	<!-- example of one answer item -->

	<a name="a1"></a>
	<p class="topline2"><b class="answer">What types of information do Neuros's web sites collect, and how are the sites collecting it?</b></p>
	<p>The majority of information and services provided on our web sites are offered without
	our collecting any personally identifiable information from you.  You can surf Neuros's web
	sites anonymously.</p>

	<p class="topline4"><b>Information You Provide</b></p>
	<p>
	There are a few activities on our web sites where the collection of personally identifiable
	information is necessary.  Those activities include things like downloading software,
	making a purchase, entering a contest or sweepstakes, participating in our forums or
	contacting us.  When personally identifiable information is collected, you will know
	because you will have to fill out a form.  For most activities, we collect only your name,
	e-mail address, birth date, gender, and zip code.  When you make a purchase, we also
	collect your street and billing addresses, your phone number, and credit card information,
	if applicable.  Personal information, including questions about your music interests, may
	also be collected for use by Neuros to improve the content of our web site, to customize the
	content and/or layout of our web site, to notify consumers about updates to our web site
	and/or to contact consumers for marketing purposes.
	</p>
	<p class="topline4"><b>Information Collected from You with Technology</b></p><b>
	</b>
	<p>
	Neuros web sites collect some information about you using technology, so it may not be
	readily apparent to you that it is being collected.  For instance, when you come to our
	web site your IP address is collected so that we know where to send information you are
	requesting.  An IP address is often associated with the place from which you enter the
	Internet like your ISP (Internet service provider), your company, or your university.  This
	information is not personally identifiable.  Neuros web sites use information collected through
	technology to make our sites more interesting and useful to you.  This includes helping
	advertisers on our site design advertisements you might like.  We normally don't combine
	this type of information with personally identifiable information.  However, we will
	combine this information with personally identifiable information to identify a visitor in
	order to enforce compliance with our Terms of Service or to protect our services, web
	sites, visitors, or others. </p>
	<p class="topline4"><b>What Are Cookies, and How Does Neuros Use Them?</b></p>
	<p>
	Cookies are pieces of information that a web site sends to your computer while you are
	viewing the web site.  These pieces of information allow the web site to remember
	important information that will make your use of that site more useful.  Neuros and other
	Internet companies use cookies for a variety of purposes.  For instance, our shopping
	areas on our web site use cookies to remember and process the items in your shopping
	cart.
	</p><p>
	You can choose to have your computer warn you each time a cookie is being sent, or you
	can choose to turn off all cookies.  You do this through your browser (like Netscape
	Navigator or Internet Explorer) settings.  Each browser is a little different, so look at your
	browser Help menu to learn the correct way to modify your cookies.  If you turn cookies
	off, you won't have access to many Neuros features that make your web experience more
	efficient, and some of our services will not function properly. </p>

	<a name="a2"></a>
	<p class="topline2"><b class="answer">How does Neuros use the personally identifiable information that has been collected?</b></p>
	<p>Neuros uses personally identifiable information in a limited number of ways.  We use the
	information to complete transactions.  For instance, if you purchase products or software
	from our web site, we use your information to process your order, or if you contact us for
	help we will use the information to contact you.  We use information collected to notify
	you if you've won a game or contest.  Information we collect is used to send you e-mail
	updates and newsletters about our sites and products.  We also use the information you
	provide to send you Neuros e-mail promotions and special offers from our third-party
	affiliates, partners and sponsors.</p>
	<img src="/images/spacer.gif" width="1" height="12" alt="" border="0"><br>
	<a href="#top"><img src="/images/back_top.gif" width="69" height="6" alt="" border="0"></a><br>
	<img src="/images/spacer.gif" width="1" height="20" alt="" border="0"><br>

	<a name="a3"></a>
	<p class="topline2"><b class="answer">Does Neuros share information with third party companies or other organizations?</b></p>
	<p>One of the most valuable assets of our business is you.  We aren't in the business of
	selling information about our visitors.  However, if we believe there is a value for our
	visitors, we will share your information or send you messages on behalf of another
	company as described below.  We will also share information for security reasons.
	</p>
	<p class="topline4"><b>Companies That Are "Standing in the Shoes" of Neuros</b></p>
	<p>
	Sometimes we hire companies to help us deliver products or services, like a shipping
	company that delivers a package.  In those instances, we need to share your information
	with them.  These companies are basically "standing in the shoes" of Neuros, and they are
	allowed to use the information only to deliver the product or service.
	</p>
	<p class="topline4"><b>Companies Offering Promotions, Products, or Services</b></p>
	<p>
	On occasion, we may offer promotions -- like sweepstakes -- in conjunction with a
	sponsor.  We will share your information with the sponsors if they need it to send you a
	product, such as a magazine subscription.  We may share your information with those
	sponsors so that they can send you other special promotions they offer, but only if you
	give us your permission to do so, and we will share it only with that specific sponsor.  In
	addition, Neuros occasionally sends e-mail promotions out to our visitors on behalf of third-
	party sponsors.  In this instance, we don't share your name with the third party -- we do
	the mailing for them.  Again, we only send these promotions to you if you've given your
	permission.
	</p>
	<p class="topline4"><b>Content Partners</b></p>
	<p>
	On some of our sites, we may provide content that is created by a third-party partner web
	site.  For instance, we may provide shopping opportunities with third parties.  In some
	instances the third-party sites will collect information in order to facilitate the transaction
	or to make the use of their content more productive and efficient.  In these circumstances
	the information collected is shared between Neuros and our third-party sponsors.
	</p>
	<p class="topline4"><b>Third-Party Advertisers and Network Advertisers</b></p>
	<p>
	To help increase privacy protections for our visitors, Neuros allows advertising on our sites
	from only those companies that have their own privacy policy.  Once you've clicked on
	an advertisement and have left Neuros's web sites, our Privacy Policy no longer applies.  You
	must read the privacy policy of the advertiser to see how your personal information will
	be handled on their site.
	</p>
	<p>
	In addition, many business advertisements are managed and placed on our site by third-
	party companies.  These companies are called "network advertisers."  Network
	advertisers collect non-personally identifiable information when you click on or scan one
	of their banner advertisements.  The information is collected using technology, so you
	may not realize it's being collected.  The network advertisers collect this information so
	that they can show you ads that are more relevant and interesting to you.  If you would
	like to read more about network advertisers or do not want network advertisers to collect
	this non-personally identifiable information about you, <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/optout_nonppii.asp" target="_NEW">click here</a>.
	</p>
	<p class="topline4"><b>Organizations That Help Protect the Security and Safety of Our Guests and Our
	Sites</b></p>
	<p>
	We will give out personal information as required by law, for example, to comply with a
	court order or subpoena, to enforce our Terms of Service or to protect the safety and
	security of our visitors and our web sites.

	<p class="topline2"><b class="answer">What choices do I have about Neuros collecting, using, and sharing my information?</b></p>
	<p>It is possible for you to use much of our web site without giving us any personally
	identifiable information.  When you do register with us or give us personally identifiable
	information, you will have an opportunity at the time we collect your information to limit
	e-mail communications from Neuros and from our third-party partners.  You can request at
	any time that Neuros not send future e-mail to you either by unsubscribing from the
	communication or by contacting us at unsubscribe@digitalinnovations.com.  Also, as
	mentioned above, there are ways to limit the information collected through technology --
	though some of our features won't work if you decide to do this.</p>

	<p class="topline2"><b class="answer">What type of security does Neuros provide?</b></p>
	<p>The importance of security for all personally identifiable information associated with our
	visitors is of utmost concern to us.  Neuros takes technical, contractual, administrative, and
	physical security steps to protect all visitors' information.  When you provide credit card
	information, we use secure socket layer (SSL) encryption to protect it.  There are some
	things that you can do to help protect the security of your information as well.  For
	instance, never give out your password, since this is what is used to access all of your
	account information.  Also remember to sign out of your account and close your browser
	window when you finish surfing the Internet, so that other people using the same
	computer won't have access to your information.</p>

	<p class="topline2"><b class="answer">How can I access my account information?</b></p>
	<p>You can access the personally identifiable information you gave us during registration at
	customer profile.  Simply <a href="/store/login/login.asp">login</a> with your member name and password, and then click My Profile in the top right hand menu.  There are instructions on the start page to help
	you recover your password if you've forgotten it.
	</p><p>
	You can also <a href="/is/contact_us.asp">contact us</a> via e-mail.  Please include information in the e-mail that will help us identify your account
	so we can assist you with your inquiry or request.</p>
