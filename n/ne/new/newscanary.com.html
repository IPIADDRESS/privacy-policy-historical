				<p>Thank you for visiting News Canary and for taking interest in our Privacy Policy. We have built this site with the objective of making it a valuable resource for you, and understand the importance of your privacy. We‚Äôre very aware of the need to respect, and protect the privacy of all our readers.

<p>Please read this Policy carefully. If you have any questions about this Policy or our data collection, use or disclosure practices, please contact us in any of the ways listed at the end of this Policy.</p>
<p><strong>What information do we collect?</strong></p>
<p>Since News Canary purpose is to provide you with detailed health care information, we may request correspondingly detailed personal health information. Certain information that we request is necessary for us to provide one or more News Canary services to you. Other information is optional. However, if you elect not to provide this optional information, this choice may limit the value of the News Canary experience for you. For example, if we do not have your children‚Äôs ages, we will not be able to provide information about their developmental stages or suggestions for age appropriate games and activities. As you can see, the more information we have about you, the more valuable the News Canary experience can be for you.</p>
<p>News Canary may collect or track the e-mail addresses of visitors that communicate with the Site via e-mail and information knowingly provided by the visitor in online registration forms, information requests, the ‚ÄúContact Us‚Äù section of the Site, and other online resources.

Information collected at registration includes, but is not limited to, name, address, email address, gender and birth date. You may choose to provide additional information, including (but not limited to) such health and lifestyle information about you and your family as marital status and household information (spouse, children, pets, etc.); ethnicity; education; income; occupation; purchasing habits; reading habits; insurance; height; weight; physical and mental health conditions and diseases; symptoms; treatments; medications; medical devices; vitamins; health habits; and participation in research surveys and clinical trials. Generally, in addition to the other uses and features described in this Privacy Policy, we use this information to improve your News Canary experience by tailoring the content displayed in your version of the Site to the information that we describe in this paragraph.</p>
<p>In addition, we might receive information about you from outside sources and add it to your News Canary membership information. We do this to improve personalization of our services (for example, providing better newsletter content, advertising or special offers that we think will interest you). We also may compare our customer list to lists received from other companies, in an effort to avoid sending identical messages to our members.</p>
