      <p>New Relic, Inc (<strong>“New Relic”</strong>) is committed to protecting
        your privacy. We have prepared this Privacy Policy to describe to you our practices
        regarding the Application Data and Personal Data (each as defined below) that we
        collect from users of our website (located at www.newrelic.com), the New Relic
        RPM products (the <strong>“Products”</strong>), or related services. This Privacy Policy
        is incorporated into, and considered a part of, the New Relic Terms of Use, currently
        located at <a href="terms.html">www.newrelic.com/terms</a>.</p>

      <h3 class="about-title-description">User Consent</h3>

      <p>By submitting or making available Application Data or Personal Data through our
        website, Products, or related services, you agree to the terms of this Privacy
        Policy and you expressly consent to the processing of your Application Data and
        Personal Data in accordance with this Privacy Policy. Your Personal Data may be
        processed in the country in which it was collected and in other countries, including
        the United States, where laws regarding processing of Personal Data may be less
        stringent than the laws in your country.</p>

        to identify or contact you, including, for example, your name, address, telephone
        number, e-mail address, as well as any other non-public information about you that
        is associated with or linked to any of the foregoing data. <strong>“Anonymous Data”</strong> means
        data about you that is not associated with or linked to your Personal Data (but
        does not include Application Data, which is covered later in this Privacy Policy);
        Anonymous Data does not permit the identification of individual persons. We collect
        Personal Data and Anonymous Data, as described below..</p>

      <h3 class="about-title-description">Personal Data You Provide to Us</h3>
      <p>We collect Personal Data from you, such as first and last name, e-mail and mailing
        addresses, telephone number, professional title, company name, and password, when
        you purchase Products, register to receive information, or register for support
        forums. In addition, we (or our third-party credit card or payment processor on
        our behalf) will collect Personal Data including your credit card number or account
        information when you purchase Products or services on our website. We also retain
        information on your behalf, such as the Personal Data described above and any correspondence
        or forum postings. If you provide us feedback or contact us via e-mail (e.g., in
        response to an employment opportunity posted on our website), we will collect your
        name and e-mail address, as well as any other content included in the e-mail, in
        order to send you a reply, and any information that you submit to us, such as a
        resume. When you participate in one of our surveys, we may collect additional profile
        information. When you post messages on the message boards of our website, the information
        contained in your posting will be stored on our servers and other users will be
        able to see it. We also collect other types of Personal Data that you provide to
        us voluntarily, such as operating system and version, information about your application
        and operating environment, and other requested information if you contact us via
        e-mail regarding support for the Products). We may also collect Personal Data at
        other points in our website that state that Personal Data is being collected.</p>

      <h3 class="about-title-description">Personal Data Collected via Technology</h3>
      <p>To make our website, Products, and related services more useful to you, our servers
        (which may be hosted by a third-party service provider) collect Personal Data from
        you, such as browser type, operating system, Internet Protocol (IP) address (a
        number that is automatically assigned to your computer when you use the Internet,
        which may vary from session to session), domain name, and/or a date/time stamp
        for your visit. We may also use Cookies (as defined below) and navigational data
        like Uniform Resource Locators (URL) to gather information regarding the date and
        time of your visit and the solutions and information for which you searched and
        which you viewed. Like most Internet services, we automatically gather this Personal
        Data and store it in log files each time you visit our website or access your account
        on our network.</p>

      <p><strong>“Cookies”</strong> are small pieces of information that a website
        sends to your computer’s hard drive while you are viewing a web site. We may use
        both session Cookies (which expire once you close your web browser) and persistent
        Cookies (which stay on your computer until you delete them) to provide you with
        a more personal and interactive experience on our website. Persistent Cookies can
        be removed by following Internet browser help file directions. If you choose to
        disable Cookies, some areas of our website may not work properly.</p>

      <h3 class="about-title-description">Personal Data Collected by Third Parties</h3>
      <p>We may receive Personal Data about you from other sources like telephone or fax,
        from companies that provide our Products or services by way of a co-branded or
        private-labeled website, companies that offer their products and/or services on
        our website, or companies that provide services (such as payment processing services)
        in connection with our website (<strong>“Partner Companies”</strong>). Our Partner Companies
        may supply us with Personal Data, such as your name and e-mail and mailing address
        information, in order to help us establish the account or fulfill orders. We may
        add this information to the information we have already collected from you via
        our website in order to perform and improve the Products and services we provide.</p>

        collects Personal Data through our website, Products, or the related services provided
        solely by New Relic. This Privacy Policy applies only to the use and disclosure
        of Personal Data that we collect while you use our website, Products, or related

        websites or their content. Please be aware that the terms of this Privacy Policy
        do not apply to these outside websites or content, or to any collection of data
        after you click on a link to a third party. </p>

        Anonymous Data to analyze request and usage patterns so that we may enhance the
        content of our Products and services and improve site navigation. New Relic reserves

        privacy practices of our Partner Companies, you should read and understand their
        privacy policies.</p>

        and obligations regarding your Personal Data as described in this Privacy Policy.</p>

        disclosure is necessary to (a) comply with relevant laws or to respond to subpoenas
        or warrants served on New Relic; or (b) protect or defend the rights or property
        of New Relic or users of the Products or related services.</p>

      <p>Although we currently do not have a parent company, any subsidiaries, joint ventures,
        or other companies under a common control (collectively, “Related Entities”),

        will possess the Application Data collected by it and us and will assume the rights
