      <h3>Personal Data Collected via Technology</h3>
      <p>To make our website, Products, and related services more useful to you, our servers (which may be hosted by a third-party service provider) collect Personal Data from you, such as browser type, operating system, Internet Protocol (IP) address (a number that is automatically assigned to your computer when you use the Internet, which may vary from session to session), domain name, and/or a date/time stamp for your visit. We may also use Cookies (as defined below) and navigational data like Uniform Resource Locators (URL) to gather information regarding the date and time of your visit and the solutions and information for which you searched and which you viewed. Like most Internet services, we automatically gather this Personal Data and store it in log files each time you visit our website or access your account on our network.</p>

      <p><strong>“Cookies”</strong> are small pieces of information that a website sends to your computer’s hard drive while you are viewing a web site. We link the information we store in cookies to the personally identifiable information you submit while on our site. We may use both session Cookies (which expire once you close your web browser) and persistent Cookies (which stay on your computer until you delete them) to provide you with a more personal and interactive experience on our website. Persistent Cookies can be removed by following Internet browser help file directions. If you choose to disable Cookies, some areas of our website may not work properly.</p>

      <p>The use of cookies by our [partners, affiliates, tracking utility company, service providers] is not covered by our privacy statement. We do not have access or control over these cookies. Our [partners, affiliates, tracking utility company, service providers] use session ID cookies to improve the quality of experience when you interact with our website, Products, and related services.</p>

      <p>Our third party advertising partner employs a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs), that help us better manage content on our site by informing us what content is effective. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on Web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. We tie the information gathered by clear gifs to our customers’ personally identifiable information.</p>

      <p>We use clear gifs in our HTML-based emails to let us know which emails have been opened by recipients. This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns. </p>

      <p>We use local shared objects, also known as Flash cookies, to serve you video content. Third Parties, with whom we partner to provide these features on our site, use Flash cookies to collect and store information.</p>

      <p>Flash cookies are different from browser cookies because of the amount of, type of, and how data is stored. Cookie management tools provided by your browser will not remove Flash cookies. To learn how to manage privacy and storage settings for Flash cookies click
