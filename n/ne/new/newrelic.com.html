        <strong>“Anonymous Data”</strong> means data about you that is not associated with

        in this Privacy Policy); Anonymous Data does not permit the identification of individual persons. 
        We collect Personal Data and Anonymous Data, as described below.</p>

      <h3 class="about-title-description">Personal Data You Provide to Us</h3>
      <p>We collect Personal Data from you, such as first and last name, phone number, zip code, e-mail,

        included in the e-mail, in order to send you a reply, and any information that you submit to us, 
        such as a resume. When you participate in one of our surveys, we may collect additional profile 
        information such as your name, phone number, address, and e-mail address. When you post comments 
        on our blog, the information contained in your posting will be stored on our servers and other 
        users will be able to see it. To request removal of your personal information from our blog or 
        community forum, contact us at <a href="mailto:info@newrelic.com?subject=privacy policy inquiry">info@newrelic.com</a>. 
        In some cases, we may not be able to remove your personal information, in which case we will let you know 
        if we are unable to do so and why. We also collect other types of Personal Data that you provide to us 
        voluntarily, such as operating system and version, information about your application and operating environment,

      <p>To make our website, Products, and related services more useful to you, our servers (which may be 
        hosted by a third-party service provider) collect Personal Data from you, such as browser type, 
        operating system, Internet Protocol (IP) address (a number that is automatically assigned to your 
        computer when you use the Internet, which may vary from session to session), domain name, and/or a 
        date/time stamp for your visit. We may also use Cookies (as defined below) and navigational data 
        like Uniform Resource Locators (URL) to gather information regarding the date and time of your visit 
        and the solutions and information for which you searched and which you viewed. Like most Internet 
        services, we automatically gather this Personal Data and store it in log files each time you visit 
        our website or access your account on our network.</p>

      <p><strong>“Cookies”</strong> are small pieces of information that a website sends to your 
        computer’s hard drive while you are viewing a web site. We link the information we store in cookies 
        to the personally identifiable information you submit while on our site. We may use both session Cookies

      <p>Our third party advertising partner employs a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web 
        Beacons/Web Bugs), that help us better manage content on our site by informing us what content is effective.  
        Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to 
        track the online movements of Web users.  In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer 
        hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on Web pages and are about the size of the period at the 
        end of this sentence. We tie the information gathered by clear gifs to our customers’ personally 
        identifiable information. </p>

      <h3 class="about-title-description">Types of Application Data We Collect</h3>
      <p>New Relic collects Application Data when our Products are deployed in your applications. 
        <strong>“Application Data”</strong> means data about the performance of your application, 
        system data (such as version data, names of plug-ins, etc.) about the environment in which your 
        application is operating, data about transactions in your application 
        (<strong>“Transaction Data”</strong>), stack traces and source code snippets for certain 
        classes of errors, and other similar data related to your application. </p>

      <h3 class="about-title-description">Use of Your Application Data</h3>
      <p>Application Data we collect is primarily used to display application performance information back to 
        the account user. It is also used by New Relic personnel to answer questions that customers may have 
        about their account and to develop and improve our products. New Relic may also aggregate Application 
        Data across multiple accounts and use this data to create and publish industry benchmarks or 
        comparative application performance metrics. Individual Transaction Data collected by New Relic is 
        obfuscated by default. Users have the option of changing the configuration of New Relic’s products so 
        that individual Transaction Data is not obfuscated. You also have the option of disabling collection 
        of certain types of Application Data collected through our Products and services, which you may exercise 
        by following the instructions in the user manual for the applicable Product or service.</p>

      <h3 class="about-title-description">Disclosure of Your Application Data</h3>
      <p>We may share your Application Data with third parties to provide technical support or to provide 
        specific services, such as hosting of your applications.</p>

      <p>We may enter into agreements with Partner Companies such as hosting companies or other services 
        providers. A Partner Company may want access to Application Data that we collect from its customers. 
        As a result, we may provide your Application Data to a Partner Company on a confidential basis in order 
        assist the Partner Company in providing customer support. Because we do not control the privacy practices 
        of our Partner Companies, you should read and understand their privacy policies.</p>

      <p>New Relic may disclose Application Data if it believes in good faith that such disclosure is necessary 
        to (a) comply with relevant laws or to respond to subpoenas or warrants served on New Relic; or (b) protect 
        or defend the rights or property of New Relic or users of the Products or related services.</p>
      
      <p>If another company acquires our company or our assets, that company will possess the Application Data 
        collected by it and us and will assume the rights and obligations regarding your Application Data as 
        described in this Privacy Policy.</p>
      
      <p>Except as otherwise stated in this policy, we do not  disclose the Application Data collected from our 
        services to third parties without consent from you. You expressly consent to the sharing of your Application 
        Data as described in this policy.</p>

      <h3 class="about-title-description">Security of Your Application and Personal Data</h3>
      <p>New Relic is committed to protecting the security of your Application Data and Personal Data. We use 
        a variety of industry-standard security technologies and procedures to help protect your Application 
        Data and Personal Data from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. When you enter sensitive information 
        (such as a credit card number) on our order forms, we encrypt the transmission of that information using 
        secure socket layer technology (SSL). We also require you to enter a password to access your account 
        information. Please do not disclose your account password to unauthorized people. Despite these measures, 
        you should know that New Relic cannot fully eliminate security risks associated with Application Data and 
        Personal Data and mistakes and security breaches may happen. If you have any questions about security on 
        our Web site, you can contact us at the information below.</p>
