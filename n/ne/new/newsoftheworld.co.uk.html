            <p class="black10"> We may from time to time operate a "Tell a friend" 
              service. This is a referral service, designed to make it easy for 
              customers to recommend our websites or offers to a friend, and is 
              a two-step process. </p>
            <p class="black10"> First, a customer sends us the friend's name 
              and email address, and secondly, we contact the friend, telling 
              them who we are, and inviting them to take advantage of a particular 
              offer, or to visit our website. </p>
            <p class="black10"> When we contact your friend, we always advise 
              them of the name and email address of the friend who made the original 
              referral. We will not use your friend's details for any other purpose.
