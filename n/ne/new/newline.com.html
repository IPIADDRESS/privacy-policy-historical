      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Thank 
        you for visiting a New Line Cinema site. Your privacy is important to 
        us. To better protect your privacy, we provide this notice explaining 
        our online information practices and the choices you can make about the 
        way your information is collected and used at this Time Warner site. 
        <a href="JavaScript:openWin1()">Click here</a> for a list of New Line 
        Cinema businesses whose sites are governed by this Privacy Notice. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b><i>The Information 
        We Collect</i><br>
        </b>At some Time Warner sites, you can order products, enter contests, 
        vote in polls or otherwise express an opinion, subscribe to one of our 
        services such as our online newsletters, or participate in one of our 
        online forums or communities. The types of personally identifiable information 
        that may be collected at these pages include: name, address, e-mail address, 
        telephone number, fax number, credit card information, and information 
        about your interests in and use of various products, programs, and services. 
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">At some other Time Warner sites, you can submit information about other people. For 
        example, you might submit a person's name and e-mail address to send an 
        electronic greeting card and, if you order a gift online and want it sent 
        directly to the recipient, you might submit the recipient's name and address. 
        The types of personally identifiable information that may be collected 
        about other people at these pages include: recipient's name, address, 
        e-mail address, and telephone number.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">At certain parts of 
        some of our sites, only persons who provide us with the requested personally 
        identifiable information will be able to order products, programs, and 
        services or otherwise participate in the site's activities and offerings.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We also may collect 
        certain non-personally identifiable information when you visit many of 
        our web pages such as the type of browser you are using (e.g., Netscape, 
        Internet Explorer), the type of operating system you are using, (e.g., 
        Windows 95 or Mac OS) and the domain name of your Internet service provider 
        (e.g., America Online, Earthlink).</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b><i>How We Use the 
        Information</i><br>
        </b>We may use the information you provide about yourself to fulfill your 
        requests for our products, programs, and services, to respond to your 
        inquiries about our offerings, and to offer you other products, programs 
        or services that we believe may be of interest to you. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We sometimes use this 
        information to communicate with you, such as to notify you when you have 
        won one of our contests or when we make changes to our subscriber agreements, 
        to fulfill a request by you for an online newsletter, or to contact you 
        about your account with us.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We use the information 
        that you provide about others to enable us to send them your gifts or 
        cards. From time to time, we also may use this information to offer our 
        products, programs, or services to them. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The information we 
        collect in connection with our online forums and communities is used to 
        provide an interactive experience. We use this information to facilitate 
        participation in these online forums and communities and, from time to 
        time, to offer you products, programs, or services. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">If you choose to submit 
        content for publication (e.g., a "letter to our editors"), we may publish 
        your screen name and other information you have provided to us. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We sometimes use the 
        non-personally identifiable information that we collect to improve the 
        design and content of our site and to enable us to personalize your Internet 
        experience. We also may use this information in the aggregate to analyze 
        site usage, as well as to offer you products, programs, or services. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We may disclose personally 
        identifiable information in response to legal process, for example, in 
        response to a court order or a subpoena. We also may disclose such information 
        in response to a law enforcement agency's request.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Agents and contractors 
        of Time Warner who have access to personally identifiable information 
        are required to protect this information in a manner that is consistent 
        with this Privacy Notice by, for example, not using the information for 
        any purpose other than to carry out the services they are performing for 
        Time Warner.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Although we take appropriate 
        measures to safeguard against unauthorized disclosures of information, 
        we cannot assure you that personally identifiable information that we 
        collect will never be disclosed in a manner that is inconsistent with 
        this Privacy Notice. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Certain Time Warner 
        sites may disclose personally identifiable information to companies whose 
        practices are not covered by this privacy notice (e.g., other marketers, 
        magazine publishers, retailers, non-profit organizations, and participating 
        databases) that want to market products or services to you. If a site 
        shares personally identifiable information, it will provide you with an 
        opportunity to opt out or block such uses. For instructions on how to 
        opt out from such disclosures, please <a href="JavaScript:openWin2()">click 
        here</a>. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Time Warner may 
        on occasion combine information we receive online with outside records 
        to enhance our ability to market to you those products or services that 
        may be of interest to you. If you prefer not to receive marketing information 
        from this site, <a href="JavaScript:openWin3()">click here</a> for instructions on how to make your request. 
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Finally, Time Warner sites will not use or transfer personally identifiable information 
        provided to us in ways unrelated to the ones described above without also 
        providing you with an opportunity to opt out of these unrelated uses.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b><i>Collection of 
        Information by Third-Party Sites and Sponsors</i><br>
        </b>Some of our sites contain links to other sites whose information practices 
        may be different than ours. Visitors should consult the other sites' privacy 
        notices as we have no control over information that is submitted to, or 
        collected by, these third parties.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Time Warner sites 
        sometimes may offer content (e.g., contests, sweepstakes, or promotions) 
        that is sponsored by or cobranded with identified third parties. By virtue 
        of these relationships, the third parties may obtain personally identifiable 
        information that visitors voluntarily submit to participate in the site 
        activity. Time Warner has no control over the third-party's use of 
        this information. The Time Warner site will notify you at the time 
        of requesting personally identifiable information if these third-parties 
        will obtain such information.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Some Time Warner 
        sites may use a reputable third party to present or serve the advertisements 
        that you may see at its Web pages. Our privacy policy does not cover any 
        use of information that a third-party ad server may have collected from 
        you. For more information on this site's use of such third-party ad servers,
