				<p style="text-align:center"><strong><u>Provisions Applicable to Registrants</u></strong></p>

				<p>Please note the relevant portions of this Privacy Policy applicable to Registrants and those
				portions applicable to all Users, including Registrants. Visitors must register with the Site
				(“<u>Registrants</u>”) in order to make use of certain features offered through the Site. When a
				Registrant submits personally identifiable information (“<u>PII</u>”) to us, that Registrant gives
				us consent to the collection, use and disclosure of the PII.</p>

				<p><strong><u>Site Registration</u></strong>. By checking the box “Accept” on clearly identified
				portions of the Site, each Registrant agrees with and accepts to be bound by the terms set forth in
				this Privacy Policy. Failure to check the “Accept” box will prevent an individual from becoming a
				Registrant. Registrants may publish, display, or otherwise transmit directly or indirectly stories,
				messages, comments, information, images, graphics, photographs and other content (individually or
				collectively, “<u>Registrant Content</u>”) to the Site, subject to this Privacy Policy and our Terms
				&amp; Conditions. NHS does not control Registrant Content and some parts of the Site may serve as
				public discussion forums open to many Registrants or Users. A Registrant should therefore tailor
				content submitted accordingly.</p>

				<p>Our Site offers publicly accessible articles. A Registrant should be aware that any information
				provided while leaving comments within this area of our Site may be read, collected, and used by
				others who access them. To request removal of your PII from our articles, contact us at 
				<img src="/images/support-email.png" style="vertical-align:middle" alt="support email address">. In
				some cases, we may not be able to remove PII, in which case we will let a Registrant know if we are
				unable to do so and why.</p>

				<p>Our Site also displays personal testimonials of satisfied customers on our site in addition to
				other endorsements. With your consent we may post your testimonial along with your name. If you wish
				to update or delete your testimonial, you can contact us at
				<img src="/images/support-email.png" style="vertical-align:middle" alt="support email address">.</p>

				<p><strong><u>Notice.</u></strong> NHS will inform Registrants about the purposes for which it
				collects and uses PII, the types of non-agent third parties to which NHS discloses that information, 
				and the choices and means, if any, NHS offers Registrants for limiting the use and disclosure of 
				their PII. NHS intends to use PII for the following reasons: (a) to present Site and contents to a 
				Registrant, (b) to provide information, products and services requested by a Registrant, (c) to 
				fulfill any other purposes for which you provide it, (d) to provide a Registrant with notices, (e) 
				to carry out our obligations and enforce our rights, including billing and collection, (f) to notify 
				a Registrant of changes to our Site or products and services we offer through it, (g) to display 
				content and advertisements customized to the preferences or viewing behavior of Registrants, (h) to 
				test different formats for the Site to gauge Visitor preferences, (i) to allow a Registrant to 
				participate in interactive features of the Site, (j) in any other way we may describe when you 
				provide the PII and (k) for any other purpose with a Registrant’s consent.</p>

				<p><strong><u>Choice.</u></strong> NHS will offer Registrants the opportunity to choose (opt-out) 
				whether their PII is (a) to be disclosed to a third party who is not an agent of NHS, or (b) to be 
				used for a purpose other than the purpose for which it was originally collected or subsequently 
				authorized by the Registrant. For sensitive PII such as credit card information, NHS will give 
				Registrants the opportunity to affirmatively and explicitly (opt-in) consent such disclosure or use.</p>

				<p><strong><u>Account Information.</u></strong> NHS honors requests from customers for changes in 
				account information, such as name and password and will use best efforts to correct any such 
				information that is inaccurate.</p>

				<p><strong><u>PII.</u></strong> Various types of PII may be collected from each Registrant in order 
				for NHS to provide services. Such information may include name, mailing address, telephone numbers, 
				email addresses, credit card information and other information that may be needed in order to 
				provide the services requested by the Registrant. We obtain address information about you from third 
				party sources, such as Experion, so that we can provide more relevant products and advertisements. 
				NHS may also request statistical information about interests and lifestyle habits.</p>

				<p><strong><u>Data Integrity- Registrants.</u></strong> NHS will use PII only in ways that are 
				compatible with the purposes for which it was collected or subsequently authorized by the individual.
				NHS will take reasonable steps to ensure that such information is relevant to its intended use,
				accurate, complete and current.</p>

				<p><strong><u>Access.</u></strong> Upon request, NHS will provide Registrants with the PII that it 
				holds about them and will take reasonable steps to provide individuals with a means to correct, 
				amend or delete information that is found to be inaccurate or incomplete. Users can request these 
				changes by contacting us at support@naturalhealthsherpa.com. NHS will use reasonable efforts to 
				respond to requests within 10 business days, but in no less than 30 days will provide a response to 
				a Registrant that either (a) confirms that PII has been updated or deleted, (b) contains a timeline 
				by which the request by be fulfilled or (c) offers a reason why the request cannot be fulfilled. NHS 
				may also contact Registrants regarding improvements to the Site, or when you sign up to our 
				newsletter subscription, to provide information regarding a Registrant’s account or with information 
				about new services that are available or other information we deem helpful or interesting to you. A 
				Registrant may opt-out and unsubscribe to these communications by (i) e-mailing “unsubscribe” to 
				<img src="/images/support-email.png" style="vertical-align:middle" alt="support email address"> or 
				(ii) making your request by contacting us at 800-316-8556 In the event of communications from third 
				parties, please follow that third party’s unsubscribe features.</p>

				<p>We may also provide you the opportunity to participate in contests or surveys on our Site. If you 
				participate, we will request certain PII from you. Participation in these surveys or contests is 
				completely voluntary and you therefore have a choice whether or not to disclose this information. 
				The requested information typically includes contact information (such as name and shipping address), 
				and demographic information (such as zip code).</p>

				<p>We will retain your information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you
				services. We will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, 
				resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.</p>

				<p><strong><u>Transfers to Third Parties- Registrants.</u></strong> NHS will not knowingly disclose, 
				sell, share or rent PII without a Registrant’s consent other than in certain exceptional 
				circumstances, such as (a) to protect against hackers, (b) to protect our legal rights or protect us 
				from liability, (c) to enforce an agreement with a Registrant, including the enforcement of the 
				Terms &amp; Conditions (d) address actual or threatened illegal or harmful conduct, (e) as required 
				by legal or professional standards or requirements (including compliance with judicial or regulatory 
				proceedings or orders), or (f) if we believe such disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the 
				rights, property or safety of NHS, Users, Registrants or others. We may also disclose PII to third 
				parties for credit card fraud protection and risk reduction as well as in the event NHS or its 
				assets are sold, in which case NHS will notify Registrants by e-mail or prominent notice on the Site 
				following the transaction. NHS will not authorize the release of credit card or account data with 
				anyone not directly involved with processing the transactions.</p>

				<p>We may provide your PII to companies that provide services to help us with our business activities 
				such as offering customer service. These companies are authorized to use your PII only as necessary 
				to provide these services to us.</p>

				<p><strong><u>Use By Minors.</u></strong> A Registrant must be 18 years of age or older. NHS will not 
				knowingly solicit or collect PII from anyone under 13 years of age. No one under age 13 may provide 
				any PII to or on the Site. If you are under age 13, do not use or provide information on this Site. 
				If we learn that we have collected or received PII from a person under 13 without verification of 
				parental consent, we will delete that information.</p>

				<p style="text-align:center"><strong><u>Provisions Applicable to All Users</u></strong></p>

				<p>Users can browse our Site without revealing any PII. The following provisions apply to all Users, 
				which shall include Registrants:</p>

				<p><strong><u>Security.</u></strong> NHS takes data security seriously and has put in place 
				appropriate physical, electronic and procedural safeguards to protect information in our possession 
				from loss, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction. Please note that 
				when sensitive PII (for example, credit card information) is transferred over the Internet, we
				protect it using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption technology. Any transmission of information 
				is at your own risk.</p>

				<p><strong><u>Data Integrity- General.</u></strong> Non-PII and aggregate information may be used to
				improve the Site. Information provided by Users is primarily used by NHS to provide and improve the 
				service requested by the User, including the use by NHS of IP addresses and other technical 
				information to diagnose problems with our servers, to administer the Site or to gather general 
				demographic information. IP addresses or other information may also be used to provide offer 
				information, company information or promotional materials from business partners, independent 
				contractors or other third parties together with whom NHS provides its services.</p>

				<p><strong><u>Use of Cookies, User’s Computer Configuration, Action Tags and Social Media Features.</u></strong>
				We use cookies, IP addresses, action tags and social media widgets to personalize and enhance the
				online experience of our Users, to test Visitor preferences to gauge format preferences, to provide 
				customized content and advertisements, to perform behavioral analyses, and to provide improved 
				content and services. Cookies are small text files that identify a User’s computer. We use both 
				session ID cookies and persistent cookies. A session ID cookie expires when you close your browser. 
				We use session cookies to make it easier for you to navigate our Site. A persistent cookie remains 
				on your hard drive for an extended period of time. We set a persistent cookie to store your 
				passwords, so you don’t have to enter it more than once. Each User can reset their browser to 
				provide notification of cookies or to disable the cookie feature. We may collect automatically 
				submitted information regarding the User’s computer configuration, including the previous and
				subsequent URL, browser type, operating system, IP address or ISP domain name. We do not link this 
				automatically-collected data to PII. We may also collect information submitted by a User in online 
				or offline communications or interactions facilitated by or through the Site.</p>

				<p>An action tag is a small, graphic image on a webpage that is designed to allow the website owner 
				or a third party to monitor who is visiting a website by collecting the IP address of the computer 
				to which the tag is sent, the URL of the webpage that the tag comes from and the time that such 
				webpage was viewed. Tags may be associated with cookie information. We may also use such anonymous 
				and aggregate information for promotional purposes.</p>

				<p>Our Site includes social media features, such as the Facebook Like button. These features may 
				collect IP addresses, which page have been visited on our Site, and may set a cookie to enable the 
				feature to function properly. Social media features are either hosted by a third party or hosted 
				directly on our Site. Your interactions with these features are governed by the privacy policy of 
				the company providing it.</p>

				<p><strong><u>Transfers to Third Parties- General.</u></strong> All information submitted by Users 
				to the Site becomes the property of NHS. When NHS uses other agents, contractors or companies to 
				perform services on its behalf or otherwise transmits information to third parties, NHS will ensure 
				that the third party agrees to protect information consistent with this Privacy Policy.</p>

				<p><strong><u>Third Party Sites.</u></strong> The Site may provide links to third party websites 
				that do not follow our Privacy Policy and over which we have no control. Users should check the 
				privacy policies of any website prior to use.</p>

				<p>Some of our third-party advertisers and ad servers that place and present advertising on the Site 
				may collect information from you via cookies, web beacons or similar technologies. These third-party 
				advertisers and ad servers may use the information they collect to help present their advertisements, 
				to help measure and research the advertisements’ effectiveness, or for other purposes. The use and 
				collection of your information by these third-party advertisers and ad servers is governed by the 
				relevant third-party’s privacy policy and is not covered by our Privacy Policy and may be different 
				from our Privacy Policy. If you have any concerns about a third party’s use of cookies or web 
				beacons or use of your information, you should visit that party’s website and review its privacy policy.</p>

				<p>We may also make some content, products and services available through our Site through 
				cooperative relationships with third-party providers (“Providers”), where the brands of our 
				Providers appear on the Site(s) in connection with such content, products and/or services. We may 
				share with our Providers any information you provide, or that is collected, in the course of 
				visiting any pages that are made available in cooperation with our Providers. In some cases, the 
				Providers may collect information from you directly, in which cases the privacy policy of our 
				Providers may apply to the Providers’ use of your information. The privacy policy of our Providers 
				may differ from ours. If you have any questions regarding the privacy policy of the Providers, you 
				should contact the Providers directly for more information. We shall have no responsibility or 
				liability for the data collection and use practices of those sites.</p>

				<p>We partner with a third party ad network to either display advertising on our Site or to manage 
				our advertising on other sites. Our ad network partner uses cookies and Web beacons to collect 
				non-PII about your activities on this and other Web sites to provide you targeted advertising based 
				upon your interests. If you wish to not have this information used for the purpose of serving you 
				targeted ads, you may opt-out by clicking
