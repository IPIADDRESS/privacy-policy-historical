						<p><strong>PRIVACY POLICY / TERMS OF USE</strong></p>
<p>PLEASE NOTE THAT OUR PRIVACY POLICY/TERMS OF USE ARE CHANGED PERIODICALLY AND HAVE CHANGED EFFECTIVE AS OF OCTOBER 12, 2011</p>
<p>Journal Register Company is committed to protecting your personal privacy. We provide this notice to explain the type of information we collect on web sites including SMS/Text Alerts and Mobile Web owned by the Journal Register Company (www.journalregister.com) and how we use this information. Our Privacy Policy/Terms of Use are available for you to review on the home page of every Journal Register Company web site (“Policy”).</p>
<p>As used in this Policy, the term “Journal Register Company” includes all of its subsidiaries and affiliates and successors as well as their officers, directors, shareholders, members, agents, servants, and employees, including the entity operating this web site including SMS/Text Alerts and Mobile Web (the “Web Site”).</p>
<p>This Policy also governs your use of the Web Site and any content made available from or through any web site owned and operated by Journal Register Company and any comments or content you may post on any Journal Register Company web site (the “Web Site”).</p>
<p>By visiting our Web Site or using the services offered on or through our Web Site, you agree to the terms of this Policy, as they may be amended from time to time. As we update and expand our Web Site and services, our Policy may change so check back to this page from time to time.</p>
<p>Our Policy does not apply to information that you may provide to us, or that we may obtain, other than through our Web Site, such as by phone, by mail or through other offline and print media. This Policy does not apply to information collected about you by anyone except us and only applies to the Web Site to which this policy is linked.</p>
<p>Our Web Site(s) are intended for users who are located in the United States of America. Our Policy shall be interpreted under the laws of the United States.</p>
<p>A. Purpose</p>
<p>In order to make your visits to our Web Site and use of the services available on or through our Web Site as worthwhile as possible, we may ask you for personal information and we may collect certain information from your computer each time you visit us. “Personal Information” includes, for example, your name; home address; business address; e-mail address; telephone, wireless or fax number; short message service or text message address or other wireless device address; instant messaging address; credit card and other payment information; demographic information and other information that may identify you as an individual or allow online or offline contact with you as an individual. From time to time, other information, such as your age, gender, education and subscription information may also be requested. Our Policy explains, in general, what Personal Information and other information is collected on our Web Site, how the information is used, and with whom we may share such information.</p>
<p>B. What Information is collected on Our Web Sites?</p>
<p>1. User Provided Information</p>
<p>We collect two types of personally identifying information from users: personal data (such as names and contact details) and aggregated data (such as information about traffic patterns on the Web Sites, for example, how many users log onto the Web Site on a daily basis). We collect personal information from users of our Web Site, for example, through such users’ activities, transactions and completion of online forms on our Web Site. Such information  may be collected, for example, when users register or subscribe for accounts or features on our Web Site, make online purchases, enter sweepstakes and contests, complete surveys, contribute to a chat room, bulletin board, list serve, blog, wiki or other open forum that we may make available on or through our Web Site, submit a comment or question to us using a “contact us” or similar feature on our Web Site, send us an e-mail, or in any other way submit  information to us via our Web Site.</p>
<p>You may be able to send information about our products and services to your friends and family members through our Web Site by clicking on an “E-mail to Friend” or similar button on our Web Site or in an e-mail that we have sent you. In some of these cases (unless you simply forward our e-mail on your own), you may provide the name and e-mail address of your friend or family member to us. Such information will be treated in accordance with our Policy and applicable law.</p>
<p>You may also be able to send an online card to a friend or family member, or send them a gift or gift certificate. If so, you may be required to provide us with your friend’s or family member’s Personal Information. Such information will be treated in accordance with our Policy and applicable law.</p>
<p>2. Web Site Usage Information</p>
<p>(i) Cookies</p>
<p>We may use “cookies” to keep, and sometimes track, information about you. Cookies are small data files that are sent to your browser or related software from a web server when you visit it and are stored on your computer’s hard drive for record keeping purposes. Cookies track where you travel on our Web Site and what you look at and purchase. They may store the information in your shopping cart, and/or your username and password. A cookie may enable us to relate your use of our Web Sites to other information about you, including your Personal Information. These purposes serve to improve and personalize your experience on our Web Sites.</p>
<p>You may occasionally get cookies from our advertisers, which is standard in the internet industry. We do not control these cookies, and these cookies are not subject to our Policy.</p>
<p>Most web browsers can be set to inform you when a cookie has been sent to you and provide you with the opportunity to refuse that cookie. Additionally, if you have a Flash player installed on your computer, your Flash player can be set to reject or delete Flash cookies. However, refusing a cookie may, in some cases, preclude you from using, or negatively impact the display or function of, the Web Site or certain areas or features of our Web Site.</p>
<p>(ii) Clear GIFs</p>
<p>We may use “clear GIFs” (a/k/a “web beacons” or “pixel tags”) or similar technologies, on our Web Site and in our communications with you to enable us to know whether you have visited a web page or received a message. A clear GIF is typically a one-pixel, transparent image (although it can be a visible image as well), located on a web page or in an e-mail or other type of message, which is retrieved from a remote site on the internet enabling the verification of an individual’s viewing or receipt of a web page or message. A clear GIF may enable us to relate your viewing or receipt of a web page or message to other information about you, including your Personal Information.</p>
<p>(iii) IP Address and Clickstream Data</p>
<p>Aggregated information, such as which pages users access or visit and information volunteered by users, such as survey information and/or Web Site registrations, is collected through various methods. For example, our server may automatically collect data about your server’s internet address when you visit us. This information, known as an Internet Protocol Address, or IP Address, is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer by your internet service provider whenever you’re on the internet. When you request pages from our Web Site, our servers may log your IP Address and sometimes your domain name. Our server may also record the referring page that linked you to us (e.g., another web site or a search engine); the pages you visit on our Web Site; the web site you visit after our Web Site; the ads you see; the ads you click on; other information about the type of web browser, computer, platform, related software and settings you are using; any search terms you have entered on our Web Site or a referral site; and other web usage activity and data logged by our web servers. We use this information for internal system administration, to help diagnose problems with our server, and to administer our Web Site. Such information may also be used to gather broad demographic information, such as country of origin and internet service provider. We may also link this information with your Personal Information when we feel that it is necessary to enforce compliance with our rules and policies or Terms of Use or to protect our Web Site, customers or others.</p>
<p>Any or all of these activities with regard to Web Site usage information may be performed on our behalf by our services providers.</p>
<p>C. How is the Personal Information Used?</p>
<p>We use both personal and aggregated information we collect for multiple purposes. The Personal Information may be used to improve the content of the Web Site, to customize the content and/or layout of the Web Site for each individual user, and to notify users about updates to the Web Site or promotional offers or opportunities that we believe will be of interest to you. We will use the Personal Information you provide to our Web Site, for example, to respond to your requests and to provide you with our product and service offerings. For example, we will process your orders, respond to your requests and inquiries and provide you with the services and features offered on or through our Web Site. We may also use your Personal Information to maintain our internal record keeping. We may also report information about your account to credit bureaus. Late payments, missed payments, or other defaults on your account may be reflected in your credit report. We may match information collected from you through different means or at different times, including both Personal Information and Web Site usage information, and use such information along with information obtained from other sources, including third parties. In addition, we may send you notices (for example, in the form of e-mails, mailings, and the like), and otherwise correspond with you, about products, services, companies and events, sponsored by us and others, that we think might interest you. You may opt-out of receiving such notices from us, at any time, by following the instructions in the Right to Opt-Out section below.</p>
<p>We may analyze user behavior as a measure of interest in, and use of, our Web Site and e-mails, both on an individual basis and in the aggregate. We may also use information provided to us on an anonymous aggregated basis for purposes of analyzing traffic and usage patterns.</p>
<p>In addition, we may use information you provide us through e-mails, Q &amp; A, and in response to polls for editorial purposes, and may use your name and any stories you provide us in articles published online and in our print publications. Please be advised that any such submissions may be used by us for any lawful purpose. If you provide us with personal anecdotes, they may be attributed to you and we may include your user name and any personal information that you provide in an open forum on this Web Site, to facilitate such attribution. We can edit, rewrite, use, and reuse the content, including your name, likeness, photograph, and biographical information you provide, in any way and any media whether now known or invented in the future, with or without attribution, including publication in our newspaper, and in trade media, and advertising and promotions.</p>
<p>D. Do we Share Personal Information and Web Site Usage Information with Others?</p>
<p>(i) Public Forums</p>
<p>When you contribute to a public area or feature of our Web Site, such as a chat room, bulletin board, list serve, blog, wiki or other open forum that we may make available on or through our Web Site, the information that you submit will be made available to the general public and will not be considered “Personal Information” for purposes of this Policy.  </p>
<p>Any comment or content you provide on the Web Site is subject to this Policy, including the Terms of Use set forth below.</p>
<p>(ii) Third Party Offers</p>
<p>We reserve the right to make our customer lists available to companies or other entities not affiliated with the Journal Register Company that have goods, services and offers that we believe might be of interest to you. We may compile these lists from customer orders placed both offline and online or that customers allow us to collect by providing us with Personal Information. We may, from time to time, provide your Personal Information to these entities so that they may send you these offers. Customers have the option of having their names and identifying information removed from those JRC lists (subject to certain exceptions and limitations in applicable laws) by:</p>
<p>1. By Email: Send an email to unsubscribe@journalregister.com. Be sure to include your name and clear instructions on what you would like us to do.</p>
<p>2. By Regular Mail or Telephone: Send us your request via the mail. Be sure to include your name and clear instructions on what you would like us to do. Send to: Journal Register Company, Online Policy, 790 Township Line Road, Suite 300, Yardley, PA 19067, Telephone Number: (215) 867-2130.</p>
<p>Customers should contact the non-JRC companies or entities that have been provided Personal Information by JRC to request that those third-party companies and entities remove the customers Personal Information.</p>
<p>(iii) Co-sponsored Contests, Sweepstakes and Offerings</p>
<p>Some of our contests, sweepstakes and other offerings may be co-sponsored by another company. In those situations, the information we obtain from you in connection with such contest, sweepstakes or offering may be shared with our co-sponsor. In those situations, our co-sponsors will have the right to use your information for their own purposes, in accordance with their own policies. If you do not wish for the information we obtain from you to be shared with our co-sponsor, then do not enter such contest, sweepstake or other offering or otherwise provide to us any Personal Information in connection with such contest, sweepstake or other offering. We are not responsible for how our co-sponsors may use your information.</p>
<p>(iv) Service Providers</p>

<p>F. Security</p>
<p>1. General</p>
<p>No transmission of data over the internet is guaranteed to be completely secure. It may be possible for third parties not under the control of the Journal Register Company to intercept or access transmissions or private communications unlawfully, including in the case of your contacting us by e-mail or a “contact us” or similar feature on our Web Site. Accordingly, though the Journal Register Company may take reasonable steps to protect the security and integrity of all Personal Information provided to this Web Site, due to the inherent nature of the internet as an open global communications vehicle, we cannot guarantee that information, during transmission through the internet or while stored on our system or otherwise in our care, will be absolutely safe from intrusion by others, such as hackers. Any such transmission is done at your own risk.</p>
<p>You may be able to create an account on our Web Site with a username and password. If so, you are responsible for maintaining the strict confidentiality of your account password, and you shall be responsible for any access to or use of the Web Site by you or any person or entity using your password, whether or not such access or use has been authorized by or on behalf of you, and whether or not such person or entity is your employee or agent. You agree to (a) immediately notify the Journal Register Company of any unauthorized use of your password or account or any other breach of security, and (b) ensure that you exit from your account at the end of each session. It is your sole responsibility to control the dissemination and use of your password, control access to and use of your account, and notify the Journal Register Company when you desire to cancel your account on this Web Site. We will not be responsible or liable for any loss or damage arising from your failure to comply with this provision.</p>
<p>We will have no liability for disclosure of your information due to errors or unauthorized acts of third parties during or after transmission.</p>
<p>In the unlikely event that we believe that the security of your Personal Information in our possession or control may have been compromised, we may seek to notify you of that development. If a notification is appropriate, we would endeavor to do so as promptly as possible under the circumstances, and, to the extent we have your e-mail address, we may notify you by e-mail or by other means as required by law. You consent to our use of e-mail as a means of such notification.</p>
<p>2. Phishing</p>
<p>With identity theft a continuing problem, it has become increasingly common for unauthorized individuals to send e-mail messages to consumers, purporting to represent a legitimate company such as a bank or on-line merchant, requesting that the consumer provide personal, often sensitive information. Sometimes, the domain name of the e-mail address from which the e-mail appears to have been sent, and the domain name of the web site requesting such information, appears to be the domain name of a legitimate, trusted company. In reality, such sensitive information may be collected by an unauthorized individual to be used for purposes of identity theft. This illegal activity has come to be known as “phishing.”</p>
<p>If you receive an e-mail or other correspondence requesting that you provide any sensitive information (including your Web Site password or credit card information) via e-mail or to a web site that does not seem to be affiliated with our Web Site, or that otherwise seems suspicious to you, please do not provide such information, and report such request to us at privacy@journalregister.com</p>
