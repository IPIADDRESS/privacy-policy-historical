<p>PLEASE NOTE THAT OUR PRIVACY POLICY CHANGES PERIODICALLY AND IS EFFECTIVE AS OF MAY 25, 2018.</p>
<p>Digital First Media (“Digital First Media,” “us,” or “we”) is committed to protecting your personal privacy. We provide this Privacy Policy (“Policy”) to explain the type of Personal Information (as defined below) we collect on web sites including SMS/Text Alerts and Mobile Web owned by the Digital First Media, such as www.digitalfirstmedia.com (each, a “Web Site”), and our mobile application (the “Application,” together with Web Site, the “Platform”) and how we use Personal Information.
