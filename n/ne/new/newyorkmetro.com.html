To operate these features, we collect certain non-personal and personal information from our visitors for specific purposes. For website activities that request personal information, you agree to provide accurate and current information about yourself. Your membership and/or participation in our website activities will be canceled without notice if at any time we discover that you provide false information, or violate any term of our Privacy Policy or our Terms of Usage Agreement.

      </p>
	
	<p>
	To participate as a member of our website, or in online activities, special events, contests, sweepstakes or Interactive Areas ("Interactive Areas" include chat rooms, bulletin boards, message boards or auditoriums, SMS text messaging, mobile alerts, and mobile e-mail updates), you may be required to provide personally identifiable information such as your name, home and e-mail addresses, telephone number, birth date and gender ("personal information"). We may also survey visitors about various topics, including local events and experiences, television viewing preferences and how we can improve our website and services. Response to our surveys is entirely voluntary. 
	</p>
	<p>
	We offer SMS text message mobile alerts and mobile e-mail updates as a text messaging/mobile e-mail service for our restaurant and bar listings. We do not collect the sender's e-mail or telephone number on this feature.
	</p>
	<p>
We collect personal information for several important purposes, including to operate our membership base, protect the security of our visitors and the site, improve our service and website, distribute our newsletters, notify the winners of our contests and sweepstakes, allow participation in specified activities or Interactive Areas and for future marketing and/or promotional use about our program service or website. 
We may also offer an "Email Thisâ feature that allows visitors to e-mail a link to another person to inform them about the NYMag.com site and our features. We do not collect the sender's or the recipient's e-mail information on this feature. 
</p>
<p>
We may also offer an âEmail Albumâ feature that allows members to share their fashion albums with others. If you e-mail your fashion albums to others, the emailed albums will automatically be made public for anyone to access.  You can also choose to make your albums private so only you can access them.  We do not collect the senderâs e-mail information on this feature.
</p>
<p>
The only personal information this website obtains about you is information voluntarily provided by you through our website. This website does not collect additional personal information about individual visitors or members from other sources. To gauge the effectiveness of our website, we may collect non-personal information about our members and visitors, such as Internet server and browser identification, the Internet service provider, clickstream information, the web page from which a person enters our site, webpages visited, duration of visit and domain type. This information does not reveal a visitor's personal identity. 
</p>
<p>
We may produce certain contests, sweepstakes and special events with the support of affiliated or non-affiliated sponsors and/or promotional partners. The personal information collected by our website in conjunction with such events may also be used for the marketing of additional services and events by NYMag.com and/or its promotional partners and sponsors beyond the contest, sweepstakes and/or special event. Depending on the event, visitors will be able to either grant their approval on how their personal information will be used before it is collected ("opt-in"), or choose to deny use of their information for additional purposes ("opt-out"). For each contest, sweepstakes, and/or special event, we will post on the website applicable rules for the event, and if necessary, post any supplemental terms and conditions or privacy provisions. To the extent there is a conflict between those privacy provisions and this policy, the privacy provisions for the specific event will govern.

	<p><a name="anchor3"></a><b>Use and Collection of Information by Operational Providers</b> 
      </p>
	
	<p>
For the convenience of our visitors, we may provide the opportunity to purchase certain goods, merchandise and services through this website (including, without limitation, on-line personals services). Companies other than NYMag.com, its parents, partners, affiliates or subsidiaries may handle some of these transactions. We call these companies that conduct our e-commerce operations, order fulfillment and/or contract services "operational providers." If you choose to use these optional services, our operational providers will request your personal information to fulfill your order or request. The voluntary submission of your personal information to these operational providers, including your order or request, will be governed by the specific provider's terms of usage and privacy policies. To facilitate an order or request, we may share your personal information with the provider. The operational provider may also share your personal information with us. We will store this information in our membership database. 
In most instances, we request that our operational providers adhere to the provisions in NYMag.com's Privacy Policy and that such providers only share visitors' personal information with NYMag.com, unless necessary to complete a visitor's request or order. We also request that these providers only use the personal information for the purpose of conducting the sale or fulfilling the requested service or order. However, you must read an operational providers privacy policy to determine the extent of use and disclosure of your personal information collected online. 

NYMag.com, its parents, affiliates and subsidiaries are not responsible for the collection, use and disclosure practices of operational providers, nor is the NYMag.com family responsible or liable for the products or services provided by operational providers.

      </p><p><b><span class="blackhdr3"><a name="anchor8"></a></span>CHILDREN'S PRIVACY 
        POLICY </b> 
      </p><p>NYMag.com respects the privacy of your child and we want to share 
        with you our policies regarding children under the age of thirteen. We 
        have developed this site to appeal to visitors over the age of thirteen. 
        Although visitors of all ages may navigate through our website, we do 
        not knowingly collect personal information from persons under the age 
        of thirteen. If upon notification by a parent or guardian, or discovery 
        by other means, that a child under thirteen has improperly registered 
        on this site by using false information, we will immediately cancel the 
        child's membership and/or participation, and delete the child's personally 
        identifiable information, member name and password from our records. 
      </p><p>If we decide to request information from children, we will require verifiable 
        parental consent before we collect any personal information from children 
        under thirteen years of age, except in the following circumstances allowed 
        by law: 
      </p><ul>
        <li>To provide notice and get consent from a parent or guardian;</li>
        <li>To respond to a one-time request from a child, after which we will 
          immediately delete the child's information;</li>
        <li>To fulfill a child's request for a subscription to a online newspaper, 
          magazine or specific information on a regular basis and we will notify 
          the parent or guardian before we contact the child again;</li>
        <li>To protect the safety of a child who is participating on this site; 
          and</li>
        <li>To protect the security or integrity of the site, take precautions 
          against liability, respond to a validly executed subpoena or warrant 
          from law enforcement, or if permitted under other provisions of law. 
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p></p><p><b>Guidelines for Parents </b> 
      </p><p>By taking responsibility for your children's online computer use, parents 
        can greatly minimize any potential risks for being online. The best way 
        to assure that your children are having positive online experiences is 
        to stay in touch with what they are doing. One way to do this is to spend 
        time with your children while they are online. Have them show you what 
        they are doing and ask them to teach you how to access the services. 
      </p><p>While children and teenagers need a certain amount of privacy, they also 
        need parental involvement and supervision in their daily lives. The same 
        general parenting skills that apply to the "real world" also apply while 
        online. 
      </p><p><b><i>Make it a family rule to:</i></b> 
      </p><ul>
        <li>Never give out identifying information-home address, school name, 
          or telephone number â in a public message such as chat or bulletin 
          boards, and be sure you're dealing with someone that both you and your 
          child know and trust before giving it out via email. Think carefully 
          before revealing any personal information such as age, marital status, 
          or financial information. Consider using a pseudonym or unlisting your 
          child's name if your service allows it.<br>
          <br>
        </li>
        <li> Get to know the services your child uses. If you don't know how to 
          log on, get your child to show you. Find out what types of information 
          it offers, and whether there are ways for parents to block out objectionable 
          material.<br>
          <br>
        </li>
        <li>Never allow a child to arrange a face-to-face meeting with another 
          computer user without parental permission. If a meeting is arranged, 
          make the first one in a public spot, and be sure to accompany your child.<br>
          <br>
        </li>
        <li>Never respond to messages or bulletin board items that are suggestive, 
          obscene, belligerent, threatening, or make you feel uncomfortable. Encourage 
          your children to tell you if they encounter such messages. If you or 
          your child receives a message that is harassing, of a sexual nature, 
          or threatening, forward a copy of the message to your service provider 
          and ask for their assistance.<br>
          <br>
        </li>
        <li>Should you become aware of the transmission, use, or viewing of child 
          pornography while online, immediately report this to the National Center 
          for Missing and Exploited Children by calling 1-800-843-5678. You should 
          also notify your online service. Remember that people online may not 
          be who they seem. Because you can't see or even hear the person it would 
          be easy for someone to misrepresent him-or herself. Thus, someone indicating 
          that "she" is a "12 year-old girl" could in reality be a 40-year-old 
          man. <br>
          <br>
        </li>
        <li>Remember that everything you read online may not be true. Any offer 
          that's "too good to be true" probably is. Be very careful about any 
          offers that involve your coming to a meeting or having someone visit 
          your house. <br>
          <br>
        </li>
        <li>Set reasonable rules and guidelines for computer use by your children. 
          Discuss these rules and post them near the computer as a reminder. Remember 
          to monitor their compliance with these rules, especially when it comes 
          to the amount of time your children spend on the computer. A child or 
          teenager's excessive use of online services or bulletin boards, especially 
          late at night, may be a clue that there is a potential problem. Remember 
          that personal computers and online services should not be used as electronic 
          babysitters. Be sure to make this a family activity. Consider keeping 
          the computer in a family room rather than the child's bedroom. Get to 
          know their "online friends" just as you get to know all of their other 
          friends. </li>
      </ul>
