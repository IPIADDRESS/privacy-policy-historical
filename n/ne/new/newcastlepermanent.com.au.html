<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We understand how important the privacy of your
  information is to you and we are committed to ensuring
  the confidentiality of your personal information.
  This Policy Statement tells you how we manage and
  protect personal information.</p>
<h3>Collection</h3>
<p> We collect most personal information directly from you.
  For example, we may collect personal information when
  you open an account, fill in an application form, deal
  with us over the telephone, send us a letter, visit our
  website or when you have contact with us in person.
  The types of personal information we collect and hold
  will depend on the particular products and services you
  request from us.</p>
<p> The personal information we collect includes your name,
  contact details (eg telephone number, email, postal and
  residential address), tax file number, date of birth and
  transactional information about the use of the product
  or service. Where relevant (for example, in the case of a
  loan application), we will also collect and hold
  information about your financial position, place of work,
  credit history and transaction history. In certain
  circumstances, we may collect sensitive information such
  as health details.</p>
<p> There may be occasions when we need to source personal
  information about you from a third party. For example,
  we may collect personal information from a credit
  reporting agency or an insurer of your mortgage (but
  only if you authorise us to do so).</p>
<p> The only personal information which we collect about
  you when you use our website is what you tell us about
  yourself, for example, by completing an online form such
  as a loan application or by sending us an email.
  When you visit our website, our server may attach a small
  data file known as a “cookie” to your hard drive. A cookie
  is a packet of information that allows the website to
  identify and interact more effectively with your computer.</p>
<p> When you use our website, we send you a unique
  identification number, which may be in the form of a
  cookie. A different identification number is sent each
  time you use our website. The society does not identify
  individual users, although we can identify a user’s
  browser type and your Internet Service Provider (ISP).</p>
<p> To evaluate the effectiveness of our website, we may
  collect statistical data. No personal data will be collected
  on these occasions.</p>
<p>
  You can configure your browser to accept all cookies,
  reject all cookies, or notify you when a cookie is sent. If
  you configure your browser so that it does not receive
  cookies some of the functionality of this and other sites
  will be lost. In particular, the use of on-line services
  creates the need for us to be able to identify the customer
  and cookies are used for this purpose. If you disable them
  the service will not recognise you. </p>
<h3>Use and Disclosure</h3>
<p> We collect and use your personal information for the
  primary purpose of:</p>
<ul>
  <li> opening an account for you;</li>
  <li> assessing an application by you for a product or service;</li>
  <li> providing you with the product or service that you have
    requested.</li>
</ul>
<p> We may use or disclose your personal information for
  purposes related to the main purpose for which we collect
  it, such as:</p>
<ul>
  <li> administering, monitoring, evaluating and managing
    the product or service you have with us;</li>
  <li> internal accounting and administration;</li>
  <li> providing you with information about other products
    and services offered by us or a related company of the
    Society;</li>
  <li> complying with the regulatory requirements;</li>
  <li> managing our relationship with you;</li>
  <li> protecting you and the Society from error or fraud.</li>
</ul>
<p> We may disclose your personal information to a related
  company of the Society, but it will still remain
  confidential. This will allow them to tell you about
  products and services offered by them that may be of
  interest to you.</p>
<p> We may also disclose your personal information when
  we contract out some of our functions to external service
  providers who conduct specific activities for us such as
  mail-outs. However, the information remains the
  property of the Society and the external service provider
  will be subject to strict confidential and non-disclosure
  obligations.</p>
<p> If you do not wish to receive direct marketing
  information from us, you can tell us and we will stop
  sending you such information.
</p>
<p>Furthermore, we may disclose your personal information
  if, for example:</p>
<ul>
  <li> you have given us your express or implied consent to
    disclose the information;</li>
  <li> the disclosure is required by law (such as, under a
    Court order or subpoena or a law that allows a
    Government agency, such as the Australian Taxation
    Office, to demand that we disclose information about
    your account);</li>
  <li> the disclosure is permitted or authorised by law (such
    as, under the Privacy Act 1988);</li>
  <li> we need to protect our interest (such as in legal
    proceedings to which we are a party);</li>
  <li> the disclosure is required in the public interest (such
    as, where a crime or fraud has been committed).</li>
</ul>
<p> We will not disclose names and addresses to third parties
  for the purpose of enabling them to direct market their
  products and services to you.</p>
<h3>Security</h3>
<p> We will take reasonable precautions and security
  measures to keep your personal information secure and
  protect it from loss and misuse and from unauthorised
  access, modification and disclosure.</p>
<h3> Updating your personal information</h3>
<p> If we have accurate personal information about you, it
  enables us to provide the best possible service.</p>
<p> We take reasonable steps to ensure that your personal
  information is accurate and up-to-date whenever we
  collect or use it.</p>
<p> If you find that current personal information we hold
  about you is inaccurate or out-of-date, please contact us
  immediately and we will correct it. If we disagree with
  you about the accuracy, completeness or currency of a
  record of your personal information held by us, we would
  if you request us to do so, take reasonable steps to
  associate with that record a statement to the effect that
  you claim this to be the case.</p>
<h3> Access to personal information</h3>
<p> You can ask us to provide you with access to the personal
  information we hold about you. If we are able to, we will
  provide you with access. A fee may apply to such access.
  In some cases, we are entitled under the National
  Privacy Principles to refuse to give you access to your
  personal information. This includes circumstances where
  giving you access would prejudice negotiations we are
  having with you, prejudice investigations of unlawful
  activity or prejudice activities carried out by or for a
  law enforcement agency.</p>
<p> If we deny your request for access, we will let you know why.</p>
<h3> Changes to this Policy Statement
</h3>
<p>We may change this Policy Statement from time to time,
  but will remain bound by any legislative requirements.
  We may notify you about changes to this Privacy
  Statement by posting an updated version on our website.</p>
<h3> Further information and complaints
</h3>
<p>You can also ask us for more information about the way
  we manage your personal information. If you have a
  complaint or would like access to your personal
  information, please contact:</p>
