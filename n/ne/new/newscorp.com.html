    <h1>Privacy Policy  </h1>
    <h3 class="style1">News America Incorporated Statement of Privacy Principles</h3>
    <p><strong>PREAMBLE</strong><br>
      News America Incorporated ("News America") is the principal U.S. 
	subsidiary of News Corporation, one of the world's largest media companies. 
	Some of the businesses of News America and its subsidiary, Fox Entertainment 
	Group, Inc., include: the production and distribution of motion pictures, 
	television programming and related consumer products (Twentieth Century 
	Fox); television broadcasting (the FOX Network and FOX-owned television 
	stations); cable programming (such as FOX Sports Net, FOX Sports World, Fox 
	Sports World Espa≈àol, FOX College Sports, Speed Channel, FOX News Channel, 
	FX and Fox Movie Channel); the publication of newspapers, books, magazines 
	and promotional free-standing inserts (such as the <em>New York Post</em>, 
	Dow Jones, HarperCollins Publishers, <em>The Weekly Standard</em>, <em>The 
	Wall Street Journal </em>and News America Marketing); marketing services (SmartSource/iGroup); 
	and Internet services (such as MySpace.com). In this Statement of Privacy 
	Principles, these businesses are collectively called the News America Group.</p>
    <p>At the News America Group we strive to enhance our relationship with consumers. Collecting personal information about consumers is vital to this effort.</p>
    <p>This Statement of Privacy Principles describes the policies and procedures of the News America Group's U.S.-based businesses for the collection, use, and dissemination of personally identifiable information about U.S. consumers in both the online and offline world. The Principles are based on the concepts of consumer notice and choice.*</p>
    <p>The News America Group is actively involved in the ongoing privacy debate and is continually monitoring privacy developments. Accordingly, from time to time we may modify these Privacy Principles to reflect changes in the law, self-regulatory initiatives and technology.</p>
    <p><strong>COLLECTION</strong><br>
      The News America Group obtains personally identifiable information only if we believe the information is relevant to our relationship with a consumer or to assist us in creating a relationship with a consumer. We obtain personally identifiable information about consumers directly from consumers whenever possible, primarily in the course of providing them with products, information and services. When the News America Group obtains personally identifiable information from third-party sources, we use only reputable sources. In those instances where our information collection activities involve children, the News America Group provides special privacy protections.</p>
    <p><strong>NOTICE</strong><br>
      When The News America Group collects personally identifiable information from consumers, we inform them about who is collecting the information, why it is being collected, how it is being collected, the types of uses we will make of the information, whether we will disclose the information to third parties and the types of third parties to whom we will disclose the information, and consumers' options regarding the use of their information.</p>
    <p><strong>CHOICE</strong><br>
      The News America Group provides consumers with an opportunity to choose whether the business unit that collects their personally identifiable information may use it for purposes that are other than those for which the information was submitted, and whether the information may be shared with third parties.</p>
    <p><strong>USE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION</strong><br>
      Inside the News America Group, we use personally identifiable information only in a manner consistent with these Privacy Principles. Personally identifiable information is available only to our employees, agents and contractors who have a business reason to have access to such information.</p>
    <p>The News America Group uses personally identifiable information to respond to our customers and to make decisions about the goods and services that the News America Group or its business partners provide or hope to provide to consumers. Subject to the exercise of consumer choice, personally identifiable information may be used for different purposes, or shared with our business partners. A News America Group business entity may disclose PII without providing consumers with a choice in order to protect the rights of the companies within the News America Group or their respective employees, agents and contractors; to protect the safety and security of visitors to web sites operated by News America Group companies; to protect against fraud or for risk management purposes; or to comply with the law or legal process. In addition, if a News America Group entity sells all or part of one of its businesses, makes a sale or transfer of assets or is otherwise involved in a business merger or transfer, PII may be transferred to a third party as part of that transaction.</p>
    <p><strong>SECURITY</strong><br>
      The News America Group uses reasonable administrative, technical, personnel, and physical measures to safeguard personally identifiable information in its possession against loss, theft, and unauthorized use, disclosure or modification.</p>
    <p><strong>ACCESS, CORRECTION AND DELETION</strong><br>
      Whenever possible, each News America Group business unit permits consumers to have a right to see the personally identifiable information that it has collected from them, to correct any information that is incorrect and to instruct the business unit to delete the information from its files.</p>
    <p><strong>REMEDIES</strong><br>
      Consumers may contact a privacy officer at each News America Group business unit regarding privacy complaints and disputes.</p>
    <p><strong>COMPLIANCE</strong><br>
      Each News America Group company will take appropriate measures to ensure compliance with these Privacy Principles.</p>
    <p><em>Revised as of: February 28, 2008</em></p>
