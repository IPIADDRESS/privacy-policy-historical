				NewCars.com is committed to online data security. 
				To better protect your privacy we provide this notice explaining our online information 
				practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected 
				and used. To make this notice easy to find, we make it available on our homepage 
				and at every point where personally identifiable information may be requested.
			</p>
			
			<p class="para_header">The Information We Collect</p>
			<p class="paragraph">

				website. On some pages, you can request quotes and register to be contacted by 
				NewCars.com affiliates. The types of personal information collected at these 
				pages are:<br>

				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c. Email address<br>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;d. Phone number<br>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;e. Car preference information<br><br>
				An individual must disclose some personally identifiable information in order to 
				receive a valid quote and/or requested information. Without this personal 
				information, NewCars.com is unable to fulfill the request for a quote or other
				requested information.
			</p>
			
			<p class="para_header">Qualified Dealers and Other Third Parties</p>
			<p class="paragraph">
				On our site, we make available requests for:<br>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a.	insurance quotes provided by 4Insurance, <br>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b.	car loan quotes provided by eLoan,<br>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c.	extended warranty quotes by 1SourceWarranty.<br><br>
				As part of providing this feature, 4Insurance, eLoan and 1SourceWarranty will

				The NewCars.com car referral service uses a national network of high-quality dealers.
				They are dedicated to deliver competitive, haggle-free pricing, fast turnaround, and
				excellent service. Appr. 90% of quote requests will be collected by NewCars.com. In areas
				where NewCars.com does not have any dealer coverage, you will be redirected to our
				affiliates' sites, StoneAge, Car.com, Dealix (InvoiceDealers), JumpStart, AutoBuyingUSA,
				AutoByTel, or AutoNation. In this case, the previously listed affiliates will collect
				personally identifiable information from you and use this information according to their
				own privacy and security policies, which can be further evaluated at

			<p class="paragraph">

				complete that particular request. We do not share this information with outside 
				parties except to the extent necessary to complete your request.<br><br>

				additions to our website. Such addresses are not used for any purpose other 
				than that for which they were submitted and are not shared with outside parties.<br><br>
				The collected personal identification information is used for the purpose it was 
				submitted for and NewCars.com own marketing. At the first time of any first marketing 
				contact between NewCars.com and the prospect, NewCars.com offers individuals a choice 
				as to whether or not they would like to receive marketing in form of newsletters etc. 
				from NewCars.com.<br><br>
				We use non-identifying and aggregate information to better design our website and to 
				share with advertisers. For example, we may tell an advertiser that X number of 
				individuals visited a certain area on our website, or that Y number of men and Z 
				number of women filled out our registration form, but we would not disclose anything 
				that could be used to identify those individuals.<br><br>
				We never use or share the personally identifiable information provided to us online in 
				ways unrelated to the ones described above without also providing you an opportunity 
				to opt-out or otherwise prohibit such unrelated uses.<br><br>

				parties or corporate affiliates with different privacy notices.
