 <strong class="red">
 NewZealand.com and Your Privacy:
 </strong>
 	At NewZealand.com it is our intent to give
 you as much control as possible over your privacy in regard to your personal
 information and the use we make of it in the course of our business. In
 general, you can visit NewZealand.com on the Web without telling us who
 you are or revealing any information about yourself.
 </p>
 <blockquote>
 <p class="content">A. NEWZEALAND.COM does not collect personally
   identifiable information about individuals except when such individuals
   specifically provide such information on a voluntary basis. For example,
   such personally identifiable information may be gathered from a contest
   or sweepstakes registration, the registration process for subscription
   sites or services and in connection with content submissions, community
   postings (e.g., chat and bulletin boards), suggestions, voting/polling
   activities, and transactional areas. Personally identifiable information
   on individual users will not be sold or otherwise transferred to unaffiliated
   third parties without the approval of the user at the time of collection.
   At such points of collection, the user will have the opportunity to indicate
   whether he or she would like to "opt out" of receiving promotional
   and/or marketing information about other products, services, and offerings
   from NEWZEALAND.COM and/or any third parties. Further, notwithstanding
   any opt out of promotional information by the user, NEWZEALAND.COM reserves
   the right to contact a subscriber regarding account status, changes to
   the subscriber agreement, and other matters relevant to the underlying service
   and/or the information collected.
 </p>
 <p class="content">B. NEWZEALAND.COM reserves the right
   to perform statistical analyses of user behavior and characteristics in
   order to measure interest in and use of the various areas of the site and
   to inform advertisers of such information as well as the number of users
   that have been exposed to or clicked on their advertising banners. NEWZEALAND.COM
   will provide only aggregated data from these analyses to third parties.
   Also, users should be aware that NEWZEALAND.COM might sometimes permit
   third parties to offer subscription and/or registration-based services
   through some NEWZEALAND.COM site. NEWZEALAND.COM is not responsible for
   any actions or policies of such third parties and users should check the
   applicable privacy policy of such party when providing personally identifiable
   information.
 </p>
 <p class="content">C. Additionally, users should be aware
   that when they voluntarily disclose personally identifiable information
   (e.g., username, e-mail address) on the bulletin boards or in the chat
   areas of the NEWZEALAND.COM sites, that information, along with any substantive
   information disclosed in the user's communication, can be collected and
   correlated and used by third parties and may result in unsolicited messages
   from other posters or third parties. Such activities are beyond the control
   of NEWZEALAND.COM.
 </p>
 <p class="content">D. Users also should be aware that non-personal
   information and data may be automatically collected through the standard
   operation of NEWZEALAND.COM's Internet servers or through the use of "cookies."
   "Cookies" are small text files a Web site can use to recognize
   repeat users, facilitate the user's ongoing access to and use of the site
   and allow a site to track usage behavior and compile aggregate data that
   will allow content improvements and targeted advertising. Cookies are not
   programs that come onto a user's system and damage files. Generally, cookies
   work by assigning a unique number to the user that has no meaning outside
   the assigning site. Users should be aware that NEWZEALAND.COM cannot control
   the use of cookies or the resulting information by advertisers or third
   parties hosting data for NEWZEALAND.COM. If a user does not want information
   collected through the use of cookies, there is a simple procedure in most
   browsers that allows the user to deny or accept the cookie feature; however,
   users should note that cookies may be necessary to provide the user with
   certain features (e.g., customized delivery of information) available on
   the NEWZEALAND.COM site.
 </p>
 <p class="content">E. Upon request, NEWZEALAND.COM will
   allow any user to "opt out" of further promotional contacts at
   any time. Additionally upon request, NEWZEALAND.COM will use reasonable
   efforts to allow users to update/correct personal information previously
   submitted which the user states is erroneous to the extent such activities
   will not compromise privacy or security interests. Also, upon a user's
   request, NEWZEALAND.COM will use commercially reasonable efforts to functionally
   delete the user and his or her personal information from its database;
   however, it may be impossible to delete a user's entry without some residual
   information because of backups and records of deletions.
 	<br>
 	<br>F. The foregoing policies are effective as of October 15, 1998. NEWZEALAND.COM
   reserves the right to change this policy at any time by notifying users
   of the existence of a new privacy statement. This statement and the policies
   outlined herein are not intended to and do not create any contractual or
   other legal rights in or on behalf of any party.
 </p></blockquote>
 <p class="content">2.
 	
 <strong class="red">What Information We Gather and Track:
 </strong>
 	There are times when we may need information
 from you. This generally involves filling out forms so you can download
 a product or order some NewZealand.com service. When you download e-mail and
 other products or services, we require you to fill out a form with your
 name and e-mail address. During this process, you are given the opportunity
 to decline further notification of important news and events. When you submit an order on-line,
 your credit card number is submitted to the credit institution for normal,
 routine processing. NewZealand.com does not collect your personal credit
 history information, and NewZealand.com does not share credit or credit
 card information with other companies or third parties, unless compelled
 by law or court order to do so.
 </p>
 <p class="content">3.
 	
 <strong class="red">What We Do With the Information We Gather and Track:
 </strong>
 	The information gathered
 from the forms you fill out is used in one of three ways:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
 <p class="content">A. To provide you with information about
 products, services, news, and events;
 	<br>
 </p>
 <p class="content">B. To allow you to purchase and download products; and
 	<br>
 </p>
 <p class="content">C. To gather broad demographic information about user trends.
 </p></blockquote>
 <p class="content">4.
 	
 <strong class="red">How We Gather and Track Information:
 </strong>
 	NewZealand.com uses various methods to collect
 certain other kinds of information including "cookies"; "referrer",
 IP addresses, and environmentals. Here is how we use those methods.
 </p>
 <blockquote>
 <p class="content">A. A "cookie" is an element
   of data that a Web site like NewZealand.com can send to your browser,
   which may then store it on your system. It can be used to provide you with
   tailored information from the Web site you have visited. Some NewZealand.com
   pages use cookies, so that we can better serve you when you visit our site
   by providing you with information tailored to your interests. You can set
   your browser to notify you when you receive a cookie, giving you the chance
   to decide whether or not to accept it. NewZealand.com does not require
   that you accept cookies.
 </p>
 <p class="content">B. A "Referrer" is the information
   passed along by a Web browser that references the Web URL you linked from,
   and our Web server automatically gathers it. This information is used by
   NewZealand.com in identifying broad demographic trends and may be used
   to provide information tailored to your interests.
 </p>
 <p class="content">C. Our Web server automatically gathers
   IP addresses. Your IP address is a number that is used by computers on
   the network to identify your computer so that data (such as the Web pages
   you request) can be sent to you.
 </p>
 <p class="content">D. Environment variables we gather include
   time, type of Web browser being used, the operating system/platform, and
   CPU speed. This information is used only for broad demographic information.
   This information is used by NewZealand.com in identifying broad Demographic
   trends and may be used to provide information tailored to your interests.
 </p>
 <p class="content">E. Additionally, the NewZealand.com
   site contains links to other Web sites, however, NewZealand.com is not
   responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such Web sites.
 </p></blockquote>
 <p class="content">5.
 	
 <strong class="red">What Sites This Covers:

 follow this policy for privacy and sharing of information with third parties.
