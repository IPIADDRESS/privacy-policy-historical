<b>What are 'cookies' and how does Newport News use them?</b>

<br><br>

A "cookie" is a small data file that contains a unique identifier. Cookies can be used to store personal information about you, directly on your computer. Newport News does not believe that storing your personal information on a cookie is a responsible use of this information and therefore, we do not use cookies to store any of your personal or financial information on your computer.

Cookies are also used to "connect" your computer to information stored in a separate location. At Newport News, we use cookies to connect your computer with the information we store for you in our database. Some examples of this data include items added to your shopping cart and user specific information on pages accessed and previous visits to our site.

Other than in helping us to provide you with the products and services available on our site, these companies are contractually restricted from using your information in any manner.

<br><br>

Our current technology platform requires that your browser be set to accept cookies to place orders on our site. Cookies keep track of the items that you order during your shopping session so that  when you're ready to check out, all of the items you've placed in your shopping cart will be there and ready for purchase.

<b>How do I know my information is secure?</b>

<br><br>

We have appropriate security measures in place to protect against the loss, misuse or alteration of information that we have collected from you at our site so you can feel comfortable and secure when shopping. When you see either a solid key icon or a locked padlock icon at the lower portion of your browser window then the site is secured through Secure Sockets Layer (SSL). With SSL implemented on both the client and server, information sent via the Internet can be trusted to arrive privately and unaltered to our server only. We always use industry-standard encryption technologies when transferring and receiving your personal information on our site. Pages requesting personal information should always have one of these icons. If you do not see one of these icons, or still have concerns about ordering electronically, please call 1-800-688-2830 to simply place your order over the phone. Have the item number, size and color ready for each item you wish to order.
