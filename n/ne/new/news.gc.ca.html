<h2>Disclaimer</h2>
<p>Some of  the information and services found on this website have been provided by Government  of Canada departments and agencies. Employment  and Social Development Canada is not responsible for the accuracy, reliability or currency of  the information or services provided by other departments and agencies of the  Government of Canada. Users wishing to rely on this information or these services  should consult directly with the appropriate source. </p>
<p> The  Government of Canada is committed to protect the privacy of its visitors on its  websites. This Privacy Notice summarizes the privacy policy and practices on  Government of Canada websites.</p>
<h2>Your Privacy and the  Internet</h2>
<p>Specific  personal information, such as your name, phone number or email address, is not  automatically gathered. ESDC would only obtain this type of information if you  supply it by email or by registering in a secure portion of the site for a  program or service (e.g. personal information provided voluntarily when you  complete an online form or request for service).</p>
<p>The nature of the Internet is such that Web servers  automatically collect certain information about a visit to a website, including  the visitor’s Internet Protocol (IP) address. IP addresses are unique numbers  assigned by Internet Service Providers (ISP) to all devices used to access the  Internet. Web servers automatically log the IP addresses of visitors to their  sites. The IP address, on its own, does not identify an individual. However, in  certain circumstances, such as with the co-operation of an ISP for example, it  could be used to identify an individual using the site. For this reason, the  Government of Canada considers the IP address to be personal information,  particularly when combined with other data automatically collected when a  visitor requests a Web page such as the page or pages visited, date and time of  the visit.</p>
<p>In cases where services are provided by organizations  outside of the Government of Canada, such as social media platforms, search or  mobile applications, IP addresses may be recorded by the third-party service  provider.</p>
<p>All personal  information created, held or collected by the Government of Canada is protected  under the federal <a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/P-21/index.html"><em>Privacy Act</em></a>. At any point of  collection, you will be asked for consent to collect your information or you  will be advised of the authority for such collection. You will also be informed  of the purpose for which the personal information is being collected, and how  to exercise your right of access to, and correction of, that information. &nbsp;In such cases, how your personal information is  handled is described in a Personal Information Collection Statement.</p>
<p>Visitors'  personal information is not usually disclosed to anyone except Government of  Canada personnel who need the information to carry out their responsibilities.  Any further disclosure of the personal information you provide would be in  accordance with the federal <a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/P-21/index.html"><em>Privacy Act</em></a> and Part 4 of the <em>Department of Human Resources and Skills  Development Act (DHRSDA) </em>if applicable<em>.</em> Once you have selected a program or service offered by another Government of  Canada department or agency, you are subject to the terms of that institution’s  privacy notice.</p>
<h2>Communicating with  Government of Canada</h2>
<p>If you  choose to send News.gc.ca an email or complete a feedback form online, your  personal information may be used in order to respond to your inquiry. ESDC does  not use the information to create individual profiles. Any disclosure of your  personal information is in accordance with the <em>Privacy  Act and Part 4 of the DHRSDA if applicable</em>. </p>
<p>Emails and  other electronic methods used to communicate with the Government of Canada are  not secure unless it is specifically stated on a Web page. Therefore, it is  recommended that you <strong>do not</strong> send  sensitive personal information, such as your Social Insurance Number or your  date of birth, through non-secure electronic means. </p>
<p>Personal  information from emails or completed feedback forms is collected pursuant to section  5 of the <em>Department of Human Resources  and Skills Development Act</em> and section 4 of the <em>Privacy Act</em>. Such information may be used for statistical,  evaluation and reporting purposes and is included in Personal Information Bank <a href="http://www.infosource.gc.ca/emp/emp03-eng.asp#psu914"><em>Public  Communications (PSU 914)</em></a>.</p>
<h2>Third-Party Social Media</h2>
<p>The Government of Canada’s use of social media serves as an extension of its  presence on the Web. Social media account(s) are public and are not hosted on  Government of Canada servers. Users who choose to interact with the Government  of Canada via social media should read the terms of service and privacy  policies of these third-party service providers and those of any applications  used to access them. Government of Canada's uses Twitter.</p>

<p>Personal information that you provide to the Government of Canada via social media account(s) is collected under the authority of the Financial Administration. This information is collected to capture conversations (e.g. questions and answers, comments, "likes", retweets) between you and the Government of Canada. It may be used to respond to inquiries, or for statistical, evaluation and reporting purposes. Comments posted that violate Canadian law will be deleted and disclosed to law enforcement authorities. Comments that violate our Terms and Conditions could also be deleted. The personal information is included in Personal Information Bank Outreach Activities (PSU 938)].</p>

<h2>Improving your Experience on Government of Canada Websites </h2>
<h3>Digital Markers (including  cookies)</h3>
<p>A digital  marker is a resource created by the visitors’ browser in order to remember  certain pieces of information for the Web server to reference during the same  or subsequent visit to the website. Examples of digital markers are “cookies” or HTML5 web storage. Some examples of what digital markers do are as follows:</p>
<ul>
  <li>they allow a website to recognize a visitor who has previously accessed the site;</li>
  <li>they track what content is viewed on a site which helps website administrators ensure visitors find what they are looking for.</li>
</ul>
<p>News.gc.ca uses <em>sessional and persistent</em> digital markers on its  website. During your on-line visit, your browser exchanges data with News.gc.ca  Web server. The digital markers used do not allow News.gc.ca to identify  individuals and do not contain personal information. <br>
  You may adjust your browser settings to reject digital markers, including  cookies, if you so choose. However, it may affect your ability to interact with  the News.gc.ca website.</p>
<h3>Web Analytics</h3>
<p>Web  analytics is the collection, analysis, measurement, and reporting of data about  Web traffic and visits for purposes of understanding and optimizing Web usage. Information in digital markers may be used in conjunction with computer request  data to identify and track your online interactions with the News.gc.ca website. <br>
  News.gc.ca uses Google Analytics and log file analysisto  improve News.gc.ca. When  your computer requests a News.gc.ca Web page, the following types of information are collected  and used for Web analytics:</p>
<ul>
  <li>the originating IP address</li>
  <li>the date and time of the request</li>
  <li>the type of browser used</li>
  <li>the page(s) visited</li>
  <li>referral website</li>
</ul>
<p>If you wish,  you may opt out of being tracked by Google Analytics by disabling or refusing  the cookies; by disabling JavaScript within your browser; or by using the <a href="http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en">Google Analytics Opt-Out  Browser Add-On</a>. Disabling Google Analytics or JavaScript will still permit  you to access comparable information or services from our websites. However, if  you disable your session cookie option, you will still be able to access our  public website, but you might have difficulties accessing any secure services. </p>
<p>News.gc.ca uses  log file analysis internally and retains information collected for Web  analytics for a maximum period of 18 months. After this period, the information  must be disposed of in accordance with the <em>Standard on Privacy and Web  Analytics</em> or as authorized by the Librarian and Archivist of  Canada. The information is not disclosed to an external third party service  provider. <br>
  Data collected for Web analytics purposes goes outside of Canada to  Google servers and may be processed in any country where Google operates  servers.&nbsp; Data may be subject to the  governing legislation of that country, [<em>for example the </em><a href="http://www.fincen.gov/statutes_regs/patriot/"><em>USA Patriot Act</em></a>].&nbsp; For further information about Google  Analytics, please refer to the <a href="http://www.google.ca/analytics/terms/us.html">Google Analytics terms  of service</a>.<br>
  Information used for the purpose of Web analytics is collected pursuant  to section 5 of the <em>Department of Human  Resources and Skills Development Act</em> and section 4 of the <em>Privacy Act</em>. Such data may be used for  communications and information technology statistical purposes, audit, and  evaluation, research, planning and reporting. For more information on how your  privacy is safeguarded in relation to web analytics, see the <em>Standard on Privacy  and Web Analytics</em>.<strong> </strong></p>
<h2>Protecting the Security of  Government of Canada Websites </h2>
<p>Software programs are used to monitor network traffic and to identify  unauthorized attempts to upload or change information, or otherwise cause  damage. When you visit News.gc.ca, these software  programs automatically receive and temporarily store information supplied by  your browser (for example, Internet explorer, Mozilla Firefox) in our Web  server logs. Some of the information automatically collected by our server when  you browse our website includes:</p>
<ul>

  <li>the name of the domain you used to access the Internet (.com, .org, .net, .ca, etc.);</li>
  <li>the type of browser you used;</li>
  <li>the type of operating system you used (Windows, Mac OS, etc.)</li>
  <li>the date and time you accessed the site;</li>
  <li>the pages you have accessed and the documents you have downloaded; and</li>
  <li>the Internet address of the website from which you linked directly to our site, if applicable.</li>
</ul>
<p>In most circumstances, this is anonymous statistical data and no attempt  is made to link this data, nor the IP addresses of the computers that have  contacted our website, with the identity of individuals visiting our site  unless an attempt to damage the site has been detected.
