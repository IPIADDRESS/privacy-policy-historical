<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

<p><span class="bold">Introduction</span><br>
We at Newsweaver respect your right to privacy and comply with our obligations under the Data Protection Act 1998. The purpose of this website Privacy Statement is to outline how we deal with any personal data you provide to us while visiting this website. Naturally, if you are not happy with the content of this Privacy Statement you should not use this website.
By visiting the Newsweaver website, you are accepting the terms of this Privacy Statement. Any external links to other website are clearly identifiable as such, and we are not responsible for the content or the privacy policies of these other website.
</p><br>

<p><span class="bold">Types of Information Collected</span></p>
<p>We retain two types of information:</p>
<p>- Personal Data</p>
<p>This is data that identifies you or can be used to identify or contact you and may include your name, company name, job title, address, email address, user IP addresses in circumstances where they have not been deleted, clipped or anonymised, telephone number, and billing and credit card information. Such information is only collected from you if you voluntarily submit it to us.</p>
<p>- Non-Personal Data</p>
<p>Like most websites, we gather statistical and other analytical information collected on an aggregate basis of all visitors to our web site. This non-personal data comprises information that cannot be used to identify or contact you, such as demographic information regarding, for example, user IP addresses where they have been clipped or anonymised, browser types and other anonymous statistical data involving the use of our website.</p><br>

<p><span class="bold">Purposes for which we hold your Information</span></p>
<p>- Non-Personal Data</p>
<p>We use the non-personal data gathered from visitors to our website in an aggregate form to get a better understanding of where our visitors come from and to help us better design and organise our website.</p>
<p>- Cookies</p>
<p>This website uses "cookie" technology. A cookie is a little piece of text stored by the browser on your computer, at the request of our server. We may use cookies to deliver content specific to your interests and to save your personal preferences so you do not have to re-enter them each time you connect to our website - our cookies are not available to other websites. Cookies are required on the Newsweaver website to allow users to access the client login area. No personal information is recorded, and the cookie is automatically deleted when you log out or close your browser. You are always free to decline our cookies, if your browser permits, or to ask your browser to indicate when a cookie is being sent. You can also delete cookie files from your computer at your discretion. Note that if you decline our cookies or ask for notification each time a cookie is being sent, this may affect your ease of use of this web site.</p>

<p><span class="bold">Disclosure of Information to Third Parties</span><br>
We may provide non-personal data to third parties, where such information is combined with similar information of other users of our website. For example, we might inform third parties regarding the number of unique users who visit our website, the demographic breakdown of our community users of our website, or the activities that visitors to our website engage in while on our website.
