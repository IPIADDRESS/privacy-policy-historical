    <p>Newsela - Privacy Policy
<em>[Last Updated: January 11, 2016]</em></p>
<p>Here's why we believe in privacy:</p>
<p>Because kids are kids, and they shouldn't have to make grown-up decisions about whom they should trust with their personal information.</p>
<p>Because parents, guardians and the educators with whom they've entrusted their children should have ultimate control over how their children's and students' personal information appears online wherever practicable.</p>
<p>Because passing along personal information to those who shouldn't have it erodes trust. And that's bad for you, for us, and for everyone who believes that technology has the power to help students learn.</p>
<p>This isn't just on us. As adults, we all share responsibility. We're working together with you to help your students and children read closely, think critically and be worldly. We also need to work together to maintain children's most basic online right: the right to privacy. So read our policy. Hold us to it. Make sure your own privacy practices are in order. And let's get this right.</p>
<p>Yours in reading,</p>
<p>Matthew Gross</p>
