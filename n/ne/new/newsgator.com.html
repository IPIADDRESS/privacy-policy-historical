		<h5>Our Commitment To Privacy</h5>
		Your privacy is important to us. To better protect your privacy we provide this notice explaining our information practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used. We are not responsible for the content or the privacy policies of web sites to which we may link.<br>
		<br>
		<h5>The Information We Collect</h5>
		This notice applies to all information collected or submitted. There are four general areas where you may provide information.<br><br>

		<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Product Usage</span><br>
		Through the usage of any of our client products or web-based readers, you create data.  The primary purpose of storing this data is to present the correct view in your reader (e.g. your subscriptions, your read and unread items).  The types of personal information that may be collected in this process include:<br>
		Subscriptions<br>
		Data from actions you take on posts (for example marking read, saving, forwarding via email, etc)<br><br>
		
		<h5>The Way We Use Information</h5>
		We use the information you provide about yourself when placing an order to complete that order. We do not share this information with outside parties except to the extent necessary to complete that order.<br><br>
		We use your email address to answer the email we receive and to communicate with you regarding your purchases. We may also use your email information to solicit feedback from you or alert you to new features in our products that we think may be of interest. You will always have the option to opt out of such communications. Your email address and other contact information are not used for any other purpose. We may utilize an external service for sending and tracking email communications and unsubscribe requests. These third parties may not share or use your email address for any other purpose.<br><br>
		We use non-identifying and aggregate information to better design our website and to share with advertisers and content partners. For example, we may tell a partner company that X number of individuals subscribe to a certain content feed and may provide aggregate demographic information about these X individuals, but we would not disclose anything that could be used to identify those individuals.<br><br>
		We collect information on viewing and interacting with content to produce relevance ranking on articles.  Personally identifiable information is not displayed or shared outside of NewsGator’s systems without your explicit permission (for example if you choose to make a clipping folder public).<br><br>
		Finally, we never use or share the personally identifiable information provided to us online in ways unrelated to the ones described above without also providing you an opportunity to opt out or otherwise prohibit such unrelated uses.<br><br>		
		<br>
		<h5>Use of Cookies</h5>
		We use session cookies (cookies which are only used for a single session) during the ordering process and in the subscriber area of the site. <br>
		We use persistent cookies (cookies which are stored on your computer and used for multiple sessions) for tracking referral sources for affiliate marketing and for measuring ad performance. No personally identifiable information is stored in this cookie.<br>
		We also use persistent cookies if you choose to use the auto-login feature of the subscriber site or for use in the online site's configuration settings. <br>
		<br>
		<h5>Our Commitment to Data Security</h5>
		To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy and ensure the correct use of information, we have put in place appropriate procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online. All personal information is transmitted in encrypted format using SSL. <br>
