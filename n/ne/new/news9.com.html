<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm"><b>Privacy Policy</b></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">NetraCorp LLC respects the privacy of
visitors to our site. This privacy policy ("Privacy Policy")
governs the use and collection of information from you by NetraCorp
LLC, and its subsidiaries ("we" or "us") through
your use of our websites. This Privacy Policy does not apply to any
information you may provide to us through other means; for example,
at a live event or via telephone. Please read this Privacy Policy
carefully so that you understand our online privacy practices. By
visiting any of our sites, you agree that your visit, and any dispute
over our online privacy practices, is governed by this Privacy Policy
and our Visitor Agreement.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">Questions regarding privacy issues
should be directed to our contact form.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm"><b>CHILDREN'S PRIVACY</b></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">Children should always get permission
from their parents before sending any information about themselves
(such as their names, email addresses, and phone numbers) over the
Internet, to us or to anyone else. We generally direct our services
to individuals that are over18. In any case, we won't knowingly allow
anyone under 13 to register with any of our sites or to provide any
other personally identifying information.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm"><b>TYPES OF INFORMATION WE COLLECT</b></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">The information we gather falls into
two categories: (1) information voluntarily supplied by visitors to
our websites when they register or initiate transactions, and (2)
information gathered on usage patterns and preferences as visitors
navigate through our sites, read our email newsletters, or use our
services, such as free email. In some cases, it is an agent or
affiliate of ours that collects the information on our behalf. Third
party providers featured on or linked to by our websites, such as
vendors of products and services offered through our sites, may be
gathering the same kinds of information.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">Why Register? To make use of certain
features on our websites (such as free email, classifieds, personal
web pages, chatrooms and other interactive message boards) visitors
need to register and to provide certain information as part of the
registration process. We may also ask for information from those who
buy products or services or conduct other transactions on our
websites. (We may ask, for example, for your name, email address,
sex, age, or zip code, and we might request information on your
interest in sports, personal finance, the performing arts, and the
like.) The information you supply will help us to offer you more
personalized features, to tailor our sites to your interests and make
them more useful to you, and to process e-commerce transactions. See
"Shopping" below to learn more about purchasing products or
services on our sites.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">The more you tell us about yourself,
the more value we can offer you. Supplying such information is
entirely voluntary. But if you don't supply the information we need,
we may be unable to provide you with services we make available to
other visitors to our sites. For example, we can't offer you a
personalized stock portfolio if you don't tell us which stocks you
want to track. And we can't send you email alerting you to a new
service we're offering, or breaking news that may interest you if you
don't tell us what you're interested in and give us your email
address.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">Of course, if you do not want to
register with us, you're still free to take advantage of the wealth
of content available on our sites without registration.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm"><b>Contests and Other Promotions</b>. From
time to time, we may offer contests, sweepstakes or other promotions
on our sites. If you enter one of these promotions, you'll have to
provide information about yourself (such as your name, address,
telephone number and email address) so that we can contact you if you
win. We may share this information with any co-sponsor of the
promotion, which we will identify in the official rules. If you don't
want us to collect the information requested in the registration form
or to provide it to contest co-sponsors, please do not enter the
contest or sweepstakes.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm"><b>Email Newsletters</b>. We may also offer
you the opportunity to subscribe to email newsletters on topics that
we believe are of interest to our visitors. If you have opted to
receive a particular newsletter, you may always unsubscribe later if
you decide not to receive further mailings of the newsletter from us.
See "Opting Out" below.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm"><b>Cookies</b>. To help make our sites more
responsive to the needs of our visitors, we invoke a standard feature
of browser software, called a "cookie," to assign each
visitor a unique, random number, a sort of user ID, if you will, that
resides on your computer. The cookie doesn't actually identify the
visitor, just the computer that a visitor uses to access our site.
Unless you voluntarily identify yourself (through registration, for
example), we won't know who you are, even if we assign a cookie to
your computer. The only personal information a cookie can contain is
information you supply. A cookie can't read unrelated data off your
hard drive. Our advertisers and the third parties that provide
products or services through our sites may also assign their own
cookies to your browser, a process that we don't control. We use
cookies to help us tailor our site to your needs, to deliver a
better, more personalized service. It is a cookie, for example, that
allows us to deliver your personalized stock quotes each time you
visit a site, even if you've been away for awhile. If you are
shopping on our site, we may use cookies to help us keep track of
your shopping cart. And we use cookies to
avoid showing you the same ad, repeatedly, during a single visit. In
addition, we may use cookies to track the pages on our sites visited
by our users. We can build a better site if we know which pages our
users are visiting and how often. Of course, you can set your browser
not to accept cookies, but if you do, you may not be able to take
advantage of the personalized features enjoyed by other visitors to
our sites.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm"><b>Other Methods of Collecting
Information</b>. Our web pages may contain electronic images (called
"single-pixel GIFs" or "web beacons") that allow
us and our vendors to count users who have visited particular pages
or to access certain cookies. We may use these tools and other
technologies to recognize which pages users visit, and which links
they click on. These features are also
included in our email newsletters so that we can learn which messages
have been opened and acted upon. We may also be able to verify your
online purchases from us or from third party sites that have agreed
to share such information with us.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm"><b>IP Addresses</b>. Our web servers
automatically collect limited information about your computer's
connection to the Internet, including your IP address, when you visit
our sites. (Your IP address is a number that lets computers attached
to the Internet know where to send you data -- such as the web pages
you view). We use this information to deliver our web pages to you
upon request, to tailor our sites to the interests of our visitors,
and to measure traffic within our sites. For example, if you are
shopping on our site, we may use your IP address to help identify you
and your shopping cart. Your IP address does not identify you
personally to us. But we maintain the right to use reverse IP address
inquiry and to release information about our visitors as described in
"Other Disclosures" below.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm"><b>DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION</b></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm"><b>Vendors</b>. To make our sites more
valuable to our visitors, we offer some features in conjunction with
other providers who may or may not remain unknown to you (our
"Vendors"). Our chat, email newsletters and free email
services, for example, are made available through arrangements with
providers that specialize in operating such services. We share with
these third parties only such information as is necessary to provide
the products or services.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm"><b>Third Party Provider Partners</b>. We also
make some products and services available through our sites through
cooperative relationships with the third party providers ("Provider
Partners") of such goods and services, where the brands of our
Provider Partner may or may not appear prominently on our site. We
may share with our Provider Partner any information you provide, or
that is collected, in the course of visiting any pages that are made
available in cooperation with our provider partner. In some cases,
the Provider Partner may collect information from you directly.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm"><b>Advertisers</b>. When we present
information to our advertisers - to help them understand our audience
and confirm the value of advertising on our websites - it is usually
in the form of aggregated statistics on traffic to various pages
within our sites. From time to time, we may share more particularized
information on visitors to our sites with those marketing products
and services that we believe may be of interest to you.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm"><b>Statistical Information</b>. Much of the
information we collect is in the form of aggregated statistics, such
as the traffic that visits various pages within our sites, and the
habits and preferences of our audience. Such aggregated information
does not include any information that would identify you personally.
We may use such aggregated information and disclose it to third
parties as we see fit.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm"><b>Sites to Which We Link</b>. Of course, our
sites include links to plenty of other websites, and provide access
to products and services offered by third parties, whose privacy
policies we don't control. When you access another website or
purchase products or services or conduct other transactions through
our websites, use of any information you provide is governed by the privacy
policy of the operator of the site you're visiting or the provider of
such products or services.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm"><b>Other Disclosures</b>. We may occasionally
release information about our visitors when release is appropriate to
comply with law, to enforce our Visitor Agreement, or to protect the
rights, property or safety of visitors to our sites, the public, or
NetraCorp LLC and its</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">employees, agents, partners and
affiliates. As our business grows, we may buy or sell various assets.
In the unlikely event that  NetraCorp LLC, the bulk of our assets, or
one or more of our sites is acquired by another company, information
on our visitors would be among the transferred assets. And, of
course, any information you include in a message you post to any
chatroom, forum or other public posting area is available to anyone
with Internet access. If you don't want people to know your email
address, for example, don't include it in any message you post
publicly.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm"><b>PURCHASES</b></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">When you are ready to make a purchase
on our site, we will ask you to provide us with certain information,
including your contact details (such as your name, address, telephone
and email), and your billing information (such as your credit card
number and expiration date). We may also ask you to provide
additional information such as unique identifiers (such as your date
of birth), and registration information (login name and password).
You will be able to review, update, or delete the information you
have provided us (except, of course any information that we do not
store) at any time by accessing your account on our site.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">We will use the information you provide
us to process your transaction and to contact you regarding your
purchase if necessary. We will share this information with our
Vendors to the extent necessary to facilitate your purchase (such as
customer service, verification, fulfillment and billing purposes). We
do not sell or rent your personal billing information to any third
party. We may share non-financial information with our Provider
Partners in accordance with this Privacy Policy. If you so consent
(e.g., by checking an unchecked box or by other means provided on our
site), we will make your information available to third parties so
that they, us, or both may contact you directly regarding special
offers, promotions, products or services that may be of interest to
you.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm"><b>OPTING OUT</b></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">When you register with us, you will
have the opportunity to review, update, or delete the information you
have provided us at any time (except, of course, any information that
we do not store). If you remove your registration information
completely, you may not be able to continue using certain services
that require registration. You agree that we may use your information
to contact you for customer service, to inform you of important
changes to or additions to services offered on our sites, to send you
administrative notices or any communications relevant to your use of
our sites, and to notify you of any changes to this Privacy Policy or
our Visitor Agreement.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">If you have subscribed to one of our
email newsletters, you will always have the opportunity to
unsubscribe from future mailings (e.g., by clicking on an unsubscribe
link in an email newsletter or by going back to our site).</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">If you have submitted your information
on a page provided in conjunction with a Provider Partner, the
information you submit may be jointly owned by us and the Provider
Partner. If you decide to opt out on our site, you may also need to
contact the Provider Partner separately to request the service
provider to remove your information from their database.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm"><b>STORAGE OF INFORMATION</b></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">All information gathered on any of our
websites is stored within a secure database operated by us or by a
contractor on our behalf. Sensitive information such as your password
is encrypted for storage. For secure commerce transactions, we will
transmit your information using secure server software (SSL)
encryption, the industry standard today. Encryption scrambles your credit
card number and personal information. However, as effective as
encryption technology is, no security system is impenetrable. We
cannot guarantee the security of our database, nor can we guarantee
that information you supply won't be intercepted while being
transmitted to us over the Internet.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm"><b>CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY</b></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm">A final note: The Web is an evolving
medium. Accordingly, we may need to amend our privacy policy at some
point in the future, and we will inform you if we make any material
changes (e.g., by posting appropriate notices on our site or
notifying you by email).</p>
