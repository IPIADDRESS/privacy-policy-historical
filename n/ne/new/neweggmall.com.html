            <p class="intro PrivacySecurity"><strong>Information Collection and Use</strong></p>
            <p class="intro">Newegg Mall ("Us" or "We") is the sole owner of information collected on this site to purchase most products and services from NeweggMall.com (refer to the paragraph on "Sharing" for the limited exceptions to this). We will not sell, share, or rent this information to any third parties, except as outlined in this policy. We collect information from our customers to process orders and better serve you with pertinent information, such as order confirmations, order status updates, and to provide you with information on products and services that are available from us or parties associated with us. </p>
		    <p class="intro">We may also use such information to better understand the shopping experiences of you individually or in conjunction with a group of our customers. Information collected includes your name, shipping address, billing address, telephone numbers, e-mail address, and financial information such as your credit card or other payment information. We also require you to submit a username and password of your choice for your future access to your account information. To safeguard that your user name and password remain confidential, DO NOT share this information with anyone. If you elect to receive our newsletter, surveys, or special promotions, your contact information will be used for the delivery of these items. However, if you elect not to receive newsletters, surveys, or special promotions, we may still periodically send other transactional communications to you that contain customer relationship information. This includes, for example, informational emails regarding changes in our policies, changes in our methods of conducting business, or requesting that you review the information we have on file for you or the options that you have previously selected regarding your transactions with us. </p>
		    <p class="intro">We may also gather or receive information on you from third party sources, such as marketing databases made available for commercial purchase. Our use of such information will comply with applicable law, the limitations imposed by the third party on us in connection with our receipt of such information from such third party sources, but not necessarily this privacy statement. </p>
		    <p class="intro">In addition, from time to time we may provide you with chances to enter into sweepstakes, contests, or other promotions. We may conduct these events in partnership with select third parties. When you enter, we collect certain personal information from you, and as a condition of entry, you typically must agree to allow us to share your information with the third party in order to allow the third party to manage the prize fulfillment process on our behalf. </p>
		    <p class="intro PrivacySecurity"><strong>Registration</strong></p>
		    <p class="intro">In order to process your orders placed on this website, you must first complete the registration form. During registration, you will be required to provide your contact information, which includes your name, e-mail address, telephone number and street address. This information is used to provide you with important NeweggMall.com services such as automated order status updates via e-mail. </p>
		    <p class="intro PrivacySecurity"><strong>Order</strong></p>
		    <p class="intro">Most of the information collected in the registration process will be used to process orders. During the order process, you will have to provide financial information such as your credit card number, expiration date, or other types of payment information. This information is used for billing purposes and to fulfill your order. If we, or any Newegg Mall merchant has trouble processing an order or after-sales service is needed, we will use this contact information to get in touch with you. To properly process your credit card information, we must share your personal and financial information with the merchant bank for authorization and approval. This process is protected by an enhanced security system. See the Security section below for more details on security measures and procedures. We do not share your personal and financial information with any third parties, except those specified in this policy. </p>
		    <p class="intro PrivacySecurity"><strong>Cookies</strong></p>
		    <p class="intro">We customize certain Web page content based upon your browser type and other information provided by our cookie. If you choose to reject the cookie, you can still browse our store but will be unable to use the shopping cart to buy merchandise. The Newegg Mall shopping cart cannot function without cookies enabled so that the necessary information to process your order is retained. If you disable cookies, Newegg Mall will be unable to accept your online order. We will not share any personally identifiable information provided by this cookie with any third party. We will, however, link data stored in cookies to the personally identifiable information you submitted while on our site. This allows us to personalize your shopping experience and discern user preferences to evoke subconscious feelings of familiarity and assurance. </p>
		    <p class="intro">Some of our business partners (e.g., advertisers) use cookies on our site. We have no access to or control over these cookies. This privacy statement covers the use of cookies by Newegg Mall only and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers. </p>
		    <p class="intro PrivacySecurity"><strong>Log Files</strong></p>
		    <p class="intro">We use IP addresses to analyze trends, administer the site, track user movement, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. We do not link IP addresses to personally identifiable information, and we do not distribute or share IP information with any third parties. </p>
		    <p class="intro PrivacySecurity"><strong>Sharing</strong></p>
		    <p class="intro">As set forth above in "Information Collection and Use," certain third party companies may be involved with your transaction and participation in promotional events. They may perform functions including order processing, fulfillment, delivery, marketing and promotional services, postal and e-mail delivery, customer service, data analysis, returns/RMA processing, warranty/product registration, and credit review and payment processing. The third parties we contract for these purposes have limited access to your personal information and may not use it for other purposes. Such third parties include Newegg Mall merchants you purchase from, and our credit card processor: </p>

		    <p class="intro">In addition, we may frame or mask another web site so that the look, feel and interface simulate the experience of browsing a genuine Newegg Mall web page. Care and discretion is exercised when evaluating third party sites. We only brand third party sites if their organization applies security and privacy practices which we view are reasonably consistent, where appropriate, to our own commitment to safe online shopping. </p>
		    <p class="intro">Your information may be shared with Newegg Inc. and our other affiliated entities. As our business continues to evolve, we may acquire, develop, establish, or sell business units or subsidiaries. Customer information is one of the business assets that would be shared and/or transferred in these types of transactions and restructurings. In such a situation, your personally identifiable information would initially be used by them in a manner consistent with our privacy policy in place at the time of sharing. Thereafter, the relevant entity may change the privacy policy governing your relative rights and interactions. Also, when you purchase the products or services of our affiliates through us, their use of your information will be governed by their policies.    </p>
		    <p class="intro">Certain manufacturers or merchants of products and providers of services sold through Newegg Mall may require or request for us to provide to them with your personal information, including for instance, (a) your name and contact information, (b) information about the particular products or services of theirs which you purchased, (c) as well as the prices paid for the purchase of those products or services, for purposes including (i) fulfilling your purchase from them or us, (ii) validating or recording a warranty that applies to your purchase, (iii) providing a discount or credit to you or to Newegg Mall, (iv) to provide you with additional information, or (v) to better understand customer needs and desires. While we endeavor to limit such manufacturers' and providers' use of the information, such limits vary and so you should not assume that any particular limitation exists. If you have a concern about a particular manufacturer, merchant or provider receiving such information, please review the items you are considering purchasing and remove them from your order. If you do not wish to have your information shared with such manufacturers or providers, please contact webmaster@neweggmall.com. We reserve the right to disclose your personally identifiable information i) as required by law, ii) when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on our web site, iii) when we  believe that your actions violate applicable laws, iv) when we  believe that your actions violate Newegg Mall's terms and conditions that you agree to by using, accessing or purchasing from or through www.neweggmall.com (or its affiliated websites), v) when we  believe that your actions violate any usage guidelines for specific products or services, vi) when we believe that your actions violate or threaten the rights, property, or safety of our company, our users, or others, or (vii) when you consent to allow your personally identifiable information to be shared or disclosed.

This includes your screen name, any address or personal information or images that you add to your signature or otherwise post to the public, and any content of any such post. </p>
		    <p class="intro">Finally, if you have elected to allow us to share your personally identifiable information at the time that you registered with us or provided us the information, or through a subsequent affirmative election through our website, we may later disclose such information to others in compliance with your election and this policy. </p>
