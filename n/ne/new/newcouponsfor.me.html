	<h2>Privacy Policy</h2>

	(Amended as of January 3, 2012)<br>
	PLEASE NOTE: OUR PRIVACY POLICY CHANGES FROM TIME TO TIME. PLEASE CHECK BACK FOR UPDATES<br><br>
	<h3>About this Privacy Policy</h3>
	This Privacy Policy is intended to describe information that we collect from you and how that information may be used,
	with whom it may be shared, and your choices about such uses and disclosures. If you have questions about our privacy
	practices, please refer to the end of this Privacy Policy for information on how to Contact Us.
	<h3>Application of this Privacy Policy</h3>
	This Privacy Policy applies to all websites ("Website(s)" or "Site(s)") owned, operated, and controlled exclusively by
	Recess LLC ("Recess", "we", "our" or "us"), such as www.newcouponsfor.me.
	<h3>Links to Third Parties</h3>
	For your convenience and to improve the usage of the Site, we may insert links to third parties on our Site. This Privacy
	Policy does not apply to such third party websites. This includes links from partners that may use Recess's logos as part
	of a co-branding agreement. The sites that such links may direct you to have their own separate privacy policy. Recess is
	not liable for the content and activities of those sites. Your visits and access to such websites is at your own risk. Please
	note that third parties' sites may utilize their own cookies with users, collect users' data, and/or solicit users' personal
	information.
	<h3>Agreement to Terms of Privacy Policy and Terms of Use</h3>
	All activities in which you may engage on our Site are voluntary. You are not required to provide any personal information
	to us unless you choose to access features on this Site. If you do not agree with the terms of this policy or other terms of
	use on this Site, then you should immediately exit this Site and discontinue using the Site. The Terms of Service of this

	<h3>Who We Are</h3>
	We are a provider of performance marketing technology used by marketers in industries including education, financial
	services, insurance, retail and lifestyle services.
	<h3>Information We Collect</h3>
	To provide advertisement that we believe may be useful to you, we collect information about your online activities,
	including your browsing history, information about which advertisements or web pages you viewed, clicked, or interacted
	with. You may be required to provide personally identifiable information to access or use parts of our Website. Personally
	identifiable information includes name, address, telephone number, email address, and any other data used or intended
	to be used to identify, contact or locate you. In addition, we may ask for certain sensitive consumer information which
	includes social security number to obtain additional information about you such as your credit score and/or your credit
	report to improve our matching service for you. If you do not provide the requested personally identifiable information, you
	may not be able to access or use the features of the Website. We may also ask for information about your interests in and
	use of various products, programs, and services; education level; educational interests; home owner status; income; debt
	level; current mortgage balance; mortgage rate and the like and other information that does not identify you.
	Cookies<br><br>
	When you visit our Site, we may collect certain information through the use of cookies. A cookie is a small text file that
	is stored on your computer. In addition to storing your preferences and other information, the cookies allow us to gather
	information about your interactions within our Site and/or on a given advertisement. We use both session cookies, which
	terminate when you close your browser, and persistent cookies, which remain on your computer until you manually delete
	them. You may decline our cookies if your web browser software permits. If you choose to accept cookies, you may
	choose to delete them later. You may access the "Help" option on your web browser's menu bar to instruct you on how to
	delete cookies.<br><br>
	Through the use of cookies, we collect information arising out of your use of our Site. When you visit our Site, we track
	certain non-personally identifiable information with respect to your activity on the Site. Your cookie information could
	consist of: the time of day an advertisement is displayed, an advertisement id that shows which advertisements you have
	clicked on, your IP address that shows your general geographic location and the referral id that shows the URL of the web
	page where you clicked on the ad, and/or other actions you conduct while on our Site. The cookies that we use will be set
	for 3 years.<br><br>
	We may use information we collect from cookies with any non-personally identifiable information that you provide to us

	as well as with your interaction with the Sites. The aforementioned information cannot, by itself, be used to gather any
	personally identifiable information about you. Third parties may also set cookies on or through the service to track Site
	usage and to track the overall effectiveness of our online advertising campaigns. We may combine cookie information with
	your personally identifiable information with your consent.
	<h3>Log Files</h3>
	When you visit our Website, we track IP addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages,
	platform type, date/time stamp and number of clicks to analyze trends and administer the Site, track user's movement,
	and gather demographic information. We use your IP address at times to help identify you as you browse and to gather
	technical and demographic information on who uses the Site.
	<h3>Web Beacons</h3>
	We may use standard internet technology, called Web Beacons (also called clear gifs, pixel tags or web bugs) that are
	tiny graphics with a unique identifier that are used to track online movements. Unlike cookies which are stored on the
	user's computer, a web beacon is embedded invisibly on a webpage (or email). Web beacons help us better manage
	content through the service by informing us and our third party partners what content and which campaigns are effective
	and to gauge the effectiveness of marketing campaigns by showing how many emails the recipients have opened or by
	sending/receiving an identification number when you travel to a site from an online advertisement. We do not tie web
	beacons to personally identifiable information without your opt in consent.
	<h3>How We Use Your Information</h3>
	In order to customize your experience, we show you advertisement(s) which we believe may be of interest to you based
	on the information we collect and our inferences from this information. The inferences may be based on several factors
	such as your cookie information, web beacon information, and any information that you provide or a combination of
	these with your opt in consent. We will not combine previously collected non-personally identifiable information with
	your personally identifiable information without your opt in consent. Similarly, we will not collect any sensitive consumer
	information such as social security numbers or financial account numbers without your opt in consent.<br><br>
	Based upon your affirmative opt in consent, as evidenced by your clicking on the applicable "submit" button,
	acknowledgement box, your registration on a Site, your submission of the requested information, including your personally
	identifiable information, we may use the information you provide to attempt to match you with providers of products and
	services and/or we may forward the information that you provided directly to our third party partners.<br><br>
	General: In general we may use information we collect about you to:
	<ul>
	<li>Provide the products and services that you have requested;</li>

	<li>Perform research and analysis about your use of, or interest in our products, services, content, or the products,
	services, or content offered by third parties;</li>
	<li>Communicate with you via email, postal mail, telephone and/or mobile devices about products or services that
	may be of interest to you either from us or third parties;</li>
	<li>Develop and display content and advertisement tailored to your interests on our site and other sites;</li>

	<li>Verify your eligibility to receive products and/or services;</li>

	<li>Enforce our Terms of Service;</li>

	<li>Manage our business; and</li>

	<li>Perform functions as otherwise described to you at the time of collection.</li>
	</ul>

	For example, we may compare and review your personal information for errors, omissions, and accuracy; compare your
	information against publicly available files or commercially available data; and/or validate personal information to verify
	that the information you submitted has a high probability of being valid information. Use for Research: We may collect
	information about you and store it in connection with other online and/or offline information we may possess or obtain
	about you to create a general user profile.<br><br>
	<h3>Email and Telephone Calls</h3>
	From time to time, we or our business partners may contact you via e-mail advertising,
	telephone marketing, direct mail marketing, or other means to inform you of additional opportunities for other
	services and/or products that we believe may be of interest to you, even if you are listed on any federal, state or
	other applicable "Do Not Call" list. You are under no obligation to accept any service or product offered through these
	communications. We may maintain separate e-mail, mailing or phone lists for different purposes based on the information
	that you submitted and that we maintain.
	<h3>Financial Information</h3>
	To the extent that you provide your credit card information, we will use the information to verify your
	identity and/or for transmitting the information to the third party partners authorized by you for the purpose of completing
	your transaction. Such verification may be conducted through a third-party service provider and, in that case, we
	would share your specific credit card information with this third-party provider for verification purposes. Your credit card
	information will be encrypted during transmission. Notwithstanding the foregoing, we may share with third-parties the fact
	that we have credit card information on file for specific users.<br><br>
	In the event we offer product and/or services where your credit card information is required to process your requested

	transaction, we will store your credit card information to facilitate your authorized transactions. Your credit card
	information is stored for a maximum of seven days.
	
	<h2>Sharing your Information</h2>
	<h3>Third parties</h3>
	WE MAY USE INFORMATION THAT WE HAVE COLLECTED FOR ANY LEGALLY PERMISSIBLE PURPOSE,
	INCLUDING SELLING OR TRANSFERRING SUCH INFORMATION AT ANY TIME TO THIRD PARTIES FOR ANY
	LEGALLY PERMISSIBLE PURPOSE. For example, we may share your personal information with third party partners
	so that they can contact you and offer you products and/or services that we and they believe might be of interest to you.
	This may include, but is not limited to, e-mail advertising, telephone marketing, and direct mail marketing. By providing
	personal information when using the Sites, you are entering into a business relationship with Recess's third party partners
	and are requesting, and expressly consenting to, being contacted by our third party partners via telephone, fax, email,
	surface mail or any other means, at any of your contact numbers or addresses, even if you are listed on any federal, state
	or other applicable "Do Not Call" list, in order to provide the services set forth on the Site or for other purposes reasonably
	related to your expressed interest in the service and/or product request and the business of our third party partners,
	including marketing-related emails.<br><br>
	PLEASE NOTE: submission of YOUR telephone number(s) is YOUR authorization and request to be called at the
	telephone number(s) YOU provide.<br><br>
	We may disclose your personally identifiable information for the purpose of the transfer or sale of personally identifiable
	information pursuant to the sale of our business or assets. If we transfer ownership of the Site to another company, we will
	notify you by general notice on our Site. We may also transfer or share non-individualized information, such as summary
	or aggregated anonymous information about all persons or sub-groups of persons visiting this Site.
	Service Providers<br><br>
	In order to provide the products or services you have requested, we may disclose the information we collect to companies
	that facilitate or provide elements of our service on our behalf, including without limitation, credit card processors, email
	management firms, and call center providers. We may also use external service providers to obtain your credit score and
	credit report.<br><br>
	
	<h3>Other Purposes</h3>
	We may also disclose your personally identifiable information when required by law, such as in response to a subpoena,
	court order, or other legal process, or to prevent imminent harm to any person or entity. We will fully cooperate with law
	enforcement agencies in identifying those who use our services for illegal purposes.
	<h2>How We Protect Your Privacy</h2>
	<h3>Security Measures</h3>
	In order to protect both the personal information and the general information that we receive from you through our
	website, we have implemented various security measures. As an initial matter, any financial information (i.e. credit card
	information) transmitted to our servers via a secure server is encrypted using Secure Sockets Layer ("SSL") technology.
	SSL is a protocol that transmits your communications over the Internet in an encrypted form. The protocol ensures that
	the information is sent, unchanged, only to the server you intended to send it to.<br><br>
	Once your Financial Information reaches our server, it is protected by a firewall. In addition to encryption and firewall
	protections, our third party partners are required to operate in accordance with federal and state laws and regulations.
	If we learn that any of our third party partners is breaching our agreement, we will take corrective actions including, if
	necessary, terminate our relationship with such third party partner.
	<h3>Risk of Interception</h3>
	We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us. However, no method
	of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. While we strive to use commercially
	acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee the security of any information you disclose
	online. For example, third parties may unlawfully intercept personal data or access our servers and obtain personal data.
	By using this site, you expressly acknowledge and agree that we do not guarantee the security of any data provided to or
	received by us through this site and that any personal information, or other data or information received from you through
	the site is provided to us at your own risk, which you expressly assume. If you have any questions about security on our
	Web site, you can mail us at the address indicated below in the Contact Us section.
	<h3>Opting Out of Email Advertisement</h3>
	If you wish to opt-out from receiving email offers containing advertisements and promotions relating to this Site, please
	click on this www.newcouponsfor.me to "opt-out".<br><br>
	If you choose to opt-out, your e-mail address will be added to the suppression files associated with this Site (e.g.
	Mortgage, Education etc.) within ten (10) business days of your request. Thereafter, you should not receive any further
	email offers containing advertisements and promotions from this Site. However you may still receive promotional
	communications from our third party partners with whom we have shared your information. To stop receiving further

	communications from these third party partners you will need to contact them directly in order to opt-out. Please note that
	after we process your request to opt-out from receiving additional email offers, advertisements and/or promotions from
	this Site, we will no longer make your information available to our third party partners relating to this Site.
	Effective Date and Notification of Changes to Privacy Policy<br><br>
	This Privacy Policy is effective as of the Effective Date stated at the beginning of this Privacy Policy and will remain in
	effect except with respect to any of its provisions that are changed in the future, in which case the changes will become
	effective on the date they are posted on the Site. We will revise the "last updated" date found at the beginning of this
	Privacy Policy when we post changes to it. We reserve the right to change this Privacy Policy at any time. You should
	check this policy periodically as terms may change from time to time. Your continued use of the Site after we post any
