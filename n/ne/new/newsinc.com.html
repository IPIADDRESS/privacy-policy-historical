If you submit to the site any comments, photographs, videos, music, text or other content, you grant to NDN the unlimited, perpetual, royalty-free right to use your name, voice, likeness and other personal information in connection with such submission in any media, now known or hereafter devised, throughout the world.</p>

<h2>Privacy Policy for Children Under 13</h2>
 
<p>In accordance with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (commonly referred to as “COPPA”), we do not require children under the age of 13 to provide us with any more information than is reasonably necessary to participate and make use of this site and under no circumstances do we require children under the age of 13 to provide us with any personal information.  Children under the age of 13 should not submit or post any personal information without the written consent of their parents or legal guardians. If you are a child under the age of 13 and want to submit your personal information to us, you should ask your parents to send an e-mail to <a href="mailto:privacy@newsinc.com">privacy@newsinc.com</a>. specifically allowing us to collect your personal information through this site.

<h2>Partner Sites / Linked Sites</h2>

<p>Our site features several activities, which are co-sponsored or operated by other sites. These activities will be identifiable by their co-branding. While these activities originate on the Websites, they may link to other sites not operated by NDN.  We have no control over the privacy practices or the content of any of our co-sponsors and strongly recommend that you check their privacy policies before engaging in these activities.  Additionally, our site contains links to other sites, including those of advertisers.  We have no control over the privacy practices of advertisers or other sites to which we provide links from this site.  For example, if you click on a banner advertisement, the click takes you off this site.  These other sites may use cookies, collect data or solicit personal information.  We strongly recommend that you check the applicable privacy policy of the site to which you are linking.</p>

<h2>Security of Information</h2>

<p>We use commercially reasonable efforts to keep your personally identifiable information secure.  Unfortunately, no electronic communication over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.  While we strive to take care to protect your personally identifiable information, NDN cannot warrant the security of any information that you submit to us, and you do so at your own risk.  We do offer secured-server transactions that encrypt your information in transit to thwart someone from intercepting it and misusing it when collecting credit card information for online purchases.  We also store any personal information, including credit card numbers, in a secure area to which the general public does not have access.</p>

<h2>Updating Personal Information</h2> 

<p>If you would like to change any contact or billing information, or if you no longer desire to receive any marketing communications from NDN or our partners, please email us at <a href="mailto:privacy@newsinc.com">privacy@newsinc.com</a>.</p>

<h2>Changes in Privacy Policy</h2>
 
<p>We reserve the right to change this Privacy Policy at any time, and will post any changes as soon as they go into effect without prior notice to you.  Any such changes are effective as of the date such changes are posted on this page.  Your continued usage after such changes are posted constitutes acceptance of each revised Privacy Policy.  Please check this page periodically to view our most current Privacy Policy.</p>
