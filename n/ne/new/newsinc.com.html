            <b>Privacy Policy for Children Under 13</b>
            <br>
            <br>
            In accordance with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (commonly referred
            to as “COPPA”), we do not require children under the age of 13 to provide us with
            any more information than is reasonably necessary to participate and make use of
            this site and under no circumstances do we require children under the age of 13
            to provide us with any personal information. Children under the age of 13 should
            not submit or post any personal information without the written consent of their
            parents or legal guardians. If you are a child under the age of 13 and want to submit
            your personal information to us, you should ask your parents to send an e-mail to
            [politicaliqsupport@dave.tv] specifically allowing us to collect your personal information
            through this site. By doing so, you allow us to alert your parent or guardian about
            this site's Privacy Policy. We do not intend to sell, license or trade any such
            information collected to third parties. Parents may review or change the personal
            information of their children provided to us or further refuse our collection of
            such information by sending an e-mail to [politicaliqsupport@dave.tv].

            <b>Partner Sites / Linked Sites</b>
            <br>
            <br>
            Our site features several activities, which are co-sponsored or operated by other
            sites. These activities will be identifiable by their co-branding. While these activities
            originate on the politicaliq.com website, they may link to other sites not operated
            by NDN. We have no control over the privacy practices or the content of any of our
            co-sponsors and strongly recommend that you check their privacy policies before
            engaging in these activities. Additionally, our site contains links to other sites,
            including those of advertisers. We have no control over the privacy practices of
            advertisers or other sites to which we provide links from this site. For example,
            if you click on a banner advertisement, the click takes you off this site. These
            other sites may use cookies, collect data or solicit personal information. We strongly
            recommend that you check the applicable privacy policy of the site to which you
            are linking.

            <b>Security of Information</b>
            <br>
            <br>
            We use commercially reasonable efforts to keep your personally identifiable information
            secure. Unfortunately, no electronic communication over the Internet can be guaranteed
            to be 100% secure. While we strive to take care to protect your personally identifiable
            information, NDN cannot warrant the security of any information that you submit
            to us, and you do so at your own risk. We do offer secured-server transactions that
            encrypt your information in transit to thwart someone from intercepting it and misusing
            it when collecting credit card information for online purchases. We also store any
            personal information, including credit card numbers, in a secure area to which the
            general public does not have access.
