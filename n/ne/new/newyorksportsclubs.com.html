<p class="BodyTextFlushLeft"><strong>Passive Information Collection Online</strong><br> We automatically collect information online such as your Internet Service Provider and IP address, the pages that you visit, your browser type, your computer operating system, the site that you report having been referred from, and time of access. We store this information in a web server log. We use this information to improve your experience on our website and to aid in the diagnosis of website problems. Your IP address also is used to gather broad demographic information. For example, we might use your IP address to collect information concerning the most popular fitness classes for the clubs located within a particular geographic area.</p>
<p class="BodyTextFlushLeft">We also collect information through "cookies." A "cookie" is a small file containing a string of characters that is sent to your computer when you visit one of our websites. When you visit the website again, the cookie allows that site to recognize your browser and customize your experience. For example, we might use a cookie to store the most recent parameters you used to search for a group fitness class so that you do not have to reenter that information the next time you do a search. You can reset your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some website features or services may not function properly without cookies.</p>
<p class="BodyTextFlushLeft"><strong>Collection of Information from Children</strong><br> We do not seek information directly from children.
