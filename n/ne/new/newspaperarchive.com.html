<h3>Privacy Statement</h3>
<h5>NewspaperArchive.com Statement of Privacy:</h5>
NewspaperArchive.com recognizes the confidentiality of 
information that may be disclosed by members in registering or making purchases 
from our Website and we are firmly committed to protecting your privacy. The 
following discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices for 
this site.
   
<h5>Overview:</h5>

The personal, private information that is provided to NewspaperArchive.com by
individual members is not provided to unrelated third parties except in rare
cases involving possible violations of our use policies or legal statutes. We
do collect some data, always with your knowledge and consent, that is used to
fulfill orders and otherwise enhance content to better meet the needs of our
users.
<br><br>
Information submitted by you online (such as your name, address, e-mail address) may be
shared with companies with which NewspaperArchive.com has a commerce
relationship and through which you reached this site, for marketing purposes.
In such circumstances you will be considered their customer as well. If you
object to such use, you may opt-out by e-mail request. Under no circumstances
will NewspaperArchive.com share with any other party your password or other
personal information it may acquire about children, family, etc.
<br><br>
Demographic information collected through on-site user surveys may be used in aggregate
statistical form to attract potential sponsors.
<br><br>
The specifics of our Privacy Policy are best described in 
the answers to the following Frequently Asked Questions:

<h5>Does NewspaperArchive.com ask for personal information?</h5>

Yes.
<br>
NewspaperArchive.com asks for 
your name, e-mail address, and other limited personal information when you sign 
up as a member and use features such as e-mail. Most of this information may be 
entered at your discretion. We may ask for similar information at other times, 
such as when you enter sweepstakes or other promotions sponsored by 
NewspaperArchive.com and/or our many partners.

<h5>How Does NewspaperArchive.com use my personal information?</h5>

Our goal is to provide you with the most personalized, relevant, user-friendly
Web experience possible. The primary use of all your personal information is to
efficiently provide you with relevant information.
<br><br>
NewspaperArchive.com will also use registration information to let you know about new 
features or
other offers of interest from NewspaperArchive.com, or to address customer
service needs and requests.
In distributing advertiser or sponsor messages, the advertiser never has access to individual account information.
NewspaperArchive.com does not sell, rent or otherwise distribute the personal
information you provide us to these advertisers.
<br><br>
Advertisers simply provide an insertion order for the 
advertising message and NewspaperArchive.com then displays the ad to appropriate 
users based on the criteria specified in the order.

<h5>Does NewspaperArchive.com request or require any personal financial information?</h5>

To facilitate payment and 
fulfillment for membership NewspaperArchive.com will request personal credit 
card or debit card information. In order to take advantage of other value-added 
family services that may be offered by NewspaperArchive.com in the future, users 
may be required to supply financial information.

<h5>Will NewspaperArchive.com disclose any of my personal information to third parties?</h5>

NewspaperArchive.com will not disclose any of your personal information, except
with your knowledge and consent as described in this policy or as may be
required by law, or to protect the rights or property of NewspaperArchive.com.
<br><br>
Circumstances where limited personal information may be disclosed are specifically described
when the data is collected, such as in the User Agreement, or in the rules of
sweepstakes or other promotions. So in all cases you control what, if any,
information you disclose.
<br><br>
NewspaperArchive.com reserves the right to disclose aggregated user statistics, such as "45% of
our users are female" or "47% of our users earn $50,000 or more per
year" in order to describe our services to prospective partners,
advertisers, and other third parties. Under protection of confidentiality
agreements, NewspaperArchive.com may match common user information, such as
name, address and phone number with third party data to avoid duplication and
prevent errors.
<br><br>
Additionally, if you click away from NewspaperArchive.com 
to visit the site of any third party advertiser or sponsor, you may be asked for 
your credit card or other personal information in order to purchase or use 
products and services offered. These companies have their own privacy and data 
collection practices. NewspaperArchive.com has no responsibility or liability 
for these independent policies. You should therefore review their privacy 
policies carefully if you have concerns about how your information may be 
used.

<h5>Will NewspaperArchive.com use my information for direct mailings?</h5>

Only at your option.
<br>NewspaperArchive.com will occasionally send e-mail messages to advise members 
when new information has been posted to the Web site or to announce special 
product and service offerings that we feel may be of interest to you. If you do 
not want to receive such mailings, you may opt out at any time by using the 
unsubscribe link listed in the e-mail.

<h5>May I refuse to provide personal information to NewspaperArchive.com or to accept
advertising?</h5>

Yes and No.
<br>
Visitors may access 
NewspaperArchive.com’s free services without providing any personal information. 
To gain full access to the members-only areas, a username, e-mail address and 
appropriate billing information are required. Because the NewspaperArchive.com 
site is partially advertiser supported, you may not "turn off" the advertising 
that appears on NewspaperArchive.com pages, but you may opt to be excluded from 
any e-mail advertising.

Does NewspaperArchive.com use "IP Addresses"?

IP Addresses:
<br>We do use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server, and to administer our Web 
site. Your IP address is also used to gather broad demographic information such 
as geographic distribution of our members.

NewspaperArchive.com Cookies:
Contrary to popular myth, cookies 
do not extract private or personal information from your computer’s memory, but 
rather, record only information you volunteer to us upon registering or visiting 
the site. Cookies are tiny files placed onto the hard drive of your computer 
when you register at our Web site that enable our server to recognize or 
"remember" who you are each time you return. NewspaperArchive.com may make 
limited use of cookies to deliver content specific to your interests. For 
instance they may be used to retain your personal preferences or save your 
password so it doesn’t have to be re-entered each time you login.

<h5>Advertiser Cookies:</h5>
NewspaperArchive.com does post third party advertising 
banners on personal family Web sites and on NewspaperArchive.com general use 
pages. These ads may contain cookies used primarily to provide data to the 
advertiser about where visitors are coming from. While we do use cookies in 
other parts of our Web site as explained above, cookies received with banner ads 
may or may not be collected by our company or be under our control.

<h5>Are Chat room dialogues recorded and saved?</h5>

Chat is not currently offered at 
NewspaperArchive.com but will be in the future. Dialogues will NOT be collected, 
stored, or used by the company or others.

<h5>What else should I know about privacy?</h5>

Demographic data is collected at 
our site at the users’ option. This information may include age and gender and 
other personal preferences that can be viewed and tabulated for use in marketing 
NewspaperArchive.com to advertisers and others. In no case is personal 
information given or sold to third parties. NewspaperArchive.com controls the 
distribution of ALL information at the site.

<h5>Contests &amp; Promotions</h5>

NewspaperArchive.com may occasionally run contests or other special promotions on our site in which we 
ask members or visitors for contact information (like an e-mail address) or 
demographic information (like a zip code, age, or income level). We use this 
data to send users promotional material about our company or our partners. The 
customer's contact information is also used to contact the visitor when 
necessary and may be shared with other companies for promotional purposes, but 
only with your prior permission and under the terms and conditions specified 
when you take part in the promotion. At any time, users may opt-out of receiving 
future mailings of this kind, or simply decline to take part in the 
promotions.

<h5>Contacting the Website</h5>

If you have any questions about this privacy statement, the practices of this
site, or your dealings with this Website, you can contact:
