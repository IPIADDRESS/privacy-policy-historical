<h2>Privacy Policy</h2>

<p>We value your privacy. Your password is encrypted before we store and authenticate it, so we don't have access to your original password. We protect any information that is personally-identifying. We will never sell your personal information.</p>

<h3>Website Visitors</h3>
<p>Like most website operators, Newsle collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Newsle's purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Newsle's visitors use its website. From time to time, Newsle may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.</p>

<p>Newsle also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users. Newsle only discloses IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below.</p>

<h3>Content in the Service</h3>
<p>Newsle automatically groups news articles, blog posts, and other publicly-available content based on people who are related to the content. Newsle does not guarantee that the groupings will be correct. There will be circumstances in which content is incorrectly linked to a person.</p>
<p>While the content in the Newsle service may reference users by name, Newsle only aggregates content that is publicly available on other websites and indexable by a search engine. We do not search for personal records, criminal records, phone numbers, addresses, or other private information.</p>

<h3>Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</h3>
<p>Some features of the Newsle service require Newsle to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that Newsle gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we gather basic information about a user and his or her contacts if the user chooses to connect his or her account to services such as Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter, or email. In each case, Newsle collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor’s interaction with the service. We never store your login credentials to any third party websites. Newsle does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain features of the service.</p>

<h3>Use of Personally-Identifying Information</h3>
<p>If you grant Newsle access to your Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter, or email account, Newsle will collect certain information about you and the people you are connected to on the account. This information is limited by the privacy settings of you and your connections, which you set through your accounts on those services. Newsle uses this information to disambiguate between people with similar names, and will not make public any of the information gathered from these services, with the exception of the name, public photo, and account ID of you and your connections, which are already publicly available.</p>
<p>If you grant Newsle permission to do so, Newsle may post activity to your Facebook account via Facebook Open Graph that corresponds to actions you take on Newsle. Newsle will not post activity to Facebook except in response to your specific actions on Newsle. By submitting contacts from any service, you authorize Newsle to contact those individuals on your behalf.</p>

<h3>Aggregated Statistics</h3>
<p>Newsle may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites. For instance, Newsle may monitor the most popular users, news articles, and comments. Newsle may display this information publicly or provide it to others. However, Newsle does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.</p>

<h3>Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information</h3>
<p>Newsle discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on Newsle’s behalf or to provide services available at newsle.com, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using the Newsle service, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. Newsle will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, Newsle discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only when required to do so by law, or when Newsle believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Newsle, third parties or the public at large. If you are a registered user of the Newsle service and have supplied your email address, Newsle may periodically send you an email to tell you about new news articles, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what’s going on with Newsle and our products. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. Newsle takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.</p>

<h3>Deleting Your Account</h3>
<p>To delete your account, go to newsle.com/settings and click "Delete My Account" at the bottom of the settings dialog. To revoke Newsle's permission to access your Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter, or email account, use that service's privacy settings interface for external applications.</p>

<h3>Cookies</h3>
<p>A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor’s computer, and that the visitor’s browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. Newsle uses cookies to help Newsle identify and track visitors, their usage of Newsle website, and their website access preferences. Newsle visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using Newsle’s website, with the drawback that certain features of Newsle’s website may not function properly without the aid of cookies.</p>

<h3>Ads</h3>
<p>Ads appearing on our website may be delivered to users by advertising partners, who may set cookies. These cookies allow the ad server to recognize your computer each time they send you an online advertisement to compile information about you or others who use your computer. This information allows ad networks to, among other things, deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you. This Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies by Newsle and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.</p>

<h3>Privacy Policy Changes</h3>
<p>Although most changes are likely to be minor, Newsle may change its Privacy Policy from time to time, and in Newsle’s sole discretion. Newsle encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to its Privacy Policy. Your continued use of the Newsle service after any change in this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such change.</p>
