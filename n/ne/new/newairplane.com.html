            <p align="left">Thank you for reviewing the Privacy Policy for Newairplane.com 
              (the “Site”). Boeing is sensitive to confidentiality 
              in online dealings and is committed to protecting individual privacy. 
              This Privacy Policy is intended to inform users about the general 
              approach Boeing uses in collecting, using, and disseminating user 
              information by means of Newairplane.com.<br>
              <br>
              <span class="subheads">What data do we collect automatically and 
              why? </span><br>
              When you visit Newairplane.com and you have not otherwise identified 
              yourself (for example, by joining the World Design Team), our web 
              server automatically recognizes your domain name but not your e-mail 
              address. We collect the domain name and monitor general site use 
              and traffic patterns to improve our web site and the products and 
              services we offer. Boeing uses web server logs to collect data for 
              metric purposes. Examples of the types of data collected on the 
              logs are IP addresses, referral pages, date and time of Site access, 
              and Site visited. We may use collected data to customize the content 
              or layout of our pages for each individual visitor.</p>
            <p><span class="subheads">Do we use cookies or tracers?</span><br>
              Cookies are small data files placed on your hard drive by a website 
              server when you visit the site. Newairplane.com uses cookies for 
              tracking purposes (for example, to personalize your experience of 
              the Site) and to make the Site easier to use. Cookies are currently 
              the only way to effectively identify a unique anonymous visitor 
              and understand how the visitor navigates our web site. An anonymous 
              visitor to our site remains anonymous in all cases. We do not attempt 
              to identify visitors if they do not voluntarily submit personal 
              information to us. With most Internet browsers, you can erase cookies 
              from your computer hard drive, block all cookies, or receive a warning 
              before a cookie is stored. Cookies offer enhanced functionality 
              to the user, but whether you allow a cookie to be placed on your 
              computer is up to you!<br>
              <br>
              In some instances, we use tracking scripts or “tracers” 
              that recognize a unique identifier from a cookie placed on your 
              hard drive when you register for the World Design Team. For example, 
              when you visit the Site home page, a tracer recognizes whether you’ve 
              previously signed up for the World Design Team. For Design Team 
              members, we also use tracking scripts or “tracers” to 
              determine what links are clicked by users from the Flight Log newsletter. 
              For instance, we use tracking scripts or “tracers” to 
              determine what links are clicked by users from the World Design 
              Team Flight Log newsletter. This information is used by Boeing solely 
              to gauge the success of our newsletter, featured content on the 
              Site, or other e-mail or web site items relating to the World Design 
              Team. We do not use tracers to gather information on your use of 
              the Internet unrelated to Boeing. Please note that Boeing does not 
              use tracers to identify your personal information, and your page-browsing 
              activity on the Site remains anonymous. Do we collect personal information? 
              <br>
              <br>
              Boeing requests personally identifiable information from you before 
              you participate in certain portions of the Site. Examples of personally 
              identifiable information include e-mail addresses, country of residence, 
              and whether you are over 18 years of age. Please note that we do 
              not consider aggregated information, from which personally identifiable 
              information has been removed, to be private.</p>
            <p><span class="subheads">What happens if I register?<br>
              </span>Registration is not required for general browsing on the 
              Site. However, if you so choose, you may join the World Design Team 
              by registering to receive e-mail and newsletters, participate in 
              surveys, and access content specially prepared for Design Team members. 
              There is no fee for registration, and you may choose to unsubscribe 
              at any time by contacting us at <a href="mailto:unsubscribe@newairplane.com?Subject=Unsubscribe%20notification">unsubscribe@newairplane.com</a>. 
              Please also note that Boeing may collect registration data in order 
              to monitor compliance with the terms of use governing the Site and 
              to set up access permissions to certain Boeing Sites.</p>
            <p><span class="subheads">What security is provided?</span> <br>
              Newaiplane.com does not conduct or allow transactions for which 
              heightened security is required. Please note that we do not treat 
              your general interaction with Newairplane.com (e.g., completion 
              of surveys, submission of suggestions) as confidential. See General 
              Submissions in Site Terms.<br>
              <br>
              <span class="subheads">When would we disclose your information? 
              </span><br>
              We do not rent, sell, or trade any personally identifiable information 
              about you (for example, e-mail addresses) to third parties. </p>
            <p><span class="subheads">What about children’s privacy?<br>
              </span>Boeing asks children under 13 not to transmit any information 
              to the Site. Boeing welcomes the parent or guardian of a child under 
              the age of 13 to use the Site and provide any information, service, 
              or product gained from the Site to its child. We ask that World 
              Design Team members be 18 years or older.</p>
            <p><span class="subheads">What if data is transmitted internationally? 
              <br>
              </span>If you are one of our international guests, we realize that 
              you may want to know whether your personal information will be transferred 
              out of your country of origin. Please be aware that when you register 
              or request a transaction on Newairplane.com, your personal data 
              may be transferred to computers in the United States in order to 
              process your request.<br>
              <br>
              <span class="subheads">Does this apply to all of the Boeing Sites? 
              <br>
              </span>Through Newairplane.com, you may link to many networked web 
              pages and web sites operated by Boeing and its subsidiaries and 
              affiliates (together, the “Boeing Sites”). Not all of 
              them have adopted this policy. Individual Boeing Sites may adopt 
              different privacy policies that fit transactions taking place on 
              that Boeing Site. If a Boeing Site has its own privacy policy, the 
              provisions of that policy will control if they conflict with this 
              general policy. Also, some Boeing Sites are intended to facilitate 
              interaction with other businesses and may not adopt a privacy policy 
              for individuals. Users of those Sites should check with their employer 
              regarding the employer’s arrangements with Boeing and applicable 
              privacy practices.<br>
              <br>
              <span class="subheads">What about external links? <br>
              </span>For the convenience of our Site visitors, Boeing may provide 
              links to third-party web sites that are external to Boeing. These 
              web sites are not operated or controlled by Boeing, and Boeing is 
              not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such 
              external web sites.<br>
              <br>
              <span class="subheads">How do we keep current? <br>
              </span>From time to time, Boeing may revise this Privacy Policy 
              at its discretion. We note the date of the policy below, so you 
              know when it was last updated. Boeing advises you to check back 
              periodically to review the Privacy Policy because users of the Site 
              will be prospectively bound by the then-current version of this 
              Privacy Policy.</p>
