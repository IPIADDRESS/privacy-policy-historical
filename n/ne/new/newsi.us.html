<h2>Information Collection</h2>
<p>
    SepticSystem.com is the sole owner of the information collected on www.SepticSystem.com.
    SepticSystem.com collects information from our users at several different
    points on our Web site.
</p>
<h3>Registration form</h3>
<p>
    Many features on this web site require that a user register.  During registration a user is required to
    give contact information (such as email address and password). We use this information to contact the 
    user about services on our site for which (s)he has expressed an interest.  We may occasionally ask the user
    to provide contact, demographic or geographic information.  This helps us to provide a more personalized 
    experience on the site.
</p>

<h3>Order forms</h3>
<p>
    We request information from the user on our order forms. A user must provide 
    financial information (such as credit card number, expiration date and zip code).  This information is
    used for billing purposes and to fill customer orders.
    If we have trouble processing an order, the information is used to contact the user.
</p>

<h2>Information Use</h2>

<h3>Profile</h3>
<p>
    We store and gather information from cookies, log files, clear gifs, and/or third parties to create a 
    profile of our users. A profile is stored information that we keep on individual users that details their 
    preferences and actions. Collected information is tied to a user's identity to provide offers and improved
    content. This profile is used to tailor a users visit to our Web site, and to direct pertinent marketing 
    promotions to them.  We do not share your profile with other third parties.
</p>
<p>
    We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our website. These companies may use information (not including your name, address, email 
    address, or telephone number) about your visits to this and other websites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. If 
    you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies, 
    <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp">click here</a>.
</p>

<h3>Cookies</h3>

<p>
    A cookie is a piece of data stored on a user's computer which allows us to track the user during their
    visit to our site. We use session cookies (rather than permanent cookies).
    Once a user closes their browser, the cookie simply terminates. If users rejects the cookie, they may 
    still use our site, although they will not be able to access areas of the site which require login.
</p>
<p>
    Some of our business partners (ex: advertisers) may use cookies on our site. We have no
    access to or control over these cookies, once we have given permission for them
    to set cookies for advertising.
</p>

<h3>Third Party Advertising</h3>
<p>
    The ads appearing on this Web site may be delivered to users by our web advertising partners. 
    We do not pass personal information to those advertisers about our users -- although those
    advertisers may choose to use technologies that allow them to connect a user's presence on
    our site with the same user's presence on other sites.  This is standard practice by 
    some advertisers, and is in no way unique to SepticSystem.com.
</p>
<p>
    This privacy statement covers the use of cookies by www.SepticSystem.com only and does not cover the use of
    cookies by any advertisers.
</p>

<h3>Log Files</h3>

<p> 
    Like most Web sites we record information about your session and write it to databases and log files. This 
    includes internet protocol (IP) addresses (which can be traced to your internet service provider (ISP), browser type, 
    referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, which pages you requested, etc.  We use this information
    to analyze trends, administer the site, track users' movements in particular and in the aggregate, and gather 
    broad demographic information for aggregate use. This information allows us to link your ip address to any
    personally identifiable information that you have given us.
</p>

<h2>Communications from the Site</h2>

<h3>Offers and Updates</h3>
<p>
    We send all new members a welcoming email to verify password and username. Established members will occasionally 
    receive information on products, services, special deals, and a newsletter if they opt in to receive this 
    information. Out of respect for the privacy of our users we present the option to not receive these types of 
    communications. Please see the Choice and Opt-out sections.
</p>

<h3>Service Announcements</h3>
<p>
    On rare occasions it is necessary to send out a strictly service related announcement. For instance, if our
    service is temporarily suspended for maintenance we might send users an email. Generally, users may not opt-out
    of these communications, though they can deactivate their account. However, these communications are not
    promotional in nature.
</p>

<h3>Customer Service</h3>
<p>
    We communicate with users on a regular basis to provide requested services and in
    regards to issues relating to their account. We reply via email or phone, in
    accordance with the user's wishes.</p>
<p></p>


<h2>Sharing</h2>

<h3>Legal Disclaimer</h3>

<p>
    Although we make every effort to preserve user privacy, we may need to disclose personal
    information when required by law wherein we have a good-faith belief that such
    action is necessary to comply with a current judicial proceeding, a court order
    or legal process served on our Web site.
</p>

<h3>Aggregate Information (non-personally identifiable)</h3>
<p>
    We may share aggregated demographic information with our partners and
    advertisers. This is not linked to any personally identifiable information.
</p>

<h3>Third Party Intermediaries</h3>
<p>
    We use a credit card processing company to bill users for goods and services. This company does not retain,
    share, store or use personally identifiable information for any secondary purposes.
</p>


<h3>Business Transitions</h3>
<p>
    In the event SepticSystem.com goes through a business transition, such as a merger, being acquired by another company, or 
    selling a portion of its assets, users' personal information will, in most instances, be part of the assets
    transferred.
</p>

<h3>Choice/Opt-out</h3>
<p>
    Our users are given the opportunity to opt-out of having their information used
    for purposes not directly related to our site at the point where we ask for
    information.
</p>

<p>
    Users who no longer wish to receive our promotional communications may
    opt-out of receiving these communications by replying to unsubscribe in the
    subject line in the email or by emailing us at privacy at septicsystem dot com.
</p>

<h3>Links</h3>
<p>
    This Web site contains links to other sites. Please be aware that we, SepticSystem.com, are not responsible for the 
    privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to 
    read the privacy statements of each and every Web site that collects personally identifiable information.
    This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by this Web site.
</p>

<h3>Tell-A-Friend</h3>
<p> 
    If a user elects to use our referral service for informing a friend about our site, we
    ask them for the friend's name and email address. SepticSystem.com will automatically send the friend a one-time
    email inviting them to visit the site. SepticSystem.com stores this information for the sole purpose of sending this 
    one-time email (and tracking the success of our referral program).
</p>

<h3>Security</h3>
<p>
    This Web site takes every precaution to protect our users' information.
</p>

<p>
    We do everything in our power to protect user-information off-line.  Users' information is 
    stored on our servers under password controls.  Access to that information is granted to
    employees on a need-to-know basis. Finally, the servers that
    store personally identifiable information are in a secure environment, 
</p>

<p>
    If users have any questions about the security at our
    Web site, users can send an email to privacy at septicsystem dot com.
</p>

<h3>Correcting/Updating/Deleting/Deactivating Personal Information</h3>
<p>
    If a user's personally identifiable information (such as email) changes or if a user no longer desires our 
    service, we provide a way to correct, update or delete/deactivate users' personally
    identifiable information. This can usually be done by emailing Customer Support at support at septicsystem dot com.
</p>

<h3>Notification of Changes</h3>
<p>
    If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes to this privacy
    statement, the homepage, and other places we deem appropriate so our users are
    always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what
    circumstances, if any, we disclose it.
</p>
<p>
    If, however, we are going to use users' personally identifiable information in a
    manner different from that stated at the time of collection we will notify
    users by posting a notice on our Web site for 30 days.
</p>

<h3>Contact Information</h3>
<p>
    If users have any questions or suggestions regarding our privacy policy, please
    contact us at: privacy at septicsystem dot com.
