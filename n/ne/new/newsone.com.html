	<h1>Privacy</h1>
<p><strong><em>Last revised November 11, 2011</em></strong></p>
<p>This website, together with a network of related content and social networking websites (each, a “Site,” and collectively, the “Company Sites”), is owned and operated by or on behalf of Radio One, Inc. (“Radio One”), Interactive One, LLC, Community Connect Inc., and/or certain other Radio One subsidiaries and affiliated companies (collectively, “Company,” “we,” “our,” or “us”). This Privacy Policy describes the type of information we may collect from you and how we may use and share that information. This Privacy Policy also explains the choices you can make about the ways this information is used by us.</p>
<p>Please read this Privacy Policy carefully. In addition, please review the Terms of Use provided at each Site, which governs your use of the Company Sites. By accessing and using any of the Company Sites (including, without limitation, any social networking features, communities or other interactive content offered on the Sites), you agree to accept the terms of this Privacy Policy and the Terms of Use provided on the Site. If you do not agree with these terms, please do not use the Site. Please note that certain features or services discussed in this Privacy Policy may not be offered on the Company Sites at any particular time.</p>
<h2>APPLICABILITY AND USER RESTRICTIONS</h2>
<p>Unless specifically stated otherwise, this Privacy Policy applies to information collected on the Company Sites, which also may be governed by separate or additional policies and does not apply to information about you collected by our affiliated providers, third party web sites (e.g., ad serving and tracking services), applications or offerings linked to or otherwise accessible from the Company Sites. The information collected or received by such affiliated providers and third parties is subject to their own respective privacy policies, which we encourage you to review. We are not responsible for compliance with other websites’ privacy policies or practices.</p>
<p>The Company Sites are not directed to children under the age of thirteen (13). In compliance with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (”COPPA”), we use reasonable commercial efforts to adhere to the prohibition on the collection of personal information online from children under the age of thirteen (13) without first obtaining verifiable parental consent. At a minimum, the Company Sites prohibit registration by, and will not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from, anyone under the age of thirteen (13). Company Site use and membership is void where prohibited by law.</p>
<h2>INFORMATION WE COLLECT AND HOW WE USE IT</h2>
<p>Whether you are a Company Site visitor or a registered member, we take certain steps to protect your information. Collection of information is usually grouped into two categories: Personal Information, which is information that is personally identifiable to a specific member (further defined below), and aggregate information, which is general demographic information that does not identify any individual member. We may use or disclose aggregate information for any purpose.</p>
<p>The Company adheres to the Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising (the “Principles”), developed by leading industry associations to apply consumer-friendly standards to online behavioral advertising across the Internet.&nbsp; To learn more about the Principles, please go to <a href="http://www.aboutads.info/">www.aboutads.info</a>.</p>
<h3>User Content</h3>
<p>Please note that whenever you publicly disclose information about yourself online (e.g., through email, social networking platforms, forums, message boards, chat areas, or similar web pages), such information may be collected, exported and used by people that you do not know. Posting personal information in public places may result in unsolicited communications, including unwanted email messages or other forms of contact. Always be smart about the information you provide online. We bear no responsibility for any action or policies of any third parties who collect any information you may disclose on the Company Sites.</p>
<h3>Personal Information</h3>
<p>As used in this Privacy Policy, “Personal Information” means personally identifiable information collected online about an individual, such as a first and last name, a physical street address, an e-mail address, a telephone number, a social security number, or any other information that permits the physical or online contacting of a specific individual.&nbsp; You can browse the Company Sites without telling us who you are or revealing any Personal Information about yourself. However, there are certain features and services (including social networking) that may not be available for your use without providing Personal Information. If you choose to provide us with Personal Information, you consent to the transfer and storage of that information on our servers.&nbsp; Further, you consent to e-mail or other marketing communications sent by us, unless you unsubscribe from such messages or opt-out, as described below.</p>
<h4>Registration</h4>
<p>Certain features and services of the Company Sites may require you to first complete a registration form and create a user name and password. During registration you are required to provide certain Personal Information. We may use this information to contact you about the services on our Site in which you have expressed interest. In addition to Personal Information collected for registration purposes, we may collect and store the following:</p>
<p>(a) your responses to the offerings and advertisements presented on the Sites;</p>
<p>(b) information about the Sites’ services or features that you use, and how frequently you use them;</p>
<p>(c) commercial transaction-related information (such as credit card or other preferred means of payment, billing or shipping information, or a history of products purchased through the Company Sites);</p>
<p>(d) your responses to or entries for surveys, sweepstakes, and contests and requests for services, products, newsletters or information;</p>
<p>(e) customer service information about you as a user of a Company Site, including any suggestions you submit to us for review;</p>
<p>(f) community discussions, chats, dispute resolution, correspondence through our Sites, and correspondence sent to us;</p>
<p>(g) your activity on the Company Sites, including adding a friend, sharing a photo or video, or accessing an application;</p>
<p>(h) your activity on certain third party sites or services for which you have consented to connect or share through your account on a Company Site;</p>
<p>(i) information from other companies, such as demographic and traffic data; and</p>
<p>(j) other information from your interaction with our Sites, services, content and advertising, including computer and/or mobile device connection and location information, browser type, statistics on page views, traffic to and from the sites, ad data, IP address and standard web log information.</p>
<h3>Profile and Preference Information</h3>
<p>So that you can make the most of our social networking features, your member name, profile photo and certain other profile information associated with your account with a Company Site or with any third party sites shared by you through a Company Site will not be private.&nbsp; Depending on your privacy settings, you can control other information shared on your member page.&nbsp; If you do not wish to share photos of yourself with other members, then delete them or do not post them.</p>
<p>We may combine information that you provide us with other information about you that we may obtain through your use of the Company Sites in order to provide promotions and marketing offers tailored to your preferences and to improve the content of the Company Sites for you.</p>
<h3>Cookies</h3>
<p>To enhance your experience with the Company Sites, we may use “cookies.” Cookies are small data files that we place in your computer’s browser when you visit the Company Sites. We may use cookies for a number of purposes, such as tracking usage patterns, measuring the effectiveness of advertising, to help serve advertisements, limiting multiple responses and registrations, facilitating your ability to navigate the Company Sites, and as part of a verification or screening process. Cookies automatically identify your web browser whenever you visit the Company Sites, help us determine which areas are popular and further personalize your experience on the Company Sites. If you do not wish to allow for use of cookies, you can generally opt-out of providing this information by setting your browser to reject cookies. However, please be aware that some areas of the Company Sites may not provide you with an acceptable user experience if you have disabled the use of cookies.&nbsp; Please refer to <a href="http://www.aboutads.info/">www.aboutads.info</a> for more information.</p>
<h3>Web Beacons and Similar Technologies</h3>
<p>The Company Sites and our e-mail messages may contain a small graphic image called a web beacon that monitors and collects certain limited information about the viewer of the web page or e-mail message. Web beacons typically are very small (generally 1-by-1 pixel) and invisible to the user, but, in general, any electronic image viewed as part of a web page or e-mail message, including an advertisement or HTML content, can act as a web beacon. We may use web beacons or similar technologies for a number of purposes, including without limitation, to count visitors to our web pages or to monitor how our users navigate the Company Sites, and we may include web beacons or similar technologies in e-mails in order to count how many e-mails (or particular articles, links, etc.) that we send are actually opened. Additionally, our advertising providers may use web beacons or similar technologies to personalize and measure the effectiveness of their advertisements using data gathered over time from users of the Company Sites.&nbsp; If you would like more information about the information collection practices of some of these third party advertising companies and to learn which of these companies allow you to opt out of this type of information collection, please click <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp">here</a>.</p>
<h3>IP Address and Log Files</h3>
<p>Upon visiting the Company Sites, we may collect and store your browser type and IP address to help diagnose problems with our server, to administer the Company Sites, to help identify and analyze user trends, to customize content and advertisements offered to you, and to gather broad demographic information for aggregate use.</p>
<h2>SHARING YOUR INFORMATION WITH THIRD PARTIES</h2>
<h3>Third Party Content</h3>
<p>When you are visiting the Company Sites, certain content may be served directly by third parties. This third party content may use cookies, web beacons, Javascript or other technologies. We do not have access to or control the use of such technology by third parties, including the information they collect or how they use such information.</p>
<h3>Applications and Websites</h3>
<h3>The Company does not own or operate certain applications or websites (e.g., games or tools) accessible through the Company Sites.&nbsp; As a result, when you use these third party applications or websites, we may share your information along with the location of your computer or mobile device to enable your use of such services and for age verification and security purposes, among other purposes.&nbsp; For example, the Company may offer you the option to connect your member profile and activity on the Company Sites with certain third party services such as Facebook, Foursquare or Twitter (“Third Party Services”).&nbsp; When you consent to publish your information or activity on the Company Sites to any Third Party Services, such information will be viewable by the communities on such Third Party Services and may be used by such Third Party Services in accordance with their posted privacy practices.&nbsp; Similarly, if another member in your friend list uses a third party application or website, it may receive your non-private member information so that you may be separately linked with your friend.&nbsp; If the application or website seeks any further information, your consent should be requested.&nbsp; We cannot guarantee that such applications or websites will follow our privacy practices, so we encourage you to always review their information sharing policies and to report any application or website that may be in violation of our privacy practices.</h3>
<h3>Online Shopping Services</h3>
<p>Company Sites may offer shopping services either directly or through a partner that operates a service under contract with us. If a Site offers shopping or other commercial services, the customer order form will ask you to provide certain Personal Information, including credit card or other payment data. The financial information that you provide will be used by the Company or its partners to bill you for products and services that you request and for any other uses to which you have consented. By giving the Site your payment data and related Personal Information, you are authorizing us to give that information to the merchant and credit card company and/or you are authorizing the Company’s partner directly to confirm and fulfill your order. In addition, the Company and/or its partners will use contact information from the order form to fulfill your orders and for customer service purposes. The Company will not otherwise use or distribute your financial information without your prior approval.</p>
<h3>Other Third Parties</h3>
<p>Our employees, agents and contractors must have a “need-to-know” business reason to obtain access to your Personal Information. We may share your Personal Information with those who help us manage or provide content or other services for the Company Sites (e.g., forum administration, order fulfillment, statistical analyses, data processing), or with outside contractors, agents or sponsors who help us with the administration, judging and prize fulfillment aspects of contests, promotions and sweepstakes. Such outside contractors, agents or sponsors may temporarily store some information on their servers, but they may only use your Personal Information to provide the Company Sites with a specific service and not for any other purpose. We may also provide your Personal Information to a third party where you have chosen to receive certain information and have been notified that the fulfillment of such a request requires sharing your Personal Information. We also may share your Personal Information with any affiliated companies and partners if we have a business reason to do so.</p>
<h3>Legal Compliance</h3>
<p>We may access or disclose your Personal Information without your consent in order to: (i) protect or defend our legal rights or property, including those of our affiliated companies or their employees, agents and contractors (including enforcement of our agreements); (ii) protect the safety and security of other users of the Company Sites or members of the public, including responding to claims that a listing or other content violates the rights of others, or protect anyone’s rights, property, or safety; (iii) protect against fraud or for risk management purposes; or (iv) comply with the law or legal process. In addition, if any Company Site is sold to or merges with another company not owned by or affiliated with Company, we may transfer your Personal Information to any acquiring or merging party as part of that transaction.</p>
<h2>YOUR PRIVACY CHOICES</h2>
<p>The following sub-headings apply only to those Company Sites for which user registration is available.</p>
<h3>Access to Personal Information</h3>
<p>You have the opportunity to correct, update or remove Personal Information you have provided to us at any time. Upon entering any Company Site, you may sign in using your previously issued login name and password. After signing in, click on “My Page” and you will have the option of either modifying or deleting your member profile settings through the “Edit Profile” or “My Account” links. If you have forgotten your login name or password, click the “Forgot your password?” link, and following verification, your login name and/or password will be sent to your email address.</p>
<h4>Activity Associated with Your Member Name</h4>
<p>Your member name is displayed to other members throughout the Company Sites and depending on your activity (e.g., blogging) on any Sites, may also be available to the public. All of your activity on our Sites is traceable to your member name. Therefore, if you associate your name with your member name, the people to whom you have revealed your name will be able to personally identify your Company Site activities.</p>
<h3>Opt-Out</h3>
<p>You may opt-out of receiving e-mail communications from us at any time by either following the instructions to unsubscribe within an email you receive from this Site or by logging in to your account and selecting “Email Alerts” under the “My Account” link. As explained above, if you choose not to provide us with information sought on registration or sign up forms, it is possible that you will not be able to access or use certain features of certain Company Sites.</p>
<h3>Your Member Profile</h3>
<p>When you register with certain Company Sites, you may set up your member profile, upload photos, provide additional information, search, add friends, send messages, perform searches and engage in other activities. Information transmitted during such activities is collected so that the Company may provide you with services and personalize certain features. Any content you post on the Company Sites is at your own risk. Certain privacy options exist on the Company Sites that allow you to limit access to your profile. However, such privacy options are not always available or perfect. We are not responsible for circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures contained on the Company Site. Furthermore, the Company cannot control the actions of third parties with whom you choose to share your profile or Personal Information. Because of the foregoing, the Company does not guarantee that any content or personal information you post on a Company Site will not be accessible by unauthorized persons. You understand and acknowledge that, even after removal, copies of your user content may remain viewable in cached and archived pages or if other users have copied or stored your user content.&nbsp; Any improper collection or misuse of information provided on any Company Site is a violation of the Site’s Terms of Use and should be reported to <a href="mailto:membersafetyteam@mail.blackplanet.com">membersafetyteam@mail.blackplanet.com</a>.</p>
<h3>Friend Referrals</h3>
<p>The Company Sites may allow you invite a friend to view or use certain features or services Company Sites, including online shopping services. To refer a friend, information including your friend’s email address is required. Such information is collected and stored to send this one-time invitation, to allow for your friend’s registration and to track the success of our referral program. Your friend may contact us at <a href="mailto:membersafetyteam@mail.blackplanet.com">membersafetyteam@mail.blackplanet.com</a> to request that we remove this information from our records.</p>
<h2>SECURITY OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION</h2>
<p>The Company employs reasonable security measures consistent with standard industry practice to secure information collected through the Company Sites. We also use internal protections to limit access to your Personal Information to only those people who need the information to perform a specific request. However, we cannot guarantee that your Personal Information will never be disclosed in a manner inconsistent with this Privacy Policy (e.g., as a result of unauthorized or otherwise unlawful third party access), and you transmit such information to us at your own risk.</p>
<h4>Account Protection</h4>
<p>Your member profile is password-protected so that you and only you have access to this information. Please use a unique combination of numbers, letters and special characters and do not disclose your Company Site password to anyone for greater protection. If you share your computer with other people, or use a publicly accessible computer, sign out of your account and close your browser window when you are done. If you do share your password or your Personal Information with others, remember that you are responsible for all actions taken under your member profile. If you lose control of your password, you may lose substantial control over your Personal Information and may be subject to legally binding actions taken on your behalf. If your password has been compromised for any reason, we encourage you to change it immediately or notify us to change your password on your behalf.</p>
<h4><strong>If Abuse Occurs</strong></h4>
<p>Although we make every effort to ensure that our e-mail list is safe, the Internet is such that we cannot guarantee that our list is invulnerable to attacks. If you believe there has been a breach of our security, please contact us at once at <a href="mailto:membersafetyteam@mail.blackplanet.com">membersafetyteam@mail.blackplanet.com</a>.</p>
<h2>CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY</h2>
<p>We reserve the right to change our Privacy Policy and our Terms of Use at any time. If we make changes, we will post them and will indicate at the top of this page the policy’s new effective date. We encourage you to refer to visit this Privacy Policy frequently to stay informed regarding our current privacy practices. Unless stated otherwise, our current Privacy Policy applies to all information that we have about you and your activity on our Company Sites.<br>
As the owner of this Site, the Company retains all ownership rights to the information collected at this Site. In the event the Company goes through a business transition, such as a merger, acquisition by another company, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, your Personal Information will likely be among the assets transferred.</p>
<h2>CONTACTING US</h2>
<p>If you have any additional questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy, please feel free to contact us any time by email at <a href="mailto:membersafetyteam@mail.blackplanet.com">membersafetyteam@mail.blackplanet.com</a> or at Privacy Request, c/o Interactive One LLC, 850 Third Avenue, Third Floor, New York, NY 10022, USA.</p>

Saint Heron's dream team -- Saada Ahmed, Marjon Carlos, Christina Coleman, Diane &quot;Shabazz&quot; Varnie and Elise Peterson -- have created a digital space dedicated to the exploration of music, culture, politics, style and whatever else tickles their fancy.

Marjon Carlos (@ladypantsbklyn), Arts and Culture Editor 1. Her writing is sickening and has appeared in Lurve, Vogue Italia, HuffPost (woot woot!) and her amazing blog.  2.

She wears green lipstick (and pretty much everything else) like a bawse!    Elise Peterson (@currentlyelise), Music Features Editor 1. Beyond Saint Heron, she's also a graphic design student at Parsons and assistant art director and writer for neonV magazine.  2. She's got incredible tightrope walking/balancing skills!  3.

Beyonce travelled to Egypt back in 2009 during her I Am... Tour. Shortly after the superstar stopped by the pyramids, she was bashed by Dr. Zahi Hawass, otherwise known as &quot;Egypt's Indiana Jones.&quot; The Egyptologist allegedly referred to the &quot;Love On Top&quot; singer as a &quot;stupid person&quot; who &quot;doesn't understand a thing&quot; and only went there to take photos, BET reported at the time, via local newspapers.   Hawass also cut short her tour of the iconic Egyptian site, according to a new interview.   &quot;Most people I take on tours are very nice and we become friends. But this lady...,&quot; Hawass recently told the Independent of Beyonce's visit to the pyramids. &quot;She said she would come at 3 p.m. but she came late. I said 'You have to say I'm sorry I'm late.' But she didn't open her mouth.&quot;   &quot;I brought a photographer and she also had a photographer and a guard,&quot; he added. &quot;When my photographer started to shoot, he said 'No, Stop! I am the one who says yes or no, not you.' I said, 'In that case since you almost hit my photographer and you are not polite - out! I am not giving you the privilege of having you on my tour.' I said Beyonce was stupid and I left.&quot;  Hawass, who was once the Egyptian antiques minister, is a controversial figure.   Although he has been commended for boosting interest in archaeology in the region, his credibility has come into question, and he has been criticized for his love of publicity. In 2011, he was fired because of his relationship with ousted President Hosni Mubarak's regime, The Associated Press reported.   He came under investigation for various indiscretions -- corruption, wasting public funding and shipping Egyptian antiques overseas without permission, opening them up to theft -- according to the Smithsonian magazine. He was also banned from traveling outside of the country.">Beyonce Reportedly Booted From Egyptian Pyramids For Being 'Rude'</a></li><li><a class="rsswidget" href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/11/27/merrill_n_4350601.html?utm_hp_ref=black-voices&amp;ir=Black+Voices" title="“I’ll give you as much time as you want,” George McReynolds drawls, leaning back in his chair in his Nashville office">Meet The Man Who Took On Merrill Lynch's Race Problem</a></li><li><a class="rsswidget" href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/rev-meg-riley/for-white-people-who-cant_b_4350036.html?utm_hp_ref=black-voices&amp;ir=Black+Voices" title="Yet another white person said to me yesterday, &quot;I'm not sure I can go see 12 Years a Slave.  It just sounds too painful to watch, and I wonder, why would I want to pay a babysitter so I can be in agony for two hours?&quot;  I've been having these conversations, and watching white friends say this on Facebook, since the movie came out.  And here's what I say in response, sometimes out loud and sometimes just in my mind.   (I try not to give long speeches on facebook.)  First of all:   I hate violent movies, too.  My system is very sensitive, too.   I already believe that slavery sucks, too.  Second:  Like you, I've read blogs and comments from African-Americans who are sick of movies re-telling the story of victimization and brutality against them.  I don't know if I would have seen, or liked, the movie if I were African-American.  I'm speaking as a white person here, the only voice I've got.  Third:  I went with dread, and with a friend whose hand I gripped so hard that she finally withdrew it.  I went with the intention to close my eyes during the most violent scenes.  And I carried out that intention.  But I went.  And I am, in my deepest self, glad that I went.  The movie profoundly touched something in me that needed to be touched.  Two weeks after seeing the film, I still wake up in the morning and check out reality carefully, as I would touch a sore tooth with my tongue, as I have woken up after someone has died or I've needed to incorporate some other piece of shocking news.  In times of integrating something big and awful into my whole being, I often wake up thinking, &quot;Something's wrong.  What is it?&quot;  And in this case, what has gotten into my system in a new, visceral, cellular level, is that racism is wrong.  Is that racism and unconscious white privilege are radically, red level blinking light, call 911, wrong.  Hold the presses, stop business as usual, put down your remote control and listen wrong.  Not just before the Emancipation Proclamation, but now.  I've been &quot;thinking about&quot; racism my whole life; giving it serious and sustained thought for almost thirty years now.  Twenty-some years ago, interning in a predominantly black church in Roxbury, Mass., I even figured out that I am white!  By that I mean, I learned that the faith I named universal, the cultural markers I presumed without reflection, were all grounded in whiteness.  That was a time of disintegration and re-formation for me, and some part of me said, &quot;Now I've got it!&quot;  But truth be told, my awareness of my whiteness is kind of like what the child-development specialist, Jean Piaget, discovered about object impermanence with infants:  When they see their mom, their mom exists.  When they don't see her, she exists no longer.  On a daily basis, on an hourly basis, on a moment to moment basis, I forget that I am white.   12 Years a Slave brought into my body, into those same tiny cells that each replicate Piaget's object impermanence, a visceral, nauseated, horrified remembering of how American history unfolded, of how it will continue to unfold until we face it head on.  Until white people are willing to bear it.  Since watching 12 Years a Slave, when I see yet another story of an African-American man jailed mistakenly and needing to fight for years or decades to get back out of prison, I find myself thinking, &quot;12 Years a Prisoner.&quot;  When I read about immigrant parents torn from their children and deported, images of a keening slave mother come to me.  And it's not just a thought in my head; I now feel that place of nausea and rage and profound grief that the movie took me to -- these stories have a new place in my body, and in my soul, to sink in.  And with that sinking in comes new energy for struggle and resistance.  12 Years A Slave shows slavery's brutality through the full humanity of those who endured it.  The beauty of Spanish moss and sunsets, the complexity of human faces, the endurance of caring hearts, the joy of work well done, slave kids playing and adults singing, all co-exist with slavery. The generosity of the film is staggering -- it even lifts up the pain and suffering of the privileged people as well as the enslaved ones.  The cinematography, the acting, the story itself, the soundtrack -- this is art at its finest.  I am grateful that movie producers finally believed the story was worthy of the resources needed to tell it well.  Many have said that the purpose of religion is to grow a soul.  What I long for most as a white person is a bold movement of white people who grow souls deep enough to feel the brutality that was and is inflicted in our names, who stand in solidarity with people of color and resist, who know that our humanity resides elsewhere besides privilege.    It felt good to sit in a theatre with people who were willing to hold that brutality with me, all of us mute through the credits.  Now, may the millions of Americans who have seen this movie use our grief and anger to stop the very real slaveries that dominate our national  and global landscape today.">For White People Who Can't Bear to See '12 Years a Slave'</a></li></ul></li><li id="text-18" class="widgetcontainer widget_text"><h3 class="widgettitle">Featured Video</h3>			<div class="textwidget">		<iframe src="http://player.theplatform.com/p/BCY3OC/VplzXks7iL2B/embed/select/0ZbK6GnhypM_?autoPlay=true&amp;playAll=true&amp;mute=true" width="290" height="163" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="">Your browser does not support iframes.</iframe>

As the saying goes, &quot;birds of a feather flock together.&quot;   So, Ms. Knowles decided to tap her close friends, who are highly successful and talented professionals in their own right, to head her newly launch website, SaintHeron.com. The result: pure unadulterated dopeness.   Saint Heron's dream team -- Saada Ahmed, Marjon Carlos, Christina Coleman, Diane &quot;Shabazz&quot; Varnie and Elise Peterson -- have created a digital space dedicated to the exploration of music, culture, politics, style and whatever else tickles their fancy. But beyond producing amazing stories, these ladies have swoon-worthy personal style and swag for days. We've already double-tapped half the photos on their Instagram feeds. Legit.   Open Ceremony's Mecca James Williams recently caught up with the gaggle of gals to get the scoop on their passions, favorite music and what their futures might hold. That interview in turn inspired us to share some of the things we learned about the woman and wax poetic about why we just added them to our list of girl crushes!   Check 'em out...   Saada Ahmed (@saadahmedny), Content Editor  1. She's also the co-mastermind behind the super cool &quot;Everyday People&quot; brunches in NYC...aka the hottest day party in town.  2. She's not a writer, but she helped round up this amazing roster of ladies. And her favorite artist is Aaliyah.  3. Her swagger is on one hundred thousand trillion!    Marjon Carlos (@ladypantsbklyn), Arts and Culture Editor 1. Her writing is sickening and has appeared in Lurve, Vogue Italia, HuffPost (woot woot!) and her amazing blog.  2. As you'd expect from her moniker &quot;Lady Pants,&quot; this chick knows how to dress. I mean, just LOOK.  3. Do yourself a favor and read her story: Sportin’ Waves: The Rise of Baby Hair in Fashion. It's epic.    Christina Coleman (@ChrissyCole), News Editor 1. She's also the news and politics editor at Global Grind and even writes a bit for NASA. #supersmartsista 2. THIS hair. Enough said.  3. Check out some of this lady's work and thank us later. Click HERE and THERE.     Diane &quot;Shabazz&quot; Varnie (@_kingshabazz_), Music News Editor 1. She's also the founder/CEO of Electric Circus &quot;an entertainment, fashion and lifestyle boutique that focuses brand development and consultation via publicity, marketing, promotion and management strategies to maximize the spotlight and consciousness of clients.&quot; #Boom  2. New York City has her to thank for the introduction to Trinidad James and The Migos -- she put on their first NYC shows.  3. She wears green lipstick (and pretty much everything else) like a bawse!    Elise Peterson (@currentlyelise), Music Features Editor 1. Beyond Saint Heron, she's also a graphic design student at Parsons and assistant art director and writer for neonV magazine.  2. She's got incredible tightrope walking/balancing skills!  3. Check out her great story on singer Jhené Aiko HERE.   And here's the lovely lady who helped bring them all together... ">Solange's Best Friends Are Talented, Smart And Super Stylish.

Beyonce travelled to Egypt back in 2009 during her I Am... Tour. Shortly after the superstar stopped by the pyramids, she was bashed by Dr. Zahi Hawass, otherwise known as &quot;Egypt's Indiana Jones.&quot; The Egyptologist allegedly referred to the &quot;Love On Top&quot; singer as a &quot;stupid person&quot; who &quot;doesn't understand a thing&quot; and only went there to take photos, BET reported at the time, via local newspapers.   Hawass also cut short her tour of the iconic Egyptian site, according to a new interview.   &quot;Most people I take on tours are very nice and we become friends. But this lady...,&quot; Hawass recently told the Independent of Beyonce's visit to the pyramids. &quot;She said she would come at 3 p.m. but she came late. I said 'You have to say I'm sorry I'm late.' But she didn't open her mouth.&quot;   &quot;I brought a photographer and she also had a photographer and a guard,&quot; he added. &quot;When my photographer started to shoot, he said 'No, Stop! I am the one who says yes or no, not you.' I said, 'In that case since you almost hit my photographer and you are not polite - out! I am not giving you the privilege of having you on my tour.' I said Beyonce was stupid and I left.&quot;  Hawass, who was once the Egyptian antiques minister, is a controversial figure.   Although he has been commended for boosting interest in archaeology in the region, his credibility has come into question, and he has been criticized for his love of publicity. In 2011, he was fired because of his relationship with ousted President Hosni Mubarak's regime, The Associated Press reported.   He came under investigation for various indiscretions -- corruption, wasting public funding and shipping Egyptian antiques overseas without permission, opening them up to theft -- according to the Smithsonian magazine. He was also banned from traveling outside of the country.">Beyonce Reportedly Booted From Egyptian Pyramids For Being 'Rude'</a></li><li><a class="rsswidget" href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/11/27/merrill_n_4350601.html?utm_hp_ref=black-voices&amp;ir=Black+Voices" title="“I’ll give you as much time as you want,” George McReynolds drawls, leaning back in his chair in his Nashville office">Meet The Man Who Took On Merrill Lynch's Race Problem</a></li></ul></li><li id="ione-rss-9" class="widgetcontainer widget_ione-rss"><h5 class="widgettitle"><a class="rsswidget" href="http://www.aol.com/" title="Pipes Output">AOL</a></h5><ul><li><a class="rsswidget" href="http://on.aol.com/video/all-natural-beauty-tips-using-items-found-in-your-kitchen-518028442" title="Save money and time with these all natural household items you already own.">All Natural Beauty Tips Using Items Found In Your Kitchen</a></li><li><a class="rsswidget" href="http://on.aol.com/video/perfect--affordable-winter-vacation-getaway-ideas-518028444" title="Get away from the cold with these great vacation destinations.">Perfect, Affordable Winter Vacation Getaway Ideas</a></li><li><a class="rsswidget" href="http://on.aol.com/video/nasty-weather-making-holiday-travel-plans-problematic-518028443" title="On the day before the busiest travel day of the year, many are scrabbling to get of town before severe weather strikes.">Nasty Weather Making Holiday Travel Plans Problematic</a></li><li><a class="rsswidget" href="http://on.aol.com/video/terry-mcmillan-on-immigration--marco-rubio-is-an-uncle-tom-517938767" title="Terry McMillan joins HuffPost Live to share her thoughts on immigration, and Marco Rubio.">Terry McMillan On Immigration: 'Marco Rubio Is An Uncle Tom'</a></li></ul></li><li id="ione-rss-8" class="widgetcontainer widget_ione-rss"><h5 class="widgettitle"><a class="rsswidget" href="http://www.newser.com/" title="Newser - Top Stories">Newser</a></h5><ul><li><a class="rsswidget" href="http://www.newser.com/story/178258/the-nsa-is-tracking-peoples-porn-habits.html?utm_source=part&amp;utm_medium=newsone&amp;utm_campaign=rss" title="Forget email and phone data, the NSA is officially spying on something people really want to keep private: their porn history.
