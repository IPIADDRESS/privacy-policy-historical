<h2>5.2 Our suppliers and service providers</h2>
<p>We may disclose your information to our third party service providers, agents, subcontractors and other organisations for the purpose of providing products and/or services to us or directly to you on our behalf. These third parties may include cloud services providers (for hosting and email management), advertising agencies, administrative services or supplementary third parties that provide additional services to us.</p>
<p>When we use third party service providers, we only disclose personal information that is necessary for them to provide their service. We have a contract in place that requires them to protect your information and not to use it other than in accordance with our specific instructions and requests.</p>
<h2>5.3 Third parties </h2>
<p>We may also disclose your personal information to third parties in the following circumstances:</p>
<ul>
<li>If we sell or buy any business or assets, in which case we may need to disclose certain personal data to the prospective seller or buyer of such business or assets.</li>
<li>If all or most of our assets are acquired by a third party, in which case personal data held by us about our customers will be one of the transferred assets.</li>
<li>If we are under a duty to disclose or share your personal data in order to comply with any legal obligation, or in order to enforce any legal agreement we have with you; or to protect our rights or property, or the safety of us, our customers, or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organisations for the purposes of fraud protection and credit risk reduction.</li>
</ul>
<p>New Scientist collects information from you in two ways: directly from your input and automatically from your use.</p>
<h2>a. Information you provide</h2>
<p>The types of personal information that New Scientist collects directly from you may include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Contact details, such as your name, email address, postal address and telephone number;</li>
<li>Usernames and passwords;</li>
<li>Job details and other professional background information;</li>
<li>Comments, feedback and other information that you submit to New Scientist; and</li>
<li>Interests and communications preferences.</li>
</ul>
<p>We may, with your consent, tell you about products and services supplied by third parties. In these cases, your personal data is never disclosed. We will send you information about a product and/or service on behalf of a partner., Our partners never receive any information about you, unless you choose to correspond with them directly after you have received the communication from New Scientist.</p>
<h2>6. Where we Store your Personal Information </h2>
<p>Due to the global nature of the produts and services we offer, it may be necessary for the information that you provide us to be be reassigned to countries outside of the European Economic Area (EEA). This may happen where any of our group companies are incorporated in a country outside of the EEA, or if any of our servers or our third party service providers are situated in a country outside of the EEA. </p>
<p>If we do transfer your information outside of the EEA, we will always take necessary steps to ensure that appropriate security measures are taken so that your privacy rights continue to be protected, as detailed in this policy. These steps include imposing contractual obligations on the recipient of your personal data and ensuring that recipients are subscribed to  recognised ‘international frameworks’ that ensure the same protection. </p>
<p>If you use our services whilst you are outside the EEA, your personal data may be transferred outside the EEA, in order for us to provide you with the services.</p>
<h2>7. How Long we Keep your Personal Information For</h2>
<p>The duration of time that we retain your collected personal data is determined by us, in a reasonable manner, based on a number of factors. These include the purpose for which we use the information and our obligations under other laws.</p>
<p>We only preserve personal data in an identifiable format for the period of time that is necessary.</p>
<p>Your personal information may be required to establish, bring or defend legal claims. In this case, we retain your personal data for 7 years after the last occasion on which we used the information in one of the ways that is specified in How we use your personal information in Section 4.</p>
<p>The only exceptions to this are where:</p>
<ul>
<li>the law requires us to retain your personal data for a longer period, or to delete it sooner;</li>
<li>you exercise your right to have the information deleted (where it applies) and we do not need to retain it in connection with any of the reasons permitted in this section 7;</li>
<li>we may need to retain your personal data where this is necessary to comply with our legal or regulatory obligations, or to protect the vital interests of another natural person.</li>
</ul>

<h2>9. Security / Cookies / Links / Social Plugins</h2>
<h2>9.1 Security measures we put in place to protect your personal information</h2>
<p>The companies within New Scientist use technical and organisational security measures to protect all personal information that is supplied by you and managed by us against manipulation, loss, destruction, and access by any third party. We are continually improving our security measures in line with advancements in technological developments.</p>
<p>The transmission of information via the internet is unfortunately not completely secure. Although we will do our best to safeguard and protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee the security of your information whilst it is in transit to our website, and all transmission is at your own risk.</p>
<p>Where you have chosen a password that enables you to access an account, you are solely responsible for keeping this password private and confidential. We request that you not to share your password with anyone.</p>
<h2>9.2 Use of ‘cookies’</h2>
<p>‘Cookies’ are small files of information that are directly sent to your device and are stored on its hard drive to allow our websites to recognise you whenever you visit.<br>
Further information on the cookies that we use and their features can be found in our Cookie Policy.</p>
<h2>9.3 Links to other websites</h2>
<p>Our website may contain links to other websites and applications (Apps)  that are operated by other organisations that we do not control. This policy does not apply to those other websites and Apps. We strongly advise you to read their privacy terms and statements. We are not responsible for the privacy policies and practices of other websites and Apps, even if you access them using the links that we have provided. The links to these websites are solely provided for your information and convenience. We disclaim all liability and responsibility for their content, privacy practices and terms of use, and we make no endorsements, representations or promises about their accuracy, content or diligence. All disclosure of personal information to third party websites is at your own risk.</p>
<p>Additionally, if you have linked to our website from a third party website, we cannot be responsible for the privacy policies and practices of the owners and operators of that third party website. We recommend that you check the policy of the third party website.</p>
<h2>9.4 Social plugins</h2>
<p>We use the social plugins (buttons) of popular social networks like Facebook, Google+ and Twitter.</p>
<p>When you visit our websites these buttons are deactivated by default. This means that you do not need to intervene in order to stop your personal data being sent to the respective social networks. To use these buttons you must activate them by clicking on them. They will remain active until you deactivate them or you delete your cookies. Please view Cookies in Section 9.2 for further information regarding our use of cookies.</p>
<p>After activation, the server of the respective social network establishes a direct link. The contents of the social plugins button are then transmitted from the social network directly to your browser, and are then incorporated in our website. Following activiation, the social network can retrieve data independently of whether you interact with the button or not. A social network cannot assign a visit to any websites that are operated by our other group companies unless, and until, you activate the respective button.</p>
<p>If you are a member of a social network and you do not wish it to combine the data that has been retrieved from your visit to our websites with your personal membership data of that social network, you must log out from the social network before activating the buttons. We have no influence over the range of data that is collected by the social networks via their buttons. The information on the purpose and extent of the collected data can be found in the data use policies of the relevant social networks. </p>
