        <h1>NewsletterDirectory Privacy Policy</h1>
        <!-- id="topContainer" -->
        <p>This NewsletterDirectory Privacy Policy is effective February 1, 2012. </p>
        <p>Last modified: February 27, 2012 </p>
        
<p>Welcome to the NewsletterDirectory.co web site (the "Website"). The Website is an internet
property of LaunchBit, Inc. ("LaunchBit", "we" or "us"). This Privacy Policy describes
how we treat the information we collect when you visit our Website. Please read this
notice carefully.</p>

<h3>I. PERSONAL INFORMATION</h3>
<p>When you visit our Website and you provide us with your personal information such
as email address, your name, zip code and telephone number, we will not disclose that
personal information to any third party without your consent, except to a third party
as required, that might assist us to help us distribute correspondence from us to you.
However, in order to cooperate with legitimate governmental requests, subpoenas, or
court orders, to protect NewsletterDirectory and/or NewsletterDirectory’s customers and/or partners, or to
ensure the integrity and operation of NewsletterDirectory and/or NewsletterDirectory’s business and systems,
we may access and disclose any information we consider necessary or appropriate under
the circumstances.</p>
<p>Please note that we do not consider aggregated information, from which personally
identifiable information has been removed, to be personal information. We may share
the aggregated information about our users for any business purpose, such as analyzing
usage trends and seeking compatible advertisers and partners.</p>
<p>In addition, when you visit our Website, our web server may automatically recognize
your domain name. We collect the domain name and monitor general site use and traffic
patterns to improve our Website and the products and services we offer. We also may
use web server logs to collect data for metric purposes. Examples of the types of data
collected on the logs are IP addresses, referral pages, date and time of Site access, and
Site visited. We may use collected data to customize the content and/or layout of our
pages for each individual visitor.</p>

<h3>II. CHOICE/OPT-OUT</h3>
<p>If we ever send you information by e-mail concerning new products or services that you
did not expressly request, we will provide you with an e-mail address by which you may
request no future notices.</p>

<h3>III. COOKIES AND/OR TRACERS</h3>
<p>Cookies are small data files placed on your hard drive by a website server when you
visit. We may use cookies for tracking purposes or to make our Website easier to use.
Cookies are currently the only way to effectively identify a unique anonymous visitor
and understand how they navigate our web site. An anonymous visitor to our site remains
anonymous in all cases. We do not attempt to identify visitors if they do not voluntarily
submit personal information to us. With most internet browsers, you can erase cookies
from your computer hard drive, block all cookies, or receive a warning before a cookie is
stored. Cookies offer enhanced functionality to the user, but whether you allow a cookie
to be placed on your computer is up to you!</p>
<p>In some instances, we may use tracking scripts or "tracers" that recognize a unique
identifier from a cookie placed on your hard drive by another website. These are used by
us solely to gauge the success of our own advertising. For instance, we may use a tracer
to determine whether you visit our employment pages after visiting a resume or career
site where we placed a banner ad. We do not use tracers to gather information on your
use of the internet unrelated to us. We may also use your Internet Protocol ("IP") address,
which is usually associated with the place from which you enter the Internet, such as your
Internet Service Provider, your company or your university, to help diagnose problems
with our server, gather broad demographic information, serve you more relevant offers
and administer our Website. Please note that we do not use tracers to identify your
personal information, and you remain anonymous unless and until you choose to identify
yourself.</p>

<h3>IV. SECURITY</h3>
<p>We do not treat your general interaction with NewsletterDirectory.co (e.g., submission of
suggestions) as confidential. Any information you submit will be treated as non-
confidential. Note that most internet browsers also offer security alerts that permit you to
determine whether your transmissions are protected.</p>

<h3>V. THIRD PARTY ADVERTISING</h3>
<p>Some of the ads appearing on this Website are delivered to you by our web advertising
partners. Information about your visit to their site, such as number of times you have
viewed an ad (but not your name, address or other personal information), is used to serve
ads to you.</p>

<h3>VIII. CHILDREN</h3>
<p>NewsletterDirectory is not intended for use by children, especially those under age 13. No one
under age 13 is allowed to use the Website, provide any personal information or receive
our email distributions. Minors between the ages of 13 and 17 must get the permission of
their parent(s)or legal guardian(s) before viewing the Website or receiving emails.</p>

<h3>IX. LINKS TO OTHER SITES</h3>	
<p>As part of the service, NewsletterDirectory may create links allowing you to access third party
sites. NewsletterDirectory is not responsible for the content that appears on those sites and does
not endorse these sites. Please consult those sites' individual privacy policies in order to
determine how they treat user information.</p>

<h3>XI. MODIFICATION TO THIS POLICY</h3>
<p>We reserves the right to change this policy from time to time; however, all changes
will be posted to this Privacy Policy at the time such changes are made. The date of the
most recent revisions will appear on this page so please check back. If you continue to
access this Website that will constitute your acceptance of any changes or revisions to the
Privacy Policy.</p>

<p>Thank you for taking the time and interest to review our policies at NewsletterDirectory. If you have concerns or questions about any aspect of this Privacy Policy, please email us at hello [at] newsletterdirectory [dot] co. We welcome your questions and feedback.</p>

<p>Thank you.</p>
