<p>
   (We’ll use the words ‘data’ and ‘information’ interchangeably.)
</p>
<p>
   Unless otherwise stated below, NewsNow Publishing Limited (“<strong>NewsNow</strong>”, “<strong>we</strong>”,
   “<strong>us</strong>” or “<strong>our</strong>”) is the data controller of the personal data that we 
   collect and process. For details on how to contact our Data Protection Officer, please see <a href="#h9">section 9</a> below.
</p>
<p>
   Where indicated, we contract third parties to process data on our behalf. These third parties act as data processors, which means 
   that they act only on our instructions and are not authorised to share the data that they process for us with anyone else, and that
   we remain the controller of such data.
</p>
<p>
   By continuing to use any of our sites, you acknowledge our collection, storage and use of your personal information as 
   described below.
</p>


<p><a name="h2"></a></p>
<h2>
   2 The data we collect about you
</h2>
<p>
   The term “<strong>personal data</strong>”, or “<strong>personal information</strong>”, means any information
   about an individual from which that person can be identified.  It does not include data where the identity has been removed 
   (i.e. anonymous data).
</p>
<p>
   We may collect, use, store and transfer different kinds of personal data about you in the following circumstances:
</p>
<h3>
   When you visit our sites
</h3>
<p>
   Our sites include <a href="http://www.NewsNow.co.uk">http://www.NewsNow.co.uk</a>, <a href="http://mobile.NewsNow.co.uk">
   http://mobile.NewsNow.co.uk</a>, <a href="http://www.NewsNow.it">http://www.NewsNow.it</a>, 
   <a href="http://mobile.NewsNow.it/">http://mobile.NewsNow.it/</a>, and any other sites we might launch in the future 
   (“<strong>sites</strong>”).
</p>
<p>
   They also include NewsNow Classifieds, our classified ad aggregation service, available at 
   <a href="http://www.NewsNow.co.uk/classifieds/">http://www.NewsNow.co.uk/classifieds/</a>.
</p>
<p>
   They do not include sites we link to that are owned and/or operated by third parties. We are not responsible and accept no 
   liability for the privacy practices of such sites or other services. This Privacy Policy applies only to our own sites 
   and services.
</p>
<h4>
   Website functionality
</h4>
<p>
   We aim to provide our users with useful services through site functionality, some of which depends on our collecting and storing information relating to your preferences or browsing behaviour. 
</p>
<p>
   When you are not signed into a NewsNow account, we store this in persistent cookies on your web browser. 
</p>
<p>
   When you are signed into a NewsNow account, we store some of this information on our servers instead, in a manner that links it to your NewsNow account, so that it can be shared between different devices from which you have signed in.
</p>
<h3>
   Cookies more generally
</h3>
<p>For further details of how we use cookies on our site, please see our <a href="/privacy/cookies/">
   Cookie Policy</a>.</p>
<h3>
   Children’s data
</h3>
<p>
   Our sites are not aimed at under-18s. Some content that is accessible on or via our sites will not be appropriate for children
   under the age of 18.
</p>
<h3>
   Special data
</h3>
<p>
   We do not seek to collect any special categories of personal data about you: those would include details about your race or 
   ethnicity, religious or philosophical beliefs, sex life, sexual orientation, political opinions, trade union membership, 
   information about your health and genetic and biometric data. Nor do we seek to collect any information about criminal 
   convictions and offences.  If, however, when using any interactive feature of the site (such as an online contact form), you 
   in fact provide us with any such special data or information about criminal convictions and offences, then by submitting such 
   data/information, we’ll assume that you are fine with our use of such data/information for (a) the purpose for which
   you have voluntarily provided such data/information and (b) any purpose that is reasonably compatible with such purpose. You
   may withdraw that permission at any time by contacting us: please see <a href="#h9">section 9</a> below for our contact details.
</p>
<h3>
   If you fail to provide personal data
</h3>
<p>
   Where we need to collect personal data by law, or under the terms of a contract that we have with you and you fail to provide
   that data when requested, we may not be able to perform the contract that we have or are trying to enter into with you (for 
   example, to provide you with services). If so, we shall notify you if this is the case at the time.
</p>


<p><a name="h3"></a></p>
<h2>
   3 How we use your personal data
</h2>
<p>
   We shall only use your personal data when the law allows us to do so.
</p>
<p>
   We have set out below a description of all the ways that we plan to use your personal data, and which of the legal bases we
   rely on to do so. We have also identified what our legitimate interests are where
   appropriate.
</p>
<p>
   Please note that we may process your personal data for more than one legal ground depending on the specific purpose for which 
   we are using your data. Please contact us if you need details about the specific legal ground that we are relying on to process
   your personal data where more than one ground has been set out below.
</p>
<h3>
   Processing purposes
</h3>
<h4>
   <a name="h3-1"></a>
   Analytics and web logs
</h4>
<p>
   When you visit our sites, we use analytics tools to collect, store and analyse standard web log data, which includes the web 
   page you have requested, the web page from which you clicked a link to NewsNow (if applicable), your computer’s public 
   IP address, your web browser’s name and version number, and your device’s operating system, and any cookies we have 
   stored when you have previously accessed our sites (if you haven’t configured your browser to refuse to store them).
</p>
<p>
   In order to diagnose bugs, to gain a better understanding of usage patterns, and to identify and block abusive patterns of 
   access, our analytics tools generate and store a unique browser identifier in a persistent cookie on your browser, which we log
   with each web page you request. This lets us distinguish unique users and link the log data we collect when you visit the site,
   with the log data from your previous and subsequent visits.
</p>
<p>
   Our log data are only collected and processed in a way that does not identify anyone. We do not make any attempt to link this 
   data to any personally identifiable information you might give us when submitting an online enquiry, subscribing to our 
   newsletter, or signing up for or into a NewsNow account (except as NewsNow account features require – see below).
</p>
<p>
   We operate an in-house analytics tool as well as a third-party analytics tool called Google Analytics, a service run by Google
   acting under contract as a data processor. Your IP address is anonymised when processed by Google Analytics. We store your full
   IP address in our in-house web logs to allow us to identify and block abusive patterns of access. We also determine your country
   and city from your IP address, to understand usage patterns.
</p>
<p>
   We retain our own in-house web log data records for around 30 days. Google Analytics does not allow us to access individual web
   log records. We retain aggregated and anonymised log data indefinitely in our in-house analytics tool and in Google Analytics.
</p>
<p>
   You can opt out of data collection by Google Analytics by installing the Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on, supplied by
   Google here: <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
   https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/</a>.
</p>
<p>
   We use those tools to allow us to diagnose bugs when they occur, to identify and block abusive patterns of access in order to
   maintain the security and performance of our sites, and to improve our services through understanding usage patterns.

</p>
<p>
   We retain such personally identifying data as long as necessary to provide the service you’ve requested. After you have
   unsubscribed from all email alerts, we will retain such data for around 30 days (except when you have provided a password, in 
   which case we will retain such data for 6 months). NB: we will unsubscribe you from all email alerts if we have seen no activity

   When you apply for employment at NewsNow, you do so in anticipation of potentially entering into a contract between 
   yourself and NewsNow.
</p>
<p>
   In connection with that, we request and process various personal data.
</p>
<p>
   During the application process we will collect, use and store your data for a number of main purposes. We request and process 
   your email address and telephone number so that we may initiate and maintain contact with you during the recruitment process. 
   We request your CV, to assess the experience you have which may be relevant for the role. We request a covering letter, to 
   assess your interest in and suitability for the role. We may ask you to complete exercises, to attend interviews, and to submit
   references, all of which are also intended to assess your suitability for the position.
</p>
<p>
   We retain your application data while processing your application.
</p>
<p>
   If you are successful in your application to join the team at NewsNow, we will request further information from you, full 
   details of which will be made available at the time.
</p>
<p>
   If you are unsuccessful, we will retain your application data on file for up to three years to allow us to process any future 
   application you might submit to us more efficiently, to ensure we are in compliance with appropriate and legal selection 
   processes, and (with your consent)  to  contact you again with regard to other suitable roles we may have in the future.
</p>
<p>
   At the time you submit your application online, we will also collect some standard analytics and web log data (as explained above)
   and we may use it to process your request more efficiently, but we do not collect any data that would allow us to link your 
   application to any other web log records of your use of our websites.

   Online advertising
</h4>
<p>
   We may serve personalised advertising content on web pages that you visit on the site, in which case we and/or our ad network
   partners may use personal data relating to you to generate such personalised advertising content.
</p>
<p>
   Please note that our operations are funded by online advertising. We work directly with many firms (partners) to get the best
   value from our ad space. Some, known as ‘exchanges’, resell our ad space in a global market of products and services of
   brands and retailers, through their own direct relationships with those brands/retailers or other firms that represent them. 
   Other partners provide us with other services, such as ad serving.
</p>
<p>
   Our exchange partners may perform some of the following activities:
   </p><ul>
      <li>
         Collecting and processing information about your use of our sites with the aim of subsequently personalising advertising
         for you on our sites, or in other contexts, such as on other sites or apps. Typically, the pages of our site that you 
         access are used to make inferences about your interests, which when combined together (to create a profile) inform 
         future selection of advertising.
      </li>
      <li>
         Selecting and delivering advertisements to you. This includes using contextual information about the pages of our site
         that you access, which may be combined with previously collected information about you to select ads.
      </li>
      <li>
         Measurement of delivery and performance of ads and user activity, which includes processing data about what ads were 
         shown, how often they were shown, when and where they were shown, and whether you took any action related to the ad, 
         such as clicking an ad or making a purchase.
      </li>
   </ul>
<p></p>
<p>
   Our partners, in performing any of the above activities, do so where either they have independently obtained consent (which 
   we may have facilitated) or have established a legal basis other than consent for those activities.
</p>
<p>

<h3>
   Other disclosures
</h3>
<p>
   In addition to the disclosures reasonably necessary for the purposes identified elsewhere in this Privacy Policy, we may share 
   your personal information if we believe in good faith that access to or use, preservation or disclosure of such information is
   reasonably necessary: (a) to satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process or enforceable governmental request; (b) to
   enforce any contractual rights that we may have in relation to the services we provide to you; (c) to detect, prevent or 
   otherwise deal with fraud, security or technical issues; or (d) to protect against harm to the rights, property or safety of 
   NewsNow, our employees or contractors, our business partners, our users or the public.
</p>
<p>
   If we become involved in any prospective or actual transaction with a third party relating to our company, our business or 
   substantially all our assets, we may share your personal information with that third party. We will endeavour to ensure the
   confidentiality of any personal information involved in such a transaction until (if at all) such personal information is 
   transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.

<h2>
   5 International transfers
</h2>
<p>
   Some of the disclosures described above may involve a transfer of data outside the European Economic Area (“EEA”).
</p>
<p>
   Whenever we transfer your personal data out of the EEA, we strive to ensure that a similar degree of protection is afforded 
   to such data by ensuring that at least one of the following safeguards is implemented:
</p>
<ul>
   <li>
      transferring data to a provider based in the USA, if such provider adheres to the 
      <a href="https://www.privacyshield.gov/welcome" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Privacy Shield framework</a>, 
      an agreement between the EU and the USA designed to protect data transferred between the two regions;
   </li>
   <li>
      transferring your personal data to a country, organisation or sector that has, at the time of transfer, been deemed to 
      provide an adequate level of protection for personal data by the European Commission; and/or
   </li>
   <li>
      using specific forms of contract approved by the European Commission that give personal data the same protection it 
      within Europe.
   </li>
</ul>
<p>
   For further details of such safeguards, please see the European Commission’s website. 
</p>
<p>
   Please contact us if you would like further information on the specific mechanism used by us when transferring your personal
   data out of the EEA.

<h2>
   6 Data security
</h2>
<p>
   We have put in place appropriate security measures (including user authentication software and secure data-sharing feeds) to
   prevent your personal data from being accidentally lost, used or accessed in an unauthorised way, altered or disclosed. 
</p>
<p>
   In addition, we limit access to your personal data to those employees, agents, contractors and other third parties who have
   a business need to know. They will only process your personal data on our instructions, and they are subject to a duty of
   confidentiality. 
</p>
<p>
   We have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected personal data breach, and we shall notify you and any applicable
   regulator of a breach where we are legally required to do so.
</p>


<p><a name="h7"></a></p>
<h2>
   7 Data retention
</h2>
<p>
   We will only retain your personal data for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes for which we collected such data, including
   for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting or reporting requirements.  
</p>
<p>
   In some circumstances you can ask us to delete your personal data: please see <a href="#h8">section 8</a> below for further 
   information.
</p>
<p>
   In some circumstances we may anonymise your personal data (so that it can no longer be associated with you) for research or 
   statistical purposes, in which case we may use this information indefinitely without further notice to you.
</p>

<h2>
   8 Your legal rights
</h2>
<p>
   You may have the following rights (which may, in certain circumstances, be subject to certain exceptions under data protection laws):
</p>
<p>
   (a) <strong>Right to be informed</strong> — you have the right to be told how your personal information will be used. 
   This Privacy Policy and other policies and statements used on our sites and in our communications are intended to provide you 
   with a clear and transparent description of how your personal information may be used.
</p>
<p>
   (b) <strong>Right to withdraw consent</strong> — where we rely on your consent to use your personal information, you 
   have the right to withdraw that consent at any time. This includes the right to ask us to stop using your personal information
   for direct marketing purposes or to be unsubscribed from our email list at any time. This will not, however, affect the lawfulness
   of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent. If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide
   certain content or services to you. We shall inform you if that is the case at the time when you withdraw your consent.
</p>
<p>
   (c) <strong>Right to access</strong> — you can write to us to ask for confirmation of what information we hold on you 
   and to request a copy of that information. We may need to seek evidence that you are entitled to see the information requested
   and to confirm your identity.
</p>
<p>
   (d) <strong>Right to rectification</strong> — if our records of your personal information are inaccurate, you have the 
   right to ask for those records to be updated.  We may need to verify the accuracy of the new data that you provide to us.
</p>
<p>
   (e) <strong>Right to erasure</strong> — you can ask us for your personal information to be deleted from our records where
   (i) there is no good reason for our continuing to process such data, (ii) you have successfully exercised your right to object
   to processing (see below), (iii) we may have processed your information unlawfully or (iv) we are required to erase your personal
   data to comply with local law. Please note, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for 
   specific legal reasons, which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request.
</p>
<p>
   (f) <strong>Right to restrict</strong> processing — you may have the right to ask for processing of your personal data 
   to be restricted, where (i) you would like us to establish the accuracy of such data; (ii) our use of the data is unlawful, 
   but you do not want us to erase the data; (iii) you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require the data as you need
   the data to establish, exercise or defend legal claims; or (iv) you have objected to our use of your data, but we need to 
   verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use the data.
</p>
<p>
   (g) <strong>Right to data portability</strong> — where we are processing your personal information (i) with your consent,
   (ii) because such processing is necessary for the performance of a contract to which you are party or to take steps at your 
   request before entering into a contact or (iii) by automated means, you may ask us to provide it to you – or to another service
   provider – in a machine-readable format.
</p>
<p>
   (h) <strong>Right to object</strong> to processing — you may have the right to object to processing of your personal data
   where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation
   that makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you believe that it affects your fundamental rights and freedoms. 
   You also have the right to object where we are processing your personal data for direct marketing purposes. In some cases, we may
   demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information that override your rights and freedoms.
</p>
<p>
   (i) <strong>Right to not to be subject to automated decision-making</strong> where that would have a significant effect on you. 
   We do not in fact engage in such activities, so this right will not, in practice, be relevant in the context of your use of our
   sites.
</p>
<p>
   To exercise these rights, please send a description of the personal information in question using the contact details at 
   <a href="#h9">section 9</a> below. Where we consider that the information with which you have provided us does not enable us to 
   identify the personal information in question, we reserve the right to ask for (i) personal identification and/or (ii) further 
   information.
</p>
<p>
   You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to exercise any of the other rights). We may, however, charge 
   a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive. Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with your
   request in those circumstances.
</p>
<p>
   We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month. Occasionally it may take us longer than a month if your request 
   is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this case, we shall notify you and keep you updated.
</p>
<p>
   As noted above, some of these rights only apply in limited circumstances. For more information, we suggest that you consult the
   guidance of the UK Information Commissioner’s Office (“ICO”) — 
   <a href="https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/individual-rights/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">

   please contact us using the details provided at <a href="#h9">section 9</a> below.
</p>
<p>
   You are further entitled to make a complaint about us or the way we have processed your data to the ICO. For further information
   on how to exercise this right, please see the guidance at <a href="https://ico.org.uk/for-the-public/personal-information" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
