<font size="+1"><strong>Our Privacy Policy</strong></font>
</p><p>
<strong>Your Privacy is Important to Us</strong><br>
According to <a href="http://www.truste.org">one source</a>, as many as seven out of ten Web users either give false information or simply leave a Web site when asked to provide personal information. Obviously, many Web users have become uncomfortable with providing information about themselves, because they don't know where it is going and/or how it will be used.
</p><p>
While we at New York Life strive to learn more about you so that we can better serve your needs, we fully respect your right to privacy. Here is what we will, and will not, do with any personal information you provide us.
</p><p>
<strong>Site Visitation</strong><br>
We collect aggregate information on what pages our users access. This information is used solely for statistical studies to determine (for instance) the relative popularity of each of our pages, the average number of pages accessed by visitors, and the average time visitors spend at the site. None of this is linked back to you as an individual visitor. It is only used for our internal auditing and to help us improve the site.
</p><p>
<strong>E-mail Addresses</strong><br>
Whenever you supply your e-mail address to us, it is kept in confidence and used solely to answer your inquiry or comply with your request. We will not exchange your e-mail address with anyone outside of New York Life unless you specifically and expressly request us to do so. We will not exchange your e-mail address <i>inside</i> New York Life unless it is necessary to answer your inquiry or comply with your request.
</p><p>

<strong><a href="http://www.newyorklife.com/NYL/0,1065,8854,00.html">Personal Folder</a></strong><br>
To create your own Personal Folder at the New York Life Web site, we ask you to provide us with an individual profile by answering a series of questions about yourself. We do this to be able to serve up content that will be of most immediate interest to you. None of this information is linked back to you as an individual visitor. Moreover, you can at any time return and modify your profile. As with site visitation, we also aggregate this information to do basic demographic research about our Personal Folder users, which we use to improve the content that we serve up to you.
</p><p>
<strong>Cookies</strong><br>
We use <http: help.netscape.com="" kb="" consumer="" 19970226-2.html="">cookies at the New York Life Web site only to maintain sessions within your Personal Folder, or when you access the Virtual Service Center (see below). When you log in to your Personal Folder using your unique user ID and password, our server passes down a cookie to your computer. That cookie functions as a "guest pass" allowing you to access the site and save pages to your Folder. It is maintained only throughout your session on the site, and is automatically timed out after three hours.

</http:></p><p>
<b><a href="https://www.newyorklife.com/vscii/index-vscii.html">Virtual Service Center</a></b><br>
To receive service at the Virtual Service Center, you must answer a series of questions about yourself. We use this to identify you as the rightful "owner" of your policy information and requestor of service. All information you supply here is sent to New York Life encrypted on a secure server. However, you should be aware that our return e-mail messages to you are <i>not encrypted</i> and so cannot be considered fully secure. Non-encrypted Internet e-mail can possibly be intercepted and viewed by other Internet users, without your knowledge or consent. If you have concerns about the likelihood of this happening, we will gladly accept your service requests through our existing 800 number toll free service.

</p><p>
<strong>Weekly What's New Update</strong><br>
When, to receive our <a href="/NYL/0,1065,7410,00.html">Weekly What's New Update</a>, you give us your e-mail address, we use it for that purpose only. We will not share your address with anyone either inside or outside of New York Life for any other purpose than to honor your request to receive our Weekly Updates. We will not rent, sell, or share our mailing list to any third parties for any purposes.
</p><p>
<strong><a href="/NYL/0,1065,8,00.html">Contact New York Life</a></strong><br>
Whatever information you supply when completing a <a href="/NYL/0,1065,8,00.html">"Contact NYL"</a> e-mail will be used solely to facilitate your request or answer your inquiry. This includes your name, address, e-mail address, phone number, or any other information you supply. We will not rent or sell that information to any third parties for any purposes. We will not share that information with New York Life agents or managers unless you specifically and expressly request to be contacted by a New York Life agent or manager. (However, when you request product information and leave us a phone number, we assume that you are requesting phone contact from a New York Life agent, who is the sole resource available to meet your request by phone.)
</p><p>
<strong>Bottom Line</strong><br>
At the New York Life site, we strive to provide you with the most comprehensive source of life insurance and financial products information on the Web. When we ask for personal information of any kind, or give you with the opportunity to supply such information, it is solely to improve our ability to meet your needs and respond to your requests. We will continue to do whatever we can to protect your privacy at our site and enhance for you the site's serviceability and usefulness.
