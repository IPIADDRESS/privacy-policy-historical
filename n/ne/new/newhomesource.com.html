                    online whenever you use any of our Websites, including (but
                    not limited to) NewHomeSource.com. We encourage you to review
                    the following Privacy Policy so that you may understand how
                    your personal information will be treated as you make full
                    use of our many offerings. </p>
				<br>
                <p><b>What personally identifiable information
                about me do you collect?<br></b>
				We may collect different types of information in
                several different ways from our Websites.
                </p>
				<br>
                <p> As an initial matter, you may browse our Websites without
                    submitting any personal information. If you choose to take
                    advantage of some of our specific products and services that
                    are available only to registered users, however, you will
                    be asked to register with us. As part of your registration,
                    we may ask for personally identifiable information, such
                    as your name, address, email address, birth date, gender,
                    occupation, industry, family information, and personal interests.
                    The more information you volunteer (and the more accurate
                    it is), the better we are able to customize your experience
                    on our sites. We keep all of your personally identifiable
                    information in secure online and offline facilities. Once
                    you register, your use of our Websites will no longer be
                    anonymous and you will be able to take full advantage of
                    the many specialized offerings on our Websites. </p>
				<br>
                <p> In addition to registration, we may ask you for personal
                    information at other times, including (but not limited to)
                    when you enter a sweepstakes, contest, or promotion sponsored
                    by us or one of our partners or you may provide us with personal
                    information when you send us a letter or email message, such
                    as if you report a problem with our Websites or services.
                    If you contact us, we may keep a record of that correspondence.
                    From time to time, we also may ask users to complete surveys
                    that we use for research purposes. Wherever we collect personal
                    information, the information you provide will be subject
                    to the terms of this Policy. </p>
				<br>
                <p> In addition, we may use IP addresses to analyze trends, administer
                    the site, track user's movement, and gather broad demographic
                    information for aggregate use. IP addresses, however, will
                    not be linked to your personally identifiable information. </p>
				<br>
                <p> Finally, our sites also may contain links and advertisements
                    to other Websites that are operated by other companies or
                    persons. Therefore, we do not control the privacy policies
                    of those sites. This Policy statement only applies to information
                    collected and maintained by us. </p>

                <p><b>What are cookies and how do you use them? </b><br>
                    As part of offering and providing customizable and personalized
                    services, we use cookies to store and sometimes track information
                    about you. A cookie is a small amount of data that is sent
                    to your browser from a Web server and stored on your computer's
                    hard drive. Some of these cookie files will be stored on
                    your hard drive even after you close your browser and other
                    files may be temporary files that will be deleted when you
                    close your Internet browser. We will not, however, attempt
                    to read any cookies or files that may be on your computer,
                    including cookies that may have been placed on your computer
                    by other Websites that you may have visited. </p>
				<br>
                <p> Generally, we use cookies to: </p>
                <p> (1) Remind us of who you are and to access your account information
                    (stored on our secured computers) in order to permit the
                    tailoring of the Websites to better match your interests
                    and/or preferences. These cookies will be stored on your
                    computer when you register or "Sign In" to one of our Websites,
                    and may be modified while you browse our sites or when you "Sign
                    Out" from one of the sites. </p>
                <p> (2) Estimate our audience size. Each browser accessing one
                    of our Websites is given a unique cookie that is then used
                    to determine the extent of repeat usage, usage by a registered
                    user versus by an unregistered user, and to help target our
                    services and advertisements based on your interests and behavior. </p>
                <p> (3) Track your progress and number of entries in some of
                    our promotions, sweepstakes, and contests. When one of the
                    promotions that we host uses cookies, the information written
                    to the cookie may be used to indicate the player's progress
                    through the promotion, and may be used to track entries,
                    submissions, and status in prize drawings. </p>
                <p> (4) Measure certain traffic patterns, such as which areas
                    of our Websites you have visited and your visiting patterns.
                    This information, however, is only gathered in aggregate
                    form - that is, this aggregated information is not linked
                    to any personal information that can identify any individual
                    person. We use this research to understand how our users'
                    habits are similar or different from one another so that
                    we can make each new experience on our sites a better one.
                    We may use this information to better personalize the content,
                    banners, and promotions that you and other users will see
                    on our sites. </p>
				<br>
                <p><b>What about your third parties
                    and advertisers - do they use cookies?</b><br>
                    Advertising networks that serve ads onto one or more of our
                    Websites and companies advertising or offering products and

				//-->
                </p><p><b>How do you use my information?</b><br>
                    Our primary goal in collecting personally identifiable and
					other information is to provide you, the user, with a
					customized experience on our Websites. This includes
					personalization services and many other types of services.
					By knowing a little about you, we are able to deliver
					more relevant advertisements and content, and hence a
					better and more valuable service, to you. For example,
					the more we know about the type of home or community
					in which you are interested, the more appropriate information
					we can deliver to you.</p>
				<br>
                <p>In our role of delivering targeted advertisements, we play
                    the middleman. Advertisers give us an advertisement and tell
                    us the type of audience they want to reach (for example,
                    males over 35 years old). We and/or our advertising server
                    agency take the advertisement and display or transmit it
                    to users meeting those criteria. In this process, the advertiser
                    never has access to individual account information. Only
                    we have access to individuals' accounts. This kind of advertisement
                    targeting is done with banner ads, as well as by promotional
                    emails. You will only receive special offers via email from
                    us if you have indicated in your account preferences that
                    you would like to receive them. Of course, you may review
                    or change <a href="http://www.newhomesource.com/">your
                    account preferences</a> at any time.</p>
				<br>
                <p> In addition, we do research on our users' demographics, interests,
                    and behavior based on the information provided to us upon
                    registration, during a promotion, from our server log files,
                    or from surveys. We do this to better understand and serve
                    our users. This research is compiled and analyzed on an aggregated
                    basis and may be shared with advertisers or business partners.
                    We also collect IP addresses for system administration and
                    to report aggregate, nonpersonally identifiable information
                    to our advertisers and partners. For this purpose, no personally
                    identifiable information will be linked to any information
                    that can identify any individual person. </p>
				<br>
                <p><b>Who besides you is collecting my information? </b><br>
                    When you are on any of our Websites and are asked for personal
                    information, you are sharing that information with us alone,
                    unless it is specifically stated otherwise. Some of our services,
                    however, may be offered in conjunction with a partner company.
                    In order to provide this cobranded service to you, it may
                    be necessary for us to share your personal information with
                    our partner company. For example, if you want to receive
                    information about a community from a builder, we may send
                    your personally identifiable information to that builder
                    so that it can fulfill your request. If data is being INITIALLY collected and maintained by any company
					other than us, you will be notified prior to the time of the data
					collection or transfer. If you do not want your data to be shared, you can choose
                    not to allow the transfer by not using that particular service.</p>

                <p> In addition, promotions that run on our Websites also may
                    be sponsored by companies other than us or may be cosponsored
                    by us and another company. Some or all data collected during
                    a promotion may be shared with the sponsor. If data from
                    your entry will be shared, you will be notified prior to
                    the time of data collection or transfer. You can decide not
                    to participate in the promotion if you do not want to share
                    your information. </p>

                <p><b>With whom do you share my information? </b><br>
                    As a general rule, we will not disclose any of your personally
					identifiable information except when we have your permission

					in good faith that the law requires it or as specifically

					your information may be disclosed.</p>
				<br>
                <p> Business Partners &amp; Sponsors: We may disclose your personal
                    information to business partners or sponsors, but this is
                    specifically described to you prior to data collection or
                    prior to transferring the data. Details of shared use can
                    be found in specific Terms of Use, or the applicable sweepstakes
                    and promotions rules. In particular, some or all data collected
                    during a promotion on one of our sites may be shared with
                    the sponsor(s) of that promotion. If personally identifiable
                    information about you will be shared, we will tell you before
                    we collect or transfer the data. </p>
				<br>
                <p> Many promotions also may offer opportunities for you to request
                    additional information from sponsors. By requesting more
                    information, you give us permission to transfer your personal
                    information to the sponsor so they can fulfill your request.
                    In many instances, only your email address will be shared.
                    If more information will be shared with the sponsor, you
                    will be notified prior to the transfer. </p>
				<br>
                <p> From time to time, you may be offered the opportunity to
                    receive materials or special offers from third parties. If
                    you opt to receive information from these third parties,
                    we will (with your permission) share your name, address,
                    and email address with them. </p>
				<br>
                <p> Third Party Data and Aggregated Data: Under confidentiality
                    agreements, we may match user information with third-party
                    data. Also, we disclose aggregated user statistics (for example, "45%
                    of our users are female") in order to describe our services
                    to current and prospective partners, advertisers, and other
                    third parties, and for other lawful purposes. As noted above,
                    this aggregated information will not be linked to any personally
                    identifiable information that can identify any individual
                    person. </p>
				<br>
                <p> Other: We may also disclose account information in special
                    cases when we have reason to believe that disclosing this
                    information is necessary to identify, contact, or bring legal
                    action against someone who may be violating our Terms of
                    Use or may be causing injury to or interference with (either
                    intentionally or unintentionally) our rights or property,
                    the rights of our users or other parties, or anyone else
                    that could be harmed by such activities. We may disclose
                    or access account information when we believe in good faith
                    that the law requires it and for administrative and other
                    purposes that we deem necessary to maintain, service, and
                    improve our products and services. We also may disclose your

                    sale of our company's business or assets. </p>

                    We may, from time to time, send you email regarding our products
                    and services. In addition, if you indicated upon registration
                    that you are interested in receiving offers or information
                    from our partners and us, we may occasionally send you direct
                    mail about products and services that we feel may be of interest
                    to you. Only we (or companies with whom we contract and who
                    agree to keep your information confidential) will prepare
                    these direct mailings and only if you indicated that you
                    do not object to receiving these offers. If you do not want
                    to receive or continue receiving such mailings, simply tell
                    us when you give us your personal information or change <a href="http://www.newhomesource.com/">your
                    account preferences</a>.</p>
				<br>
                <p> On some of our promotions, we will ask for your email address
                    in order to update you on your score, entries, and status
                    in prize drawings. When you participate in these types of
                    promotions, you automatically receive promotion-related email,
                    unless you choose the no-email option that some promotions
                    offer. Occasionally these promotion-related email messages
                    may include targeted advertisements. You may also be required
                    to provide personally identifiable information to collect
                    your prize when you win one of our promotions or contests. </p>

                    you may be unable to use some of our services, including
                    services that require registration in order to participate. </p>
				<br>
                <p> We will notify you at the time of data collection or transfer
                    if your data will be shared with a third party and you will
                    always have the option of not permitting the transfer. If
                    you do not wish to allow your data to be shared, you can
                    choose not to use a particular service or not to participate

				<br>
                <p> You may also request that we delete or deactivate your account
                    at any time, but doing so will result in not being able to

                <p><b>How do you protect my personal financial information? </b><br>
                    Keeping your personal financial information private is vitally
                    important to us. </p>
				<br>
                <p> Knowing that you use certain services or features may help
                    us to offer you better and more relevant content and advertisements.
                    But as with all personally identifiable information, we do
                    not make this available to any third parties except as set
                    forth in this Policy. Any user statistics that we may provide
                    to prospective advertisers or partners regarding financial
                    information are provided in the aggregate only and do not
                    include any personally identifiable information linked to
                    any individual user. </p>
				<br>
                <p> Please note that there may be places on our Websites where
                    you can transmit credit card information in order to complete
                    a transaction or for verification purposes. Any time we ask
                    for a credit card number we transmit that credit card number
                    in an encrypted format. We use industry-standard, SSL (secure
                    socket layer) encryption. We also store your credit card
                    information using industry-standard secure servers and facilities. </p>
				<br>
                <p><b>What security precautions are in place to protect the loss, misuse, or alteration of my information? </b><br>
                    Your account information on our Websites is password-protected
                    so that you and only you have access to this personal information.
                    Therefore, we recommend that you do not divulge your password
                    to anyone and that you chose a password that only you know.
                    We will never ask you for your password in an unsolicited
                    phone call or in an unsolicited email. Also remember to sign
                    out of your account and close your browser window when you
                    have finished your visit to our Websites. These practices
                    will help ensure that others cannot access your personal
                    information and correspondence if you share a computer with
                    someone else or are using a computer in a public place such
                    as a library or Internet cafe. If you use a public computer,
                    you may also wish to delete any temporary or other files
                    that may have been created during your visit on our sites.</p>
				<br>
                <p> Unfortunately, it is not possible for data transmissions
                    over the Internet or wireless networks, or for any security
                    precautions, to be guaranteed 100% secure. As a result, while
                    we strive to protect your personal information, we cannot
                    ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit
                    to us or from our online products or services, and you do
                    so at your own risk. Once we receive your transmission, we
                    make our best effort to ensure its security on our systems. </p>

                <p><b>What about my child's privacy? </b><br>
                    The safety of children is very important to us. We maintain
					general audience Websites that are designed for use by
					adults and that comply with the Children's Online Privacy
					Protection Act. Specifically, we do not knowingly collect

				<br>
                <p> We encourage parents to create a safe place for children
                    on the Internet. Parental control protections (such as computer
                    hardware, software or filtering services) are commercially
                    available that may assist parents in limiting access to content
                    that may be harmful to minors. We also encourage parents
                    to monitor their child's use of the Internet and teach them
                    not to disclose any personally identifiable information (including
                    their age, appearance, school, grade, etc.) about themselves
                    in emails, chat rooms, or on other sites, except with your
