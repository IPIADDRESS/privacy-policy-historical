                        <p><strong><u>Refusing or  withdrawing Consent:</u></strong><br>
                          Subject to legal and contractual requirements, an Individual can refuse  to consent to Nelson Education Ltd.’s collection, use or disclosure of Personal  Information about the Individual, or an Individual may withdraw the Individual’s  consent to Nelson Education Ltd.’s further collection, use or disclosure of  Personal Information at any time in the future by giving Nelson Education Ltd.  reasonable notice, unless: i) the consent is otherwise required by law or ii)  the use or disclosure is permitted by law or is related to the legal or  regulatory requirements described herein.

                        <p><strong><u>Internet Aspects:</u></strong><br>
                          Information may be collected when an Individual visits all websites of  Nelson Education Ltd. (“Nelson Education Ltd. Sites”). Although the information  collected, used or disclosed on the Internet as described below often does not  constitute Personal Information (and to the extent that such is the case, then  the obligations under the Privacy Policy do not extend to such information),  Nelson Education Ltd. provides the details below about Internet aspects of  Nelson Education Ltd. Services for the purposes of disclosure about Nelson  Education Ltd. Services.</p>
                        <p><u>Internet Protocol Address (IP Address)</u> <br>
                          When an Individual’s web browser requests a web page from another  computer on the Internet, it automatically gives that computer the address  where it should send the information. This address is called the computer's  "IP address." For most users accessing the Internet from a dial-up Internet  service provider (ISP), the IP address will be different every time the user  logs on.<br>
                          Nelson Education Ltd. may use the user’s IP Address to:</p>
                        <ul type="disc">
                          <li>facilitate       the diagnosis and remedy of a technical problem reported by the user’s or       Nelson Education Ltd.’s technical team; </li>
                          <li>display       (or allow the display by Third Party advertising providers of) more       appropriate and relevant content and advertising, such as content and       advertising based on the user’s geographic area; and</li>
                          <li>estimate       user traffic from specific countries or organizations. Many IP addresses       are commonly associated with Internet service providers, universities, or       major corporations in specific regions or localities. Aggregate       information derived from IP addresses may also be reported to advertisers. </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><u>Cookies</u><br>

                        <p>1.3 Nelson Education Ltd. is responsible for Personal Information in its  possession or control, including information that has been transferred to a  Third Party for processing.

                        <p><strong>Principle 2 - Identifying Purposes for  Collection of Personal Information </strong><br>
                          <em>Nelson Education Ltd. has collected and  collects Personal Information for the purposes set out below, and shall  identify the purposes for which Personal Information is collected at or before  the time the information is collected.</em></p>
                        <p>2.1 Nelson Education Ltd. has collected and collects Personal  Information for the following purposes: a) to establish and maintain  responsible commercial relations with Individuals and to provide ongoing  service; b) to understand Individuals’ needs; c) to develop, enhance, market or  provide products and services; d) to manage and develop its business and  operations, including personnel and employment matters; and e) to meet legal or  regulatory requirements, including to protect or defend a legal interest.</p>
                        <p>As examples of the above:<br>
                          i) Nelson Education Ltd. may from time to time use an Individual’s  Personal Information to contact the Individual about changes, enhancements or  similar notices related to Nelson Education Ltd. products and services; <br>
                          ii) if an Individual indicated that he/she was interested in receiving  offers or information from Nelson Education Ltd. or certain of our selected  sponsors or advertisers, Nelson Education Ltd. may send the Individual  materials about products and services that Nelson Education Ltd. feels may be  of interest to the Individual; and<br>
                          iii) if an Individual enters a contest or other promotion offered on a Nelson  Education Ltd. Site, Nelson Education Ltd. may, under the rules of the  promotion, use the Individual’s name and certain other information to  administer the promotion, such as contacting, announcing and promoting the  winners of the promotion.</p>
                        <p>Further references to “identified purposes” mean the purposes identified  in this Principle 2.</p>
                        <p>2.2 Nelson Education Ltd. shall specify orally, electronically or in  writing the identified purposes to the Individual at or before the time  Personal Information is collected. Upon request, persons collecting Personal  Information shall explain these identified purposes or refer the Individual to  a designated person within Nelson Education Ltd. who shall explain the  purposes.</p>
                        <p>2.3 Unless required by law, Nelson Education Ltd. shall not use or  disclose, for any new purpose, Personal Information that has been collected  without first identifying the new purpose and obtaining the consent of the Individual.</p>
                        <p><strong>Principle 3 - Obtaining Consent for  Collection, Use or Disclosure of Personal Information </strong><br>
                          <em>The knowledge and consent of an Individual  are required for the collection, use or disclosure of Personal Information,  except where inappropriate.</em></p>
                        <p>3.1 Generally, Nelson Education Ltd. shall seek consent to use and  disclose Personal Information at the same time it collects the information.  However, Nelson Education Ltd. may seek consent to use and disclose Personal Information  after it has been collected but before it is used or disclosed for a new  purpose.</p>
                        <p>3.2 In obtaining consent, Nelson Education Ltd. shall use reasonable  efforts to ensure that an Individual is advised of the identified purposes for  which Personal Information will be used or disclosed. Purposes shall be stated  in a manner that can be reasonably understood by the Individual.</p>
                        <p>3.3 Where Personal Information is required for the supply of a product  or service,&nbsp; Nelson Education Ltd. will not  be able to collect, use or disclose Personal Information of an Individual for  the purpose of supplying such product or service unless the Individual has consented  to the collection, use or disclosure of Personal Information for such  identified purpose.</p>
                        <p>3.4 In determining the appropriate form of consent, Nelson Education  Ltd. shall take into account the sensitivity of the Personal Information and  the reasonable expectations of the Individuals.</p>
                        <p>3.5 In general, the use of products and services by an Individual constitutes  implied consent for Nelson Education Ltd. to collect, use and disclose Personal  Information for all identified purposes, so long as the Individual, as  applicable, has been made aware of the terms of this Privacy Policy.</p>
                        <p>3.6 An Individual may withdraw consent at any time, subject to legal or  contractual restrictions and reasonable notice. An Individual may contact  Nelson Education Ltd. for more information regarding the implications of  withdrawing consent.<br>
                          3.7 In certain circumstances Personal Information can be collected, used  or disclosed without the knowledge and consent of the Individual. For example,  Nelson Education Ltd. may collect or use Personal Information without knowledge  or consent if it is clearly in the interests of the Individual and consent  cannot be obtained in a timely way, such as when the Individual is a minor,  seriously ill or mentally incapacitated.<br>
                          Nelson Education Ltd. may also collect, use or disclose Personal  Information without knowledge or consent if seeking the consent of the Individual  might defeat the purpose of collecting the information such as in the  investigation of a breach of an agreement or a contravention of a federal or  provincial law.</p>
                        <p>Nelson Education Ltd. may also use or disclose Personal Information  without knowledge or consent in the case of an emergency where the life, health  or security of an individual or property is threatened.</p>
                        <p>Nelson Education Ltd. may disclose Personal Information without  knowledge or consent to collect a debt, to comply with a subpoena, warrant or  other court order, or as may be otherwise related to the legal or regulatory  requirements described herein.</p>

                          <em>Nelson Education Ltd. shall not use or  disclose Personal Information for purposes other than those for which it was  collected, except with the consent of the Individual or as required by law.

                        <p>5.4 Only those employees of Nelson Education Ltd. who require access for  business reasons, or whose duties reasonably so require, or properly designated  representatives of Nelson Education Ltd., are granted access to Personal Information  about Individuals.</p>

                        <p>5.6 Nelson Education Ltd. shall maintain reasonable and systematic  controls, schedules and practices for information and records retention and  destruction which apply to Personal Information that is no longer necessary or  relevant for the identified purposes or required by law to be retained. Such  information shall be destroyed, erased or made anonymous.</p>
                        <p><strong>Principle 6 - Accuracy of Personal  Information </strong><br>
                          <em>Personal Information shall be as accurate, complete and up-to-date as is  necessary for the purposes for which it is to be used.</em></p>
                        <p>6.1 Personal Information used by Nelson Education Ltd. shall be  sufficiently accurate, complete and up-to-date to minimize the possibility that  inappropriate information may be used to make a decision about an Individual.</p>

                        <p><strong>Principle 8 - Openness Concerning Policies  and Practices </strong><br>
                          <em>Nelson Education Ltd. shall make readily  available to Individuals specific information about its policies and practices  relating to the management of Personal Information.</em></p>

                        <p>9.2 In certain situations, Nelson Education Ltd. may not be able to  provide access to all of the Personal Information that they hold about an  Individual. For example, Nelson Education Ltd. may not provide access to  information if doing so would likely reveal Personal Information about a Third  Party or could reasonably be expected to threaten the life or security of  another person. Also, Nelson Education Ltd. may not provide access to  information if disclosure would reveal confidential commercial information, if  the information is protected by solicitor-client privilege, if the information  was generated in the course of a formal dispute resolution process, or if the  information was collected in relation to the investigation of a breach of an  agreement or a contravention of a federal or provincial law, or if the  information was collected as part of journalistic, literary or artistic  activities. If access to Personal Information cannot be provided, Nelson  Education Ltd. shall provide the reasons for denying access upon request.</p>
                        <p>9.3 Upon request, Nelson Education Ltd. shall provide an account of the  use and disclosure of Personal Information and, where reasonably possible,  shall state the source of the information.

Any such  information shall be used only for this purpose.<br>
                          9.5 Nelson Education Ltd. shall promptly correct or complete any  Personal Information found to be inaccurate or incomplete. Any unresolved  differences as to accuracy or completeness shall be noted in the Individual’s  file. Where appropriate, Nelson Education Ltd. shall transmit to Third Parties  having access to the Personal Information in question any amended information  or the existence of any unresolved differences.</p>
                        <p>9.6 An Individual can obtain information or seek access to his or her  Personal Information by contacting a designated representative at Nelson  Education Ltd. principal office.</p>
