        of Canada, including in the United States, to perform services for Nelson Education Ltd.
        involving some or all of a Person's Personal Information. This may require
        transfer of information to those Nelson Education Ltd. Companies and/or Third Parties.
        This information is subject to the laws of the Nelson Education Ltd. Companies' and/or
        Third Parties' jurisdiction, including laws with respect to disclosure
        of such information.</p>
      <h3>Obtaining Consent:</h3>
      <p>Nelson Education Ltd. will make a reasonable effort to make sure Persons understand
        how their Personal Information will be used by Nelson Education Ltd. Nelson Education Ltd. will obtain

      <p>A Person’s consent can be express, implied, or given through an
        authorized representative. A Person can withdraw consent at any time,
        with certain exceptions noted herein. Nelson Education Ltd., however, may collect, use

      <h3> Internet Aspects:</h3>
      <p>Personal Information may be collected when a user conducts activities
        on or related to all websites of Nelson Education Ltd. Companies (“Nelson Education Ltd. Companies
        Sites”) or related to services made available on the Nelson Education Ltd. Companies
        Sites (“Nelson Education Ltd. Companies Services”). Although information
        collected, used or disclosed on the Internet as described below often
        does not constitute Personal Information (and to the extent that such
        is the case, then the obligations under the Nelson Education Ltd. Privacy Code do not
        extend to such information), Nelson Education Ltd. provides the details below about
        Internet aspects of Nelson Education Ltd. Companies Services for the purposes of disclosure
        about Nelson Education Ltd. Companies Services.</p>
      <p><u> Internet Protocol Address (IP Address)</u><br>
  When the user’s web browser requests a web page from another computer
  on the Internet, it automatically gives that computer the address where it
  should send the information. This address is called the computer's "IP
  address." For most users accessing the Internet from a dial-up Internet
  service provider (ISP), the IP address will be different every time the user
  logs on.</p>
      <p>Nelson Education Ltd. Companies may use the user’s IP Address to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li> facilitate the diagnosis and remedy of a technical problem reported
          by the user’s or Nelson Education Ltd. Company’s technical team.</li>
        <li> display (or allow the display by Third Party advertising providers
          of) more appropriate and relevant content and advertising, such as
          content and advertising based on the user’s geographic area.</li>
        <li> estimate user traffic from specific countries or organizations.
          Many IP addresses are commonly associated with Internet service providers,
          universities, or major corporations in specific regions or localities.
          Aggregate information derived from IP addresses may also be reported
          to advertisers.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><u>Cookies</u><br>
  A cookie is a small text file, which often includes an anonymous unique identifier,
    that is sent to the user’s web browser from a web site's computers
    and is stored on the user’s computer's hard drive. Cookies cannot be
    used to run programs or deliver viruses to a user’s computer.</p>
      <p>Nelson Education Ltd. Companies may use cookies to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li> improve the operation and performance of the Nelson Education Ltd. Companies Services
          and to make Nelson Education Ltd. Companies Services easier and more convenient to
          use. For example, cookies help Nelson Education Ltd. Companies provide more personalized
          services by recalling user preferences on subsequent visits (e.g. language
          preference). Cookies also allow Nelson Education Ltd. Companies to save passwords
          and preferences for a user so that the user will not have to re-enter
          them on the next visit to a Nelson Education Ltd. Companies Site;</li>
        <li> measure aggregate user traffic and demographic statistics related
          to Nelson Education Ltd. Companies Services and advertisements (e.g. number of users,
          average time spent, average age and similar statistics). This information
          helps Nelson Education Ltd. Companies to better understand when to update, change
          or offer new services and provides Nelson Education Ltd. Companies with details as
          to the performance of Third Party advertisements and content. This
          information may be reported, in aggregate form only, to Nelson Education Ltd. Companies’ current
          and prospective sponsors, advertisers and business partners. No Personal
          Information will be disclosed in such reports;</li>
        <li>display advertisements. Nelson Education Ltd. Companies and Third Party advertising
          providers may use cookies when serving advertisements on Nelson Education Ltd. Companies
          Sites. In some cases, advertisements from Third Party advertisers are
          delivered to users (in conjunction with Nelson Education Ltd. Companies Services)
          by such Third Party advertisers, or by separately contracted advertising
          providers on their behalf, and not by Nelson Education Ltd. Companies; as such, the
          Third-party advertisers' use of cookies is subject to their own privacy
          policies, not the Nelson Education Ltd. Privacy Code, and users should consult the
          privacy policies of such Third Party advertisers.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies. If a user prefers,
        the user can reset his/her browser either to notify the user when the
        user has received a cookie, or to refuse to accept cookies. The user
        should understand that while Nelson Education Ltd. Companies do not require a user to
        use cookies, certain Nelson Education Ltd. Companies Services will not function properly
        if a user sets his/her browser to not accept cookies.</p>
      <p><u>Web Beacons</u><br>
  Certain Nelson Education Ltd. Companies Services may contain electronic images known as Web
    beacons – sometimes called single-pixel gifs – that allow Nelson Education Ltd.
    Companies to count users who have visited those pages and to deliver co-branded
    services. Web beacons are not used to access Personal Information; they are
    a technique used to compile aggregated statistics about Nelson Education Ltd. Companies
    service usage. Web beacons collect only a limited set of information including
    a cookie number, time and date of a page view, and a description of the page
    on which the Web beacon resides. Certain Nelson Education Ltd. Companies Services web pages
    may also contain Web beacons placed there by Nelson Education Ltd. Companies’ advertising
    partners to help Nelson Education Ltd. Companies determine the effectiveness of Nelson Education Ltd. Companies’ Internet
    advertising campaigns.</p>
      <p><u>Links To Other Sites And Advertisements</u><br>
  A Nelson Education Ltd. Companies Service may contain links to other websites and services.
    While Nelson Education Ltd. Companies try to link only to sites and services that share
    Nelson Education Ltd. Companies’ high standards and respect for privacy, a user should
    understand that Nelson Education Ltd. Companies are not responsible for the content of,
    or the privacy practices employed by, other companies or websites. This Nelson Education Ltd.
    Privacy Code applies only to the Nelson Education Ltd. Companies Services related to this
    Nelson Education Ltd. Privacy Code.</p>
      <p> <u>Additional Information</u><br>
  Nelson Education Ltd. Companies automatically collect certain information about the user’s
  computer hardware and software. This information may include: browser type,
  operating system type, domain names, access times and referring Web site addresses.
  This information is used by Nelson Education Ltd. Companies to operate the service, to maintain
  the quality of the service, and to provide general statistics regarding use
  of the Nelson Education Ltd. Companies Sites.<br>
  Certain Nelson Education Ltd. Companies Services may be co-branded and offered in conjunction
  with another company. If a user registers for or uses such services, both Nelson Education Ltd.
  Companies and the other company may receive information collected in conjunction
  with the co-branded services. </p>

      <p>1.3 Nelson Education Ltd. is responsible for Personal Information in its possession
        or control, including information that has been transferred to a Third
        Party for processing. Nelson Education Ltd. shall use appropriate means to provide a
        comparable level of protection while information is being processed by
        a Third Party (see Principle 7).</p>
      <p>1.4 Nelson Education Ltd. has implemented policies and procedures to give effect to
        the Nelson Education Ltd. Privacy Code, including: a) implementing procedures to protect
        Personal Information and to oversee Nelson Education Ltd.’s compliance with the

      <h3>Principle 2 - Identifying Purposes for Collection of Personal Information </h3>
      <p><em>Nelson Education Ltd. has collected and collects Personal Information for the purposes
          set out below, and shall identify the purposes for which Personal Information
          is collected at or before the time the information is collected.</em></p>
      <p>2.1 Nelson Education Ltd. has collected and collects Personal Information for the following
        purposes: a) to establish and maintain responsible commercial relations
        with Individuals and to provide ongoing service; b) to understand Individual
        needs; c) to develop, enhance, market or provide products and services;
        d) to manage and develop its business and operations, including personnel
        and employment matters; and e) to meet legal or regulatory requirements,
        including to protect or defend a legal interest, and in connection with
        an actual or possible Nelson Education Ltd. corporate re-organization, merger or amalgamation
        with another entity, or an actual or possible sale of all or a substantial
        portion of the assets of Nelson Education Ltd., provided that the Personal Information
        disclosed continues to be used by the entity acquiring the information
        either for evaluation of the possible transaction, or, on completion
        of any such transaction, for the purposes permitted by this Privacy Policy.</p>
      <p>As examples of the above:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>i)	Nelson Education Ltd. may from time to time use a Person’s Personal Information
          to contact the Person about changes, enhancements or similar notices
          related to Nelson Education Ltd. Companies products and services; </p>
        <p>ii) if a Person indicated that he/she was interested in receiving
          offers or information from Nelson Education Ltd. or one or more Nelson Education Ltd. Companies or
          certain of our selected sponsors or advertisers, Nelson Education Ltd. may send the
          Person materials about products and services that Nelson Education Ltd. feels may
          be of interest to the Person; and</p>
        <p>iii) if a Person enters a contest or other promotion offered on a
          Nelson Education Ltd. Companies website, Nelson Education Ltd. may, under the rules of the promotion,
          use the Person’s name and certain other information to administer
          the promotion, such as contacting, announcing and promoting the winners
          of the promotion.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Further references to “identified purposes” mean the purposes
        identified in this Principle 2.</p>
      <p>2.2 Nelson Education Ltd. shall specify orally, electronically or in writing the identified
        purposes to the Person at or before the time Personal Information is
        collected. Upon request, persons collecting Personal Information shall
        explain these identified purposes or refer the Person to a designated
        person within Nelson Education Ltd. who shall explain the purposes.</p>
      <p>2.3 Unless required by law, Nelson Education Ltd. shall not use or disclose, for any
        new purpose, Personal Information that has been collected without first
        identifying the new purpose and obtaining the consent of the Person.</p>
      <h3>Principle 3 - Obtaining Consent for Collection, Use or Disclosure of
        Personal Information </h3>
      <p><em>The knowledge and consent of a Person are required for the collection,
          use or disclosure of Personal Information, except where inappropriate.</em></p>
      <p>3.1 Generally, Nelson Education Ltd. shall seek consent to use and disclose Personal
        Information at the same time it collects the information. However, Nelson Education Ltd.
        may seek consent to use and disclose Personal Information after it has
        been collected but before it is used or disclosed for a new purpose.</p>
      <p>3.2 In obtaining consent, Nelson Education Ltd. shall use reasonable efforts to ensure
        that a Person is advised of the identified purposes for which Personal
        Information will be used or disclosed. Purposes shall be stated in a
        manner that can be reasonably understood by the Person.</p>
      <p>3.3 Nelson Education Ltd. will require Individuals to consent to the collection, use
        or disclosure of Personal Information as a condition of the supply of
        a product or service only if such collection, use or disclosure is required
        to fulfill the identified purposes.</p>
      <p>3.4 In determining the appropriate form of consent, Nelson Education Ltd. shall take
        into account the sensitivity of the Personal Information and the reasonable
        expectations of the Persons.</p>
      <p>3.5 In general, the use of products and services by an Individual, or
        the acceptance of employment or benefits by an Employee, constitutes
        implied consent for Nelson Education Ltd. to collect, use and disclose Personal Information
        for all identified purposes.</p>
      <p>3.6 An Individual may withdraw consent at any time, subject to legal
        or contractual restrictions and reasonable notice. Individuals may contact
        Nelson Education Ltd. for more information regarding the implications of withdrawing
        consent.</p>
      <p>3.7 In certain circumstances Personal Information can be collected,
        used or disclosed without the knowledge and consent of the Person. For
        example, Nelson Education Ltd. may collect or use Personal Information without knowledge
        or consent if it is clearly in the interests of the Person and consent
        cannot be obtained in a timely way, such as when the Person is a minor,
        seriously ill or mentally incapacitated.</p>
      <p>Nelson Education Ltd. may also collect, use or disclose Personal Information without
        knowledge or consent if seeking the consent of the Person might defeat
        the purpose of collecting the information such as in the investigation
        of a breach of an agreement or a contravention of a federal or provincial
        law.</p>
      <p>Nelson Education Ltd. may also use or disclose Personal Information without knowledge
        or consent in the case of an emergency where the life, health or security
        of an individual or property is threatened.</p>
      <p>Nelson Education Ltd. may disclose Personal Information without knowledge or consent
        to collect a debt, to comply with a subpoena, warrant or other court
        order, or as may be otherwise related to the legal or regulatory requirements
        described herein.</p>
      <h3>Principle 4 - Limiting Collection of Personal Information </h3>
      <p><em>Nelson Education Ltd. shall limit the collection of Personal Information to that
          which is necessary for the purposes identified by Nelson Education Ltd.</em></p>
      <p><em>Nelson Education Ltd. shall collect Personal Information by fair and lawful means.</em></p>
      <p>4.1 Nelson Education Ltd. collects Personal Information primarily from Individuals
        or its Employees.</p>
      <p>4.2 Nelson Education Ltd. may also collect Personal Information from other sources
        including credit bureaus, employers or personal references, or other
        third parties that represent that they have the right to disclose the
        information.</p>
      <h3>Principle 5 - Limiting Use, Disclosure and Retention of Personal Information </h3>
      <p><em>Nelson Education Ltd. shall not use or disclose Personal Information for purposes
          other than those for which it was collected, except with the consent
          of the Person or as required by law. Nelson Education Ltd. shall retain Personal Information
          only as long as necessary for the fulfillment of the purposes for which
          it was collected.</em></p>
      <p>5.1 In certain circumstances Personal Information can be collected,
        used or disclosed without the knowledge and consent of the Person. (See
        Principle 3.7) </p>
      <p>5.2 In addition, Nelson Education Ltd. may disclose a Person’s Personal Information
        to: a) another person for the development, enhancement, marketing or
        provision of any of the products or services of Nelson Education Ltd.; b) a person who,
        in the reasonable judgment of the Nelson Education Ltd. Companies, is seeking the information
        as an agent of the Person; c) any Nelson Education Ltd. Companies to permit the provision
        of services requested by the Person, and d) a Third Party or Third Parties,
        where the Person consents to such disclosure or disclosure is required
        by law.</p>
      <p>5.3 Nelson Education Ltd. may disclose Personal Information about its employees: a)
        for normal personnel and benefits administration; b) in the context of
        providing references regarding current or former employees in response
        to requests from prospective employers; or c) where disclosure is required
        by law.</p>
      <p>5.4 Only those Employees of Nelson Education Ltd. who require access for business reasons,
        or whose duties reasonably so require, or properly designated representatives
        of Nelson Education Ltd., are granted access to Personal Information about Individuals
        and Employees.</p>
      <p>5.5 Nelson Education Ltd. shall keep Personal Information only as long as it remains
        necessary or relevant for the identified purposes or as required by law.
        Depending on the circumstances, where Personal Information has been used
        to make a decision about a Person, Nelson Education Ltd. shall retain, for a period
        of time that is reasonably sufficient to allow for access by the Person,
        either the actual information or the rationale for making the decision.</p>
      <p>5.6 Nelson Education Ltd. shall maintain reasonable and systematic controls, schedules
        and practices for information and records retention and destruction which
        apply to Personal Information that is no longer necessary or relevant
        for the identified purposes or required by law to be retained. Such information
        shall be destroyed, erased or made anonymous.</p>
      <h3>Principle 6 - Accuracy of Personal Information </h3>
      <em>Personal Information shall be as accurate, complete and up-to-date
      as is necessary for the purposes for which it is to be used.</em>
      <p>6.1 Personal Information used by Nelson Education Ltd. shall be sufficiently accurate,
        complete and up-to-date to minimize the possibility that inappropriate
        information may be used to make a decision about a Person.</p>
      <p>6.2 Nelson Education Ltd. shall update Personal Information about Persons as and when
        necessary to fulfill the identified purposes or upon notification by
        the Person.</p>
      <h3>Principle 7 - Security Safeguards </h3>
      <p><em>Nelson Education Ltd. shall protect Personal Information by security safeguards
          appropriate to the sensitivity of the information.</em></p>
      <p>7.1 Nelson Education Ltd. shall protect Personal Information against such risks as
        loss or theft, unauthorized access, disclosure, copying, use, modification
        or destruction, through appropriate security measures. Nelson Education Ltd. shall protect
        the information regardless of the format in which it is held.</p>
      <p>7.2 Nelson Education Ltd. shall protect Personal Information disclosed to third parties
        by contractual agreements stipulating the confidentiality of the information
        and the purposes for which it is to be used.</p>
      <p>7.3 All employees of Nelson Education Ltd. with access to Personal Information shall
        be required as a condition of employment to respect the confidentiality
        of Personal Information.</p>
      <h3>Principle 8 - Openness Concerning Policies and Practices </h3>
      <p><em>Nelson Education Ltd. shall make readily available to Persons specific information
          about its policies and practices relating to the management of Personal
          Information.</em></p>
      <p>8.1 Nelson Education Ltd. shall make information about its policies and practices easy
        to understand, including: a) The title and address of the person or persons
        accountable for the compliance with the Nelson Education Ltd. Privacy Code and to whom
        inquiries or complaints can be forwarded; b) The means of gaining access
        to Personal Information held by Nelson Education Ltd.; and c) A description of the type
        of Personal Information held by Nelson Education Ltd., including a general account of
        its use.</p>
      <p>8.2 Nelson Education Ltd. shall make available information to help Persons exercise
        choices regarding the use of their Personal Information.</p>
      <h3>Principle 9 - Access to Personal Information </h3>
      <p><em>Nelson Education Ltd. shall inform a Person of the existence, use and disclosure
          of his or her Personal Information upon request and shall give the
          Person access to that information.</em></p>
      <p>A Person shall be able to challenge the accuracy and completeness of
        the Personal Information and have it amended as appropriate.</p>
      <p>9.1 Upon request, Nelson Education Ltd. shall afford to a Person a reasonable opportunity
        to review the Personal Information in the Person’s file. Personal
        Information shall be provided in understandable form within a reasonable
        time and at minimal or no cost to the Person.</p>
      <p>9.2 In certain situations, Nelson Education Ltd. may not be able to provide access
        to all of the Personal Information that they hold about a Person. For
        example, Nelson Education Ltd. may not provide access to information if doing so would
        likely reveal Personal Information about a Third Party or could reasonably
        be expected to threaten the life or security of another person. Also,
        Nelson Education Ltd. may not provide access to information if disclosure would reveal
        confidential commercial information, if the information is protected
        by solicitor-client privilege, if the information was generated in the
        course of a formal dispute resolution process, or if the information
        was collected in relation to the investigation of a breach of an agreement
        or a contravention of a federal or provincial law, or if the information
        was collected as part of journalistic, literary or artistic activities.
        If access to Personal Information cannot be provided, Nelson Education Ltd. shall provide
        the reasons for denying access upon request.</p>
      <p>9.3 Upon request, Nelson Education Ltd. shall provide an account of the use and disclosure
        of Personal Information and, where reasonably possible, shall state the
        source of the information. In providing an account of disclosure, Nelson Education Ltd.
        shall provide a list of organizations to which it may have disclosed
        Personal Information about the individual when it is not possible to
        provide an actual list.</p>
      <p>9.3 In order to safeguard Personal Information, an individual or employee
        may be required to provide sufficient identification information to permit
        Nelson Education Ltd. to account for the existence, use and disclosure of Personal Information
        and to authorize access to the individual’s file. Any such information
        shall be used only for this purpose.</p>
      <p>9.4 Nelson Education Ltd. shall promptly correct or complete any Personal Information
        found to be inaccurate or incomplete. Any unresolved differences as to
        accuracy or completeness shall be noted in the Person’s file. Where
        appropriate, Nelson Education Ltd. shall transmit to third parties having access to
        the Personal Information in question any amended information or the existence
        of any unresolved differences.</p>
      <p>9.5 A Person can obtain information or seek access to his or her Personal
        Information by contacting a designated representative at Nelson Education Ltd. principal
        office.</p>
      <p>9.6 An employee can obtain information or seek access to his or her
        Personal Information by contacting his or her immediate supervisor within
        Nelson Education Ltd.</p>
      <h3>Principle 10 - Challenging Compliance </h3>
      <p><em>A Person shall be able to address a challenge concerning compliance
          with the above principles to the designated person or persons accountable
          for the compliance of Nelson Education Ltd. with the Nelson Education Ltd. Privacy Code.</em></p>
      <p>10.1 Nelson Education Ltd. shall maintain procedures for addressing and responding
        to all inquiries or complaints from Persons about Nelson Education Ltd.’s handling
        of their Personal Information. If any Person at any time has any questions
        or concerns about Nelson Education Ltd.’s privacy practices, the Person can either:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p> i) write to Customer Service – Privacy, Nelson Education Ltd.,
          1120 Birchmount Road, Toronto, ON, M1K 5G4; or<br>
    ii) provide information to Nelson Education Ltd. through <a href="#privacyform">the form
    on its Internet Privacy page</a>.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>10.2 Nelson Education Ltd. shall inform Persons about the existence of these procedures
        as well as the availability of complaint procedures.</p>
      <p>10.3 The person or persons accountable for compliance with the Nelson Education Ltd.
        Privacy Code may seek external advice where appropriate before providing
        a final response to individual complaints.</p>
      <p>10.4 Nelson Education Ltd. shall investigate all complaints concerning compliance with
        the Nelson Education Ltd. Privacy Code. If a complaint is found to be justified, Nelson Education Ltd.
        shall take appropriate measures to resolve the complaint including, if
        necessary, amending its policies and procedures. A Person shall be informed
        of the outcome of the investigation regarding his or her complaint.</p>
