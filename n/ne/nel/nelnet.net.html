<p>
The privacy policies on this web site apply to users who are located in the U.S. when

sure to check back occasionally to ensure you have read the most current version.

</a></p><p><a class="anchor" name="Privacy_Online">
We at Nelnet are committed to providing you a useful and enjoyable online experience, 
and to protecting your personal information during your visit.  When you access a 
Nelnet web site, you can be sure that your information is protected by the latest 
security and authentication techniques.  We may collect information from your visit, 
in order to personalize and improve upon your experience with us, but all information 
we collect is treated as confidential. 
</a></p><a class="anchor" name="Privacy_Online">

<p>
To access student loan account information and send emails via our web site, you will 
need a browser that supports the use of Secure Sockets Layer (Netscape 4.0 or greater, 
MS Internet Explorer 5.0 or greater, etc). This encryption technology helps ensure the 
authenticity of your online sessions and secures data being transmitted over the public 
Internet.
</p>

<p>
If you are using Netscape Navigator, your session is secured if a key appears in the 
lower left corner of your screen; when the session is not secure, the key will appear 
broken.  Internet Explorer displays a lock icon in a locked position on the status bar 
when you enter a secure site. When you leave a secure web site, Internet Explorer displays 
a lock icon in an unlocked position on the status bar.  If the page you are viewing uses 
frames, you may not see the key or lock, but can simply right-click anywhere in the frame 
and select “Properties”.  If the web site address (URL) starts with “https” the “s” 
indicates a secure site or area of the site. 
</p>

<p>
When you enter a Nelnet web site, you will pass through our security "firewall" and we 
identify the Internet Protocol (IP) address of your computer or handheld device.  The 
IP address won’t identify you personally, but it will let us identify the device you’re 
using and we store IP addresses in case we need to track a connection for security 
purposes.
</p>

<p>
Nelnet web sites use cookies in several applications for navigational purposes. A cookie 
is a small text file placed on your hard drive (with your permission) by a web page server. 
Accepting a cookie from a Nelnet web site does not give Nelnet access to your computer or 
any personal information about you.  Also, the type of cookies we use don’t get stored 
permanently in your computer – they expire immediately after you close your browser and 
are deleted. You can also set up your web browser to inform you when cookies are set or 
to prevent cookies from being set.
</p>

<p>
If you supply us with your email address we may let you know by email about other products 
and services and product enhancements that may be of interest to you. You will have the 
opportunity to tell us you don’t want to receive future messages with each message you 
receive.   If you send us an email question or comment, we will use your email address 
to reply to you and we will temporarily store your email address, your message and our 
reply for quality assurance or to satisfy applicable laws and regulations.  When we 
collect your email address this way, we won’t use it for marketing our products and 
services unless you have given us permission. If you are not comfortable that your 
email system is secure, you can always contact Customer Service by telephone.  
</p>

<p>
We don't knowingly collect, maintain or use personal information from our web sites about 
children under age 13. If we find out we have collected such information we will take all 
reasonable measures to delete that information from our system as soon as possible.  We are 
not responsible for the collection and use of information by companies or individuals 
unaffiliated with us whose web sites may contain links to ours, including vendors where 
you may shop.
</p>

<p>
Please note that when you shop with a vendor who is linked to a Nelnet web site, even 
though you may have started your visit at the Nelnet site, and even though Nelnet pages 
may still appear, your transactions are completed with a separate organization, not with 
Nelnet.  We don’t share your personal information with them, but information you choose 
to share with them will fall under their privacy policies, which we encourage you 
to review.  We carefully select other organizations in an effort to give you the value 
and excellent customer service you expect from Nelnet.
</p>

<p>
We have also created relationships with others on the Web who might have products and 
services we do not, but that we think you might be interested in.  These companies’ 
web sites may be hyperlinked to ours, or we may have "co-branded" sites we share with 
them.  Again, we do not share your personal information with them, nor do we control 
their use of your information.  That’s why it is important for you to know what their 
privacy practices are if you visit their sites.

This Policy explains our collection and use practices regarding consumer 
information, including how and what we share with our related companies and 
with outside companies.  Protecting your privacy is important to the Nelnet 
Companies (“Nelnet”) and our employees. We want you to understand what 
information we collect and how we use it. This Policy is the standard for 
Nelnet employees regarding collection, use, retention, and security of nonpublic 
personal information. If you pay off your loan(s) we will continue to adhere to 
the privacy policies and practices described in this notice. 
</p>

<a name="intro">
</a><p><a name="intro">
This Policy applies to you if you have received a financial product or service 
from a </a><a href="#company_list">Nelnet Company</a>.  An example would be if a Nelnet company 
owns your student loan.  This Policy also applies to our former customers.    
Please note that if Nelnet services, but does not own, your student loan, your 
lender’s privacy Policy applies instead.  In those cases, Nelnet complies with 
the privacy policies of our lender clients.  The information in this Policy 
applies to individuals only, and we may change the policies from time to time.  
The effective date of this Policy is January 1, 2002.
</p>

<a name="why">
<p></p><center><b><u>Why We Collect Information</u></b></center><p></p>

<p>
We collect information so we can identify you as our customer, to establish, manage 
and protect your accounts, to complete your transactions, to create and offer you 
products and services you might be interested in, and to comply with various legal 
and regulatory requirements.
</p>

</a><a name="what_collect">
<p></p><center><b><u>What Information We Collect</u></b></center><p></p>

<p>
“Nonpublic personal information” is information about you that is not publicly 
available, but that we get in connection with providing a financial product or 
service to you, and that we need to serve you effectively and efficiently.  
We may collect nonpublic personal information about you in the following ways:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Information we receive from you on applications or other loan and account 
	forms, which may include your name, address, e-mail address, birth date and phone 
	number, so we can identify you as a customer, get in touch with you about your 
	account when necessary and generally maintain your account; your social security 
	number or other identifying information that helps us prevent unauthorized access 
	to or use of your account; and personal financial information that helps us process 
	your application and identify products and services that may be of 
	interest to you.<br><br>
		
	</li><li>Information about your transactions with us or with our affiliates or 
	others, including but not limited to account balances, your payment history 
	and how you use your account.  We use this information to respond to your 
	requests, service your accounts and again, make recommendations or offers 
	to you, as we feel appropriate. <br><br>

	</li><li>Information we receive from third parties such as credit bureaus, for 
	example your credit history or credit score.  This information is used in 
	processing loan applications, collecting accounts and determining eligibility 
	for offers of other products and services.<br><br>
</li></ul>

</a><a name="what_share">
<p></p><center><b><u>What Information We Share</u></b></center><p></p>

<p>
Rest assured that Nelnet will only share your information as allowed by law and 
described in this Policy.
</p>

<p><u>Within Nelnet</u></p>

<p>
Nelnet-affiliated companies (companies related to Nelnet by common 
control or ownership), are involved in a variety of businesses, including 
education lending; funding, purchase and sale of education loans and loan servicing.  
Among our affiliates we may share:
</p>

<p>
	</p><ul>
	<li>Your financial data, for example, your assets and income that you include on a loan application; and,
	</li><li>Information we receive from credit bureaus or other nonaffiliated parties, such as your creditworthiness and your payment history.
	</li></ul>
<p></p>

</a><p><a name="what_share">
	In the “</a><a href="#opting">Opting Out</a>” section, you can direct us not to share the two 
	types of information described above with our affiliated companies, except where 
	one of our companies is simply providing services for another.
</p>

<p>
Our affiliated companies may share certain other information about you in order 
to provide a loan to you or to maintain and service your account.  Our employees 
engaged in this sharing are only allowed to use the information for those reasons 
necessary to these functions.  This information could include:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>Information we receive from you on applications or other forms, such as your name, address, telephone number, email address and social security number; and
	</li><li>Information about transactions with us, our affiliates or others, such as your loan account balance, payment history and parties to transactions.
</li></ul>

<p><u>Outside Nelnet</u></p>

<p>
In some situations, we may also share your information with companies outside our 
organization, such as:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>Financial service providers.  This includes companies that originate loans or process loan transactions for us, vendors that print, prepare or mail statements for us, correspondent lenders and computer system programmers; and
	</li><li>Marketing service providers.  Such companies may  be used to help us market our products and services to you.
</li></ul>

<p>
These providers only receive limited information about you as necessary to perform 
their functions.  They are always required to maintain confidentiality of the information 
and we restrict their use to the purpose we authorize.  They are not allowed to pass the 
information on to others for their own benefit.
</p>

<p>
We may also enter into joint marketing agreements with non-affiliated companies who 
offer products and services different from ours.  We’re very cautious in selecting 
our marketing partners, and again, the outside party will be subject to confidentiality 
and restrictions on use of your information.  The information we may provide these 
companies includes your contact information as described above, and occasionally 
some account activity information such as balance, payment history and parties to 
transactions, as well as credit history and creditworthiness information.
</p>

<p>
If you do not want us to share your nonpublic personal information with nonaffiliated 
companies, you may <a href="#opting">opt-out</a> of that sharing and we will not share your 
information except as we are permitted to by law with our marketing partners and other 
non-affiliated companies.

</p>

<p></p><center><u>Other Situations</u></center><p></p>

<p>
Sometimes the law or other circumstances also require that we disclose nonpublic 
personal information about you to nonaffiliated third parties.  Some examples are:  
when you ask or permit us to do so; when a guaranty agency, school or the Department of 
Education need that information in connection with your account, with agencies that assist 
us in servicing your loan; in response to subpoenas or court orders; with credit bureaus; 
or when we suspect fraud or criminal activity.  
</p>


<a name="security">
<p></p><center><b><u>Our Security Procedures</u></b></center><p></p>

<p>
Nelnet takes careful steps to safeguard customer information.  We restrict access 
to your personal and account information to those employees who need to know that 
information to provide products or services to you, and we regularly train our employees 
on privacy, information security, and their obligation to protect your information.   
We maintain physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards that comply with federal and 
industry standards to guard your personal information and we regularly test those 
safeguards to maintain the appropriate levels of protection.
</p>

<p>
Our Information Security divisions continually update and improve the security standards 
and procedures we use to help protect against anyone gaining unauthorized access to your 
confidential information, including through the Internet.  We also build checks and 
balances into our procedures so that we can properly identify our customers. 
</p>

<p>
You can help safeguard your personal information by taking a few simple precautions. 
Protect your account numbers, passwords, PIN’s, and customer access numbers. Never 
disclose confidential information to unknown callers.  You should always use a secure 
browser and current virus detection software, and never open e-mail from unknown sources.
