				</p><h4>FOSHEEDO, LLC PRIVACY STATEMENT</h4>
		
			This privacy statement is applicable to Fosheedo.com and any other site that 
			Fosheedo owns and operates.
			<br>
			<br>
			Children Under 13<br>
			<br>
			Fosheedo does not intend to collect any personal information from anyone under 
			13 years of age. If you are under 13, you should not enter any personally 
			identifiable information about yourself on any Fosheedo web site or in any 
			Fosheedo product, and should ask a parent to do so for you. If you are under 
			13, Fosheedo must have express written permission from a parent before you may 
			provide us with any information about yourself. The authorizing parent must 
			email us at customerservice@fosheedo.com certifying the parent's age and 
			authority, and giving us express permission to acquire and retain any such 
			personal information from you as we may normally obtain from users of any of 
			our sites.
			<br>
			<br>
			Information Collection
			<br>
			<br>
			Fosheedo does not collect personally identifiable information about you except 
			when you specifically provide this information on a voluntary basis. For 
			example, we might ask for such information when we run a contest, when you 
			register for subscription services, during product registration, in our online 
			stores, and in connection with content submissions, community postings (e.g., 
			chat and bulletin boards), surveys, and voting and polling activities. Fosheedo 
			will make every effort to ensure that whatever information you provide will be 
			maintained in a secure environment. Unfortunately, no data transmission over 
			the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive 
			to protect your personal information, Fosheedo cannot guarantee the security of 
			any information you transmit to us or from our online products or services, and 
			you provide such information at your own risk. Once we receive your 
			transmission, we make our best effort to ensure its security on our systems. 
			When credit card information is transmitted we use industry standard, SSL 
			(secure socket layer) encryption.
			<br>
			<br>
			Information Sharing
			<br>
			<br>
			Fosheedo may from time to time share or provide your personally identifiable 
			contact information to unaffiliated third parties, including successors in 
			interest, who may offer you related goods and services.
			<br>
			<br>
			Fosheedo may also retain an outside company to manage a database containing 
			certain customer information to create and distribute mailings or e-mail 
			offerings by Fosheedo or third parties. In those situations, the outside party 
			is performing work for Fosheedo.
			<br>
			<br>
			We reserve the right to contact you regarding your account status, technical 
			support, product information, changes to the subscriber agreement, and any 
			other matter that might affect our service to you and/or our records on you 
			and/or any products you purchased from us.
			<br>
			<br>
			Fosheedo may also disclose user information in special cases when we have 
			reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, 
			contact or bring legal action against someone who may be causing injury to or 
			interference with (either intentionally or unintentionally) Fosheedo’s rights 
			or property, other Fosheedo users, or anyone else that could be harmed by such 
			activities. Fosheedo may also disclose user information when we believe in good 
			faith that the law requires it.
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			Information Use
			<br>
			<br>
			Fosheedo may use your identifiable contact information to send you promotional 
			and/or marketing information about products, services and offerings from 
			Fosheedo. Fosheedo reserves the right to perform statistical analyses of user 
			behavior and characteristics, either internally or by sending this data to a 
			third party for further analysis. We do this in order to measure interest in 
			and use of the various areas of our Web sites and to create tailored marketing 
			offerings. We may share this information with advertisers. We may also use this 
			information to let advertisers know how many visitors have seen their banners 
			and how many have clicked on them. Fosheedo will generally provide only 
			aggregated data from these analyses to advertisers; advertisers will not 
			normally be able to identify any individual from these analyses.
			<br>
			<br>
			Also, you should be aware that Fosheedo may sometimes permit third parties to 
			offer subscription and/or registration-based services through a Fosheedo site. 
			Fosheedo is not responsible for any actions or policies of such third parties, 
			and you should check the applicable privacy policy of any third party when 
			providing personally identifiable information.
			<br>
			<br>
			Fosheedo collects IP addresses for system administration, record keeping, and 
			advertising reporting. Your IP address is automatically assigned to your 
			computer when you use the World Wide Web. Fosheedo's servers record incoming IP 
			addresses. The IP addresses are analyzed only in aggregate; no connection is 
			made between you and your computer's IP address. By tracking IP addresses, we 
			can determine which sites refer the most people to Fosheedo. (Think of an IP 
			address like your zip code; it tells us in general terms where you're from.)
			<br>
			<br>
			You should be very cautious when you voluntarily disclose personal information 
			(for example, name or e-mail address) on bulletin boards, in chat areas, or the 
			upload areas of any Fosheedo site. That information, along with any other 
			information you may disclose in your posting, can be collected, correlated, and 
			used by third parties, and may result in unsolicited messages from other 
			posters or third parties. Such activities are beyond the control of Fosheedo.
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			Cookies
			<br>
			<br>
			You should be aware that information and data may be automatically collected 
			through the standard operation of Fosheedo's Internet servers or through the 
			use of "cookies." "Cookies" are small text files a Web site can use to 
			recognize repeat users. Fosheedo uses cookies to recognize visitors and more 
			quickly provide personalized content or grant you unimpeded access to 
			registered areas of our Web sites. With cookies enabled, you will not need to 
			fill in password or contact information, should areas of our sites ask for this 
			information. Information gathered through cookies also helps us measure use of 
			our sites. Cookie data allow us to track usage behavior and compile data that 
			we can use to improve the site and target advertising.
			<br>
			<br>
			Generally, cookies work by assigning a unique number to the user that has no 
			meaning outside of the Web site that he or she is visiting. Sometimes, 
			advertisers or third parties hosting data for Fosheedo will issue cookies. 
			Fosheedo cannot control the use of these cookies or the information that they 
			gather.
			<br>
			<br>
			You can easily turn off cookies. Most browsers have a feature that allows the 
			user to refuse cookies or issues a warning when cookies are being sent. 
			Remember, though, cookies may be necessary to provide you with certain features 
			available on Fosheedo's sites. Some areas of our site may not function properly 
			without cookies. Enabling cookies ensures a smooth, efficient visit to our 
			site.
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			Opting Out
			<br>
			<br>
			Upon request, Fosheedo will allow any user to opt out of further promotional 
			contacts at any time. Additionally upon request, Fosheedo will use reasonable 
			efforts to allow you to update or correct personal information to the extent 
			that changing the data will not compromise privacy or security interests. Also, 
			upon your request, Fosheedo will use commercially reasonable efforts to 
			functionally delete you and your personal information from our database; 
			however, it may be impossible to delete all of your information without some 
			residual data because of backups and records of deletions. Furthermore, your 
			e-mail address will be added to a suppression list that stops any message 
			directed to you before it leaves Fosheedo. It is your responsibility, however, 
			to make certain that we have your most current e-mail address.
			<br>
			<br>
			Should you wish to opt out of any mailing from Fosheedo or a mailing you 
			received through information provided to a third party affiliate, please 
			contact Fosheedo list maintenance.
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			Links to Other Sites
			<br>
			<br>
			Fosheedo may from time to time offer links to other sites from sites within the 
			Fosheedo domain. Fosheedo has no control over these external sites or their 
			content, and cannot be held responsible for any actions they may take or any 
			information they might collect. You may arrive at one of these sites through 
			clicking on a banner advertisement, as part of a co-branding arrangement, or 
			simply by selecting a link on a Fosheedo web page. These sites might issue 
			their own cookies or collect data or personal information. Use caution when 
			visiting an external site.
			<br>
			<br>
			Fosheedo Security Policy
			<br>
			<br>
			Fosheedo is aware of your privacy concerns and strives to collect only as much 
			data as is required to make your Internet and/or product use experience as 
			efficient and satisfying as possible, in the most unobtrusive manner as 
			possible.
			<br>
			<br>
			Consent to Processing in the United States
			<br>
			<br>
			By providing any personal information to Fosheedo pursuant to this Privacy 
			Policy, all users, including, without limitation, users in the member states of 
			the European Union, fully understand and unambiguously consent to this Privacy 
			Policy and to the collection and processing of such information in the United 
			States of America.
			<br>
			<br>
			The foregoing policies are effective as of July 11, 2003. Fosheedo reserves the 
			right to change this policy at any time. By using our site, you signify your 
			assent to the Fosheedo Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to this policy, 
			please do not use our sites. Your continued use of the Fosheedo sites and 
			products following the posting of changes to these terms will mean you accept 
			those changes. This statement and the policies outlined herein are not intended 
			to and do not create any contractual or other legal rights in or on behalf of 
			any party.
