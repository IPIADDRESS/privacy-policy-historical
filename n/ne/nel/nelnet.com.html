<p>
The privacy policies on this Web site apply to users who are located in the U.S. when 
visiting our Web sites.  The policies are subject to change from time to time, so be 
sure to check back occasionally to ensure you have read the most current version.

</a></p><p><a class="anchor" name="Privacy_Online">
We at Nelnet are committed to providing you a useful and enjoyable online experience, 
and to protecting your personal information during your visit.  When you access a 
Nelnet Web site, you can be sure that your information is protected by the latest 
security and authentication techniques.  We may collect information from your visit, 
in order to personalize and improve upon your experience with us, but all information 
we collect is treated as confidential. 
</a></p><a class="anchor" name="Privacy_Online">

<p>
To access student loan account information and send emails via our Web site, you will 
need a browser that supports the use of Secure Sockets Layer (Netscape 4.0 or greater, 
MS Internet Explorer 5.0 or greater, etc). This encryption technology helps ensure the 
authenticity of your online sessions and secures data being transmitted over the public 
Internet.
</p>

<p>
If you are using Netscape Navigator, your session is secured if a key appears in the 
lower left corner of your screen; when the session is not secure, the key will appear 
broken.  Internet Explorer displays a lock icon in a locked position on the status bar 
when you enter a secure site. When you leave a secure Web site, Internet Explorer displays 
a lock icon in an unlocked position on the status bar.  If the page you are viewing uses 
frames, you may not see the key or lock, but can simply right-click anywhere in the frame 
and select “Properties”.  If the Web site address (URL) starts with “https” the “s” 
indicates a secure site or area of the site. 
</p>

<p>
When you enter a Nelnet Web site, you will pass through our security "firewall" and we 
identify the Internet Protocol (IP) address of your computer or handheld device.  The 
IP address won’t identify you personally, but it will let us identify the device you’re 
using and we store IP addresses in case we need to track a connection for security 
purposes.
</p>

<p>
Nelnet Web sites use cookies in several applications for navigational purposes. A cookie 
is a small text file placed on your hard drive (with your permission) by a Web page server. 
Accepting a cookie from a Nelnet Web site does not give Nelnet access to your computer or 
any personal information about you.  Also, the type of cookies we use don’t get stored 
permanently in your computer – they expire immediately after you close your browser and 
are deleted. You can also set up your Web browser to inform you when cookies are set or 
to prevent cookies from being set.
</p>

<p>
If you supply us with your email address we may let you know by email about other products 
and services and product enhancements that may be of interest to you. You will have the 
opportunity to tell us you don’t want to receive future messages with each message you 
receive.   If you send us an email question or comment, we will use your email address 
to reply to you and we will temporarily store your email address, your message and our 
reply for quality assurance or to satisfy applicable laws and regulations.  When we 
collect your email address this way, we won’t use it for marketing our products and 
services unless you have given us permission. If you are not comfortable that your 
email system is secure, you can always contact Customer Service by telephone.  
</p>

<p>
We don't knowingly collect, maintain or use personal information from our Web sites about 
children under age 13. If we find out we have collected such information we will take all 
reasonable measures to delete that information from our system as soon as possible.  We are 
not responsible for the collection and use of information by companies or individuals 
unaffiliated with us whose Web sites may contain links to ours, including vendors where 
you may shop.
</p>

<p>
Please note that when you shop with a vendor who is linked to a Nelnet Web site, even 
though you may have started your visit at the Nelnet site, and even though Nelnet pages 
may still appear, your transactions are completed with a separate organization, not with 
Nelnet.  We don’t share your personal information with them, but information you choose 
to share with them will fall under their privacy policies, which we encourage you 
to review.  We carefully select other organizations in an effort to give you the value 
and excellent customer service you expect from Nelnet.
</p>

<p>
We have also created relationships with others on the Web who might have products and 
services we do not, but that we think you might be interested in.  These companies’ 
Web sites may be hyperlinked to ours, or we may have "co-branded" sites we share with 
them.  Again, we do not share your personal information with them, nor do we control 
their use of your information.  That’s why it is important for you to know what their 
privacy practices are if you visit their sites.

<p><b>Summary of our policy<br>
</b>Nelnet knows how
important privacy is to you, and we are committed to providing you with
extraordinary customer service. That commitment includes protecting personal
information you entrust to us by adhering to strict guidelines. <o:p></o:p></p>

<p>This policy explains the
collection and use practices of the <a href="#nc">Nelnet Companies </a>
regarding consumer information, including how and what we share with our
related companies. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>Nelnet does not
share your personal information outside the <a href="#nc">Nelnet Companies</a> except in the limited situations
described <a href="#how">below</a> and we will never sell or provide
your personal information to third parties for their own use. This policy
is our standard regarding collection, use, retention, and security of nonpublic
personal information. Even if you pay off your loan(s), we will continue to
adhere to the privacy policies and practices described in this notice. <o:p></o:p></p>

<p>You can <a href="privacy.pdf" target="_blank">direct us</a>
 not to share “non-transactional” information with our affiliated <a href="#nc">Nelnet Companies</a>.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This policy applies to you if you have
received a financial product or service from one of the Nelnet Companies. The
typical example of this is if a Nelnet company made, or purchased and now owns,
your student loan. This policy also applies to our former customers. <b>Please
note that if Nelnet services, but does not own, your student loan, your
lender’s privacy policy applies instead</b>. In those cases, Nelnet complies
with the privacy policies of our lender clients. The information in this policy
applies to individuals only, and we may change the policies from time to time.
The effective date of this policy is July 1, 2004. <o:p></o:p></p>

<p>You can take additional
steps to protect your privacy by keeping passwords and PIN’s confidential,
never disclosing personal information to unknown callers, and ensuring your
Internet use is secured and protected from unauthorized access or use.<o:p></o:p></p>

<a class="anchor" name="why">
<p><b>Why we collect information<br></b>We collect information so we can
identify you as our customer, to establish, manage and protect your accounts,

requirements. <o:p></o:p></p>

<p><b>What information we collect<br>
