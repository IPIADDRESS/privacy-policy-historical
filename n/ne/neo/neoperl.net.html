In this notice, we would like to explain what it means for you when you use our personalised services and how we protect your data. In order to ensure your privacy is protected to the greatest possible extent, we naturally comply with all legal regulations on data protection.</p> <p><strong>Personal data<br> </strong>Personal data is information about your identity. This includes information such as name, address, telephone number, email address. It is not necessary for you to disclose personal data in order to use our website. In certain cases, however, we need your name, address and other information so that we can provide the services you have requested.</p> <p>We also need this information, for example, to send you information material, goods you have ordered or to answer questions you have asked us. We will let you know whenever this is the case. In addition, we store and process only data that you provide to us voluntarily or automatically. When we ask you for further data, this is voluntary information. Personal data is only processed to fulfil an offer you have requested and to protect our own legitimate business interests.</p> <p><strong>Intended use of personal data<br> </strong>We use the personal data you provide to answer your inquiries, process your orders or provide you access to certain information or offers. We will neither sell your personal data to third parties nor market it in any other way.</p> <p><strong>Specific use<br> </strong>We will collect, process and use the personal data you provide online only for the purposes we have told you about. Your personal data will not be passed on to third parties without your necessary consent. Personal data is only collected and transmitted to government institutions and authorities entitled to receive information in accordance with the relevant laws or if we are obliged to do so by a court decision. Our employees and the service companies commissioned by us are bound to non-disclosure and compliance with the provisions of the German Federal Data Protection Act (Bundesdatenschutzgesetz, BDSG).</p> <p>Your personal data will only be stored for as long as is necessary for its processing. This applies so long as no other storage duration is specified in this Privacy Statement or no longer storage duration is required due to legal obligations.</p> <p><strong>Data collected automatically<br> </strong>When you use our website, the following data is stored for organisational and technical reasons: the names of the pages accessed, the browser and operating system used, the date and time of access, search engines used, names of files downloaded and your IP address. We evaluate this technical data anonymously and for statistical purposes only, in order to be able to continuously optimise our internet presence and make our internet offerings even more attractive. This anonymous data is stored separately from personal information on secure systems and does not allow you to be personally identified. Your personal data and privacy are therefore protected at all times.</p> <p><strong>Children</strong><br> People under the age of 16 should not give us any personal data without the consent of their parents or legal guardians. Personal data from children and young people is not requested, collected or passed on to third parties.</p> <p><strong>Links</strong><br> This privacy notice does not apply to external links which are available to you within the scope of our website. When we provide links, we endeavour to ensure that they also comply with our data protection and security standards. However, we have no influence over other providers' compliance with data protection and security regulations. Please therefore also read the privacy policies provided on the websites of other providers.</p> <p><br> <strong>Contact data</strong></p> <p><strong>Name and address of the controller responsible for processing<br> </strong><em>Neoperl GmbH<br> Klosterrunsstraße 9-11<br> 79379 Müllheim<br> Tel. +49 7631 188 0<br> Fax. +49 7631 188 287<br> Mail: info@neoperl.de</em></p> <p><strong>Name and address of the data protection officer<br> </strong><em>Michael Kranzer<br> Bechtle GmbH<br> IT-Systemhaus Freiburg<br> Leinenweberstraße 1, DE-79108 Freiburg im Breisgau<br> datenschutzbeauftragter@neoperl.de</em></p> <p>If you have any questions about data protection, you can contact our data protection officer directly at any time.</p> <p><br> <strong>Use of special services on our website</strong></p> <p>For certain services (newsletter, etc.), we need to collect personal data. Only the data required for the respective purpose is collected and the legal retention periods are taken into account.</p> <p><strong>Newsletter subscribers<br> </strong>If you would like to subscribe to the newsletter offered on our website, we require an email address from you as well as information that allows us to verify that the email address belongs to you and that you agree to receive the newsletter. We use the double opt-in procedure to ensure that newsletters are only sent out where consent has been provided. As part of this process, the potential recipient can be included in a distribution list. Subsequently, the user is given the opportunity to confirm their registration in a legally secure manner by means of a confirmation email. The address is only actively included in the distribution list if user confirmation is provided.</p> <p>We use this data exclusively for sending the requested information and offers.</p> <p>The newsletter software used is called Newsletter2Go. This means your data will be transmitted to Newsletter2Go GmbH. Newsletter2Go is prohibited from selling your data and using it for purposes other than sending the newsletter. Newsletter2Go is a certified German provider selected in accordance with the requirements of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the German Federal Data Protection Act.</p> <p>Further information can be found here: https://www.newsletter2go.co.uk/information-for-newsletter-recipients/</p> <p>You can revoke your consent to your data and email address being stored and used to send you the newsletter at any time, for example via the "Unsubscribe" link in the newsletter.</p> <p><strong>Customer account<br> </strong>Personal data is required for a customer account.

The word "YouTube" appears on the YouTube button for easy recognition. When you visit a page of our website that contains such a plug-in, your browser establishes a direct connection to the YouTube servers. As part of this, the YouTube server learns which specific page of our website you have accessed. If you are logged into your personal YouTube user account while visiting our website, you enable YouTube to associate your browsing activity directly with your account. If you would like to prevent this data transmission, please log out of YouTube before visiting our website.</p> <p>The purpose and scope of data collection, further processing and use of the data by YouTube, as well as your rights in this regard and setting options to protect your privacy can be found in the YouTube privacy policy: https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/7671399?p=privacy_guidelines&amp;hl=en-GB.</p> <p><strong>XING</strong><br> This website includes programs (plug-ins) from the social network xing.com. This network is operated by XING AG, Gänsemarkt 43, 20354 Hamburg, Germany. On our website, these plug-ins can be recognised by the XING logo. When you visit a part of our website that contains such a plug-in, your browser establishes a direct connection to the XING servers, which in turn transmits the content of the plug-in to your browser and integrates it into the page you are viewing. As a result, the fact that you have visited our website is passed on to XING. If you are logged into your personal XING user account while visiting our website, XING can associate your visit with your account. If you interact with plug-ins, for example clicking XING button, this information is transmitted directly from your browser to XING and stored there.</p> <p>The purpose and scope of data collection, further processing and use of the data by XING, as well as your rights in this regard and setting options to protect your privacy can be found in the XING privacy policy: https://www.xing.com/app/user?op=tandc&amp;what=dp#.</p> <p>If you do not want XING to collect data about you via our website, you must log out of XING before visiting our website.

This network is operated by the LinkedIn Corporation, 2029 Stierlin Court, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA. If you click the LinkedIn button (plug-in), you will be redirected to our LinkedIn page in a separate browser window and – if you are logged into your LinkedIn user account – you can follow us on LinkedIn. The plug-in establishes a direct connection between your browser and the LinkedIn server. As a result, LinkedIn learns that you have visited our website and your IP address. In addition, if you are logged into your LinkedIn user account, LinkedIn is able to associate your visit to our website with you and your account. We would like to make clear that we have no knowledge of the content of the (personal) data transmitted or how it is used by LinkedIn. For more information, please see LinkedIn's Privacy Policy at: https://www.linkedin.com/legal/privacy-policy.</p> <p><br> <strong>Managing and deleting cookies</strong></p> <p>You can manage the use of cookies in different ways, depending on the browser you use.
