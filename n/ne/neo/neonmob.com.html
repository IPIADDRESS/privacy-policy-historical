    <h3>
        <strong>1. </strong>
        <strong>What information about me does NeonMob collect?</strong>
    </h3>
    <p><strong>Personal Information.</strong> NeonMob collects personal information only if you voluntarily
        choose to share such information with NeonMob. You may browse the Site and Mobile Apps without
        disclosing any personal information. However, in order for you to take advantage of particular
        opportunities provided through the Services, we may require that you furnish personal information.
        When
        you set up an account, sign up for newsletters or participate in surveys, NeonMob may collect
        personal
        information such as your name and email address. If you place an order on the Site or a Mobile App,
        NeonMob may request and collect personal information such as your name, e-mail address, mailing
        address,
        telephone number, and credit card information. You also may choose to send NeonMob personally
        identifying information in an e- mail message containing information or inquiries about NeonMob's
        Services. There are several other opportunities for you to share personal information about yourself
        with NeonMob on the Services. This may include information about you such as your interests, your
        name,
        and your mailing address and e-mail address. Submission of this information is strictly voluntary.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Anonymous or Aggregated Data.</strong> NeonMob collects and stores certain data about the use
        of NeonMob's Services on an aggregate and/or anonymous basis. NeonMob does not link this information
        to anything personally identifiable to you. NeonMob only uses this information for system
        administration and to help NeonMob develop ideas about how it might improve and optimize its
        Services.</p>
    <p><strong>Cookies and Other Technologies.</strong> Like many websites and mobile applications, we may
        use “cookies” to collect information. A cookie is a small data file that we transfer to your
        computer’s
        hard disk for record-keeping purposes. We may use cookies for two purposes. First, we may utilize
        persistent cookies to save your login information for future logins to the Site or Mobile Apps.
        Second,
        we may utilize session ID cookies to enable certain features of the Site or Mobile Apps, to better
        understand how you interact with the Site and Mobile Apps and to monitor aggregate usage by our
        users
        and web traffic routing on the Site and Mobile Apps. Unlike persistent cookies, session cookies are
        deleted from your computer when you log off from the Site, Mobile Apps and Services and then close
        your
        browser. Third party advertisers on the Site may also place or read cookies on your browser. You can
        instruct your browser, by changing its options, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before
        accepting a cookie from the websites you visit. If you do not accept cookies, however, you may not
        be
        able to use all portions or all functionalities of the Services. We and our service providers may
        also
        use "pixel tags," "web beacons," "clear GIFs," or similar means in connection with Site pages and
        the
        Mobile Apps and HTML-formatted e-mail messages to, among other things, track the actions of users
        and
        e-mail recipients, to determine the success of marketing campaigns and to compile aggregate
        statistics
        about Site and Mobile Apps usage and response rates. We may also engage one or more third party
        service
        providers to serve online advertisements on our behalf. They may use a “pixel tag” to collect
        anonymous
        information about your visits to this Site and to other websites, and they may use that information
        to
        target advertisements for goods and services. This information is collected anonymously, in a manner
        that does not personally identify you.</p>
    <p><strong>IP Address.</strong> When you visit and interact with the Site and Mobile Apps, NeonMob
        and/or third parties with whom NeonMob has contracted to provide services to NeonMob may collect IP
        Addresses. Your Internet Protocol (IP) address is a number that is automatically assigned to the
        computer that you are using by your Internet Service Provider (ISP). This number is identified and
        logged automatically in our server log files whenever you visit the Site, along with the time(s) of
        your
        visit(s) and the page(s) that you visited.</p>

        (collectively, the "Promotions") through the Services. We typically ask you for certain personal
        information when you enter and, if applicable, win a Promotion. We will use your email address to
        contact winners. You should carefully review the rules, if any, of each Promotion in which you
        participate through the Services, as they may contain additional important information about our use
        of personal information about you. To the extent that the terms and conditions of the Promotion
        rules concerning the treatment of personal information about you conflict with this Privacy Policy,
        the terms and conditions of the Promotion rules shall control.</p>
    <p><strong>Internal Business Purposes.</strong> We may also use personal information about you for our
        internal business purposes, such as data analysis, audits, order fulfillment, workflow planning and

        <strong>3. </strong>
        <strong>To whom does NeonMob disclose information about me?</strong>
    </h3>
    <p>NeonMob does not share, rent or sell your information to another company in ways other than disclosed
        in this Privacy Policy.</p>
    <p><strong>Third Party Agents and Service Providers.</strong> We work with third party agents and
        service providers who may provide services including but not limited to data analysis, payment
        processing, order fulfillment, printing and other services of an administrative nature. We may share
        personal information about you with third parties for the purpose of enabling these third parties to
        provide these types of services (for example, if you choose to make a purchase through the Site or

        purchase, including, without limitation, to process your credit card or payment account number or to
        ship products to you). NeonMob requires that its agents and service providers that have access to
        such
        personal information properly safeguard that personal information and use it only for the purpose
        that
        it was collected and not for their own promotional marketing.</p>
    <p><strong>E-mails to Friends.</strong> Please note that any personal information you provide in
        connection with sending messages regarding Services-related content to a friend through the Site or
        Mobile App, such as your name and your e-mail address, will be disclosed to your friend.</p>
    <p><strong>Promotions.</strong> We may share the personal information you provide in connection with
        Promotions with third party sponsors of such Promotions (irrespective of whether such Promotions are
        hosted by us), or otherwise in accordance with the rules applicable to such Promotion. You should
        carefully review the rules, if any, of each Promotion in which you participate through the Services,
        as they may contain additional important information about a sponsor's or other third party's use of
        personal information about you. To the extent that the terms and conditions of such rules concerning
        the treatment of personal information about you conflict with this Privacy Policy, the terms and
        conditions of such rules shall control.</p>
    <p><strong>Information Posted by Visitors.</strong> NeonMob may make available through the Services

        caution when deciding to disclose personal information, or any other information, on the Services.

    <h3>
        <strong>4. </strong>
        <strong>What does NeonMob do to protect the data transmitted through the Services?</strong>
    </h3>
    <p>We will take the appropriate legal, organizational, and technical measures to protect personal
        information to protect personal information, including sensitive information such as credit card
        information, from loss, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction.
        However, regardless of the effectiveness of our security measures, no security system is
        impenetrable. We ask that you do your part by, at a minimum, keeping any computer passwords you use
        to access the Internet strictly confidential. If at any time you believe that your interaction with
        the Services is no longer secure, please let us know as soon as possible.</p>

        to use any non-personally identifiable data derived from or incorporating your personal
        information.</p>


    <h3>
        <strong>6. </strong>

    </h3>
    <p>For your convenience, NeonMob may include links to or allow its Services to connect to third party
        sites, products and services (the “Third Party Services”). You should carefully review
        security/privacy policies of any Third Party Services accessible from or connected to our Services.
        Such Third Party Services have their own policies and data collection, use, and disclosure
        practices. Please consult each applicable third party’s policies and practice. NeonMob is not

        asks that the child's parent submit the information on his or her behalf. NeonMob strongly
        encourages
        parents to take an active role in their children's use of the Internet and to take appropriate steps
        to
        ensure a positive and safe experience.</p>

    </h3>
    <p>We will retain personal information about you for the period necessary to fulfill the purposes
        outlined in this Privacy Policy unless a longer retention period is required by law and/or
        regulations. We also take reasonable steps to ensure that personal information we process is
        reliable for its intended use, accurate, and complete as necessary to carry out the purposes
        described in this Privacy Policy.</p>

        <strong>12. </strong>
        <strong>Privacy Policy Changes </strong>
