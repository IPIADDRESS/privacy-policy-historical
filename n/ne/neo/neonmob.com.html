        information such as your name and email address. If you place an order on the Site or a Mobile App,
        NeonMob may request and collect personal information such as your name, e-mail address, mailing
        address,
        telephone number, and credit card information. You also may choose to send NeonMob personally
        identifying information in an e- mail message containing information or inquiries about NeonMob's
        Services. There are several other opportunities for you to share personal information about yourself
        with NeonMob on the Services. This may include information about you such as your interests, your
        name,
        and your mailing address and e-mail address. Submission of this information is strictly voluntary.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Anonymous or Aggregated Data.</strong> NeonMob collects and stores certain data about the use
        of NeonMob's Services on an aggregate and/or anonymous basis. NeonMob does not link this information
        to anything personally identifiable to you. NeonMob only uses this information for system
        administration and to help NeonMob develop ideas about how it might improve and optimize its
        Services.</p>
    <p><strong>Cookies and Other Technologies.</strong> Like many websites and mobile applications, we may
        use “cookies” to collect information. A cookie is a small data file that we transfer to your
        computer’s
        hard disk for record-keeping purposes. We may use cookies for two purposes. First, we may utilize
        persistent cookies to save your login information for future logins to the Site or Mobile Apps.
        Second,
        we may utilize session ID cookies to enable certain features of the Site or Mobile Apps, to better
        understand how you interact with the Site and Mobile Apps and to monitor aggregate usage by our
        users
        and web traffic routing on the Site and Mobile Apps. Unlike persistent cookies, session cookies are
        deleted from your computer when you log off from the Site, Mobile Apps and Services and then close
        your
        browser. Third party advertisers on the Site may also place or read cookies on your browser. You can
        instruct your browser, by changing its options, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before
        accepting a cookie from the websites you visit. If you do not accept cookies, however, you may not
        be
        able to use all portions or all functionalities of the Services. We and our service providers may
        also
        use "pixel tags," "web beacons," "clear GIFs," or similar means in connection with Site pages and
        the
        Mobile Apps and HTML-formatted e-mail messages to, among other things, track the actions of users
        and
        e-mail recipients, to determine the success of marketing campaigns and to compile aggregate
        statistics
        about Site and Mobile Apps usage and response rates. We may also engage one or more third party
        service
        providers to serve online advertisements on our behalf. They may use a “pixel tag” to collect
        anonymous
        information about your visits to this Site and to other websites, and they may use that information
        to
        target advertisements for goods and services. This information is collected anonymously, in a manner
        that does not personally identify you.</p>
    <p><strong>IP Address.</strong> When you visit and interact with the Site and Mobile Apps, NeonMob
        and/or third parties with whom NeonMob has contracted to provide services to NeonMob may collect IP
        Addresses. Your Internet Protocol (IP) address is a number that is automatically assigned to the
        computer that you are using by your Internet Service Provider (ISP). This number is identified and
        logged automatically in our server log files whenever you visit the Site, along with the time(s) of
        your
        visit(s) and the page(s) that you visited.</p>

    </h3>
    <p>NeonMob does not share, rent or sell your information to another company in ways other than disclosed

    <p><strong>Third Party Agents and Service Providers.</strong> We work with third party agents and

        purchase, including, without limitation, to process your credit card or payment account number or to

        such
        personal information properly safeguard that personal information and use it only for the purpose

        Promotions with third party sponsors of such Promotions (irrespective of whether such Promotions are
        hosted by us), or otherwise in accordance with the rules applicable to such Promotion. You should
        carefully review the rules, if any, of each Promotion in which you participate through the Services,
        as they may contain additional important information about a sponsor's or other third party's use of
        personal information about you. To the extent that the terms and conditions of such rules concerning
        the treatment of personal information about you conflict with this Privacy Policy, the terms and

        caution when deciding to disclose personal information, or any other information, on the Services.

    <h3>
        <strong>4. </strong>
        <strong>What does NeonMob do to protect the data transmitted through the Services?</strong>
    </h3>
    <p>We will take the appropriate legal, organizational, and technical measures to protect personal
        information to protect personal information, including sensitive information such as credit card
        information, from loss, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction.
        However, regardless of the effectiveness of our security measures, no security system is
        impenetrable. We ask that you do your part by, at a minimum, keeping any computer passwords you use
        to access the Internet strictly confidential. If at any time you believe that your interaction with
        the Services is no longer secure, please let us know as soon as possible.</p>


    <h3>

        <strong>How can I remove or transport my data?</strong>

    <p>You can remove any information you provide via the Services at anytime by logging in to your account.
        When you request that we delete your NeonMob account, your data will be permanently expunged from

        to use any non-personally identifiable data derived from or incorporating your personal
        information.</p>


    <h3>
        <strong>6. </strong>

    </h3>
    <p>For your convenience, NeonMob may include links to or allow its Services to connect to third party
        sites, products and services (the “Third Party Services”). You should carefully review
        security/privacy policies of any Third Party Services accessible from or connected to our Services.

    </h3>
    <p>While NeonMob encourages everyone to visit its Site, use its Mobile Apps and learn about the company
        and its technology and applications, NeonMob has no desire to collect information from those under
        the
        age of 13. Any instance of personal information about a child under the age of 13 being collected

        NeonMob
        asks that the child's parent submit the information on his or her behalf. NeonMob strongly
        encourages
        parents to take an active role in their children's use of the Internet and to take appropriate steps
        to
        ensure a positive and safe experience.</p>


    <h3>
        <strong>10. </strong>
        <strong>Where can I learn more about using the Internet and protecting my privacy?</strong>

    <h3>
        <strong>11. </strong>
        <strong>What are NeonMob's policies on data retention and integrity?</strong>
    </h3>
    <p>We will retain personal information about you for the period necessary to fulfill the purposes
        outlined in this Privacy Policy unless a longer retention period is required by law and/or
        regulations. We also take reasonable steps to ensure that personal information we process is
        reliable for its intended use, accurate, and complete as necessary to carry out the purposes
        described in this Privacy Policy.</p>


    <h3>
        <strong>12. </strong>
        <strong>Privacy Policy Changes </strong>
    </h3>
    <p>If NeonMob makes changes to this Privacy Policy, these changes will be posted on the Site in a timely
        manner. NeonMob reserves the right to modify this privacy statement at any time, so please review it
        frequently. You can determine when this Privacy Policy was last revised by referring to the "Last
        Updated" legend at the top of this page. Any changes to this Privacy Policy will become effective
