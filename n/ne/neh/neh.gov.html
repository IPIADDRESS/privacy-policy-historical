			  <p><b>Privacy Statement</b></p>
			  <p>Maintaining the privacy of our users is important to 
              us and our privacy policy is clear. We will collect <b>no personal 
              information</b> about you when you visit our Web site unless you 
              choose to provide that information to us. </p>
			  
			  
			  <a href="" name="PersonalInformation"></a>
			  <p><b>Personal Information</b></p>
			  
			  <p>If you provide us with information about yourself via e-mail or our 
			  Web site, your information will be used only for the purposes described 
			  at the point of collection, such as to send you information or to respond 
			  to your questions or comments.  If you provide contact information, NEH 
			  staff or our contractors or partners may contact you to clarify your comment 
			  or question, or to learn about your satisfaction with our services.</p>
			  
			  <p>We do not sell any personal information to third parties.  We never collect 
			  information or create individual profiles for commercial or marketing purposes.</p>
			  
			  <p>If you apply online to NEH programs, we use the information you submit to 
			  determine eligibility, assist reviewers in evaluating the application, select 
			  successful applicants, and administer the award program. Some of the reviewers 
			  will be outside the agency; we will take appropriate security measures with the 
			  information that we share with them. The information otherwise would be disclosed 
			  only for a governmental purpose or as required by law.</p>
			  
			  <p>We also may share information you give us with another government agency if your 
			  inquiry relates to that agency.  In other limited circumstances, such as responses to 
			  requests from Congress and private individuals, we may be required by law to disclose 
			  information you submit.</p>

			  <p><b>External Links</b></p>
			  
				<p>We provide links from our Webs ite to external Web sites because they provide

				<p>Once you link to another Web site, you are subject to the privacy policy and terms 
				and conditions of the new Web site.  We encourage you to read the privacy policies

				Links to .com, .net, and other commercial domains are acceptable if supportive of users' 
				needs and relevant to NEH's mission.  However, be advised that we cannot support a volume

				<p>We reserve the right to review links and add or remove links at any time for any reason 
				consistent with Federal policy or NEH guidance.  Links to external Web sites may be removed 
				if the Web sites lobby or solicit the Federal government on positions of fiscal or political 
				nature, or if they receive funds or revenue for volume of traffic delivered from NEH to the 
				external site where the site is not an official partner of NEH.  Except for partnerships, NEH 
				does not agree to reciprocal link arrangements.</p>
