              COMMITMENT TO YOUR PRIVACY</strong></p>
            <p> This site is owned and operated by Internet Dreams Ltd. Your privacy 
              on the Internet is of the utmost importance to us. At Internet Dreams 
              Ltd, we want to make your experience online satisfying and safe.</p>
            <p>Because we gather certain types of information about our users, 
              we feel you should fully understand the terms and conditions surrounding 
              the capture and use of that information. This privacy statement 
              discloses what information we gather and how we use it.</p>
            <p>Definition of the Information Internet Dreams Ltd gathers and keeps 
              track of.</p>
            <p>Internet Dreams Ltd gathers two types of information about users:</p>
            <ul>
              <li> Information that users provide through optional, voluntary 
                submissions. These are voluntary submissions to receive our electronic 
                newsletters, to participate in our message boards or forums, to 
                email a friend, and from participation in polls and surveys.</li>
              <li> Information Internet Dreams Ltd gathers through aggregated 
                tracking information derived mainly by tallying page views throughout 
                our sites. This information allows us to better tailor our content 
                to readers' needs and to help our advertisers and sponsors better 
                understand the demographics of our audience. Because Internet 
                Dreams Ltd derives its revenue mainly from sponsorships and advertising, 
                providing such aggregated demographic data is essential to keeping 
                our service free to users. Under no circumstances does Internet 
                Dreams Ltd divulge any information about an individual user to 
                a third party. </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Internet Dreams Ltd Gathers User Information In The Following Processes:</p>
            <p><strong><img src="../Resources/arrow_red.gif" width="13" height="14" align="absbottom"> 
              Optional Voluntary Information</strong></p>
            <p>We offer the following free services, which require some type of 
              voluntary submission of personal information by users:</p>
            <p>1. Electronic newsletters (Dispatches)</p>
            <p>We will offer a free electronic newsletter to users. Internet Dreams 
              Ltd gathers the email addresses of users who voluntarily subscribe. 
              Users may remove themselves from this mailing list by following 
              the link provided in every newsletter that points users to the subscription 
              management page. Users can also subscribe to the newsletters at 
              the time of registration.</p>
            <p>2. Message boards/forums</p>
            <p>Users of the site's Message Boards and Forums must register separately 
              for these services (both are free of charge) in order to post messages, 
              although they needn't register to visit the site. During registration 
              the user is required to supply a username, password, and email address.<br>
              <br>
              3. "E-mail this to a friend" Service</p>
            <p>Our site users can choose to electronically forward a link, page, 
              or documents to someone else by clicking "e-mail this to a 
              friend". The user must provide their email address, as well 
              as that of the recipient. This information is used only in the case 
              of transmission errors and, of course, to let the recipient know 
              who sent the email. The information is not used for any other purpose.</p>
            <p>4. Polling</p>
            <p>We may offer interactive polls to users so they can easily share 
              their opinions with other users and see what our audience thinks 
              about important issues. Opinions or other responses to polls are 
              aggregated and are not identifiable to any particular user. Internet 
              Dreams Ltd may use a system to "tag" users after they 
              have voted, so they can vote only once on a particular question. 
              This tag is not correlated with information about individual users.</p>
            <p>5. Surveys</p>
            <p>Internet Dreams Ltd may occasionally conduct user surveys to better 
              target our content to our audience. We sometimes share the aggregated 
              demographic information in these surveys with our sponsors, advertisers 
              and partners. We never share any of this information about specific 
              individuals with any third party.</p>
            <p><strong><img src="../Resources/arrow_red.gif" width="13" height="14" align="absbottom"> 
              CHILDREN</strong></p>
            <p>Consistent with the Federal Children's Online Privacy Protection 
              Act of 1998 (COPPA), we will never knowingly request personally 
              identifiable information from anyone under the age of 13 without 
              requesting parental consent.</p>
            <p><strong><img src="../Resources/arrow_red.gif" width="13" height="14" align="absbottom"> 
              USAGE TRACKING</strong></p>
            <p>Internet Dreams Ltd tracks user traffic patterns throughout all 
              of our sites. However, we do not correlate this information with 
              data about individual users. Internet Dreams Ltd does break down 
              overall usage statistics according to a user's domain name, browser 
              type, and MIME type by reading this information from the browser 
              string (information contained in every user's browser).</p>
            <p>Internet Dreams Ltd sometimes tracks and catalogs the search terms 
              that users enter in our Search function, but this tracking is never 
              associated with individual users. We use tracking information to 
              determine which areas of our sites users like and don't like based 
              on traffic to those areas. We do not track what individual users 
              read, but rather how well each page performs overall. This helps 
              us continue to build a better service for you.<br>

            <p>We may place a text file called a "cookie" in the browser

              you supply yourself. A cookie can't read data off your hard disk

              uses cookies to track user traffic patterns (as described above). 
              Our advertising system delivers a one-time cookie to better track 
              ad impressions and click rates.</p>

              USE OF INFORMATION</strong></p>
            <p>Internet Dreams Ltd uses any information voluntarily given by our 
              users to enhance their experience in our network of sites, whether 
              to provide interactive or personalized elements on the sites or 
              to better prepare future content based on the interests of our users.</p>
            <p>As stated above, we use information that users voluntarily provide 
              in order to send out electronic newsletters and to enable users 
              to participate in polls, surveys, message boards, and forums. We 
              send out newsletters to subscribers on a regular schedule (depending 
              on the newsletter), and occasionally send out special editions when 
              we think subscribers might be particularly interested in something 
              we are doing. Internet Dreams Ltd never shares newsletter mailing 
              lists with any third parties, including advertisers, sponsors or 
              partners.</p>
            <p>When we use tracking information to determine which areas of our 
              sites users like and don't like based on traffic to those areas. 
              We do not track what individual users read, but rather how well 
              each page performs overall. This helps us continue to build a better 
              service for you. We track search terms entered in Search function 
              as one of many measures of what interests our users. But we don't 
              track which terms a particular user enters.</p>
            <p>Internet Dreams Ltd creates aggregate reports on user demographics 
              and traffic patterns for advertisers, sponsors and partners. This 
              allows our advertisers to advertise more effectively, and allows 
              our users to receive advertisements that are pertinent to their 
              needs. Because we don't track the usage patterns of individual users, 
              an advertiser or sponsor will never know that a specific user clicked 
              their ad. We will not disclose any information about any individual 
              user except to comply with applicable law or valid legal process 
              or to protect the personal safety of our users or the public.<br>
