<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>Getting To Know Our Customers</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Network Solutions is in the business of putting people in touch with other people. That 
requires more than simply offering innovative technical services. It also requires that we 
understand you, our customer, and your needs. Indeed, we are the Internet's leading 
domain name registrar because we have taken the time to get acquainted with each one of 
our many customers.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We get to know you primarily through the information you provide to us when signing up 
for, or using, one or more of our services. The information you provide ranges from basic 
contact information, to payment information, to the technical coordinates of your host 
servers. The application for domain name registration services found at 
<a href="http://www.networksolutions.com">http://www.networksolutions.com</a> is a representative illustration of the information we 
request of you. All of the information we request from you when purchasing our services 
is obligatory unless otherwise noted on the relevant form. When you purchase our 
services, you agree to provide and maintain accurate, complete and updated information.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">After you've signed up for our services, we may be in communication with you about 
your account, technical questions you may have about services provided by us, or any 
other matter relating to those services. Those communications are essential to our 
relationship with you and to our ability to provide you with quality services that are 
responsive to your needs. At the same time, those communications give us helpful 
insights about you, your preferences and the ways in which we might improve our 
services. We therefore may maintain this information for future use.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Additionally, for operational and quality assurance purposes, we take note of whether and 
how you use the information and services that we provide, such as by recording site 
traffic patterns and by maintaining log files of users' access to site files. Finally, in order 
to provide our interactive services, such as the dot com and free mail services and various 
message boards, we store your messages to or from other people.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The information we receive from or about you is stored on systems designed to prevent 
the loss, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration or destruction of that 
information. We also encrypt your transmission of sensitive information to us (e.g., credit 
card numbers, account passwords) in the interest of heightened privacy protection and 
information integrity.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As a domain name registrar, we compile and maintain a publicly accessible registration 
database that includes basic information about each domain name registered with us, 
including the names, telephone numbers and e-mail addresses of individuals designated 
as points of contact for a given domain name. Whether or not applicable domain name 
registration fees have been paid is also publicly accessible. With the gradual continued 
privatization of the Domain Name System, and consistent with the rules or policies 
applicable to that system, or to comply with any changes in law or regulation, we may, if 
appropriate, take steps to restrict the accessibility and amount of personally identifying 
information available in the registration database.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>Information Corrections Or Changes</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">You have the ability to correct or change certain information in our records, such as your 
address and contact information. The instructions for doing this can be found on our Web 
site at <a href="http://www.networksolutions.com/makechanges/">http://www.networksolutions.com/makechanges/</a>. You may change this 
information at any time and as often as necessary. If you need assistance or have 
questions about correcting information, you can contact us via e-mail.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>How We Put Information To Good Use</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We use information about you for purposes of monitoring and improving our internal 
operations, as well as to ensure that we: (i) bill you properly, (ii) administer your account 
in accordance with your agreements with us and (iii) properly perform the services you 
have requested.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We also use the information we collect to monitor and improve our internal operations, as 
well as to improve the experience of users in our network of sites. For example, we may 
correlate Web site traffic information with data about individual users. We may also 
break down overall usage statistics according to customers' domain names, browser 
types, and MIME types by reading this information from the browser string (information 
contained in every user's browser).</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Another example of our use of information to enhance the experience of users in our 
network of sites is our reliance on cookie files. We use cookie files to make it easier for 
users to access our site or services. A cookie file is a small data file that certain Web sites 
write to your hard drive when you visit them. A cookie file can contain information such 
as a user ID that the site uses to track the pages you've visited. But the only personal 
information a cookie can contain is information you supply yourself. A cookie can't read 
data off your hard disk or read cookie files created by other sites. We use cookies to track 
user traffic patterns (as described above) when you register for Network Solutions 
services. When you register, we may use a cookie to store a unique, random user ID. We 
use this ID to identify you anonymously in our database and to track the pages you visit 
on our site.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">If you've set your browser to warn you before accepting cookies, you will receive the 
warning message with each cookie. You may refuse cookies by turning them off in your 
browser; however, some of our sites may require a cookie for access.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Our registrar business may use personal information contained in the registration 
database in its directory service, an online resource for locating information about 
companies on the Web which can be found at: <a href="http://www.dotcomdirectory.com">http://www.dotcomdirectory.com</a>. To 
remove information about you from this directory, just click on the "remove my listing" 
link at the bottom of the relevant listing(s) for instructions.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Finally, we use the information we collect to direct important notices and information 
affecting your account or services, as well as to provide general information that may be 
of interest to you, including newsletters, surveys, contest and sweepstake announcements, 
and information about our service or product offerings or the offerings of our business 
affiliates. You may opt out of receiving information from us simply by notifying us of 
your desire in accordance with the opt-out instructions contained in any information 
message you receive from us. Note, however, that in order to fulfill our service 
obligations to you, we must continue sending you notices and other important 
information affecting your account or services.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>With Whom We May Share Information</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">When you register or reserve a domain name through us, our registrar unit must disclose 
your domain name and its associated Internet Protocol ("IP") numbers to the appropriate 
registry in order to make your chosen domain name a functional address on the Internet. 
We are the registry for all second-level domain names in the .com, .org, .net and .edu top 
level domains ("TLDs"). Our registry unit discloses each registered domain name and its 
associated IP numbers ("TLD zone files") to TLD server administrators for the purpose 
of ensuring that the domain name operates as a functional address on the Internet. 
Consistent with the current rules and policies for the Domain Name System, our registry 
unit also discloses the TLD zone files to other interested persons, provided those persons 
agree, among other things, not to use the TLD zone files for improper purposes, including 
the transmission of unsolicited commercial e-mail.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We may share certain information about you with those of our vendors who are 
responsible for handling your account or performing other necessary services that you 
require. Although we may share sensitive financial information (i.e., credit card numbers, 
banking information), security information (e.g., account passwords) and personal 
communications (e.g., personal e-mail messages or message board postings) with such 
vendors where necessary and appropriate, we will not share such information with other 
third parties, except in response to formal requests (e.g., subpoena or court order) made in 
connection with litigation or arbitration proceedings directly relating to a domain name 
registration or other services we provide.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As noted above, our domain name registrar unit currently makes certain information 
about you available to the general public via our domain name registration database look-
up and directory services. These services give users access to such data on a query-by-
query basis.  Qualified persons may also access such data on a bulk basis provided they 
agree, among other things, not to use the data to enable or otherwise support the 
transmission of mass unsolicited commercial advertising or solicitations via email; or (ii) 
sell or redistribute the data to third parties.  If you do not want your personal information 
disclosed on a bulk basis, you may send us an email at <a href="mailto:privacy@networksolutions.com">privacy@networksolutions.com</a>.  
Include the words ìremove bulk accessî in the subject line of the e-mail and all the 
domain names for which you are the registrant in the body of the e-mail.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Additionally, we may share the information stored on that database, as well as other 
information that is not of a sensitive nature, with carefully selected business partners, 
including those who offer services that complement those provided by us or which may 
otherwise be of interest to you. If you do not want us to share information about you with 
our business partners, you may send us an e-mail at <a href="mailto:privacy@networksolutions.com">privacy@networksolutions.com</a>. 
Include the words "remove domain" in the subject line of the e-mail and all the domain 
names for which you are the registrant in the body of the e-mail. Please note, however, 
that, consistent with the current rules and policies for the Domain Name System, 
information about you must remain available in the publicly accessible registration 
database.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>Our Accountability To You</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">By purchasing our services, you obtain the protections of, and consent to the data 
processing practices described in, this Privacy Statement. When you purchase our 
services, you also represent to us that you have provided notice to, and obtained consent 
from, any third party individuals whose personal data you supply to us with regard to: (i) 
the purposes for which such third party's personal data have been collected, (ii) the 
intended recipients or categories of recipients of the third party's personal data, (iii) 
which of the third party's data are obligatory and which data, if any, are voluntary, and 
(iv) how the third party can access and, if necessary, rectify the data held about them.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In addition to the privacy protections that we provide, our employees, agents and 
business partners are independently responsible for ensuring compliance with this 
Privacy Statement, as described below.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>Employee Accountability</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Only those Network Solutions employees that have a legitimate business purpose for 
accessing and handling personal information obtained by us are given authorization to do 
so. The unauthorized access or use of such information by a Network Solutions employee 
is prohibited and constitutes grounds for disciplinary action.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Additionally, our information management systems are configured in such a way as to 
block or inhibit employees from accessing information that they have no authority to 
access.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>The Accountability of Network Solutions' Agents and Business Partners</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Our trusted vendors and business partners are responsible for processing or handling 
some of the information that we receive. These vendors and business partners are not 
authorized to use such information for purposes beyond those specified by us and are 
required to preserve the confidentiality with which we treat such information.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">If you feel that Network Solutions, or any of our agents, representatives or employees, is 
violating this Privacy Statement, please contact us via e-mail at
