					<span class="page_header">NAI WEBSITE PRIVACY POLICY</span><br>
					Effective 21 January 2009
					<p>
					</p><p>
					The Network Advertising Initiative's ("NAI's") website serves three basic functions. First, it is a free consumer portal for information about certain kinds of online advertising. Second, it is a non-commercial service site that allows consumers to "opt-out" of a specific kind of advertising practice used by NAI members. Finally, it contains password-protected pages where NAI members can access member-only materials. 
</p>
<p>
This Privacy Policy applies exclusively to information practices related to our website, <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org">www.networkadvertising.org</a>. Although this website contains links to other websites, please be aware that we are not responsible for the privacy practices of those, or any other sites. If you follow a link to another website you should carefully read their privacy policy. 
</p>
<p>
<b>Personal Information Collected on this Website</b><br>
No personally-identifiable information is collected on this website from consumers that browse the website for information or use the opt-out service. 
</p>
<p>
The only personally-identifiable information collected on this website is gathered on our "contact us" pages, where fields are provided so that you can provide your name, email address and phone contact information. We collect this information so that we can respond to the comments that you send to us via that form.
</p>
<p>
The NAI is the sole owner of all information collected on this site. The NAI will not rent, sell or share any personally-identifiable information about you with third parties for any reason except when required to assist in resolving an issue you raise with us or as required by law. 
</p>
<p>
We do not merge any of the personally-identifiable information collected via our contact form with other anonymous data collected on our website. 
</p>
<p>
<b>Anonymous Information Collected on this Website</b><br>
We record anonymous data such as traffic logs, number of visits or clicks on a given page, pages viewed or links to our site. We use IP addresses and cookies for gathering website statistics. We also store IP addresses on our server in the event that our site should become corrupted and it becomes necessary to discover the cause of this corruption. 
</p>
<p>
We aggregate this anonymous data as part of managing, maintaining and reporting on use of our website. We may share this anonymous data with third parties for the limited purpose of reporting on use of our website, or to comply with applicable law. We do not rent, sell or share any anonymous data collected on this website with third parties for marketing purposes. 
</p>
<p>
None of this anonymous data is linked to personally-identifiable information and we make no attempt to link IP addresses to the individuals who visit this site. 
</p>
<p>
<b>Cookies</b><br>
We use cookies on this website. 
</p>
<p>
Cookies are small chunks of data created by a web server, delivered through a web browser, and stored on your computer. They provide a means for websites that you visit to keep track of your online patterns and preferences, as well as identify you as a return visitor. Cookies make the personalization of your web experiences possible, so that you do not need to re-enter your information from scratch upon each visit to a given website. 
</p>
<p>
We serve a cookie from our website when members log in to member-only pages, so that they can navigate those pages on the site. A randomly-generated anonymous identifier is assigned to that cookie to enable this process. 
</p>
<p>
We also serve a cookie to note the anonymous web traffic described in the previous section of this Privacy Policy. 
</p>
<p>
Finally, NAI member companies serve cookies via this website to allow consumers to opt-out of the Online Preference Marketing ("OPM") practices of those member companies. To enable a consumer to opt out, the NAI or member company must set an "opt-out cookie" on the consumer's browser. At this site, the setting of that opt-out cookie occurs when the consumer chooses, via one of our opt-out pages, not to participate in the OPM practices of an NAI member company. The only way that an NAI member company will be able to know that a consumer has chosen not to participate in OPM is if the member company can read an opt-out cookie on that consumer's browser. To learn more about how our opt-out process works, <a href="../managing/opt_out.asp">click here</a>. 
</p>
<p>
As part of the opt-out process, please note that NAI members serve cookies on our website. 
</p>
<p>
No personally-identifiable information is collected by or linked to any of the cookies delivered on our site. 
</p>
<p>
You have the ability to manage the use of cookies on your computer using controls in your web-browser. To learn more about how to manage cookies, visit <a href="http://www.allaboutcookies.org/" target="_blank">http://www.allaboutcookies.org/</a>. 
</p>
<p>
<b>Changes to Our Privacy Policy</b><br>
As our organization, membership and services evolve, this Privacy Policy may be revised to reflect those changes, where applicable. We therefore reserve the right to amend this Privacy Policy at any time, for any reason. Notice of such amendments will be posted as an updated Privacy Policy on this website, and an effective date will be indicated. Users are encouraged to check our site frequently to review the current Privacy Policy in effect.
