Consequently, Netvibes declines all liability for the content of third party websites or the practices of these third parties concerning the protection of Personal Data.</p><p>It is therefore Your responsibility to inform yourself as to these third parties' privacy policies.</p><h3>VIII. Transfer of personal data</h3><p>If You are accessing the Site from a location outside of the European Union, please note that through Your continued use of the Site, which is governed by French law, the corresponding Terms of Services and this Privacy Policy, You are transferring Your Personal Data to the European Union and You consent to that transfer.</p><p>As a member of a global group, Netvibes is able to use available technology to efficiently manage Personal Data and obtain such Personal Data online or otherwise throughout its affiliates’ international operations.&nbsp; Personal Data may be collected through the Site and subsequently disclosed to and used by an affiliate of Netvibes (along with Netvibes, “3DS Group Companies”) for the purposes stated in section 4 of this Privacy Policy.</p><p>Please note that Netvibes may transfer Your Personal Data outside of the European Union, as long as before transferring Your Personal Data, Netvibes has ascertained that non European Union entities, including Netvibes’ affiliates and subsidiaries, offer an adequate level of protection in accordance with European legislation.</p><p>Where Netvibes has knowledge that a third party to which Netvibes has provided Personal Data for the purposes listed in section 4 above, is using or disclosing Personal Data contrary to this Privacy Policy or to applicable laws, Netvibes will take reasonable steps to prevent or stop such use or disclosure.</p><p>You will have the opportunity to decide whether You authorize Netvibes to use Your Personal Data for a purpose differing from the purpose for which it was originally collected.<br>Netvibes will also disclose Personal Data to third parties if Netvibes determines that such disclosure is necessary for technical reasons (such as hosting services by a third party) or to protect Netvibes’ legal interests (such as in the event of sale of assets to a third company, or change of control or total or partial liquidation of Netvibes). Additionally, Netvibes may share Your personal Data with the reseller assigned to You or in the territory where You are located. Netvibes may also share Your personal data with business partners when Netvibes and the business partner sponsor an event together or participate in a marketing promotion together and in which You engage.</p><p>Netvibes may also disclose Your Personal Data if required by law or if Netvibes believes in good faith that such disclosure is reasonably necessary to comply with legal process (for example, a warrant, a subpoena, or other court order) or protect the rights, property, or personal safety of Netvibes, our customers, or the public.</p><p>These transfers may be transmitted over the Internet, via mail, via facsimile, or by any other method that Netvibes determines is appropriate and in accordance with applicable law.</p><h3>IX. Right of access to and rectification of the data</h3><p>Netvibes will take reasonable steps to ensure that the Personal Data collected is used for the purposes stated in this Privacy Policy and that such Personal Data is correct and up to date.</p><p>You have a right to access Your Personal Data.&nbsp;In addition,&nbsp;You have&nbsp;a right to request the rectification, completion, update and erasure of Your Personal Data. You also have a right to obtain a copy of the Personal Data stored by Netvibes.</p><p>If You have an account, You may be able to exercise Your rights of access to and rectification of the Personal Data by logging on to Your account.

Data security and recipients</h3><p>Netvibes undertakes to ensure the protection and security of Personal Data that You choose to communicate, in order to ensure the confidentiality of Your Personal Data and prevent Your Personal Data from being distorted, damaged, destroyed or disclosed to unauthorized parties.</p><p>Netvibes maintains reasonable physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to protect Personal Data from loss, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, modification and destruction.&nbsp; As part of those safeguards, Netvibes employs sophisticated technology designed to protect Personal Data during its transmission and prevent transmission errors or unauthorized acts of third parties.&nbsp; However, while Netvibes strives to protect Your Personal Data, in light of the inevitable risks of data transmission over the internet, Netvibes cannot guarantee full protection against any error occurring during the course of Personal Data transmission that is beyond Netvibes' reasonable control.</p><p>Since Personal Data may be confidential, access is limited to employees, contractors and resellers of 3DS Group Companies who have a need to know such data in carrying out their tasks. All the people who have access to Your Personal Data are bound by a duty of confidentiality and subject to disciplinary actions and/or other sanctions if they fail to meet these obligations.</p><p>However, it is important for You to exercise caution to prevent unauthorized access to Your Personal Data. You are responsible for the confidentiality of Your password and information appearing on Your account. Consequently, You must ensure that You log out of Your session in the event of shared use of a computer.</p><h3>XI. Dispute resolution</h3><p>Although Netvibes has put in place reasonable safeguards to protect Personal Data, we recognize that there is no method of transmitting or storing Personal Data that is completely secure.</p><p>However, Netvibes is committed to ensure the privacy of Personal Data: if You have a reason to believe that the security of Your Personal Data has been compromised or misused, You should contact Netvibes via the following address:&nbsp;security@netvibes.com.</p><p>Netvibes will investigate and attempt to resolve complaints regarding use and disclosure of Personal Data in accordance with the principles contained in this Privacy Policy.</p><p>Unauthorized access to Personal Data or the improper use of Personal Data may constitute offenses under local law and under the regulations in force within each company in the Netvibes group.</p><h3>XII.
