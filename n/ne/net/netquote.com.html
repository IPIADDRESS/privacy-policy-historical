    <p>Whether  it’s auto, home, renter’s, life, health or business insurance, NetQuote offers  you the complete choice advantage.</p>
    <p>Since 1989,  NetQuote has provided millions of consumers with a free, simple, and effective  way to shop for insurance. As a leading online marketplace for insurance,  NetQuote works with a combination of local agents, regional and national  carriers to ensure that you are provided with a wide variety of responses to  your request for a quote.</p>
    Helping  you save money is important but so is your privacy.&nbsp; This policy outlines our commitment to  protecting your information.<br>
  <br>
  <span class="header_14point_bold">Your Privacy is Important to Us</span>
  <br>
  <br>
  At NetQuote, your privacy is our chief concern.  We understand that you entrust us with your private information to help us  match you with an insurance agent (we refer to all of these as  "Agents") who can meet your needs. In exchange for your trust, you  expect and deserve our commitment to treat your information with respect.&nbsp; Rest assured that we protect your privacy.  Under no circumstances will NetQuote sell or share any personal information  about you to or with any person or organization except: as authorized by you,  to participating agents or other parties involved in your transaction, or as  may be required by law or court order. The Privacy Policy below describes the  standards we adhere to in handling information about you and your insurance  quote request.<br>

  <p class="header_14point_bold">1.	&nbsp;Who We Are and What We Do</p>
  <p>NetQuote is  the leading online marketplace connecting consumers with insurance agents to  compete for their business across a variety of insurance policy types.&nbsp; NetQuote has been in business since  1989.&nbsp; NetQuote is not an insurance  agency and does not provide quotes directly to consumers.&nbsp; Rather, NetQuote is  a free matching service that instantly connects you with our nationwide network  of quality insurance agents.&nbsp; </p>
  <p>After  you submit your quote request via our web site, NetQuote immediately matches  you to local and national agents who can meet your insurance needs.&nbsp; We create this connection by emailing you the  list of matching agents and their contact information as well as passing your  information to the agents.&nbsp; Your matching  agents will use the information you provided in your quote request to run your  quote and contact you with the details.&nbsp;  Sometimes, NetQuote does not have a matching agent based on your  location and insurance needs.&nbsp; In this  event, your information may be passed to one of our partner copmanies to ensure  that you receive as many competitive quotes as possible.&nbsp; </p>
  NetQuote  does not charge a fee to use our service.&nbsp;  NetQuote is paid a fee by the insurance agents who purchase leads  through our service.
  <a name="Information" id="Information"></a>
  <p class="header_14point_bold">2. &nbsp;Information Collected</p>
  <p><b>Personal Information</b><br><br>
    NetQuote collects the following personal  information in each of our quote requests.&nbsp;  We pass this information on to your matching agents so they can generate  accurate quotes for you.</p>

  <p><i>* This information is not required, but is helpful in generating your quotes.</i></p>
  <p class="Arial_12_point_bold">Technical information</p>
  <p>We collect and track certain technical  information to ensure that your consumer experience is a beneficial one.&nbsp; We may also use technical information to  store your preferences and make future visits to our site quicker for you.
  </p><ul>
    <li>Cookies – a cookie is a small file stored on a  user’s computer that contains information about the user.&nbsp; We use either session ID cookies (which  terminate once a browser is closed) or persistent cookies (which are small text  files stored on a user’s hard drive for an extended period of time).&nbsp; Cookies allow us to see how and when you use  our sites, but they cannot be used to track personal information such as email  address or phone number. &nbsp;Cookies also  allow us to store the personal preferences that you set during each visit to  our sites which can speed up your future visits.</li><br>
    <li>Log files – NetQuote uses log files to track how  our sites are being accesses and used.&nbsp;  Log files track anonymous user information such as IP addresses, browser  types, Internet service providers, referring and exit pages, platform type,  date and time stamps, and number of clicks to, from, and within our sites.&nbsp; Web logs are tracked only on NetQuote’s  servers and do not place anything on your computer.</li><br>
    <li>Information from Banner Ads – if you arrive at  NetQuote.com through a banner ad, NetQuote can track where you arrived from, as  well as clicks that might have impacted our servers.&nbsp; This information is anonymous and cannot be  used to gather personal information about you.</li><br>
    </ul>
  <p></p>
  <p class="Arial_12_point_bold">Survey information</p>
  <p>NetQuote uses survey information to gather  feedback from consumers who have filled out insurance quote requests on our web  site.&nbsp; We use this information to track  our customer satisfaction and make improvements to our service. This survey,  which will arrive approximately one week after a quote request has been filled  out, is completely voluntary and anonymous.&nbsp;  No personal information will be asked of you.</p>
  <p class="Arial_12_point_bold">Information from the "Contact Us" section of the web site</p>
  <p>If you decide to communicate with us through the  “Contact Us” section on our web site, we may ask you for personal information  such as your name, email address, or phone number.&nbsp;&nbsp; This information is not sold to any third parties.&nbsp; Your information may, however, be shared with  outside sources in order to resolve any problems you may have.</p>
  <p class="Arial_12_point_bold">Information gathered from agents</p>
  <p>Our agent web site contains preliminary  information for insurance agents who might like to join our network.&nbsp; If you are an agent and submit information  through the “Request More Information” page, your email address and phone  number will be used for contact purposes but not shared with any outside  parties.</p>
  <p class="Arial_12_point_bold">Information gathered from affiliates</p>
  <p>The affiliate section of our web site contains  preliminary information for people who might like to join our affiliate  network.&nbsp; If you sign up as an affiliate  we will gather personal information such as name, postal address, and phone  number.&nbsp; This information is used to  contact you with information such as payment delivery notifications and a  monthly affiliate newsletter.&nbsp; This  information is never shared with any outside parties.<a name="HowYour" id="HowYour"></a></p>
  <p class="header_14point_bold">3. &nbsp;How Your Information is Used</p>
  <p class="Arial_12_point_bold">How we share information with agents</p>
  <p>When you submit a quote request with NetQuote,  your information is used to match you with an average of three to four  qualified, licensed agents who can best serve your insurance needs.&nbsp; In the event that we cannot match you with an  agent, your information may be passed on to one of our partner  companies in an effort to ensure you receive as many competitive quotes as  possible.</p>
  <p class="Arial_12_point_bold">How we internally use technical information to improve marketing</p>
  <p>NetQuote uses technical information such as  cookies and web logs to study how our sites are being used.&nbsp; We can also use cookies to track your  preferences so that when you return to our web site, you can navigate more  easily without having to re-enter certain information.&nbsp; By analyzing the data that cookies and web  logs provide, we can determine how to improve our web sites and banner ad  campaigns to better serve our customers.</p>
  <p class="Arial_12_point_bold">How we use survey data to measure satisfaction</p>
  <p>NetQuote uses information from our consumer  satisfaction survey to better understand the consumer experience and improve  our services.&nbsp; Personal information is  not visible to anyone as this survey is completely anonymous.</p>
  <p class="Arial_12_point_bold">Other uses of your information by third parties</p>
  <ul>
  	<li>Partner companies – in the event that no NetQuote  agents can serve your insurance needs, the information from your quote request  may be passed to one of our partner companies.&nbsp;  We feel it would be poor customer service to fail to provide a quote  merely because no matching agents are available.&nbsp; In these circumstances, we pass your quote  request only to partner companies that we have an existing contractual  relationship.&nbsp; NetQuote only enters into  relationships with reputable companies and our contract requires they follow  applicable laws and not misuse the data provided to them.&nbsp; Any contact from partner companies is not  covered under this policy, nor are any further communications you may have with  agents from those partner companies.</li><br>
  	<li><span class="header_14point_bold"><a name="Communications"></a></span>Companies that perform information processing on  our behalf – NetQuote partners with companies who manage our email systems and  conduct surveys on our behalf.&nbsp; Your  personal information is shared with these companies on a limited basis so that  we can create and target our marketing campaigns.</li><br>
  	<li>Law Enforcement – NetQuote will share your  personal information in response to law enforcement officers, government  personnel, court order or subpoena.&nbsp; This  information will only be shared in order to comply with a legal obligation.</li><br>
  </ul>
  <p class="header_14point_bold">4. Communications You Can Expect</p>
  <p class="Arial_12_point_bold">Confirmation email</p>
  <p>Minutes  after you submit a quote request through NetQuote, you will receive a  confirmation email.&nbsp; This email will include  your unique quote request ID, a link to your list of matching agents and  helpful information to aid you in making your insurance choices.&nbsp; Note that the agents contained in your  matching list will be those responding to you with your customized quote(s).</p>
  In  the event that a match cannot be made, you will receive an email informing you  that no agents meet your quote request requirements.&nbsp; This email will be sent within a matter of  hours after you complete a quote request.
  <p class="Arial_12_point_bold">Follow up calls and emails from agents</p>
  <p>After submitting a quote request through  NetQuote, your quote request is matched with qualified, licensed agents.&nbsp; These agents may contact you via the information  that you provided in your quote request.</p>
  <p class="Arial_12_point_bold">Customer satisfaction surveys</p>
  <p>Approximately one week after you submit a quote  request through NetQuote, you will receive an anonymous customer service  satisfaction survey.&nbsp; This survey is  short and completely voluntary.&nbsp; Also, we  may, from time-to-time, send additional surveys to better understand your  customer experience so we can enhance our service.&nbsp; Again, participation is voluntary and you can  unsubscribe from this communication at any time.</p>
  <p class="Arial_12_point_bold">Customer Communications</p>
  <p>After submitting a quote request with NetQuote,  you’ll receive monthly customer tip emails with helpful tips and information to  help you continue to make informed insurance decisions.&nbsp; In addition, NetQuote provides expiration  alert emails that notify consumers about their policy renewal dates.&nbsp; If you wish to no longer receive these  communications, you can opt-out using the unsubscribe link available in every  email communication.&nbsp; This will ensure  you will be removed from future NetQuote communications.</p>
  <p class="Arial_12_point_bold">Newsletter</p>
  <p>You have the opportunity to sign up for  NetQuote’s monthly newsletter on the last page of each quote request, within  the newsletter center within NetQuote.com, or on the designated areas located  throughout the site.&nbsp; After signing up to  receive this newsletter, you will receive a welcome email to confirm your  subscription and provide you an opportunity to unsubscribe for any  reason.&nbsp; You will receive the NetQuote  e-newsletter once a month to your email inbox.&nbsp;  You can opt out of this newsletter at any time by clicking the Unsubscribe  link in the email.<a name="disclaimer" id="disclaimer"></a></p>
