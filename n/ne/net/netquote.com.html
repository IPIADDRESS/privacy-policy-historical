    NetQuote Inc<br>
    1860 Blake Street, 9th Floor<br>
    Denver, CO 80202<br>
    800-795-2886</p>

  <p class="header_14point_bold">3. COLLECTION OF INFORMATION</p>
  <p class="Arial_12_point_bold">Personal Information Collection </p>
  <p class="Arial_12point_reg">We collect personal information that you provide to us over the Internet (especially via our websites, generally located within our addresses under the domain www.netquote.com) (collectively, our “Sites”), by email, regular mail, use of the “Contact Us” function on our Sites, your responses to surveys, or by phone, from third parties that give your information to us and through other legal means. This is often called personally identifiable information if it identifies you and is not generally available to the public, and it may include information about your family as well as your own information. For the purposes set forth in greater detail below, we may collect information in any of the following categories: your first and last names, physical and e-mail addresses, phone number, driver’s license number, Social Security number, date of birth, gender, marital status, type of vehicle, information about your driving habits and record, certain health-related information and personally identifiable information about other drivers who may be included on your insurance policy. Depending on the nature of your relationship with us, we may collect financial information from you, such as credit card numbers, billing addresses and expiration dates, in order to facilitate the billing and payment of your accounts. If a third party provides us your information, then we take reasonable steps to establish that the third party had the authority to provide such information to us.</p>
  <p class="Arial_12point_reg">For information you submit to us, we attempt to notify you which categories of information are required and which are optional. If you do not wish to provide us personal information that we request, then you should not provide such personal information – you are not required to do so. However, if you do not provide us with certain information that we require, then we may not be able to respond to your requests, process your applications, provide you complete services or otherwise carry out the business contemplated between you and NetQuote. If you have any concerns about the nature of the information we collect, you may contact us at the above address.</p>
  <p class="Arial_12_point_bold">Certain Other Forms of Information Collected on the Internet </p>
  <p class="Arial_12point_reg">If you use our Sites, we may collect non-personal information about your use of the Sites (such as IP addresses, domains, browser type and version, and operating system) (“Use Data”). Use Data may include aggregated information about you that does not identify you personally (for example, information about users from zip codes, or the average age of certain users, etc.). Use Data may also include the following types of information:</p>
  <p class="Arial_12point_reg"><span class="Arial_12_point_bold">Cookies</span><br>
  A cookie is a small file stored on a user’s computer that contains information about the user. We may use either session ID cookies and/or persistent cookies. For the session ID cookie, once a user closes the browser, the cookie simply terminates. A persistent cookie is a small text file stored on a user’s hard drive for an extended period of time. Persistent cookies can be removed by following Internet browser help file directions. By showing how and when you use our Sites, cookies help us see which areas are popular and which are not and help in targeting information based on your interests. Cookies also allow us to store the personal preferences that you set during each visit to our Sites, which in turn allows us to speed up your future activities at our Sites. Most browsers are initially set to accept cookies. You can set your browser to notify you when you have received a cookie, giving you the opportunity to decide whether to accept it. You have the option to reject our cookies and still use our Sites, but you may not be able to access or use some of the features we offer on our Sites, including submitting information to receive insurance quotes. </p>
  <p class="Arial_12point_reg"><span class="Arial_12_point_bold">Log Files</span><br>
    Like most standard website servers, we use log files, which are files that track how our Sites are accessed and used and what requests are made of our servers. This may include keeping track of internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser types, internet service providers (ISP), referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, and number of clicks to, from and within our Sites.</p>
  <p class="Arial_12_point_bold">Other Forms of Information Collected by Other Means</p>
  <p class="Arial_12point_reg">We may collect non-personal information from you via sources other than the Internet. Such information may include, for example, your responses to surveys we send to you, and other information or questions about your experience with, or questions about, us that you may submit or ask in anonymous form or that we dissociate from any of your personal information. </p><br>
  <p class="header_14point_bold">4. USE OF INFORMATION</p>
  <p class="Arial_12_point_bold">Use of Your Personal Information by NetQuote</p>
  <p class="Arial_12point_reg">We use your personal information to provide you with any information you request from us and to address any communications that you may have initiated or authorized. We will also use your information to fulfill our obligations to you pursuant to any contracts or agreements that you may enter into with us, or in connection with your use of our Sites. For example, if you are a consumer and you submit personal information in order to receive insurance information, we will use your personal information to process your request, including by providing your personal information to third parties as discussed in more detail below. </p>
  <p class="Arial_12point_reg">We may also use your information to provide assistance or support with respect to your use of our services or Sites (including surveys and the like), to troubleshoot problems and to resolve disputes that may arise. Further, we may use your information to improve our content, advertising or services, or to analyze trends or to customize the display or format of our marketing content or Sites. </p>
  <p class="Arial_12point_reg">From time to time, we may use your information to send you information about our services and offerings, and about certain products and services of selected third parties, in which we think you may be interested. It is our policy to send you such information only with your consent. </p>
  <p class="Arial_12point_reg">We will not use your information or send you information if you have notified us of your preference not to have your information so used, or not to receive such information, or when we are prohibited by law from doing so.</p>
  <p class="Arial_12point_reg">NetQuote stores your information in order to fulfill its obligations to you and otherwise in connection with the uses and practices described in this Policy. It is our policy not to keep records of your personal information other than for as long as is reasonably necessary in connection with such uses and practices.</p>
  <p class="header_14point_bold">Use of Your Personal Information by Insurance Providers</p>
  <p class="Arial_12point_reg">By submitting your personal information to us as part of a request for information about insurance quotes and policies, you authorize us to provide that information to various insurance agents, insurance companies and related third parties that participate in our insurance quote distribution network and operations (“Insurance Providers”). If you submit your personal information to us in order to receive quotes and information about insurance and insurance products, we will provide that information to Insurance Providers, based on the specific criteria established by individual Insurance Providers. The Insurance Providers may provide your personal information to their vendors, suppliers and insurance carriers in order to generate price and other information relevant to insurance policies that you have requested, and the Insurance Providers may use the information to contact you directly about your inquiries regarding insurance products. Furthermore, Insurance Providers may use your personal information to obtain additional information about you related to your inquiry, which may include the receipt of “insurance score” or similar information about you. </p>
  <p class="Arial_12point_reg">We use reasonable efforts – such as contractual obligations – to ensure that the Insurance Providers are bound to protect your personal information to at least the degree established in this Policy. Additionally, it is our policy to require Insurance Providers to use reasonably secure means of receiving and processing your personal information. </p>
  
  <p class="Arial_12point_reg"><span class="Arial_12_point_bold">IMPORTANT:</span> You should be aware that after an Insurance Provider contacts you directly, any information you provide to the Insurance Provider – which may be duplicative of the personal information you initially submitted through NetQuote – will no longer be covered by this Policy, and you should verify the individual Insurance Provider’s privacy policies and practices. NetQuote has no control over these policies and practices. Also be aware that the Insurance Providers may use the personal information they acquire about you from NetQuote in connection with other information they acquire about you (from credit reporting companies, etc.) as well as information you provide them. NetQuote cannot and will not be responsible or liable for any of your personal information that you provide directly to Insurance Providers after the Insurance Provider contacts you or that they acquire from sources other than NetQuote.</p>
  <p class="header_14point_bold">Other Uses of Your Personal Information by Third Parties </p>
  <p class="Arial_12point_reg">In addition to the foregoing uses by Insurance Providers, to the extent permitted by law and regulations, we may share your personal identification information with the following categories of entities and/or under the following circumstances:</p>
  <p class="Arial_12point_reg">- Third parties that perform information processing on our behalf, such as companies that manage our email systems, that conduct surveys for customer satisfaction, that help us send information regarding companies, products or services in which we believe you may be interested, or that provide analyses of use of our services or Sites.<br>
    - Our corporate affiliates and other entities that operate websites for NetQuote.<br>
    - In response to a request by law enforcement or other governmental personnel or court order or subpoena; in order to comply with a legal obligation; to protect the integrity of our company if we believe that a user has committed unlawful or otherwise harmful acts; or to protect our interests in connection with a legal proceeding.<br>
    - In emergency situations to protect health or safety; or if we believe such disclosure is in your vital interest.<br>
    - If we obtained your information from public sources.<br>
    - Third parties with whom we have advertising or promotional relationships (provided that we are not otherwise restricted from making such disclosures).<br>
    - In connection with any merger or consolidation with, or sale of substantially all of our assets to an affiliated entity or third party, provided that such party agrees to comply with our Policy or you are given a choice if such party would like to use such information in a manner materially different from that disclosed in our Policy. </p>
  <p class="Arial_12point_reg">NetQuote does not sell, rent or disclose your personal information to third parties for their own marketing purposes except as authorized by and as set forth in this Policy. </p>
  <p class="header_14point_bold">Use of Use Data and other Internet-Based Information</p>
  <p class="Arial_12point_reg">We use aggregated (i.e., non-personal) Use Data for purposes of site administration and to compile information about usage of our Sites and services. For example, we use cookie information to track from what computers applications have been submitted in order to track and prevent potentially fraudulent submissions. We may share aggregated information (which does not contain your personal information) with third parties, such as advertisers and marketing partners.</p>
  <p class="Arial_12point_reg">We may combine personal information with Use Data to help us serve you better in connection with your use of our services or Sites, and to respond to your requests for technical assistance (e.g., we may record which web browser you use in order to help respond to your questions with difficulties using our Sites).</p><br>  <p class="header_14point_bold">5. SECURITY</p>
  <p class="Arial_12point_reg">We have taken appropriate technical and organizational measures to help prevent unauthorized access, maintain data security, and to make proper use of the information that we collect – for example, we collect personal information from you only through secured connections (which you can verify on certain Internet browsers by looking for a closed lock symbol on the lower status bars on the browser window). Additionally, it is our policy to comply with all laws that govern our collection and use of your personal information. <span class="Arial_12_point_bold">However</span>, no transmission of data over the Internet is guaranteed to be completely secure and we cannot guarantee the security of any information you provide to us. For example, third parties may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private communications. Therefore, although we use industry standard practices to protect your privacy, we do not promise or guarantee, and you should not expect, that your personal information or communications with us will always remain private.</p><br>
  <p class="header_14point_bold">6. MODIFYING OR DELETING PERSONAL INFORMATION</p>
  <p class="Arial_12point_reg">We intend to keep your information accurate and up to date. You have the opportunity to review and correct any of your information that we may have, or to restrict the uses we make of your information. </p>
  <p class="Arial_12point_reg">In order to review or correct your information that we have on file, please take the following steps: </p>
  <p class="Arial_12point_reg">- Contact us via <a href="http://extranet.netquote.com/MarketingMedia/optout.html">http://extranet.netquote.com/MarketingMedia/optout.html</a>.<br>
    - Give us your name and email address, together with any information that might help us more effectively serve or communicate with you<br>
    - Let us know how we can help you – if you would like to review your information, etc.<br>
    - Let us know the most convenient way for us to communicate with you (email, phone, etc.)</p>
  <p class="Arial_12point_reg">After reviewing your information, if you request that certain information be amended or deleted, we will use reasonable efforts to respond to your request in a timely manner. Please be aware that even if you request that your information be removed from our systems, such information may never be completely removed due to technical and legal constraints, including backup and disaster recovery systems, as well as the need to keep some information to track and record your requests. For example, if you provided us with information or made requests that we must by law maintain records of, there is certain information that we must maintain in order to properly service your account and to comply with law. We may retain certain information in our sole discretion that we need to process your information in order to fulfill your requests, to maintain our records in accordance with industry practices, to resolve disputes, to troubleshoot problems, to enforce this Policy, or for other valid business reasons; however, it is not our policy to retain more information for longer than is necessary. We will not remove your non-personal Use Data from our aggregated files, and you will not be able to review or amend your non-personally identifiable Use Data. </p>
  <br>  <p class="header_14point_bold">7. MINORS</p>
  <p class="Arial_12point_reg">Our Sites and services are not directed toward individuals under sixteen years old (“Minors”) nor do we knowingly collect information from Minors. </p><br>
  <p class="header_14point_bold">8. LINKS TO THIRD PARTY SITES</p>
  <p class="Arial_12point_reg">Our Sites may contain links to other sites. Be aware that we are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our Site and to read the privacy statements of each and every website that collects personal information. </p><br>  <p class="header_14point_bold">9. POLICIES APPLICABLE TO RESTRICTED AREAS WITHIN THE SITES</p>
  <p class="Arial_12point_reg">Certain restricted areas within the Sites (as defined below), such as areas available only to registered insurance agents or marketing partners of NetQuote, may have additional or different terms and conditions with respect to matters addressed in this Policy. If you are granted access to any such restricted areas, you should consult the privacy policies posted on those areas. </p><br>  <p class="header_14point_bold">10. NOTIFICATION OF CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY</p>
  <p class="Arial_12point_reg">We may, at our sole discretion, revise this Policy at any time in a manner consistent with applicable law and regulations. When we revise this Policy, including changes to NetQuote’s use of your personal information, we will incorporate the revisions into this Policy and will revise the “last revised” date at the top of this web page. We recommend that you regularly visit this Policy in order to remain informed about any changes that we may implement.</p></td>
