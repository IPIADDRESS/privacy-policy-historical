					<p>This Privacy Statement discloses the privacy practices for NetIQ Corporation ("NetIQ"), and for its web site (www.NetIQ.com) and localized versions of that site, including the type of personal information collected and tracked, how the information is used, and with whom the information is shared. This Privacy Statement is available with one click from most NetIQ.com web pages.</p>
					<p><strong>NetIQ is committed to protecting your privacy</strong>. Regardless of the nature or source of your personal information in our possession, NetIQ will use that information solely for internal business purposes. We will not sell your personal information. If we share your personal information with third parties performing services for us, or acting on our behalf, we will  contractually require them to protect your information.</p>
                    <p><strong>Cookies Notice</strong>: This site uses cookies, as described in the Cookies paragraph below. You can control cookies via settings on your systems (details available at: <a href="http://www.aboutcookies.org">www.aboutcookies.org</a>).</p>

                    <h4>Collection of Personal Information</h4>
                    <p>In general, you can visit this site without telling us who you are or disclosing personal information about yourself; only the name of the domain from which you access the Internet as well as the Internet address and the date and time you access this web site are logged. The user otherwise remains anonymous. NetIQ uses such non-personal information to analyze trends as well as measure the number of visitors to different parts of this site and how much time they spend there, to help us make the site more useful to visitors. NetIQ recognizes as "personal information" the information that personally identifies you, plus any associated information that allows us to contact you, or that allows us to respond more effectively to a request from you. Your personal information may be known to us because you have licensed products from us. Or we may come into possession of your personal information through a variety of means, both active and passive, of types described below.</p>
                    <p>We request personal information when you are registering an account with the NetIQ.com site or registering to receive information such as a white paper or newsletter, entering a contest, signing up for an event or training, or downloading or purchasing NetIQ products. Personal information collected through NetIQ.com is generally limited to your name, contact information, job title, and areas of job responsibility, but may include other information when needed to provide a service you requested.</p>
                    <p>In other cases, certain actions by you will have the effect of providing personal information to NetIQ. For example, you may participate in a NetIQ blog, chat or forum, or send an e-mail message to NetIQ requesting a response. Additionally, your action in response to a NetIQ-initiated contact may allow NetIQ to associate your personal and non-personal information, and that association would also be treated as personal information.</p>
                    
                <hr>
				
                    <h4>Use of Personal Information</h4>
                    <p>When you provide personal information or data to NetIQ, you are consenting to the use of that data by NetIQ and its applicable worldwide affiliated companies, as stated in this Privacy Statement. Your information may be stored and processed in the United States or any other country in which NetIQ or its affiliates, contractors, or agents maintain facilities, and by using this site, you consent to any such transfer of information outside of your country in compliance with applicable law.</p>
                    <p>NetIQ will primarily use your personal information to:</p>
                    <ul>
                    	<li>Provide you with periodic information you agreed to receive about NetIQ products, services, and events</li> 
                        <li>Allow you to purchase and/or download products and/or receive support or other services for NetIQ products</li> 
                        <li>Deliver information regarding products or services that you request or purchase</li> 
                        <li>Gather demographic information about NetIQ web site visitor trends</li> 
                        <li>Allow you to access limited-entry areas of our site as appropriate</li> 
                        <li>Insure our Site is relevant to your needs</li> 
                        <li class="last">Alert you to product upgrades, special offers, updated information and other new services from NetIQ, unless you have opted out of this use.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>NetIQ may also use personal information  or data as a means of validating your identity when you logon to its affiliated  websites such as Novell.com or SUSE.com.</p>
                    <p>NetIQ may send out periodic e-mails informing you of a technical service or security issues related to a product or service you have requested or purchased, or confirming your request or purchase of a product or service. You will not be able to choose to unsubscribe from these mailings, as they are considered an essential part of the service you have chosen.</p>
                    
          <hr>
				
                    <h4>Sharing of Personal Information</h4>
                    <p>Regardless of the nature or source of your personal information in our possession, NetIQ will use that information solely for internal business purposes. We will not sell your personal information. If we share your information with third parties performing services for us, or acting on our behalf, we will not allow them to use your information for other purposes, and we will contractually require them to protect your information.</p>
                    <p>Otherwise, NetIQ will not share your personal information unless compelled to do so by exceptional conditions such as the following: NetIQ may be required to share information by law or legal edict; NetIQ may share information in a good-faith belief that such action is necessary to protect the personal safety of NetIQ users, protect and defend the rights or property of NetIQ and its family of web sites, or protect the public; NetIQ may share information if a complaint or legal action arises from your posted content on an NetIQ bulletin board; or the information may pass to another entity in connection with an asset sale of a NetIQ product line, or of substantially all of the business of NetIQ.</p>
