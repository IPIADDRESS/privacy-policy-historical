    <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>DatZap LLC t/a TicoSAT ("TicoSAT”) is sensitive to privacy
      issues on the Internet. We believe it is important you know what information
      we collect and receive from you on the TicoSAT Web Site (the “Web
      Site”) and how we will use it. This policy will also instruct you
      on what to do if you do not wish to continue receiving information from
    us.</p>
      <p>1. Type of information collected.</p>
      <p>In general, you can visit TicoSAT on the World Wide Web without telling
        us who you are or revealing any information about yourself. For each
        visitor to our Web Site, Our web servers automatically recognize and
        collect only the user’s domain name, and not the individual user’s
        email addresses, of visitors. Thus, the only way we usually obtain a
        visitor’s name, email address or other personal information is
        when you provide it to us, such as through survey information and/or
        site registrations. This information is aggregated to measure the number
        of visits, average time spent on the site, pages viewed, etc. TicoSAT
        uses this information to measure the use of our site and to improve the
        content of our site.</p>
      <p>However, at times we may need other information from you, such as your
        name and address, usually, in order to respond to an inquiry from you,
        process an order or allow you to access your account information. When
        such information is needed, we will try to let you know at the time of
        collection, how we will use this personal information, although we do
        not guarantee that we will always be able to do so.</p>
      <p>We may at times use a technology called cookies to provide you with
        tailored information. A cookie is a tiny element of data that a Web Site
        can send to your browser, which may then be stored on your hard drive
        so we can recognize you when you return. You may set your browser to
        notify you when you receive a cookie.</p>
      <p>At times we conduct on-line surveys to better understand the needs and
        profile of our visitors. When we conduct a survey, we will try to let
        you know how we will use the information at the time we collect information
        from you on the Internet.</p>
