generated unique number. 
</p>
<p>Two types of cookies are used on this website: 
</p>
<p><strong>session cookies</strong> - temporary cookies that remain in the cookie file of 
your browser until you leave the site; 
</p>
<p><strong>persistent cookies</strong> - these remain in the cookie file of your browser 
for much longer (though how long will depend on the lifetime of the specific 
cookie). 
</p>
<p>Cookies can help a website to arrange content to match your preferred 
interests more quickly. Most major websites use cookies.<br>Cookies cannot be

preferred interests or to avoid showing you the same adverts repeatedly. 
</li><li>To compile anonymous, aggregated statistics that allow us to understand how 
users use our site and to help us improve the structure of our website. We 
cannot identify you personally in this way. 
</li><li>Within research surveys to ensure you are not invited to complete a 
questionnaire too often or after you have already done so. 
</li><li>To store registration information so that you only have to re-enter your 
password each time you visit the site. 
<p><strong>Third-party cookies</strong>: <br>Third parties serve cookies via this site. 
These are used for the following purposes: </p>
</li><li>To serve advertisements on our site and track whether these advertisements

</p><p><strong>What can I do to manage cookies stored on my computer?</strong> <br>There are a 
number of ways to manage cookies. If you use different computers in different 
locations you will need to ensure that each browser is adjusted to suit your 
cookie preferences. 
</p><p>Some modern browsers have a feature that will analyse website privacy 
policies and allow a user to control their privacy needs. These are known as 
'P3P' features (Privacy Preferences Platform). Find further information on <a target="blank" href="http://www.allaboutcookies.org/p3p-cookies/index.html">P3P.</a> 
</p><p>You can easily delete any cookies that have been installed in the cookie 
folder of your browser. For example, if you are using Microsoft Windows 
Explorer: </p>
<ul><li>Open 'Windows Explorer' 
</li><li>Click on the 'Search' button on the tool bar 
</li><li>Type 'cookie' into the search box for 'Folders and Files' 
</li><li>Select 'My Computer' in the 'Look In' box 
</li><li>Click 'Search Now' 
</li><li>Double click on the folders that are found 
</li><li>'Select' any cookie file 
</li><li>Hit the 'Delete' button on your keyboard </li></ul>
<p>If you are not using Microsoft Windows Explorer, then you should select 
'cookies' in the 'Help' function for information on where to find your cookie 
folder. 
</p><p><strong>What can I do to stop cookies being installed on my browser?</strong> 
</p><p>All web browsers enable you to set your cookie preferences before you start 
surfing.<br><a target="_blank" href="http://www.allaboutcookies.org/manage-cookies/netscape-navigator3.html">Netscape Navigator 3.0</a><br><a target="_blank" href="http://www.allaboutcookies.org/manage-cookies/internet-explorer3.html">Internet Explorer 3.0</a><br><a target="_blank" href="http://www.allaboutcookies.org/manage-cookies/netscape4.html">Netscape 4.0+</a><br><a target="_blank" href="http://www.allaboutcookies.org/manage-cookies/internet-explorer4.html">Internet Explorer 4.0</a><br><a target="_blank" href="http://www.allaboutcookies.org/manage-cookies/internet-explorer5-plus.html">Internet Explorer 5.0+</a><br><a target="_blank" href="http://www.allaboutcookies.org/manage-cookies/netscape-6-plus.html">Netscape 6.0+</a><br>
</p><p><strong>I like to control which cookies are being set on my browser, but the 
alerts are rather annoying - is there any way that I can stop them?</strong> 
</p><p>The most up-to-date versions of browser technology enable you to set your 
preferences with more sophistication so that you can choose which cookies to 
accept or reject. They use a system called P3P (Privacy Preferences Platform) to 
match your preferences with the privacy policy of a website. For more
