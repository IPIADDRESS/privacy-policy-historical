	<h3>Collection and Use of Information</h3>

	<p>Personal information means information that uniquely identifies you as an individual, specifically your name, postal delivery address, e-mail address, payment method (e.g., credit card, debit card, or other payment method accepted by Netflix).  Non-personal information means any information that is not personal information.</p>

	<p>When you interact with us, we may ask you to supply us with personal information so that we can provide, enhance and personalize our services and marketing efforts. For similar reasons, we may supplement the personal information you provide with publicly available information about you as well as information from other sources, as permitted by law. We use this personal information, for example, to process your registration, your orders and your payments, and to communicate with you on these and other topics. We also use your e-mail address to send you newsletters, as well as messages about new Netflix features, Netflix special offers, promotional announcements, consumer surveys and other correspondence concerning our service. Occasionally, we may send these materials to you via postal mail.  If you no longer want to receive the newsletters, other announcements, simply access the "Manage mailing preferences" link on the "Your Account" page and uncheck those items to unsubscribe. Please note that you cannot unsubscribe from certain correspondence from us, including messages relating to your account transactions.</p>

	<p>We keep track of your interactions with us and collect information related to your use of our service, including but not limited to your online activity, title selections and ratings, payment history and correspondence as well as Internet protocol addresses, device types, unique device data, such as device identifiers, operating systems, any instant watching of movies, TV shows and related activity. We use this information for such purposes as determining in which country you are located so that we may provide localized content,  enforcing our terms (such as using device identifiers to determine your eligibility for a free trial), providing recommendations on movies &amp; TV shows we think will be enjoyable, personalizing the service to better reflect particular interests, tracking your instant-watching hours, determining your Internet service provider, helping us quickly and efficiently respond to inquiries and requests and otherwise enhancing or administering our service offering. We also provide analysis of our users in the aggregate to prospective partners, advertisers and other third parties. We may also disclose and otherwise use, on an anonymous basis, movie &amp; TV show ratings, consumption habits, commentary, reviews and other non-personal information.   For example, we use movie &amp; TV show ratings and consumption behavior to improve our recommendations to you as well as other users.</p>


	<p>While using the Netflix service, you will have opportunities to post reviews or other personal information in public forums. Please understand that when you post such information, it is made public and is not subject to this policy.  We are not responsible for any third party's use of personal information you publicly disclose through our service.</p>

	<p> From time to time, we may partner with companies whose products we believe will interest our members. In conjunction with these partners, we may send promotional announcements and/or serve web-based advertisements on their behalf, as permitted by law. You can go to the "Manage mailing preferences" link on the "Your Account" page and request that your name be excluded from marketing emails or postal mail. </p>

	<h3>Disclosure of Information</h3>
<p>Set forth below is a list of our affiliated entities we share information with: </p>

<p>NGS Services, LLC, 3175 N.W. Aloclek Drive, Hillsboro, Oregon, 97124, U.S.A.  </p>
<p>This list may change from time to time. </p> 
	<p> In addition, we use other companies, agents or contractors to perform services on our behalf. For example, we have partnered with other companies, to provide infrastructure and IT services, personalize and optimize our web pages, process credit card transactions, provide customer service, collect debts, analyze and enhance data, including users' interaction with our website, and process consumer surveys. In the course of providing such services, these other companies may have access to your personal information.  We do not authorize these companies to use or disclose your personal information except for the purpose of providing the services we request of them. </p>

	<p> We may offer joint promotions or programs that, in order for participation, will require personal information be shared with third parties. For example, we may partner with companies that offer incentives, such as frequent flyer mileage awards, if you sign up or otherwise utilize our service. In fulfilling these types of promotions, we may share your name and other personal information in connection with fulfilling the incentive.  By participating in such joint promotions or programs, you consent to our sharing of your personal information. </p>

	<p>Netflix also reserves the right to disclose personal information when we reasonably believe disclosure is required by law, if we reasonably believe disclosure is necessary to protect, establish or exercise legal rights, or in situations involving potential threats to physical safety. In connection with any reorganization, restructuring, merger or sale, or other transferring of assets we reserve the right to transfer information, including personal information, provided that the receiving party agrees to respect your personal information in a manner that is consistent with our privacy policy. </p>

	<h3>Cookies and Other Technologies</h3>
	<p>To Enhance our Service</p>
	<p>As you interact with our service, we and our service providers may place cookies on your system.  Cookies are small pieces of data that are sent to your browser from a web server and stored on your system for record keeping purposes.  In general, cookies can make the Internet more useful by storing information about your preferences on a particular system. </p>

	<p>In addition to cookies, we and our service providers use  a variety of other technologies, including pixel tags (web beacons), clear gifs, or other technologies built into our application software or your Netflix ready device, to gather information on how users interact with our service. These technologies can help personalize the service for you and help associate your interactions with our service to other information within your account.

	<a name="security"></a>
	<h3>Security</h3>

	<p>Netflix takes information security very seriously and uses reasonable administrative, technical, physical and managerial measures to protect your personal information from unauthorized access. For example, we utilize Secure Sockets Layering, an industry-standard protocol for certain of your transmissions to us, in order to encrypt the personal information that you send to us through the registration and sign up process.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, no security system can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. Accordingly, we cannot guarantee the security of your personal information and cannot assume liability for improper access to it. By using our service, including our website and user interfaces, or providing personal information to us through any means, you agree that we can communicate with you electronically regarding security, privacy, and administrative issues relating to your use of the Netflix service. </p>

	<p>In order to provide you with ease of access to your account and to help administer the Netflix service, Netflix implements technology that enables us to recognize you as the account holder and provide you with direct access to your account without requiring you to retype any password or other user identification when you revisit the Netflix service.  You can choose not to take advantage of this feature on your computer by unchecking the box "Remember me on this computer" when you login on the website.  Netflix ready devices do not have this feature.  To remove access to your Netflix account from a device, go to the "Manage Netflix ready devices and computers" link on the "Your Account" page and remove that device from your account.   You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account information and for restricting access to your computer or device through which you access your Netflix account. If you disclose your password to anyone or share your account and/or devices with other people, you take full responsibility for their actions.  Where possible, users of public or shared devices should log out at the completion of each visit.  If you sell or return a computer or Netflix ready device, you should log-out and deactivate the device before doing so.  If you fail to log out and deactivate your device, subsequent users may be able to access certain of your account information.  To deactivate a device, go to "<a href="http://www.netflix.com/Player">Manage Netflix ready devices and computers.</a>"</p>
