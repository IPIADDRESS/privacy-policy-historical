             		<h1 id="pageheader">Privacy Policy</h1>
              
             		<p>netTALK.COM,  INC. ("netTALK") is committed to your privacy. We obey all  laws and regulations in the United States applicable to our use and  disclosure of your information. Except as set forth in this Privacy  Policy, we will not trade, sell, or disclose to any third party any  form of PII (as defined below) without your consent and we will not  disclose or make available any PII to any third parties seeking to  market third party products without your consent. We have set forth  this Privacy Policy to explain to you how we collect and use  information from our customers who use services and products from  netTALK ("Customers") and from visitors to our Web sites  and from potential customers who have communicated, made contact, or  interacted with netTALK ("Visitors"), both in connection  with online and offline services and products offered by netTALK.</p>
<p><strong>Collection  of Information</strong></p>
<p>netTALK  shall collect personally identifiable information, including but not  limited to name, physical address, email address, telephone number,  credit card information, and other personal information  (collectively, "PII"), from Customers when initiating  service and in connection with the provision or marketing of products  and services. netTALK may collect PII from Visitors in connection  with any visit to our Web sites, any communication about our services  and products, or other transactions or interactions with netTALK.  netTALK may also collect non-personally identifiable information from  Customers and Visitors regarding usage of our services or our Web  site ("Non-PII"). Non-PII may include Web site pages  viewed, time spent using certain services, demographic data, cookies,  and other information which does not specifically identify any one  individual. "Cookies" are pieces of information that may be  placed on your computer by a Web site for the purpose of facilitating  and enhancing your communication and interaction with that Web site.  Many Web sites use cookies for these purposes. We may use cookies to  customize your visit to our Web sites and for other purposes to make  your visit more convenient or to enable us to enhance our service. In  addition to our cookies, we may also use (and our third party  advertisers may use) clear gifs, Web beacons, and third party cookies  to improve the performance of our Web sites, provide certain features  such as advertising, or to anonymously track usage of our Web sites  and track the online activity of users. In addition, we may use such  devices in our HTML-based emails to track the usage of such emails in  much the same manner as usage of our Web sites is tracked.You may  stop or restrict the placement of cookies on your computer, including  third party cookies, or flush them from your browser by adjusting  your Web browser preferences, in which case you may still use our Web  site, but it may interfere with some of its functionality.</p>
<p><strong>Anti-Spyware  Policy</strong></p>
<p>netTALK  believes that Spyware is a threat to consumer privacy and a  consumer's experience online. Therefore, we forbid any netTALK  employee, agent, partner, affiliate, or contractor from intentionally  deploying or using Spyware (as defined in this policy) on behalf of  netTALK. Spyware refers to any executable software application that  is installed on a user's personal computer and covertly gathers and  transmits PII through the user's Internet connection without the  knowledge or consent of the user. Cookies and Web beacons are not  considered Spyware. Spyware may gather PII, such as e-mail addresses  and credit card information, and may even alter personal computer  settings. Intentional use of Spyware by any netTALK employee, agent,  partner, or affiliate on netTALK's behalf will not be tolerated and  will be considered grounds for dismissal, contract termination,  and/or loss of payment.</p>
<p> <strong>Use  of Information</strong></p>
<p>netTALK  will use PII (1) to market products and services to Customers and  Visitors that netTALK believes may be of interest to them, (2) to  provide services and products requested by Customers and Visitors and  (3) to enable its vendors and contractors to provide and assist  netTALK in the marketing and provision of such services and products  to netTALK, Customers, or Visitors. However, we will not share your  credit card information with any third parties unless they are  involved in processing payments for services that you have purchased  from netTALK. netTALK only works with partners whom we believe  maintain high standards with respect to privacy and consumer rights.  netTALK may also use and disclose PII to investigate and help prevent  potentially unlawful activity or activities that threaten the  integrity of our service or network, to investigate fraud or  violations of our <a href="/terms-of-service"><u>Terms  of Service</u></a>,  as required by courts or administrative agencies or in connection  with a sale, merger, or reorganization of netTALK's business. Non-PII  may be shared with any number of third parties by netTALK.</p>
<p><strong>CPNI</strong></p>
<p>In  the course of providing services to you, we collect and maintain  certain customer proprietary network information ("CPNI").  CPNI includes the types of services you currently purchase, related  usage and billing information for those services. Your telephone  number, name, and address are not CPNI. We value our relationships  with our customers and are committed to respecting and protecting  your CPNI. Accordingly, we do not sell, trade, or share your CPNI,  including your calling records outside of netTALK's family of  companies or with anyone not authorized to offer our products or  services, or to perform functions on our behalf except as authorized  by you or required by law. Generally, we can use your CPNI to offer  additional services to you, and for billing and collections purposes.  We can also disclose your CPNI for legal or regulatory reasons,  including in response to subpoenas and court orders. We can also use  CPNI to investigate fraud and to prevent violation of our Terms of  Service and unlawful use of our network, services, and other  customers.</p>
<p><strong>Security</strong></p>
<p>netTALK  has invested and deployed a wide variety of technology and security  features to make reasonable efforts to ensure the privacy of  information on its network. In addition, netTALK has implemented  operations guidelines to ensure Customer and Visitor privacy is  safeguarded at every level of its organization. netTALK will continue  to revise policies and implement additional security features as new  technologies becomes available. However, no system or service can  give a 100% guaranty of security, especially a service that relies  upon the public Internet. Therefore, you acknowledge the risk that  third parties may gain unauthorized access to your information when  using our services.</p>
<p><strong>Communications</strong></p>
<p>netTALK  will not read, listen to or disclose to any third parties private  e-mail, conversations, or other communications that are transmitted  using netTALK services except as required to ensure proper operation  of services or as otherwise authorized by law.</p>
<p>You  should be aware that any PII which you voluntarily include and  transmit through publicly accessible forums (i.e., such as chat  rooms, blogs, instant messages, listservs) may be viewed and used by  anyone with access to such forums. netTALK is unable to control such  uses of your PII, and by using such services, you assume the risk  that the PII provided by you may be viewed and used by third parties.</p>
<p><strong>Account  Information</strong></p>
<p>Subject  to certain security requirements, netTALK will do its best to honor  requests from Customers for account information, for example, name,  address, company, or billing information. The Customer is responsible  for ensuring that the information on file with netTALK is current and  accurate.</p>
<p><strong>Children's  Privacy Policy</strong></p>
<p>netTALK  does not sell products or services for purchase by children. netTALK  does not knowingly solicit or collect PII from children or teenagers  under the age of eighteen. If you believe that a minor has disclosed  PII to netTALK, <a href="/contact"><u>report  this to us</u></a>. </p>
<p><strong>netTALK  Spam Policy</strong></p>

Spam complaints will be dealt with  seriously and can result in losing netTALK privileges such as loss of  referral credits and even loss of a customer's account. If you  receive spam and want to report it to netTALK, please forward the  email you have received to webmaster@nettalk.com. </p>
<p><strong>Third  Party Web Sites and Services</strong></p>
<p>Our  service may contain links to other Web sites and services not  maintained by netTALK. In addition, other Web sites and services may  also reference or link to netTALK. We encourage you to be aware when  you leave our service, or surf the Internet, and to read the privacy  statements of each and every Web site and service that you visit. We  do not endorse, screen, or approve, and are not responsible for the  privacy practices or the content of, such other Web sites and  services. netTALK does not assume any liability for third parties  that have been provided with information as permitted by this Privacy  Policy or who have collected information as permitted by this Privacy  Policy (such as advertisers using third party cookies).</p>
<p><strong>Opt-out  Policy</strong></p>
<p>If  you do not want your PII used by netTALK for any direct marketing  purposes, then you may opt-out of such disclosures by calling us at <strong>1-305-621-1200</strong>.</p>
<p>However,  we are not responsible for removing your PII from the lists of any  third party who has previously been provided your information in  accordance with this policy. Since netTALK must use a Customer's PII  in order to provide them with netTALK services, Customers cannot  opt-out of all uses of their PII unless they cancel their service.</p>
<p><strong>Changes  to policy</strong></p>
<p>We  reserve the right, at our discretion, to change, modify, add, or  remove portions from this policy at any time by posting such changes  here. You should review this policy regularly for changes, and can  easily see if changes have been made by checking the Effective Date  below. However, if at any time in the future we plan to use PII in a  way that differs from this policy, we will post such changes here and  provide you the opportunity to opt-out of such differing uses. Your  continued use following the posting of any changes to this policy  means you accept such changes.</p>
<p><strong>Terms  of Service</strong></p>
<p>For  Customers, this Privacy Policy is subject to the netTALK Terms of  Service or other agreements between you and netTALK. If you are a  Customer, please refer to the Terms of Service or such other  agreements regarding certain rights and limitations with respect to  your use of netTALK's services.</p>
<p><strong>United  States of America</strong></p>
<p>Our  service is maintained in the United States of America. By using our  services, you authorize the export of PII to the USA and its storage  and use as specified in this policy.</p>
