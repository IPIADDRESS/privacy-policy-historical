                                    Personal information means information that can be used to identify and contact you, specifically your name, postal delivery address, e-mail address, payment method (e.g., credit card or debit card) and telephone number, as well as other information when such information is combined with your personal information. 

 

                                    <br><br>

 

                                    When you register or re-register at our Web site, we ask you to supply us with personal information so that we can provide, enhance and personalize our services and marketing efforts.  For similar reasons, we may supplement the personal information you provide with publicly available information about you.  We use this personal information to process your registration, your orders and your payments, and to communicate with you on these and other topics. We also use your e-mail address to send you newsletters, as well as messages about Netflix special offers, promotional announcements and consumer surveys. Occasionally, we may send these materials to you via postal mail, using the shipping address provided. Our mailers that contain the DVDs may also contain promotional items or advertisements.  If you no longer want to receive the newsletters, other announcements or non-DVD-mailer postal mail, simply access the Email Subscriptions page under Your Account and uncheck those items to unsubscribe.  Please note that you cannot unsubscribe from certain correspondence from us, including messages relating to your account transactions. 

 

                                    <br><br>

 

                                    We keep track of your interactions with us, including but not limited to your site activity, DVD selections, movie ratings, payment history and correspondence as well as any instant movie viewing and related activity. We use this information for such purposes as providing recommendations on movies we think will be enjoyable, personalizing the site to better reflect particular interests, tracking your available instant-viewing hours, helping us quickly and efficiently respond to inquiries and requests and otherwise enhancing our service offering for our customers. We also provide analyses of our users in the aggregate to prospective partners, advertisers and other third parties. We may also disclose and otherwise use, on an anonymous basis, movie ratings, consumption habits, commentary, reviews and other non-personal information about customers. 

 

                                    <br><br>

 

                                    While using the Netflix service and Web site, you will have opportunities to post reviews or other personal information in public forums.  Please understand that when you post such information, it is made public and is not subject to this policy.

These technologies, show us, for example, popular pages, conversion rates, click-throughs and other information that can be used to improve, operate and monitor our site and our service.

                                    Except as otherwise disclosed to you, we will not sell, rent or disclose your personal information to third parties without notifying you of our intent to share the personal information in advance and giving you an opportunity to prevent your personal information from being shared.

                                    We use other companies, agents or contractors to perform services on our behalf. For example, we have partnered with other companies to personalize and optimize our Web pages, process credit card transactions, collect debts, analyze and enhance data, including customers' interaction with our site, and process consumer surveys. We also provide postal addresses to the U.S. Post Office for delivery purposes. In the course of providing such services, these other companies may have access to your personal information. These companies are not permitted to use your personal information except for the purpose of providing the services we request of them. 

 

                                    <br><br>

 

                                    From time to time, we may partner with companies whose products we believe will interest our users. In conjunction with these partners, we may send promotional announcements and/or serve web-based advertisements to our customers on their behalf. You can go to the Email Subscriptions page under Your Account and request that your name be excluded from these mailings for our marketing partners.   In addition, we may offer joint promotions or programs that, in order for participation, will require personal information be shared with third parties.  In such instances, you will be provided with notice of the sharing prior to your decision to participate.

                                    Netflix also reserves the right to disclose personal information when we reasonably believe disclosure is required by law, if we reasonably believe disclosure is necessary to establish or exercise legal rights, or in situations involving potential threats to physical safety.  In the event that Netflix is acquired by or merged with a third party, we reserve the right, to sell or otherwise transfer the personal information we have collected as part of that transaction provided that such third party continues to honor our privacy policy.

                                    Netflix takes information security very seriously and uses reasonable administrative, technical and managerial measures to protect your personal information from unauthorized access.  For example, we utilize Secure Sockets Layering, an industry-standard protocol for certain of your transmissions to us, in order to encrypt the personal information that you send to us through the registration and sign up process.  We store your email address and payment method information in an encrypted form.  

 

                                    <br><br>

 

                                    You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account information and for restricting access to your computer or mobile device through which you access your Netflix account. Users of public or shared computers or unprotected mobile devices should log out at the completion of each visit to the Netflix Web site.

 

                                    <br><br>

 

                                    Unfortunately, no security system can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.

By using this Web site, or providing personal information to us through any means, you agree that we can communicate with you electronically regarding security, privacy, and administrative issues relating to your use of this site.
