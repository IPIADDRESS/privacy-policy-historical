        <h3>Collection and Use of Information</h3>

        <p> We receive and store information, including personal information, about you and your use of our service.  This information is gathered in a number of ways, including when you enter it on our website and from interactions with our service.  In this Privacy Policy, we use the term “personal information” to mean information that can be used to uniquely identify or contact you.  Non-personal information is information that does not permit direct association with you.  We may collect, use, transfer and disclose non-personal information for any purpose.  You can choose not to provide personal information we may request of you, but, in general, most of the personal information we request is required in order to provide our service and the lack of such personal information will prevent us from doing so.</p>

        <p> When you interact with us, we may ask you to supply us with personal information so that we can provide, enhance and personalize our services and marketing efforts.  For similar reasons, we may supplement the personal information you provide with publicly available information about you as well as information from other sources, as permitted by law.  We use this personal information for various reasons, including to process your registration, your orders and your payments, and to communicate on these and other topics.  For example, we may use your e-mail address or other methods to send newsletters, messages about new Netflix features, Netflix special offers, promotional announcements, consumer surveys and other correspondence and marketing concerning our service.  If you no longer want to receive certain communications from us via email, simply access the "Email preferences" <span class="href">(<a class="legal_link" href="https://www.netflix.com/EmailPreferences">https://www.netflix.com/EmailPreferences</a>)</span> link on the "Your Account" page of our website <span class="href">(<a class="legal_link" href="https://www.netflix.com/YourAccount">https://www.netflix.com/YourAccount</a>)</span> and uncheck those items to unsubscribe, or click the “unsubscribe” link in the email.  <span class="href">For information about opting out of certain postal communications, please visit <a class="legal_link" href="https://help.netflix.com/article/en/node/8748#gsc.tab=0">https://help.netflix.com/article/en/node/8748#gsc.tab=0</a>.</span>  Please note that you cannot unsubscribe from certain correspondence from us, including messages relating to your account transactions.</p>

        <p> We keep track of your interactions with us and collect information related to you and your use of our service, including but not limited to: your online activity, title selections, reviews, ratings, payment history, correspondence, Internet protocol addresses, device and software data (such as type, configuration and unique identifiers), instant watching of movies, TV shows and related activity.  We use this information for such purposes as determining your general geographic location, providing localized content, enforcing our terms (such as determining your eligibility for a free trial), providing recommendations on movies &amp; TV shows we think will be enjoyable, personalizing the service and our marketing to better reflect particular interests, tracking your instant-watching hours, determining your Internet service provider, helping us quickly and efficiently respond to inquiries and requests and otherwise analyzing, enhancing, administering or promoting our service offering for you and other users.  We may supplement this information with information from other sources, including offline data and your browsing behavior on other sites and interactions with our advertising.  We also provide analysis of our users in the aggregate or otherwise in anonymous form to prospective partners, advertisers and other third parties.  We may also disclose and otherwise use, on an anonymous basis, movie &amp; TV show ratings, consumption habits, commentary, reviews and other information.  For example, we use movie &amp; TV show ratings and consumption behavior to improve our recommendations to you as well as other users.</p>

        <p> While using the Netflix service, you will have opportunities to post reviews or other information in public forums.  Please understand that when you post such information, it is made public and is not subject to this policy.  We are not responsible for any third party's use of information you publicly disclose through our service.</p>

        <p> From time to time, we may partner with companies whose products we believe will interest our members.  In conjunction with these partners, we may send promotional announcements and/or serve web-based advertisements on their behalf, as permitted by law.  You can go to the "Email preferences" <span class="href">(<a class="legal_link" href="https://www.netflix.com/EmailPreferences">https://www.netflix.com/EmailPreferences</a>)</span> link on the "Your Account" page and request that your name be excluded from marketing emails. </p>
        <p> You may connect one or more social networks (such as Facebook) with your Netflix account.  If you choose to do so, we will collect and use information from your social networking account(s) and your use of our social features.  For more details about our social features, information we collect and use, as well as account connection, including how to disconnect, see our Social Terms<span class="href"> (<a class="legal_link" href="https://www.netflix.com/socialterms">https://www.netflix.com/socialterms</a>)</span>. </p>

        <a name="disclosure"></a>
        <h3>Disclosure of Personal Information</h3>
        <p> We may share your personal information among the Netflix family of companies <span class="href">(<a class="legal_link" href="https://help.netflix.com/support/6592?locale=en-US&amp;country=US">https://help.netflix.com/support/6592?locale=en-US&amp;country=US</a>)</span>.  The Netflix companies that access your personal information will follow practices that are consistent with the practices described in this Privacy Policy. </p>
        <p> In addition we use other companies, agents or contractors (“Service Providers”) to perform services on our behalf or to assist us with the provision of services to you.  For example, we engage Services Providers to provide marketing, communications, infrastructure and IT services, personalize and optimize our service, process credit card transactions, provide customer service, collect debts, analyze and enhance data, including users' interaction with our service, and process consumer surveys. In the course of providing such services, these other companies may have access to your personal information.  We do not authorize these companies to use or disclose your personal information except in connection with providing the services we request of them. </p>

        <p> We may offer joint promotions or programs that, in order for participation, will require personal information be shared with third parties.  For example, we may partner with companies that offer incentives, such as frequent flyer mileage awards, if you sign up or otherwise utilize our service.  In fulfilling these types of promotions, we may share your name and other information in connection with fulfilling the incentive.  By participating in such joint promotions or programs, you agree to our sharing of your information.  Please note that we do not control the privacy practices of these third party businesses. </p>

        <p> Netflix also reserves the right to disclose personal information if we reasonably believe that access, use, preservation or disclosure of such information is reasonably necessary to (a) satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process, or governmental request, (b) enforce applicable terms of use, including investigation of potential violations thereof, (c) detect, prevent, or otherwise address illegal or suspected illegal activities, security or technical issues, or (d) protect against harm to the rights, property or safety of Netflix, its users or the public as required or permitted by law.  In connection with any reorganization, restructuring, merger or sale, or other transferring of assets we reserve the right to transfer information, including personal information, provided that the receiving party agrees to respect your personal information in a manner that is consistent with our Privacy Policy. </p>

        <h3> Other Websites, Platforms and Applications</h3>

        <p> The Netflix service may be provided through platforms or contain links to sites operated by third parties whose policies regarding the handling of information may differ from ours.  For example, you may be able to access the Netflix service through platforms such as PlayStation systems, Microsoft Xbox, Nintendo Wii, Roku Streaming Player, iPad or iPhone and a number of other Internet connected devices.  While we endeavor to associate with reputable companies, Netflix cannot be responsible for the information handling practices of these other websites and platforms.  These websites and platforms have separate and independent privacy statements, notices and terms of use, which we recommend you read carefully.  In addition, you may encounter third party applications that interact with the Netflix service.

        <h3>Security</h3>

        <p> Netflix takes information security seriously and uses reasonable administrative, technical, physical and managerial measures to protect your personal information from unauthorized access.  For example, we utilize Secure Sockets Layering, an industry-standard protocol for certain of your transmissions to us, in order to encrypt certain personal information that you send to us through the registration and sign up process.</p>

        <p> Unfortunately, no security system can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. Accordingly, we cannot guarantee the security of your information and cannot assume liability for improper access to it.  By using our service, including our website and user interfaces, or providing information to us through any means, you agree that we can communicate with you electronically regarding security, privacy, and administrative issues relating to your use of the Netflix service. </p>

        <p> In order to provide you with ease of access to your account and to help administer the Netflix service, Netflix implements technology that enables us to recognize you as the account holder and provide you with direct access to your account without requiring you to retype any password or other user identification when you revisit the Netflix service.  You can choose not to take advantage of this feature on your computer by unchecking the box "Remember me on this computer" when you login on the website.  To remove access to your Netflix account from your devices: (a) visit "Your Account" <span class="href">(<a class="legal_link" href="https://www.netflix.com/YourAccount">https://www.netflix.com/YourAccount</a>)</span> (note, deactivation may not occur immediately) or (b) delete your Netflix settings from your device (steps vary by device and the option is not available on all devices).  You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account access information and for restricting access to your computer or device through which you access your Netflix account.  Where possible, users of public or shared devices should log out at the completion of each visit.  If you sell or return a computer or Netflix ready device, you should log-out and deactivate the device before doing so.  If you do not maintain the security of your password or device, or fail to log out or deactivate your device, subsequent users may be able to access your account, including your personal information.</p>

        <h3>Changes to This Policy</h3>

Such revisions shall be effective immediately; provided however, for existing members, such revisions shall, unless otherwise stated, be effective 30 days after posting.  We will endeavor to post prior versions (including marked changes) of the Privacy Policy, if any, for the preceding 12-month period.  You can see these prior versions of the Privacy Policy by visiting our website <span class="href">(<a class="legal_link" href="https://www.netflix.com/privacypolicychanges">www.netflix.com/privacypolicychanges</a>)</span>. </p>

        <h3>Transfer of Information</h3>

        <p> Given that the Internet is a global environment, using the Internet to collect and process information necessarily involves the transmission of data on an international basis.  Therefore, by using Netflix, you acknowledge and agree to the transfer of your information outside your country of residence to any country (including the United States) where we have facilities or engage third parties (including but not limited to payment processors, cloud service or other IT providers, and other companies that provide services to us).  You understand that the countries to which we may transfer information may not have as comprehensive a level of data protection as in your country. </p>
