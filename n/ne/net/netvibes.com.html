    </p>
    <h3>I. Nature of Personal Information Collected by Netvibes</h3>
    <p>
        We may collect and process both information that you voluntarily communicate to us in order to access or use our Service (such as your email, password, or your list of friends) and data related to your preferences and traffic (such as your IP address or the modules selected). You do not need to open an account and provide us with personally identifiable information to use our Service. Some personal information may be necessary to access some aspects of our Service. We will never collect or process personal data pertaining to, directly or indirectly, your race, your political, philosophical, or religious views, your health, or your sexual orientation.

    </p>
    <h3>II. Non-Personally Identifiable Information &amp; Cookies</h3>
    <h4>Traffic</h4>
    <p>

We may collect the following information: origin of the connection (ISP), IP address, type and version of your Internet browser, length of connection, etc. These data may be used for statistical purposes to analyze the traffic (most and least-viewed modules, favorite itineraries, activity per day and hour, etc.) and to improve our Site by adapting it to your tastes. Traffic data are always processed anonymously.

    <h4>Cookies</h4>
    <p>
        We may place "cookies" on your computer hard drive to record your visit and to restore your personalized Netvibes web pages when you connect with your usual computer. These small files may contain, for instance, traffic data and your preferences. 
    </p>
    <p>
        You may suppress cookies after your visit or configure your Internet browser to prevent them. However, you should be aware that in this event your preferences will be lost if you do not have a Netvibes account. Please refer to the help file of your Internet browser for the adequate configuration.

    </p>
    <h4>Cancellation of Account</h4>
    <p>
        At any time you may request <a href="http://www.netvibes.com/static.php?show=feedback">by email</a>
        that your account be cancelled and that all associated personal information be deleted. Please note that in this event all your preferences will be lost.
