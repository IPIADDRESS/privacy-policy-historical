 concerns.</p><p>

 use such information anonymously and in the aggregate. This information helps us
 determine what is most beneficial for our users, and how we can continually
 create a better overall experience for you. We may share this information with
 our partners, but only in the aggregate, so that they too may understand how

 Net-Temps provides email address links located on the Contact Us page so that
 you may email us directly with any questions or comments you may have. 
 Net-Temps reads all messages received and makes efforts to respond promptly.  In

 Net-Temps is the sole owner of the information collected on this site.  We will
 not sell, share, or rent this information to others in ways different from what
 is disclosed in this statement.  Net-Temps collects information from our users
 at several different points on our website.</p><p>
 
 <b>Membership Information</b><br>
 Companies wishing to sign up for Net-Temps' service are asked to provide certain data including full name, complete mailing address, phone number and email address.  Members can expect to receive periodic email communications including resume search agent results, a hot list of candidates, updates regarding their service and the weekly newsletter. If members do not wish to receive resume search agents results or a daily hotlist, they may remove the agents from their desktop and disable the daily hotlist.  An unsubscribe is provided at the bottom of each
recruiter newsletter if they wish to opt-out.
 </p><p> 
 Members have the ability to update/change their company information and user information including contact name, email address, password and phone number.  
Each account has a designated administrator who has the ability to change any of this information in their password-protected  recruiting center.
 </p><p>
 Net-Temps membership is a paid service and available on a month-to month basis or 6 or 12-month contract basis.  Membership may be cancelled with 30 days prior notice to the contract renewal date.  
 </p><p>
 <b>Single Job Posting</b><br>
If a company wishes to post a single job on Net-Temps, the name, company name, complete mailing address and email address are required.  In addition credit card and expiration information is also required. This information is then processed by VeriSign, Inc., a third party service provider.  
 </p><p>

 
 <b>Personal Resume Bank</b><br> 
 The Personal Resume Bank allows Net-Temps Recruiters to create a private
 database of resumes from the Recruiters Desktop. Resumes entered into the
 Personal Resume Bank from the Net-Temps resume banks are accessible to anyone
 with an active Net-Temps subscription account. Resumes entered into the Personal
 Resume Bank from a source other than the Net-Temps resume banks are accessible
 to only that recruiter; the Recruiters Desktop is password protected. If a
 recruiter elects to cancel their account, they may email all the resumes in
 their Personal Resume Bank to any email address they choose and/or print the
 resumes.</p><p> 
 
 <b>Forums</b><br>
 Net-Temps provides job seeker career forums for each of its career channels. 
 These areas are not restricted and are accessible by anyone visiting the website
 and Net-Temps personnel. The information provided in the forum is publicly displayed and users should use caution when posting online. If you use the career forums on this site, you should be aware that any personally identifiable information you submit there can be read, collected, or used by other users of these forums, and could be used to send you unsolicited messages.  We are not responsible for the personally identifiable information you choose to submit in these forums.  Net-Temps reserves the right to remove any messages in the forums and terminate the accounts of visitors who use these services in a manner inconsistent with the Net-Temps Terms of Use.
 </p><p>
 
 <b>Personal Information</b><br>
 Net-Temps' resume functionality requires/requests users to give us contact
 information (such as their email address) and personal information (such as
 their work histories and academic achievements). The user's contact and personal
 information is used to contact the visitor when necessary, but is primarily used
 in the construction of the user's resume and Candidate Profile.</p><p> 
 
 Demographic data that are collected at our site are not required, and are shared
 with clients only on an aggregate basis, primarily to aid employers with their
 own EEO compliance and affirmative action policies. 
 We do not disclose information about your individual visits to Net-Temps, or
 personal information that you provide, such as your name, address, email
 address, telephone number, credit card number, personal references, etc., to any
 outside parties, except when we believe the law requires it. But, we may record
 and share aggregated information with our partners.</p><p> 
 </p><p>
 Net-Temps offers the ability to send newsletter and article content found on the website to a friend via email.  Net-Temps requires both the senders' and recipients' email addresses in order for the newsletter/article be sent.  This information is stored on Net-Temps but is not shared or sold to third parties.
 </p><p>
 
 <b>Legal Disclaimer</b><br>
 We may disclose personal information when required by law or in the good-faith
 belief that such action is necessary in order to conform to the edicts of the
 law or comply with a legal process serviced on our website.</p><p>
 
 <b>Resume Posting</b><br>
 When you post your resume, you have the option of suppressing your contact
 information.  You also have the ability of making the resume active or
 non-active.  An active resume will be accessible to all employers and recruiters
 who pay for access to our resume database product.  We use our best efforts to
 grant access to this database only to paying employers, recruiters, hiring
 managers, headhunters, and human resource professionals, but cannot guarantee
 that other parties will not, without our consent, gain access to this database.
 You may remove your resume from our searchable database by deleting the resume
 or by making it inactive.   However, employers and recruiters who have paid for
 access to the database, and other parties who have otherwise gained access to
 the database, may have retained a copy of your resume in their own files or
 databases. We are not responsible for the retention, use, or privacy of resumes
 in these instances, or for the use or privacy of resumes by any of such parties
 while resumes are in the database.</p><p>

 <b>Delete/Opt-Out</b><br>
 The majority of our email communications will have instructions on how to unsubscribe 
 so that you will not receive any future emails from us if you so choose. For example,  
 users who no longer wish to receive our newsletter may unsubscribe by sending an
 email to <a href="mailto:infocus@net-temps.com">infocus@net-temps.com</a>
 or <a href="mailto:crossroads@net-temps.com">crossroads@net-temps.com</a> with
 the word 'REMOVE' in the Subject line. Job search agents results may also be removed by deleting 
 them from the Job Search Assistant.</p><p>
 
 <b>Links</b><br>
 Net-Temps contains links to other websites. These sites have their own policies
 and practices with respect to online privacy, and Net-Temps cannot be
 responsible for the privacy practices or the content of these websites. In
 addition, in certain instances a Net-Temps advertiser may ask you for personal
 information. Net-Temps cannot be responsible for the privacy practices of its
 advertisers.</p><p>

 </p><p><b>Co-Branded Partners</b><br>

Partners via co-branded websites provide many of Net-Temps' resume and interview services.  Some of these co-branded websites require users to provide personal information including full name and email address in order to proceed in order to proceed in the purchase process of the service.  Not all of the co-branded websites are covered by the Net-Temps Privacy Policy and users should read the partners' privacy statements carefully before proceeding.
 
 </p><p>
 
 <b>Troubleshooting</b><br>
 We use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server and to
 administer our website. An Internet protocol (I.P.) address is a set of numbers
 that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you log on to your
 Internet service provider or through your company's local area network (LAN) or
 wide area network (WAN). IP addresses are tied to personally identifiable information to enable our web-based service. 
 </p><p> 

 <b>Cookies</b><br>
 A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's computer tied to information 
 about the user. We use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies. For the 
 session ID cookie, once users close the browser, the cookie simply terminates. 
 A persistent cookie is one stored as a file on your computer, and it remains 
 there when you close Internet Explorer. The cookie can be read by the Web site 
 that created it when you visit that site again. Persistent cookies can be removed 
 by following Internet browser help file directions. You can configure your browser 
 to accept all cookies, reject all cookies, or notify you when a cookie is set. Each 
 browser is different so check the "Help" menu of your browser to learn how to 
 change your cookie preferences.
 </p><p>
 By setting a cookie on our site, users do not have to log in a password more than 
 once, thereby saving time while on our site. This information is stored and used to create a custom account for the user and make available information tailored to their requests (such as career-specific information like hot jobs, job search agents and news). If users reject the cookie, they may 
 still use our site. The only drawback to this is that the user will be limited 
 in some areas of our site.  For example, the user will not be able to have 
 career-specific information automatically available upon sign in (hot jobs, search agents and news). 
 </p><p>
 Some of our business partners and advertisers use cookies on our site. However, we have no 
 access to or control over these cookies once we have given permission for them to set cookies for advertising. 
 </p><p>

 <b>Surveys &amp; Contests</b><br>
 From time-to-time our site requests information from users via surveys or
 contests.  Participation in these surveys or contest is completely voluntary and
 the user therefore has a choice whether or not to disclose this information. 
 Information requested may include contact information (such as name and email
 address), and demographic information (such as zip code).  Contact information
 will be used to notify winners and award prizes. In addition, contest winners' names and address (city and state) are posted on the website. Survey information will be used for purposes of monitoring or improving the use and satisfaction of this site. All personal information collected is done so by Net-Temps and is not shared or sold to third parties. Survey information will be
 used for purposes of monitoring or improving the use and satisfaction of this
 site.</p><p>
 
 <b>Children</b><br>
 We do not specifically collect information about children. We believe that
 children should get their parents' consent before giving out personal
 information. If you are concerned about your child's use of Net-Temps, we
 encourage you to use web filtering technology to supervise your child's access
 to the site. We also encourage you to participate in your child's experience
 with Net-Temps.  With a little guidance, the site can prove very useful in
 finding a part-time or summer job for your child, as well as providing them with
 excellent career counseling information.</p><p>
 
 <b>Security</b><br>
 We operate secure data networks protected by industry standard firewall and
 password protection. We have security measures in place to attempt to protect
 against the loss, misuse and alteration of your user data under our control. </p><p>
 
 Only certain employees have access to the information you provide us. For
 example, we impose strict rules on our employees who have access either to the
 databases that store user information or to the servers that host our services.
 While we cannot guarantee that loss, misuse or alteration to data will not
 occur, we try to prevent such unfortunate occurrences.</p><p>
 
 <b>Notification of Changes </b><br>
 This policy may be revised over time as new features are added to the website.
 We will post those changes so that you will always know what information we
 gather, how we might use that information, and whether we will disclose it to
 anyone. Please check this site for information about revisions to our privacy
 policy. </p><p>
 
 We will notify you directly if there is a material change in our privacy
 practices. We will take commercially reasonable measures to obtain written or
 active email consent from the user if Net-Temps is going to be using the
 information collected from the user in a manner different from that stated at
 the time of collection. We will also post the changes in our privacy statement
 30 days prior to a change.
