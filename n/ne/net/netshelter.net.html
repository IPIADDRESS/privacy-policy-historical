<p>Consumer privacy is of paramount importance to NetShelter Inc. ("NetShelter"), our advertisers, and the Web publishers in our network. NetShelter is committed to protecting the privacy of consumers, publishers, and advertisers, and to do our part to maintain the integrity of the Internet.   NetShelter's combination of proprietary and partner technology allows us to deliver relevant, targeted content to individuals, but not at the expense of individual privacy.  This Privacy Policy describes how we gather information from you when you visit the web sites of NetShelter (including all our subsidiaries, affiliates, and networks) and when we serve advertisements on our network of web sites, why we collect this information, and how we may use and share this information. For more details on our practices, <a href="/contact.html"><br> </a><strong>contact us.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Non-Personally Identifiable Information</strong> <br> NetShelter may collect anonymous data while you are visiting a NetShelter web site or when we serve advertisements on our network of web sites. This anonymous data includes, but not limited to, information such as your IP address, web pages which have been viewed by you, date and time, domain type, and your responses to an advertisement delivered by us or a third party advertising technology vendor.  This type of information may be collected using different types of technologies, such as cookies and pixels.  This information is not tracked to a specific individual's personally-identifiable information.  You may elect not to allow us to use non-personally identifiable information by following the Opt-Out procedures set forth below.</p>
<p><strong>Personally-Identifiable Information</strong> <br> Personally-identifiable information is information that identifies you or can be used to identify, contact, or locate you, such as your name, address, email address, and telephone number.  We do not ask for personally-identifiable information other than as outlined below for business purposes.</p>
<p>At some of the NetShelter partner properties, they may ask people to register and provide personally identifiable information. None of this personally identifiable information will be combined with non-PII used for our anonymous ad serving. NetShelter is committed to making sure that our partners provide notice and choice to all consumers.</p>
<p><strong>Other Information That Is Collected</strong> <br> At some NetShelter properties, including this one, we collect personally-identifiable information from you if you want to become a part of our network of web sites ("business information").  We use this information to administer the network, such as maintaining account information, sending payments, etc.  We may share business information with third parties who provide administrative services (and they are required to maintain the confidentiality of the information), as well as pursuant to a court order or to law enforcement or government officials as we deem necessary or appropriate.</p>
<p><strong>How We Use Your Information</strong> <br> NetShelter may use your non-personally identifiable information to better target advertisements and other content to individuals in an effort to create a more relevant experience for each person. The non-personally identifiable information is also used to predict responses to advertisements, to help determine which ads perform best and which content is most appropriate for different individuals, and to provide aggregate reporting to advertisers and clients.  This information may also be combined with information from other sources, and shared with our affiliates and partners for similar use.</p>
<p>We may retain such information for up to two years.  Aggregate reports generated from such information may be kept longer.</p>
<p><strong>Opt-Out</strong> <br> We partner with third parties for certain advertising services. These third parties may be members of the Network Advertising Initiative (NAI), a coalition of online advertising networks that provides an opportunity for consumers to opt-out of targeted advertising by member companies. To learn more about behavioral advertising in general, and to exercise your right to opt-out of this practice, click here.</p>
<p>Please note that if you change your computer, change your internet browser (e.g. from Internet Explorer to Firefox), or delete all your cookies, you will need to renew your opt-out.</p>
<p><strong>Business Transfers</strong> <br> As we develop our business, we might sell or buy businesses or assets.  In the event of a corporate sale, merger, reorganization, dissolution or similar event, we reserve the right to include any or all stored personal information among the assets transferred to the acquiring company.</p>
<p><strong>Children</strong> <br> NetShelter does not knowingly collect personally-identifiable information from children under the age of 13 through our web sites.  If you are under 13, please do not give us any personally-identifiable information.  We encourage parents and legal guardians to monitor their children's internet usage and to help enforce our Privacy Policy by instructing their children to never provide personally-identifiable information on our web sites without their permission.  If you have reason to believe that a child under the age of 13 has provided personally-identifiable information to NetShelter through our web sites, please contact us, and we will endeavor to delete that information from our databases.</p>
<p><strong>Links to Other Web Sites</strong> <br> This Privacy Policy applies only to our web sites and not to any third party sites.  We suggest contacting those sites directly for information on their privacy, security, data collection and distribution policies.</p>
<p><strong>Security</strong> <br> We have reasonable security measures in place intended to protect against the loss, misuse or alteration of any personal information collected.  However, we are unable to guarantee that the security measures we take will not be penetrated or compromised or that your personal information will remain secure under all circumstances.</p>
<p><strong>Changes To Our Privacy Policy</strong> <br> This Privacy Policy is effective as of August 1, 2009.  We may change this Privacy Policy from time to time, and will post prior notice of any such changes on our web site.  Our use of information collected prior to a material change in this Privacy Policy shall continue to be governed by the Privacy Policy that is in effect at the time the information was collected, unless you opt in to allow the information to be governed by the new policy.  Please refer back to this Privacy Policy on a regular basis.</p>
