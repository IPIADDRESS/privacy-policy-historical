                    Net 4 India knows that you care how information about you 
                    is used and shared, and we appreciate your expectation that 
                    we will do so carefully and sensibly. This notice describes

                    interacting with Net 4 India, you agree to accept the practices 
                    described in this Privacy Notice. The Privacy Policy applies 
                    only to Net 4 India and those websites that carry the Net 
                    4 India brand. It does not apply to any other organizationâ€™s

                  <blockquote> 
                    <p>Here are the types of information we gather from visitors 
                      to Net 4 India: </p>
                    <p><span class="blueHead">Information You Give Us</span>: 
                      We receive and store any information you enter on our Web 
                      site or provided to us in any other way, such as by telephone 
                      or by electronic mail. For example, we are required by the 
                      Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers ("ICANN"), 
                      the organization which assumes responsibility for domain 
                      name allocation, to collect information about you during 
                      the domain name registration process. This information includes 
                      your full name, mailing address, phone number, email address, 
                      and, where provided, your facsimile number. We also collect 
                      certain financial information from you during the domain 
                      name registration process. Namely, when you apply to register 
                      a domain name through Net 4 India and the payment option 
                      selected by you is via Credit card, we require you to provide 
                      a credit card number and billing address before we will 
                      process that application. </p>
                    <p><span class="blueHead">Automatic Information</span>: Net 
                      4 India does not use "cookies." We do, however, 
                      receive and store certain types of information whenever 
                      you interact with us. For example, our servers track the 
                      type of Web browser you are using, and the page to which 
                      you link from Net 4 India. We collect this information to 
                      better develop a sense of what services our customers need 
                      and not to track your individual usage patterns. </p>

                    address, phone number, email address, and, where provided,

                    having your WHOIS Information available for bulk access, ICANN 
                    also requires Net 4 India to make that information available 
                    to third parties who enter into a bulk WHOIS data access agreement 
                    with Net 4 India. In making your selection to opt-into having

                    Information available for bulk access for marketing or other 
                    purposes, your WHOIS Information will still be made available 
                    to the public through the "port 43" WHOIS service 
                    described above. </p>
                  <p>Except as set out in this Privacy Notice, you will receive 
                    notice when personal information about you might go to third 
                    parties, and you will have an opportunity to choose not to 
                    have us share that information. We share personal information

                  <p>We work to protect the security of your information during
