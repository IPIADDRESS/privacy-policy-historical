              Privacy Policy<br>
              NetSuite respects the privacy of anyone who uses a NetSuite Web 
              site (www.netsuite.com, www.netcrm.com, or www.oraclesmallbusiness.com) 
              and a NetSuite online applications (NetSuite, NetCRM, NetSuite, 
              or the Oracle Small Business Suite). 
            </p><p>NetSuite gathers important information from our visitors and customers. 
              We publish this Privacy Policy to communicate how we gather and 
              use information about you, how we protect it, and how you can participate 
              in its protection.</p>
            <p>NetSuite provides its service to you subject to the NetSuite 
              Terms of Service and this Privacy Policy, which shall be deemed 
              part of the Terms of Service. We reserve the right to change this 
              Privacy Policy. If we change it, we will provide notification of 
              the change at least thirty (30) business days before the change 
              takes effect and include directions for how you can respond to the 
              change.</p>
            <p><b>Collected Information</b><br>
              We require people who register to use a NetSuite online applications 
              (the "Services") to give us contact information. Depending 
              on the services chosen, we ask for contact and account information, 
              such as name, company name, address, phone number, e-mail address, 
              password and the number of users in the organization who will be 
              using the Services, in addition to financial and billing information, 
              such as billing name, address and credit card number. When you express 
              interest in additional information, when you register for the Services, 
              or after you become a user, we may ask for additional personal information, 
              such as title, department name, fax number or additional company 
              information, such as annual revenues, number of employees or industry. 
              You can opt out of providing additional information by not entering 
              it when asked.</p>
            <p>NetSuite does not distribute or share customer e-mail addresses, 
              except as noted in its Terms of Service, or as may be required by 
              law.</p>
            <p>NetSuite uses the information we collect to set up the Services 
              for individuals and their organizations. We may also use the information 
              to contact customers and prospects to further discuss their interest 
              in our company, the Services we provide and ways we can improve 
              them, and to send information such as announcements of promotions 
              and events regarding our company or partners. We may also e-mail 
              a customer newsletter and updates about the Services or the company. 
              You can opt out of receiving these communications by replying to 
              them at the time they are distributed or at any time by e-mailing 
              <a href="mailto:support@netsuite.com">support@netsuite.com</a>.</p>
            <p>All financial and billing information that we collect through a 
              NetSuite Web site and the Services is used solely to bill for the 
              Services. NetSuite does not use this billing information for marketing 
              or promotional purposes. Except as we explicitly state at the time 
              we request information, or as provided for in the NetSuite Terms 
              of Service, we do not disclose to any third party the information 
              provided.</p>
            <p>NetSuite has referral relationships with third-party companies 
              and individuals ("Referral Partners") who refer their 
              customers to NetSuite. Customers who become paying users of a NetSuite 
              online application through a Referral Partner are considered customers 
              of both NetSuite and the Referral Partner. NetSuite and a Referral 
              Partner may share customer contact as well as account, financial 
              and billing information with respect to their joint business relationship 
              with the customer. The sharing of this information allows NetSuite 
              and the Referral Partner to establish the identity of the shared 
              customer and determine referral fees owed. This sharing also allows 
              Referral Partners to provide consolidated billing services to the 
              shared customer. Shared contact and account, financial and billing 
              information is governed by the NetSuite Terms of Service. NetSuite 
              does not share your business data with Referral Partners.</p>
            <p>NetSuite has integration relationships with third-party companies 
              and individuals ("Integration Partners"). These relationships 
              extend the functionality of the Services and the Integration Partner 
              application or service ("Integrated Service") by allowing 
              the Services and the Integrated Service to exchange customer data 
              and to establish linked business processes between the two. Customers 
              who pay NetSuite for use of the Services and use this Integrated 
              Service are considered customers of both NetSuite and the Integration 
              Partner. NetSuite and an Integration Partner may share customer 
              contact, account, financial and billing information, and business 
              data with respect to their integrated business relationship with 
              the customer. The sharing of this information allows NetSuite and 
              the Integration Partner to establish the identity of the shared 
              customer and determine referral fees owed. This sharing also allows 
              the Integration Partner to provide consolidated billing services 
              to the shared customer and allows for the enhanced functionality 
              of the integrated service. Shared contact, account, financial and 
              billing information, and business data is governed by the NetSuite 
              Terms of Service.</p>
            <p>NetSuite uses a third-party intermediary to manage credit card 
              processing. This intermediary is solely a link in the distribution 
              chain and is not permitted to store, retain, or use the information 
              provided, except for the sole purpose of credit card processing.</p>
            <p>Other third parties, such as content providers, may provide information 
              on a NetSuite Web site, but they are not permitted to collect any 
              information, nor does NetSuite share any personally identifiable 
              user information with these parties.</p>
            <p>NetSuite customers use NetSuite online applications to host data 
              and information. NetSuite will not review, share, distribute, print, 
              or reference any such data except as provided in the NetSuite Terms 
              of Service, or as may be required by law. We will view or access 
              individual records only with your permission (for example, to resolve 
              a problem or support issue). Of course, users of the Services are 
              responsible for maintaining the confidentiality and security of 
              their user registration and passwords.</p>
            <p>NetSuite may also collect certain information from visitors to 
              a NetSuite Web site and customers of the Services, such as Internet 
              addresses. This information is logged to help diagnose technical 
              problems and to administer the NetSuite Web site and Services in 
              order to constantly improve quality. We may also track and analyze 
              non-identifying and aggregate usage and volume statistical information 
              from visitors and customers and provide such information to third 
              parties.<br>
            </p>
            <p><b>Cookies</b><br>
              Cookies are files Web browsers place on a computer's hard drive. 
              They are used to help us authenticate clients and provide timesaving 
              shortcuts and preferences. NetSuite uses a persistent encrypted 
              cookie, if the client requests, to save and retrieve individual 
              authentication information as well as other per-client device preferences. 
              When a visitor follows a link to the NetSuite Web site from an 
              affiliate or promotion, NetSuite stores information about that 
              affiliate or promotion in a session cookie. Acceptance of these 
              cookies is optional. NetSuite issues a mandatory session cookie 
              to each user of the Services only to record encrypted authentication 
              information for the duration of a specific session. If you reject 
              this cookie, access to and usage of the Services will be denied. 
            </p>
            <p><b>Third Party Sites</b><br>
              The NetSuite Web site and online applications contain links to 
              other Web sites. NetSuite is not responsible for the privacy practices 
              or the content of these other Web sites. Customers and visitors 
              must check the policy statement of these others Web sites to understand 
              their policies. Customers and visitors who access a linked site 
              may be disclosing their private information. It is your responsibility 
              to keep such information private and confidential. </p>
            <p><b>Security</b><br>
              NetSuite has security measures in place for the Services to help 
              protect against the loss, misuse and alteration of the data under 
              NetSuite's control. When the Services are accessed using Netscape 
              Navigator, or Microsoft Internet Explorer versions 4.0 or higher, 
              Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology protects information using 
              both server authentication and data encryption to help ensure data 
              is safe, secure and available only to you. NetSuite also implements 
              an advanced security method based on dynamic data and encoded session 
              identifications and hosts the Services in a secure server environment 
              using a firewall and other advanced technology to prevent interference 
              or access from outside intruders. Finally, NetSuite requires unique 
              user names and passwords that must be entered each time a customer 
              logs on. These safeguards help prevent unauthorized access, maintain 
              data accuracy and ensure the appropriate use of data. </p>
            <p><b>Opt-Out Policy</b><br>
              NetSuite offers you a means to choose how we may use information 
              you provided. If, at any time after registering for information 
              or ordering the Services, you change your mind about receiving information 
              from us or about sharing information with third parties, send us 
              a request specifying your new choice. Send your request to <a href="mailto:support@netsuite.com">support@netsuite.com</a>. 
            </p>
            <p><b>Correcting and Updating Your Information</b><br>
              To update or change registration information, to update billing 
              information, or to discontinue the Services, log on to the Services 
              at a NetSuite Web site, click the Setup tab, and click links to 
              these tasks. You can also correct and update information by e-mailing 
              <a href="mailto:support@netsuite.com">support@netsuite</a>.com 
              or by calling 877-639-0235. </p>
            <p><b>Additional Information</b><br>
              Questions regarding this Privacy Policy or the security practices 
              of the Services should be directed to NetSuite's Security Administrator 
              by e-mailing <a href="mailto:security@netsuite.com">security@netsuite.com</a>.
