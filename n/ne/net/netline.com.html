NetLine collects information from our users at several different points on our website, including:
</p>

<p>
Newsletters / Email Alerts<br>
If you wish to subscribe to our newsletter, we ask for contact information such as name and email address.

If you cannot receive HTML, you will not receive a functioning sensor.
</p>

<p>
<b>SECURITY</b><br>
NetLine has implemented generally accepted standards of technology security in order to protect information from loss, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration or destruction.

<h4>Client e-Marketing Campaigns</h4>

<p>
NetLine delivers permission-based electronic marketing campaigns, including newsletters, surveys, and product offerings on behalf of our clients. NetLine's role in supporting our clients may include hosting the actual collection site, delivery of email, tracking results of e-marketing campaigns, analysis of data, and transferring collected data back to the client.
</p>

<p>
In some cases, NetLine stores database lists from our clients. These lists may contain email addresses, street address, contact information and other relevant information. Confidentiality of the client list is a top priority. NetLine is contractually bound to keep our clients' customer data private. A client's list is never shared with other clients, partners, etc., and is treated as an asset of our client.
</p>

<p>
NetLine tracks if a recipient has the ability to support HTML email in their email client, as well as whether an HTML email message has been opened or previewed. This capability is used only to deliver the best content to the recipient, and the recipient always has control to change their profile by contacting the client for whom the campaign was deployed.
</p>

<p>
Information regarding the activity of campaign recipients is only reported to the client who deployed the e-marketing campaign through NetLine. Information about specific campaign recipients is only shared with the client who owns the list on which the recipients email address originally appeared.
</p>

<p>
NetLine has a strict policy against sending unsolicited commercial email. If problems arise with a client's campaign, NetLine will work with the client to resolve the problems and prevent them in the future. If NetLine determines that a client has knowingly used our system for sending unsolicited commercial email, NetLine will revoke the right of this client to send email from our system.
</p>

<p>
If you no longer wish to receive email from a NetLine client, you may opt-out of receiving these communications by clicking on the link within the email you receive or by contacting the client for whom the campaign was deployed directly. If you experience difficulty opting out in either of these ways, email us at <a href="mailto:optout_help@netline.com">optout_help@netline.com</a>.
</p>

<p>
We've had great results generating leads through NetLine's content syndication program.  I've found their multiple targeting and filtering options, low guaranteed cost-per-lead, duplicate scrubbing practices, and customer service a unique combination in an industry cluttered with unsatisfactory lead generation options.  We plan on working with NetLine for many years to come.

We have been using NetLine since 2006 and their Lead Source program has been a great way to get targeted leads in our vertical industry of manufacturing. We have renewed every quarter because the leads have converted into both sales ready leads and closed business.

While running different Lead Source programs with NetLine my experience has been extremely positive. Their Client Services support sets them apart from other vendors as they pro-actively schedule 'check-up' meetings for our campaigns which have proven to be of tremendous value...

This is an essential 'tool' in my 'circulation inbox', consistently delivering subscribers I need in the demographic areas I'm looking for to meet my audit goals. NetLine and its TradePub.com offer the expertise to help me reach our company goals. And the customer service provided is excellent, requests are implemented in minutes!
