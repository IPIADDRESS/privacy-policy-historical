    <span class="Crosshead">Privacy Policy </span>
    <br>
</p>
<p>
    <span class="Crosshead">Our policy </span>
    <br>
</p>
<p>netimperative is committed to ensuring that your privacy is protected and respected. This Privacy Statement sets out our Privacy Policy and explains how we use the information we collect about you, how you can instruct us if you prefer to limit the use of that information and procedures that we have in place to safeguard your privacy. If you have any questions or concerns regarding this statement, you should contact info@netimperative.com.</p>
<p>
    <span class="Crosshead">The information we collect and how we use it </span>
    <br>
</p>
<p>We collect a limited amount of information about our users on the open site, so that we can provide a site that is more interesting and useful, as well as provide advertising that is more appropriate for our readers. We do this using a cookie that we place on your computer. You may disable cookies on your browser to prevent this.</p>
<p>When you register to partake in the public message boards, email lists, chat areas or email digest services on netimperative, we may ask for your name and email address. This is to ensure that while your username ensure anonymity on the site, we can communicate with users of the service to ensure that any and all issues and/or complaints are dealt with promptly.</p>
<p>When you become a member of netimperative, we need to know a little more about you: name, job title, company name, physical address, email address and telephone number. We gather this information to allow us to process your registration, open an account for you, and ensure that we can guarantee to the best of our ability that every member is who they say they are. By asking you to pay by credit card we also ensure that you are over the age of 18.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We also gather this information in order to ensure adequate levels of service. The relevant information is then used by us, our agents and our sub-contractors to provide you with statements of your account if you require them as well as helping us with communication regarding any matter relating to the conduct of site members and the provision of the service in general.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Pathgrade Ltd and our group and subsidiary companies may also wish to provide you with information about special features of our site, as well as any additional special services or products we think may be of use or of interest to you. If you would rather not receive this type of information, please send a blank email to noprom@netimperative.com</p>
<p>Neither Pathgrade Ltd, nor any group companies, will issue your personal data to third parties without your prior permission, except in the instance of the sale of the company as part of the transfer of assets to the new owner.</p>
<p>
    <span class="Crosshead">Our use of cookies </span>
    <br>
</p>
<p>netimperative collects IP addresses as part of the system administration process. This is both for our traffic statistics and also to help us better understand how our audience uses the site. This helps us evolve and develop our service.</p>
<p>We will not look at the IP addresses we collect unless it becomes necessary to resolve a complaint about misuse of our services and we need to investigate records of particular visitors. If your browser is set up to accept them, we will also use a feature known as cookie. Our cookies contain small pieces of information that our web site transfers to your computer's hard drive. Cookies can make our site more useful by allowing us to store information that you provided us on earlier visits to our web site, and by allowing you not to have to re-register when you make regular visits to the site. We will not be using cookies to uncover information about your computer. Advertising networks that serve ads onto the site may also use cookies, but please note that netimperative.com has no access to, or control over, those cookies.</p>
<p>The majority of browsers are set up to accept cookies, however you can configure your browser to either refuse cookies, or notify when your browser has received one.</p>
<p>
    <span class="Crosshead">How we protect your information </span>
    <br>
</p>
<p>The internet is not a secure medium. However we have put in place various security procedures as set out in this policy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>All site and member information is held in a database on servers that can only be accessed by authorised personnel. These servers are protected by firewalls, which are used to block unauthorised traffic.</p>
<p>netimperative does not hold credit card details to process financial transactions, including membership registration. Transactions take place on a third party site, where the third party informs our software on the status of any transaction. Any credit card transactions you make to purchase netimperative services or products while visiting our site will be confirmed by email.</p>
<p>netimperative will not disclose any information about individual users, except as described in this Privacy Policy, unless we are compelled to do so to comply with applicable laws or valid legal process, or to protect the rights and property of netimperative. We will not give, rent, lend or sell any individual user's information to our advertisers, sponsors or partners. Advertisers may give us an ad and tell us the type of audience they want to reach (for example, male users in Brighton). netimperative would then take the ad and display it to users who've told us they meet those criteria. In this process, the advertiser never has access to individual account information. Only netimperative has access to individuals' accounts.</p>
<p>We may also disclose aggregate information (for example, 1m of our members clicked on an advertisement last month) in order to describe our services to prospective partners, advertisers, and other third parties, and for other lawful purposes.</p>
<p>However, in the event that the business is sold, or integrated with another business, your details may be disclosed to our and any prospective purchasers' advisers and will be passed on to the new owners of the business.</p>
<p>
    <span class="Crosshead">Other points about privacy </span>
    <br>
</p>
<p>The information that you post on bulletin boards, in chat rooms and other similar places on our site is visible to the general public. Please remember that whenever you disclose personal information publicly, that information can be collected and used by others. If you post your email address on an open bulletin board, you may receive unsolicited messages from other parties. This is against the policies of netimperative.com, and if you believe you are receiving such messages via postings on netimperative, please email us at info@netimperative.com.</p>
<p>Furthermore, while we will do our best to protect your personal information, netimperative cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information that you transmit to us. Please be careful and responsible when maintaining the secrecy of your passwords and/or any account information online.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A number of our data providers, advertisers, sponsors or partners link from our site to areas on their own sites where they sell goods and services. If you follow links away from netimperative to their sites, please be aware that these other sites may have different privacy and data collection practices and that netimperative bears no responsibility for these independent policies. Please check each site for its own policies.</p>
<p>
    <span class="Crosshead">Updating your details </span>
    <br>
</p>
<p>If any of the information that you have provided to netimperative changes, for example if you change your email address, please let us know by following the links on the site or by sending an email to info@netimperative.com or by sending a letter to Customer Services, netimperative, 3 Waterhouse Square, 142 Holborn, London EC1N 2NX.</p>
<p>
    <span class="Crosshead">Your consent </span>
    <br>
</p>
<p>By submitting your information you consent to the use of that information as set out in this Policy. If we change our Privacy Policy we will post the changes on this page so that you may be aware of the information we collect and how we use it at all times. We will also email you should we make any changes so that you may consent to our use of your information in that way.</p>
<p>Because the internet infrastructure is global, the information you provide may be transferred outside the European Economic Area during use as set our in this policy. By submitting your information you consent to these transfers. While we are not anticipating such a transfer, as the databases will be held within the European Economic Area and subject to European Data Privacy laws, there may come a time where some information is accessible via localised servers in the rest of the world.  We will make you aware of such a situation should it arise. However, it should be noted that netimperative operates its business (and the business of all subsidiaries) according to European Data Protection directives.</p>
<p>
