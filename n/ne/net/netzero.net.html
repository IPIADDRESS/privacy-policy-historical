Our primary goal in collecting information from you is to provide you with a smooth, efficient and customized experience while using the Services. </p><ul><li><b>Personal information.</b>  We collect personal identifying information (including, but not limited to, name, address, phone number and e-mail address), demographic information (including, but not limited to, age, household size, income level, education level and gender), financial information (including, but not limited to, credit card information) and psychographic information (including, but not limited to, reason for Internet use, reason for use of NetZero and topics of interest to you) when you register for and use the NetZero Service and other NetZero programs.</li><br><br><li><b>Non-personal and Aggregated information.</b>  This refers to information that is not personally identifiable. We automatically gather certain information about you based upon your activity on the Site or the way you use the Service. We also collect machine data such as processor type, processor speed, operating system type, browser type, audio devices, modem devices, video cards and any software on your computer that may interact or interfere with our Software or Service. This information may include the web site's Uniform Resource Locator ("URL") that you just came from, which URL you next go to, what browser you are using, and your Internet Protocol ("IP") address. This information is compiled and analyzed on an aggregated basis. For instance, we may know that ten thousand people visit this Privacy Statement today, but we do not know their names or addresses so they are anonymous to us. NetZero also uses this information to do internal research on our visitors' demographics, interests and behavior to better understand and serve our visitors.</li><br><br></ul><p></p><p class="s0"><a href="#list">Back to list</a></p><br><a name="2"></a><p><b>Where do we collect information from you?</b><br><br></p><ul><li>We collect personal identifying information on the NetZero Site. We collect this, and other information, as part of NetZero's MyNetZero start page and, if you request, information regarding advertising services provided by NetZero or other information from the Investor Relations portion of our Site.  We also collect information from visitors to our Site regarding the referring Uniform Resource Locator ("URL"), your Internet Protocol ("IP") address, which browser you used to come to the Site and the pages of our Site that you viewed during your visit. An URL is the global address of documents and other resources on the World Wide Web. An IP address is an identifier for a computer or device on a TCP/IP network. TCP/IP stands for "Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol," and is the suite of communications protocols used to connect hosts on the Internet. Networks using the TCP/IP protocol route messages based on the IP address of the destination.</li><br><br><li><b>NetZero Service</b>. During the NetZero Service registration process we ask subscribers to provide personal identifying, demographic and psychographic information. The information you provide during registration is placed in your NetZero personal profile. You may access or change your NetZero personal profile information at any time. In addition, you may provide other personal identifying information and financial information, such as a credit card number and other credit card verification information if you choose to enter such information in order to purchase additional time on the Service or in order to use other NetZero Services.  NetZero may update the information in your NetZero Personal Profile with information obtained through generally accepted methods of address verification.  You may access your NetZero Personal Profile information at any time.

Our Service implements our own unique technology which builds a database of the types of sites you visit while you are online.
