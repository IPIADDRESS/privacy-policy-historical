We automatically gather certain information about you based upon your activity on the Site or the way you use the Service. We also collect machine data such as processor type, processor speed, operating system type, browser type, audio devices, modem devices and video cards. This information may include the web site's Uniform Resource Locator ("URL") that you just came from, which URL you next go to, what browser you are using, and your Internet Protocol ("IP") address. This information is compiled and analyzed on an aggregated basis. For instance, we may know that ten thousand people visit this Privacy Statement today, but we do not know their names or addresses so they are anonymous to us.

TCP/IP stands for "Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol," and is the suite of communications protocols used to connect hosts on the Internet. Networks using the TCP/IP protocol route messages based on the IP address of the destination.

Some of our services are offered in conjunction with our business partners in a co-branded manner. When we offer you co-branded services or products we may share your personal information with our third party partner if you have elected to receive e-mails as provided in your NetZero Personal Profile or during the registration process for the NetZero Service. If any company other than NetZero is collecting personal information (other than companies collecting information on NetZero's behalf), you will be notified prior to the time of collection or prior to the transfer of information to a third party by NetZero.
