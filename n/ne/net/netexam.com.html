<p>When you visit Media Defined, we may also use “Clear GIFs” (a.k.a. “web beacons” or “pixel tags”) or similar techniques in our Website and/or in our communications with you. A clear GIF is typically a one-pixel, transparent image located on a web page or in an e-mail or other type of message that helps us to verify an individual’s viewing or receipt of a web page or message. Clear GIFs allow us to know whether you have viewed a web page prior to visiting our Website and may enable us to relate such information to other information, including your personal information. We use information provided from clear GIFs to allow more accurate reporting, improve the effectiveness of our marketing and make Media Defined better for our users.</p>
