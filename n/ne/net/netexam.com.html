This Policy supplements our <a href="#WebsitePrivacyPolicy">Website Privacy Policy</a>, and unless specifically defined in this Policy, the terms in this Policy have the same meaning as the Website Privacy Policy.</p>

                                    <p>Media Defined, Inc. recognizes that the EEA and the U.K. have established strict protections regarding the handling of Personal Data, including requirements to provide adequate protection for Personal Data transferred outside of the EEA and the U.K.. To provide adequate protection for certain Personal Data about consumers, corporate customers, clients, suppliers, business partners, job applicants, and employees received in the U.S. from the EEA and the U.K., Media Defined has elected to self-certify to the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework administered by the U.S. Department of Commerce (“Privacy Shield”).

                                    <b>Personal Data Collection and Use</b>

                                    <p>Our <a href="#WebsitePrivacyPolicy">Website Privacy Policy</a> describes the categories of Personal Data that we may receive in the U.S. as well as the purposes for which we use that Personal Data. Media Defined will only process Personal Data in ways that are compatible with the purpose for which Media Defined collected it, or for purposes the individual later authorizes. Before we use your Personal Data for a purpose that is materially different than the purpose for which we collected it or that you later authorized, we will provide you with the opportunity to opt out. Media Defined maintains reasonable procedures to help ensure that Personal Data is reliable for its intended use, accurate, complete, and current.</p>

                                    <b>Data Transfers to Third Parties</b>
                                    <p><b><i>Third-Party Agents or Service Providers.</i></b> We may transfer Personal Data to our third-party agents or service providers who perform functions on our behalf as described in our Website Privacy Policy. Where required by the Privacy Shield, we enter into written agreements with those third-party agents and service providers requiring them to provide the same level of protection the Privacy Shield requires and limiting their use of the data to the specified services provided on our behalf. We take reasonable and appropriate steps to ensure that third-party agents and service providers process Personal Data in accordance with our Privacy Shield obligations and to stop and remediate any unauthorized processing. Under certain circumstances, we may remain liable for the acts of our third-party agents or service providers who perform services on our behalf for their handling of Personal Data that we transfer to them.</p>

                                    <p><b><i>Third-Party Data Controllers.</i></b> In some cases, we may transfer Personal Data to unaffiliated third-party data controllers. These third parties do not act as agents or service providers and are not performing functions on our behalf. We will only provide your Personal Data to third-party data controllers where you have not opted-out of such disclosures, or in the case of sensitive Personal Data, where you have opted-in if the Privacy Shield requires consent. We enter into written contracts with any unaffiliated third-party data controllers requiring them to provide the same level of protection for Personal Data the Privacy Shield requires. We also limit their use of your Personal Data so that it is consistent with any consent you have provided and with the notices you have received. If we transfer your Personal Data to one of our affiliated entities within our corporate group, we will take steps to ensure that your Personal Data is protected with the same level of protection the Privacy Shield requires.</p>

                                    <p><b><i>Disclosures for National Security or Law Enforcement.</i></b> Under certain circumstances, we may be required to disclose your Personal Data in response to valid requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.</p>
