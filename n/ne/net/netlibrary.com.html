                      The netLibrary Web site logs IP addresses for system administration purposes.
                      Your IP address can help us diagnose problems with our server and track a user’s
                      session to give us an idea of which parts of our site users are visiting.  In addition,
                      we track system information, such as the type of browser you are using, your operating
                      system, and the referring IP address.  We use this information in aggregate only; we
                      do not link IP addresses to any personal identifiers.

                      <b>Cookies</b><br>
                      netLibrary uses a feature of your browser called a cookie to store your member ID and
                      state information about where you are in the site.  netLibrary uses cookies to keep
                      track of where you are in the site since the Internet is a stateless environment, but
                      many of netLibrary's functions, such as moving from one page to the next in a book,
                      require state.  netLibrary does not store any of your personal information in cookies.
                      A cookie is simply a small data file that the Web site writes to your hard drive.
                      A cookie can’t read any other data off your hard drive, pass on a virus, or read
                      cookie files created by other sites.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      You can refuse cookies by turning them off in your browser. netLibrary will not
                      operate properly without cookies enabled.

                      <b>Registration</b><br>
                      A significant amount of the site is available without registration, but in order
                      to take advantage of some features of netLibrary, you must register and create a
                      member account. The netLibrary online registration form requires you to provide your
                      full name, e-mail address, ZIP code, a User Name, and password.  All other registration
                      information, such as your age, address, phone number, and employer, is optional and is
                      marked as such. We hope that, like many netLibrary users, you will want to provide
                      information about yourself so that we can continue to make our Web site more valuable
                      to you.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      For certain contests, surveys, or chat forums, we may ask you to provide additional
                      information about yourself.  Participation in these enhanced services is completely
                      optional.

                      If you choose to purchase additional products or services from netLibrary, we
                      will collect your billing address, credit card number, and credit card expiration
                      date.  Occasionally, our publishers request that we provide the name of all eBook
                      purchasers along with the items purchased.  The purchase of eBooks may imply consent
                      to providing that information.

											 <b>Recommend to a Friend</b><br>
											 If a user elects to use our "Recommend to a friend" service for 
											 informing a friend about eBooks offered by netLibrary, we ask them

											 will automatically send the friend a one-time email inviting them to 
											 visit the site but does not store these email addresses for 
											 future use.

                      <b>Usage</b><br>
                      As you interact with netLibrary, your usage patterns are logged anonymously.
                      This tells us if you searched to find information and what searches
                      you used.  We also log whether or not your searches were successful and what subject
                      areas you visited.  The logs use your session ID only, they do not connect with your
                      specific member ID.  Usage data is viewed and analyzed in aggregated form only.

                      <b>Circulation Records</b><br>
                      While you are viewing an eBook in netLibrary, or while you have an eBook checked
                      out, the system has to be able to recognize you to know if you have access rights
                      to that eBook.  However, we do not keep any long-term circulation records.  It is
                      not possible to view a history of what publications an individual has used.  We do
                      keep track of any eBooks that you personally may purchase so that the system can
                      recognize you as the owner and person authorized to access them.
