				</ul>
				<p>
					Further information about the third parties with whom we share personal information is available&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nettigritty.com/privacy/third-party-data/">here</a>.</p>
				<h3 id="sharing-with-partners">
					SHARING WITH PARTNERS</h3>
				<p>
					When we share personal information with certain third-party partners, including marketing and advertising partners, that information includes your name, email address and other information enabling partners to:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						assist you in using our products and services,</li>
					<li>
						contact you with offers, services or products that may be of interest to you, and</li>
					<li>
						provide you with their products or services.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					If you are located in a jurisdiction where such sharing requires your permission, we will only do so with your consent. Please note that if you access our services through a tool that hides your location, such as through a virtual private network, you may not receive our request for permission because we were not able to identify you as being located in a jurisdiction where your permission is required.</p>
				<p>
					Further, our partners are prohibited from using your contact information for any purpose beyond those set forth above without your consent.&nbsp;</p>
				<p>
					In the event we collect information from you in connection with an offer that is jointly presented by us and a partner, we will let you know who is collecting the information and whose privacy policy applies, as well as any options you may have regarding use of your information.</p>
				<h3 id="sharing-with-third-party">
					SHARING WITH THIRD PARTY SERVICE PROVIDERS AND VENDORS</h3>
				<p>
					Occasionally, we enter into contracts with carefully selected third parties so that they can assist us in servicing you (for example, providing you with customer service, fraud detection and deterrence or access to advertising assets and providing us with information technology and storage services) or to assist us in our own marketing and advertising activities (including providing us with analytic information and search engine optimization services). Our contracts with such third parties prohibit them from using any of your personal information for any purpose beyond the purpose for which it was shared.</p>
				<p>
					If you purchase a product or service from a third party through one of our brands, we will pass your personal information to such third party in order for them to fulfill your order.</p>
				<p>
					We also share non-personal information with certain third parties, including the media, industry observers, marketing and advertising partners, vendors, customers, potential customers or partners. For example, we disclose mobile search trends, email open rates by industry, campaign best practices or the number of users that have been exposed to, or clicked on, our websites or evaluated or purchased our products and services.</p>
				<h3 id="corporate-reorganizations">
					CORPORATE REORGANIZATIONS</h3>
				<p>
					If we are involved in a merger, acquisition, a sale of all or a substantial portion of our assets, or other similar sale transaction, your information will be transferred as part of that transaction. We will notify you by email and/or a prominent notice on our website of any such transfer and any choices you may have regarding your information.</p>
				<h3 id="authorized-users">
					AUTHORIZED USERS</h3>
				<p>
					All users authorized by you to have access to your account can view personal information stored in the account. A primary account holder can view personal information saved in subaccounts to which they have authorized access. We share information about authorized users only for legitimate purposes consistent with this privacy policy, including servicing your account and marketing products and services to you.</p>
				<h3 id="legal-reasons">
					LEGAL PROCESS</h3>
				<p>
					Lastly, if legally required to do so, or if we have a good faith belief that such disclosure is reasonably necessary, we may disclose your personal information to courts of law, law enforcement authorities and other relevant third parties, such as internet service providers, to conduct an investigation, respond to a third party or law enforcement subpoena or court order, bring legal action, prevent harm to others or pursue other relief when you or a third party are or may be:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						violating our terms and conditions of use;</li>
					<li>
						causing injury or other harm to, or otherwise violating the property or other legal rights, of us, other users, or third parties; or</li>
					<li>
						violating federal, state, local, or other applicable law.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					This disclosure can include transferring your information to the U.S. and other countries outside the European Economic Area. To the extent we are legally permitted to do so, it is our policy to notify you in the event that we are required to provide your personal information to third parties in connection with a subpoena.</p>
				<h2 id="security">
					SECURITY</h2>
				<p>
					The transmission of information via the internet, email or text message is not completely secure. Although we will do our best to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee the security of your information transmitted through the Services or over email; any transmission is at your own risk. Once we have received your information, we will take appropriate technical and organizational measures to safeguard your personal information against loss, theft and unauthorized use, access or modification.</p>
				<p>
					When we collect financial account information, such as credit card numbers, we protect its transmission through the use of encryption such as the Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol.</p>

				<ul>

					<li>
						We wish to erase the personal information as the processing we are doing is unlawful but you want us to simply restrict the use of that data;</li>
					<li>
						We no longer need the personal information for the purposes of the processing but you require us to retain the data for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims; or</li>
					<li>
						You have objected to us processing personal information we hold about you on the basis of our legitimate interest and you wish us to stop processing the personal information while we determine whether there is an overriding interest in us retaining such personal information.</li>

				<h3 id="objection">
					OBJECTION</h3>
				<p>

					THIRD PARTY LINKS AND INFORMATION COLLECTION AND USE BY OUR USERS</h2>
