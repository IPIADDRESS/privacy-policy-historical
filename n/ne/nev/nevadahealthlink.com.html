        </header>
        <section class="privacyPolicyContent">
            <p>Nevada Health Link will collect sensitive information from consumers in order to perform Nevada Health Link functions, such as enrollment in qualified health plans (QHPs) and eligibility for advance payments of the premium tax credit (APTC) and cost sharing reductions (CSR).  Personally-identifiable consumer information (PII) and Protected Health Information (PHI) are protected by federal law and state laws.  This Privacy Policy describes how information about covered persons or Nevada Health Link applicants may be used, disclosed, and accessed.</p>
            <h2 class="privacyPolicySubheader">What information will be collected?</h2>
            <p>Nevada Health Link will only collect the minimum information required to achieve its mission of providing affordable health insurance to individuals and small businesses in the State of Nevada.  The information collected during the application process, enrollment, customer support, and renewals will only be used to ensure the efficient operation of the Nevada Health Link, verify the eligibility of an individual to enroll through Nevada Health Link or to claim a premium tax credit or cost-sharing reduction, and the amount of the credit or reduction.  This information will not be shared with any other person or entity unless it is required to determine eligibility or to enroll in a qualified health plan.</p>
            <p>In order to facilitate enrollment in Nevada Health Link, and to determine eligibility for enrollment in qualified health plans (QHPs), advance payments of the premium tax credit (APTC), and cost sharing reductions (CSR), Nevada Health Link must collect information necessary to authenticate identity, citizenship status, residency, income, and incarceration status.  This data includes, but is not limited to:</p>   
            <ul>
    <li class="PPLi"><strong>Demographic Data:</strong> Name, Address, Phone Number, Email, Age</li>
    <li class="PPLi"><strong>Income Data:</strong> Tax Filing Status, Marriage Status, Tax Dependents, Employer, Annual or Monthly Income</li>
    <li class="PPLi"><strong>Citizenship Data:</strong> Social Security Number, Resident Alien Number, Native American Tribe ID Number, Incarceration Status</li>
    <li class="PPLi"><strong>Disability Information:</strong> Whether the applicant is blind, disabled, or requires assistance with daily living (this information cannot be used to deny coverage, but may help an individual to become eligible for Medicaid)</li>
    <li class="PPLi"><strong>Payment Information:</strong> Credit Card Numbers, Checking Account Numbers</li>
    <li class="PPLi"><strong>Health Insurance Coverage Information:</strong> Past and current health insurance coverage, tobacco use, consumer plan selections, and other information necessary to facilitate enrollment</li>
    <li class="PPLi"><strong>Pre-Authorizations, Current Episodic Status, Continuity of Care, etc:</strong>For individuals and families enrolling in Medicaid Managed Care Organization (MCO) Transition Qualified Health Plans who were formerly enrolled in a MCO Medicaid Plan, pre-authorized care and prescriptions, current treatment plans, and other continuity of care information will be transferred between the MCO Medicaid Plan and that MCO‚Äôs Transition Qualified Health Plan to ensure continuity of care for this special population.</li></ul>
            <p>This information is captured during the application and enrollment process and is used during annual open enrollments to provide an expedited enrollment experience.</p>
            <p>To improve the Nevada Health Link portal and the overall usability of the site, some data regarding page views, browsing behavior, and system response times may also be collected.  All personal data changes, eligibility results, plan selections, and any other action performed by the user will be tracked for audit and appeals purposes.</p>
            <p>Each interaction between an individual and Nevada Health Link or the Customer Contact Center will also be documented along with any communications, notifications, or emails.  The primary purpose of recording this information is to help improve the efficiency of the Customer Service Center, Nevada Health Link Operations, and to support the appeals process.</p>
            <h2 class="privacyPolicySubheader">What other parties will have access to my information?</h2>
            <p>Nevada Health Link will only share information with insurance carriers, and state and federal agencies as required to process requests for enrollment in QHP‚Äôs and to determine eligibility for health coverage, advance payments of the premium tax credit, and cost sharing reductions.  The following table outlines the entities Nevada Health Link will share data with, and how that data is used.  All entities that receive data from Nevada Health Link are required to support the same level of data security standards as Nevada Health Link itself.</p>

            <p>Information collected by Nevada Health Link during the enrollment process is protected by several federal and state laws, including provisions in the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA), IRS Code, and Nevada regulations.  In addition, Nevada Health Link has policies and procedures in place to ensure information security and privacy.   The following laws and guidelines are important safeguards in the protection of information shared with the Nevada Health Link:</p>
            <p>45 CFR ¬ß 155.260 states that Nevada Health Link may only use PII to determine eligibility for enrollment in qualified health plans, to determine eligibility for Medicaid and the Children‚Äôs Health Insurance Program, and to determine eligibility for exemptions from the individual mandate to maintain health insurance coverage.   Nevada Health Link will fully comply with this federal regulation.  Nevada Health Link will not create, collect, use or disclose personally identifiable information for any purposes that are not authorized under this regulation.   The following principles are outlined in the regulation:</p>
            <ul>
    <li class="PPLi"><strong>Individual Access:</strong> Individuals will be provided with a simple and timely means to access and obtain their personally identifiable health information</li>
    <li class="PPLi"><strong>Correction:</strong> Individuals will be provided with a timely means to dispute the accuracy of their personally identifiable health information and to have erroneous information corrected</li>
    <li class="PPLi"><strong>Openness and transparency</strong> All policies, procedures, and technologies that affect individuals and their personally identifiable information are fully disclosed to the public</li>
    <li class="PPLi"><strong>Individual Choice:</strong> Individuals will be provided a reasonable opportunity and capability to make informed decisions about the collection, use, and disclosure of their personally identifiable health information</li>
    <li class="PPLi"><strong>Collection, use, and disclosure limitations:</strong> Personally identifiable health information will be created, collected, used, and/or disclosed only to the extent necessary to accomplish the goals of Nevada Health Link</li>
    <li class="PPLi"><strong>Data quality and integrity:</strong> Persons and entities will take reasonable steps to ensure that personally identifiable health information is complete, accurate, and up-to-date to the extent necessary to provide services to the members of Nevada Health Link</li>
    <li class="PPLi"><strong>Safeguards</strong> Personally identifiable health information is protected with reasonable operational, administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to ensure its confidentiality, integrity, and availability and to prevent unauthorized access, use, or disclosure</li>
    <li class="PPLi"><strong>Accountability</strong> These principles are implemented, and adherence assured, through independent security audits by a third party.</li></ul>
