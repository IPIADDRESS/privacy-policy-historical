													<p> <strong>Overview </strong></p>
													<p>Protecting your privacy is important to NEC-Mitsubishi Electronics Display 
													  of America, Inc. ("NEC-Mitsubishi"). We strive to keep your personal 
													  information confidential. By ensuring that you are aware of and understand this 
													  Privacy Policy, we can provide you with better service. This Privacy Policy 
													  applies exclusively to information received from you online and its purpose 
													  is to inform you about the types of information we gather about you when you 
													  visit www.necmitsubishi.com ("our Site"), how we may use that information, 
													  whether we disclose it to anyone, and the choices you have regarding our use 
													  of, and your ability to correct, that information. </p>
													<p>Please take a moment to read the following policy to learn how we handle your 
													  personal information. This Policy may change from time to time, so please check 
													  back periodically. </p>
													<p>Questions regarding this Policy should be directed to <a href="mailto:privacy.policy@necmitsubishi.com">privacy.policy@necmitsubishi.com</a> 
													  or may also be communicated directly to the following address: </p>
													<p>Customer Information Privacy Practices<br>
													  c/o Legal Department<br>
													  NEC-Mitsubishi Electronics Display of America, Inc.<br>
													  1250 N. Arlington Heights Rd.<br>
													  Itasca, IL 60143 </p>
													<p> <strong>Sites Covered By This Statement </strong></p>
													<p>This Online Privacy Statement covers the collection and use of data on the 
													  www.necmitsubishi..com Web site in the United States. </p>
													<p> <strong>What Information We Collect </strong></p>
													<p>The information we collect on our Site generally falls into the following two 
													  categories: Personally Identifiable Information and Non-Personally Identifiable 
													  Information. </p>
													<p><strong>Personally Identifiable Information</strong>: This refers to information 
													  that lets us know the specifics of who you are. The Personally Identifiable 
													  Information we collect when you use our Site may include your name, mailing 
													  address, phone number, e-mail address, employer, credit card number and its 
													  expiration date, shipping address, public postings, prospect email address, 
													  and job title. We request Personally Identifiable Information when you order 
													  a product or service, participate in certain online promotional activities, 
													  fill out online surveys, register a product online, request technical support, 
													  and correspond with us. We also collect Personally Identifiable Information 
													  when you ask that we send products or information directly to other people; 
													  in these cases, we will collect the information you submit about the recipient. 
													</p>
													<p><strong>Non-Personally Identifiable Information:</strong> This refers to information 
													  that does not by itself identify a specific individual. The non-personally identifiable 
													  data we collect when you visit our Site may include the Uniform Resource Locator, 
													  i.e. the global address of documents and other resources on the World Wide Web, 
													  ("URL") of the Web site that you came from before visiting our Site, 
													  which pages you visit on our Site, which URL you next go to, which browser you 
													  used to come to our Site, your Internet Protocol ("IP") address, and 
													  any search terms entered on our Site. This Statement also contains more information 
													  about how we use cookies and other technology to collect this data. </p>
													<p>We do not connect the Personally Identifiable Information and Non-Personally 
													  Identifiable Information we collect on our Site. </p>
													<p> <strong>Why We Collect Your Information </strong></p>
													<p>Our primary goals in collecting information are to provide customers with superior 
													  service and to provide all visitors a smooth, efficient, and personalized experience 
													  while using our Site. For example, if you purchase products or supplies, or 
													  request information on our Site, we use your Personally Identifiable Information 
													  to fill your order or to provide you with the requested information. We may 
													  use Non-Personally Identifiable Information to analyze customer behavior to 
													  help us understand how visitors use our Site and to measure interest in the 
													  various pages. We use this information to improve the content of our Site, to 
													  make our Site easier to use, and to customize our advertising. </p>
													<p> <strong>How We Use Your Information </strong></p>
													<p>We gather and use information in a number of ways, including the following: 
													</p>
													<p><strong>Surfing:</strong> We collect certain Non-Personally Identifiable Information 
													  when you visit our Site or click on banner ads for NEC-Mitsubishi products and 
													  services. We collect this information to help run our Site more efficiently, 
													  to gather broad demographic information, to monitor the level of activity on 
													  our Site, and to evaluate the effectiveness of our advertising. We use cookies 
													  and other technology to collect this information. </p>
													<p><strong>Ordering</strong>: We collect Personally Identifiable Information when 
													  you purchase products, supplies or services online. We collect this information 
													  to deliver your order, to obtain payment, and to communicate with you about 
													  the status of your order. </p>
													<p><strong>Product registration</strong>: We collect Personally Identifiable Information 
													  when you register your NEC products online. We keep this information for reference 
													  if you later request customer service and we use the information to personalize 
													  that service. </p>
													<p><strong>Technical support:</strong> We may collect certain information when 
													  you request technical support for your NEC products. This information is necessary 
													  to identify your systems, understand the configuration of the products, diagnose 
													  your questions, and provide solutions. </p>
													<p><strong>Online surveys and polling:</strong> We collect Personally Identifiable 
													  Information from customers who volunteer to complete surveys or participate 
													  in polls. We use this information to improve our products and services. </p>
													<p><strong>Promotional activities/Seminars/Sweepstakes: </strong>We collect Personally 
													  Identifiable Information from you when you enter a promotional program or activity, 
													  including but not limited to seminars and sweepstakes. We use this information 
													  to administer the program or activity, to send you promotional e-mails, notify 
													  winners, and make the winners' list publicly available pursuant to certain states' 
													  laws. </p>
													<p><strong>Newsletters and promotional e-mails:</strong> We collect Personally 
													  Identifiable Information when you ask us (you "opt-in") to receive 
													  newsletters, promotional e-mails, and other information. We use this information 
													  to provide you with the information you request. </p>
													<p><strong>Contact information:</strong> If you contact us, we may keep a record 
													  of your correspondence or comments, including Personally Identifiable Information, 
													  in a file specific to you. We use this information to help us provide better 
													  customer service in the event you contact us again. </p>
													<p> <strong>Sharing Your Information </strong></p>
													<p>We only share your Personally Identifiable Information outside the NEC family 
													  of companies if it is required by law, or to protect NEC-Mitsubishi, its customers, 
													  or the public, or with companies that help NEC-Mitsubishi fulfill its obligations 
													  with you, and then only with partners who share NEC-Mitsubishi's commitment 
													  to protecting your privacy and data. Except as previously stated, we do not 
													  sell, trade, or rent to others the Personally Identifiable Information we collect 
													  online. Where NEC-Mitsubishi engages third parties to perform services on our 
													  behalf, we will require them to observe the intent of this Online Privacy Statement.</p>
													<p>Personally Identifiable Information previously collected by NEC-Mitsubishi 
													  may be transferred to any new corporate entity formed as a result of corporate 
													  reorganization of NEC-Mitsubishi, or any of NEC-Mitsubishiâs divisions, 
													  provided that such new corporate entity agrees to abide by the terms of this 
													  Privacy Policy.</p>
													<p>From time to time, we may be required to provide Personally Identifiable Information 
													  in response to a court order, subpoena, or government investigation. We also 
													  reserve the right to report to law enforcement agencies any activities that 
													  we in good faith believe to be unlawful. We may release certain Personally Identifiable 
													  Information when we believe that such release is reasonably necessary to enforce 
													  or apply our Terms of Use or to protect the rights, property, and safety of 
													  others and ourselves. </p>
													<p> <strong>Your Choices </strong></p>
													<p>NEC-Mitsubishi will not use or share the Personally Identifiable Information 
													  collected on our Site in ways unrelated to the purpose for which you provided 
													  the information, including those described in Section titled "How We Use 
													  Your Information ", without providing you a choice whether to permit any 
													  such unrelated uses. At the time you provide your information, we will offer 
													  you a choice as to whether you want to receive ("opt-in") further 
													  communications about special offers, product information or other marketing 
													  messages. If you choose not to receive these communications ("opt-out"), 
													  we will not use the information you provide for this purpose. You can opt out 
													  at any time as all e-mail communications from us, such as newsletters, tell 
													  you how to stop receiving them. Please follow these instructions if you no longer 
													  wish to receive the e-mail messages. </p>
													<p>You can correct factual errors in your personally identifiable information 
													  by sending us a request that credibly shows error. To protect your privacy and 
													  security, we will also take reasonable steps to verify your identity before 
													  granting access or making corrections. </p>
													<p> <strong>Use of Cookies on Our Site </strong></p>
													<p>A "cookie" is a small data file transferred by a Web site to your 
													  computer's hard drive. We send cookies when you surf our Site, make purchases, 
													  respond to online surveys or polls, or request information. Accepting the cookies 
													  used on our Site does not give us access to your Personally Identifiable Information, 
													  but we can use the cookies to identify your computer. The aggregate information 
													  collected permits us to analyze traffic patterns on our Site. This can enable 
													  us over time to provide you with a better experience on our Site by improving 
													  the content and making it easier to use. For example, cookies can keep track 
													  of what you have selected to purchase as you continue to shop and allow you 
													  to enter your password only once on pages where a logon is required. </p>
													<p>Most browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually refuse cookies, 
													  or selectively accept certain cookies, by adjusting the preferences in your 
													  browser. If you turn off cookies, though, there may be some features of our 
													  Site that will not be available to you and some Web pages may not display properly. 
													  You can find information on popular browsers and how you can adjust them to 
													  control cookies at the following Web sites: </p>
													<p>Microsoft Internet Explorer: <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/info/cookies.htm" target="_blank">http://www.microsoft.com/info/cookies.htm</a><br>
													  Netscape Navigator: <a href="http://www.netscape.com/legal_notices/cookies.html" target="_blank">http://www.netscape.com/legal_notices/cookies.html</a> 
													</p>
													<p><strong>Protecting Your Information</strong></p>
													<p>NEC-Mitsubishi safeguards the security of the data you send us with physical, 
													  electronic, and managerial procedures. We urge you to take every precaution 
													  to protect your personal data when you are on the Internet. Change your passwords 
													  often, use a combination of letters and numbers, and make sure you use a secure 
													  browser. </p>
													<p>NEC-Mitsubishi uses industry-standard Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption 
													  on all Web pages where personal information is required. To make purchases on 
													  our Site, you must use an SSL-enabled browser. This protects the confidentiality 
													  of your personal and credit card information while it is transmitted over the 
													  Internet. </p>
													<p>In order to most efficiently serve you, credit card transactions and order 
													  fulfillment are handled by established third-party banking, processing agents 
													  and distribution institutions. They receive the information needed to verify 
													  and authorize your credit card or other payment information and to process and 
													  ship your order. </p>
													<p>When you access your account information, the information is kept on a secure 
													  server. All of the customer data we collect is protected against unauthorized 
													  access by physical security means. </p>
													<p> <strong>Children's privacy </strong></p>
													<p>NEC-Mitsubishi takes special care to protect the privacy needs of children 
													  under the age of 13 and encourages parents to be an active participant in their 
													  child's online activities and interests. We abide by the Children's Online Privacy 
													  Protection Act (COPPA) requirements. </p>
													<p>NEC-Mitsubishi.com does not target and is not intended for children under the 
													  age of 13. You must be at least 18 years old to have our permission to use this 
													  site. Our policy is that we do not knowingly collect, use or disclose Personally 
													  Identifiable Information about visitors under 18 years of age. If you are the 
													  parent or guardian of a minor under 18 years of age and believe that they have 
													  disclosed personally identifiable information to us, please contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy.policy@necmitsubishi.com">privacy.policy@necmitsubishi.com</a> 
													  so that we may delete the minor's information. </p>
													<p> <strong>Links to Third Party Web Sites </strong></p>
													<p>Other sites accessible through our Web site have their own privacy policies 
													  and data collection, use and disclosure practices. Please consult each site's 
													  privacy policy. NEC-Mitsubishi is not responsible for the policies or practices 
													  of third parties. Please be aware that this site may contain links to other 
													  sites on the Internet that are owned and operated by third parties. This Privacy 
													  Policy does not cover the information practices of those Web sites linked to 
													  NEC-Mitsubishi.com. These other sites may send their own cookies to users, collect 
													  data, or solicit personal information. Additionally, other companies that place 
													  advertising on our site may collect information about you when you view or click 
													  on their advertising through the use of cookies. We cannot control this collection 
													  of information. You should contact these advertisers directly if you have any 
													  questions about their use of the information that they collect. </p>
													<p> <strong>Changes to This Privacy Policy </strong></p>
													<p>This Privacy Policy was last changed on March 26, 2003. If NEC-Mitsubishi makes 
													  changes to any terms or conditions of the Privacy Policy, the changes will be 
													  posted in this document so that you will always know what information we gather, 
													  how we might use that information and to whom we will disclose it. We may change, 
													  modify, add or remove portions of this Policy at any time, and any changes will 
													  become effective immediately upon being posted unless we tell you otherwise.<br>
