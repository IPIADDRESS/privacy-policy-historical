Your options can be checked and changed at any time by using "my nectar" or calling Nectar on 0870 4 100 100.
			<br><br><span class="nectarFormStrong">These options do not affect any other data, such as data participating companies may collect from other sources e.g. from an account with them. If you have concerns about the use of such data, please contact the relevant participating company directly.</span>
			<br><br><span class="nectarFormStrong">This is Loyalty Management UK Limited's policy on information collected through the Nectar programme.</span> It is part of the Collector Rules and Primary Collectors are responsible for ensuring that Additional Collectors on their accounts are aware of its terms. Primary Collectors and Additional Collectors ('you') will provide information on a registration form or other communication with us and when you use your card or give details to earn or redeem points, the participating company in question will record in its database the details of the transaction on which those points are earned or redeemed. If you transfer points from a participating company's old loyalty scheme into Nectar, associated information will also transfer to Nectar. Any of this information may be used by, and shared between us and participating companies* where necessary to operate the Nectar programme (for example, so that you can redeem your points or to help prevent abuse of the programme).
			<br><br>Information regarding the specific goods or services you buy from a particular participating company will <strong>not</strong> be passed to us or any other participating company except where required to operate the Nectar programme. A participating company with whom you use your card or redeem an offer may use information about the specific goods or services which you purchase from it to market to you or to update a database on which you already appear and will be entitled to do this even if you leave Nectar.
			<br><br>Any information (including your name and address) that does <strong>not</strong> relate to specific goods or services that you buy (for example, the number of points you earn every month) may be used by us to analyse where and how you use your Nectar card. We may also use that information, and share it with participating companies so they can use it to select and send you offers (which may include bonus offers) which we or they believe are likely to interest you. Participating companies may use and analyse that information to market their services to you outside the Nectar programme.
			<br><br>Nectar allows Additional Collectors (for example, family members) to earn points on a Primary Collector's account and will pool all information regarding that account (including that transferred from other programmes). The Primary Collector is primarily responsible for an account so will have access to information on all transactions on the account (including those by Additional Collectors) whilst Additional Collectors will be able to check the total balance on the account and details of Points earned by them. Offers and marketing may be sent to Primary Collectors and/or Additional Collectors.
			<br><br>One of the benefits of participating in Nectar is that, <span class="nectarFormStrong">on the basis referred to above</span>, we and participating companies* may use information about you to send you details of offers, promotions and products. Please email us via <a href="mailto:helpline@nectar.com?subject=nectar help&amp;body=Please include the following details in order to help is deal with your query: Name, Collector Number (if known), Date of Birth, Mother's Maiden Name, nature of query.
