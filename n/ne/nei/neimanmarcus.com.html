It allows us to recognize your		computer (but not specifically who is using it) upon entering our site by associating the identification numbers in the cookie 		with other customer information you have provided us. That customer information is stored on our secured database. 		<br><br>		We use cookies to keep track of what you have in your shopping cart and to remember you when you return to the Web Site as well 		as to identify the pages you click on during your visit to our site and the name of the Web site you visited immediately before 		clicking to NeimanMarcus.com. We use this information to improve our site design, product assortments, customer service, and 		special promotions. You can, of course, disable cookies on your computer by indicating this in the preferences or options menus 		in your browser.  However, it is possible that some parts of our Web Site will not operate correctly if you disable cookies.		<br><br>		We may contract with third parties who may use cookies and collect information on our behalf or provide services such as credit 		card processing, shipping, promotional services or data management. We call them our Customer Care Partners. These third parties 		are prohibited by our contract with them from sharing that information with anyone other than us or our other Customer Care Partners. 		However, we respect your right to choose whether to be included in such services.

Our Web Site is a general audience site. We do not collect or maintain information         from those we actually know are under 13, and no part of our Web Site is targeted to attract anyone under 13.  We also do not send         email correspondence to anyone who tells us that they are under the age of 13 without their parent's consent. Our online sweepstakes         are restricted to entrants who are at least 18 years old. 		<br><br>		Children under the age of 13 should always ask their parents or guardians for permission before providing any personal information to 		anyone online. We urge parents and guardians to participate in their children's online activities and use parental control or other web 		filtering technology to supervise children's access to the web.        <br><br>        <strong>Links to other sites</strong>        <br>        While visiting NeimanMarcus.com, you may link to Web sites operated by our business partners or other third parties.

Make sure you understand any Web site's privacy policies before providing personal information.        <br><br>        <strong>Online account registration</strong>        <br>        To make online shopping faster and easier, you may register with NeimanMarcus.com.

Using your name and a password         of your choice, you may access your account online at any time to add, delete, or change         information.        <br><br>        If you are using a public computer, we strongly encourage you to LOG OUT at the conclusion of         your session. Your information will still be stored with us but it will not be accessible to         anyone else from that computer.        <br><br>        <strong>E-mails</strong>        <br>        You will receive promotional e-mails from us only if you have asked to receive them.
