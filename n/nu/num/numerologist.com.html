     <p>We are not responsible   for the content or the privacy practices employed by other sites.

Numerologist.com requires   suppliers not to use the information for any purpose other than the purpose for   which it was originally collected, protecting the privacy of your information. </p>

Each Web site can send its own cookie to   your browser if your browser's preferences allow it, but (to protect your   privacy) your browser only permits a Web site to access the cookies it has   already sent to you, not the cookies sent to you by other sites.</p>
