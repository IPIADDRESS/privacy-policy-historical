<p>IV. User Accounts.</p>
<p>In order to use our Services, you will need to register and create, or otherwise accept, a user account (“User Account”). Note that when you log into a User Account, you are agreeing to be bound by this Privacy Policy and the <a href="http://www.nuorder.com/termsandconditions/">TERMS AND CONDITIONS</a>, and are also “accepting” your User Account.

Even if you choose to unsubscribe or otherwise modify your User Account settings, the COMPANY reserves the right to contact you regarding your account and your use of this Website and/or the Services.</p>
<p>V. Special Promotions and Purchases; Submission of Content to be Published.</p>
<p>To participate in some Services such as sweepstakes, contests and surveys (“Special Promotions”), or to make online purchases or subscriptions (such purchases or subscriptions herein referred to as “Purchases”), you may need to provide personally identifiable information, such as name, address, e-mail address, phone number, and date of birth. Your information may be collected by COMPANY or by a third party, such as a co-sponsor or a vendor involved in, or providing services in connection with, a Special Promotion, or an e-commerce partner in the case of a Purchase.</p>
<p>If you make a Purchase or enter a sweepstakes or other Special Promotion on one of our sites or through our Services, the COMPANY will collect your personally identifiable information, and you are deemed to consent to us providing your information to third parties who provide certain services such as processing of credit card transactions, customer service, promotion or sweepstakes administration, order fulfillment and/or prize delivery, as applicable. (As more fully described below in Section XII , these third parties are ly prohibited from using this information for their own marketing purposes and/or from sharing, selling, or otherwise distributing any personal data of our customers, unless you choose to opt in for such additional uses and/or disclosure by the third parties, under their respective privacy policies.). Also, by entering a sweepstakes or other Special Promotion, you are agreeing to the official rules that govern that sweepstakes or other Special Promotion, which may contain specific provisions applicable to you, including, except where prohibited by law, allowing the sponsor(s) of the promotion to use your name, voice or likeness in advertising or marketing associated with the promotion.</p>
<p>If you make a purchase or enter a promotion (such as a sweepstakes) in which the COMPANY is participating on a third party’s website (or through some other means or medium), we will collect your information from the third party only if you opt-in to receive additional communications from us, or we are required to fulfill some function in relation to your activity (e.g., to send your order or deliver a prize).</p>
<p>If you submit to the Website a comment, photograph or other content to be published, online or offline (including on-air, in a DVD, or any other format), we may publish your name or other personally identifiable information in connection with publishing the content and you are hereby deemed to give us permission to do such.</p>
<p>VI. Information Collected by Other Means or Media.</p>
<p>In some situations, we may also collect personally identifiable information and other information about you through other means, directly or indirectly. For example, if you access any COMPANY content, or purchase such content via your wireless carrier or through another third party, the COMPANY may collect information directly from you or through the third party. Likewise, if you use our software, or provide information to other companies who share information about their customers, we may collect additional information about you. In each of these cases, the COMPANY will apply this Privacy Policy to any personally identifiable information.</p>
<p>VII. Information About Other People.</p>
<p>Some COMPANY Websites and Services may ask you to submit personally identifiable, as well as other information about other people and/or their affiliated companies. For example, in creating a Buyer Account, a Brand User will have to supply information about a Buyer.</p>
<p>Such information may be used to facilitate transactions among Buyers, Brand Users, the COMPANY, and third parties. As such, such information may be shared and used by all such parties to the extent the COMPANY desires or otherwise allows such information to be shared. You are hereby accepting and agreeing to such use and sharing of information.</p>

<p>Please note that whenever you opt in to receive future communications from a third party, your information will be subject to the third party’s privacy policy. If you later decide that you do not want that third party to use your information, you will need to contact the third party directly, as we have no control over how third parties use information. You should always review the privacy policy of any party that collects your information to determine how that entity will handle your information.</p>
<p>COMPANY will not share, sell, rent, or disclose any personally identifiable information that we have collected except as stated herein, or in the following instances: 1) we have been given your consent to disclose; 2) we have previously informed you of the disclosure, including by means of our Privacy Policy or on the Website, or through the Service where you provided your information; 3) we are required by law, legal process, or court order to disclose; 4) disclosure is necessary to identify, contact, or bring legal action against someone who may cause or be causing harm to, or interference with, COMPANY’s rights or property, other COMPANY Website users, or anyone else; or 5) to respond to an inquiry, request or complaint that you have made.

<p>c. Holders of Buyer Accounts that are designated as associated with each other by a Brand User may be able to view all information of or regarding each other.</p>
<p>XIII. Our Commitment to Data Security.</p>
<p>While the COMPANY takes reasonable and appropriate precautions to protect your personally identifiable information from unauthorized disclosure and to prevent possible security breaches in our Websites, Services, and customer databases, no website, Internet transmission, computer system, or wireless connection is completely secure. Consequently, COMPANY cannot guarantee that unauthorized access, hacking, data loss, or other breaches will never occur. The COMPANY cannot guarantee to Buyers that User Accounts are properly affiliated by Brand Users. Your use of the COMPANY Websites and Services is at your own risk. COMPANY urges you to take steps to determine what information you will submit to the Website, keep your information safe by memorizing your password or keeping it in a safe place (separate from your account information), logging out of your User Account, and closing your Web browser.</p>
<p>Whenever you give COMPANY sensitive or confidential information (for example, credit card numbers for Purchases), COMPANY will take commercially reasonable steps to protect the transmission of such information by establishing a secure connection with your Web browser. COMPANY employs a security technology known as a secure-socket-layer (“SSL”) to protect the transmission of payment information to the site. Unless otherwise specified herein or on the Website where you make a Purchase, credit and debit card numbers are used only for payment processing and are not retained for marketing purposes.</p>
<p>XIV. Hyperlinks To and From Other Sites.</p>
