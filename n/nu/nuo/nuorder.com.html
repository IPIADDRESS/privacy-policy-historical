<p class="c2"><span class="c3">As stated in the </span><span class="c5 c3"><a class="c4" href="/termsandconditions/">TERMS AND CONDITIONS</a></span><span class="c3">, you will be deemed to have consented to the disclosure to, and use by, a subsequent owner or operator of a COMPANY Website or Service, of any information about you contained in the applicable COMPANY database, if COMPANY or one of its companies assigns its rights and obligations regarding any of your information at the time of a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or substantially all of COMPANY’s or such COMPANY company’s assets related to the applicable site or Service to a subsequent owner or operator. In the event of such a merger, acquisition, or sale, your continued use of the Website or any related Service signifies your agreement to be bound by the </span><span class="c5 c3"><a class="c4" href="/termsandconditions/">TERMS AND CONDITIONS</a></span><span class="c3">&nbsp;the Website’s or Service’s subsequent owner or operator.</span></p>
