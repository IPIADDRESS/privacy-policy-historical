            <p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
            <p class="c2"><span class="c3">While the COMPANY takes reasonable and appropriate precautions to protect your personally identifiable information from unauthorized disclosure and to prevent possible security breaches in our Websites, Services, and customer databases, no website, Internet transmission, computer system, or wireless connection is completely secure. Consequently, COMPANY cannot guarantee that unauthorized access, hacking, data loss, or other breaches will never occur. The COMPANY cannot guarantee to Buyers that User Accounts are properly affiliated by Brand Users. Your use of the COMPANY Websites and Services is at your own risk. COMPANY urges you to take steps to determine what information you will submit to the Website, keep your information safe by memorizing your password or keeping it in a safe place (separate from your account information), logging out of your User Account, and closing your Web browser.</span></p>
            <p class="c1"><span class="c3"></span></p>
            <p class="c2"><span class="c3">Whenever you give COMPANY sensitive or confidential information (for example, credit card numbers for Purchases), COMPANY will take commercially reasonable steps to protect the transmission of such information by establishing a secure connection with your Web browser. COMPANY employs a security technology known as a secure-socket-layer ("SSL") to protect the transmission of payment information to the site. Unless otherwise specified herein or on the Website where you make a Purchase, credit and debit card numbers are used only for payment processing and are not retained for marketing purposes.</span></p>
