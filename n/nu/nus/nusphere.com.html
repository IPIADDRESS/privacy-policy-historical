          <p>At
          NuSphere we respect your right to privacy and we understand that, as a
          visitor to NuSphere.com, you prefer to control your own personal
          information and preferences. For this reason, we may ask you to
          register or to provide personal information and preferences when you
          visit certain areas of www.NuSphere.com, download free software, request
          new information, or subscribe to the NuSphere newsletter.</p>
          <p>We will
          guard the personal information you share with us to ensure the
          content, services, and advertising that we provide on NuSphere.com
          (and related NuSphere sites) are always tailored to your current,
          designated preferences.</p>
          <p>When you
          provide NuSphere with your name (or alias), mailing address, or
          telephone number, NuSphere and NuSphere representatives may use your
          postal address and phone number to alert you to certain upgrades,
          special offers, updated information, classes, and/or new services.
          ("Representatives" include value-added resellers and
          authorized training partners.)</p>
          <p>When you
          provide NuSphere with your e-mail address (as an alternative to, or in
          addition to, your mailing address and phone number), NuSphere may
          contact you via e-mail. NuSphere never releases e-mail addresses to
          its Representatives. NuSphere also does not offer, or allow for the
          selling of, any user-provided information to third parties.</p>
          <p>If you
          do not want NuSphere or NuSphere representatives to contact you, you
          may "opt out" of this preference at any time, whether you're
          online or contacting NuSphere directly. As part of your preference
          flexibility, you'll always have the option to opt [back] in and have
          NuSphere contact you based on your previous or new preferences. For
          detailed instructions, please see the section "<a href="#contact">Contact
          Us</a>,"
          below.</p>
          <p>If you
          choose not to register or provide personal information, you can still
          visit most of NuSphere's Web sites; however, you will not have access
          to areas that require personal identification.</p>
          <p class="subhead">NuSphere membership</p>
          <p>NuSphere
          offers free membership to all NuSphere.com visitors. In order to
          establish membership, visitors are requested to provide both personal
          information and preferences. This information is stored and protected
          by your user-established Member ID and Password.</p>
          <p>There is
          an additional "Remember Me" option that allows you to be
          recognized (by your user-designated name or alias) when returning to
          any NuSphere Web site in the future. Acceptance of this option allows
          NuSphere to place a log file (cookie) that contains only enough
          information to identify you upon return visits. This eliminates the
          need to continually ask you for the same information. This cookie
          contains no personal information, with the exception of your name or
          alias that you previously provided.</p>
          <p>No
          information, other than that found in the cookie, will be accessed by
          any NuSphere system. Access to your user information always requires
          both your Member ID and Password.</p>
          <p class="subhead">How
          NuSphere will protect your personal information</p>
          <p>NuSphere
          will always protect the personal information that you share with us.
          NuSphere stores information internally in a controlled, secure
          environment. If, for example, you make a purchase online, we route all
          transactions through SSL (Secure Socket Layers) and will process your
          credit card number only to secure your current payment. The SSL
          transaction does not retain your credit card number subsequent to the
          transaction at hand, and will not use the number for marketing
          purposes.</p>
          <p>If
          NuSphere requests general demographic information, this information is
          limited to reporting purposes only; members remain anonymous. Phone
          numbers, e-mail addresses, and postal addresses are never shared for
          demographic reports with outside entities.</p>
          <p>NuSphere
          may occasionally present a special contest or promotion that is
          sponsored by another company. To qualify for entry, we may ask you to
          provide personal information. If we plan to share that information
          with the sponsor(s), we will provide an up-front statement to that
          effect.</p>
          <p class="subhead">NuSphere
          would like to receive your comments and questions about this Privacy
          Policy</p>
          <p>Please
          address comments or questions regarding NuSphere's Privacy Policy to
          one of the addresses listed below (for online, e-mail, or postal
          mail). NuSphere may occasionally update, amend, or change this Privacy
          Policy based on user feedback and as needed or appropriate. Notice of
          revisions will always be posted on this Privacy Web page.</p>
