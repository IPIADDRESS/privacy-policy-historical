        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <h2>NutshellMail Privacy Policy</h2>
        <h3><strong>1. Introduction</strong></h3>
        <p>(i) Welcome to NutshellMail.com (the "Site"), which is owned and operated by Nutshell Mail L.L.C. ("NutshellMail") and provides:</p>
        <p>(a) electronic messaging aggregation and accessibility services known as NutshellMailâ„¢;<br>(b) delivery of aggregated messages in the form of e-mail updates; and<br>(c) related services (collectively, (a)-(c) above are the "Services").</p>
        <p>(ii) NutshellMail fully appreciates the need to protect the privacy of users of the Site and/or the Services (individually, a "User" and collectively, the "Users"). As a result, your privacy is very important to us, and this Privacy Policy identifies and explains the types of information we may gather along with potential users and uses of that information.</p>
        <p>(iii) NutshellMail reserves the right to change all or a portion of this Privacy Policy at any time with or without individual notice to you, and your continued use of the Services or the Site constitutes your binding acceptance of any such changes. Changes to the Privacy Policy shall become effective upon posting to the Site.  You may always review the most current version of our Privacy Policy by accessing the Site.</p>
        <p>(iv) Please be advised that use of the Site and the Services are subject to and controlled by NutshellMail's Terms of Service ("TOS"). By using the Services, you evidence your complete and unqualified acceptance of the TOS, which creates a binding contract between us with respect to your duty to comply with the TOS. All capitalized terms used herein shall have the same meaning as defined in the TOS unless otherwise expressly defined in this Privacy Policy.</p>
        <h3><strong>2. Information Gathered by NutshellMail</strong></h3>
        <p>(i) NutshellMail may gather personal information about you that is provided or transmitted by Users of the Site and/or the Services. We may also gather aggregated tracking information regarding overall usage of the Site and the Services, such as but not limited to tallies of page views and click-through activity and/or the number of messages sent via the Services. This information is used to help us understand how Users are using the Site and the Services.</p>
        <p>(ii) The following are some but not necessarily all of the methods that may be used us to obtain information from and about Users:</p>
        <p>(a) Registration, Payment &amp; Support: We may obtain information that is provided during any voluntary or mandatory registration process, online payment transaction or request for technical support, which may include without limitation the User's name, postal address, e-mail addresses, cell and landline phone numbers, e-mail service providers, social network providers and certain demographic information, such as age and gender. We may ask you to provide one or more e-mail addresses and/or social network usernames and their corresponding passwords. This information is only collected when required to authenticate your access to the e-mail account or social network as well as to provide the Services. We may also obtain this information when collected by third parties that have a business relationship with NutshellMail and to whom you have provided such information.</p>
        <p>If payment is required for the Services, NutshellMail will request your name, mailing address, phone number, credit card information and other information to securely process the financial transaction.
