    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

    <p>We at NuWire, Inc. appreciate you visiting NuWireInvestor.com. Your privacy is important
    to us. To better protect your privacy, we provide this notice explaining our online
    information practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used on this website.</p>

    <h2>THE INFORMATION WE COLLECT</h2>

    express an opinion, subscribe to one of our services such as our online magazine or
    participate in one of our online forums. The types of personally identifiable information
    that may be collected at these pages include: name, address, e-mail address, telephone
    number, fax number, credit card information and information about your interests in
    and use of various products, programs and services.</p>
    <p>There are certain circumstances where you can submit information about other people.
    For example, you might submit a person's name and e-mail address to send an article,
    a sponsored subscription or a promotional offer. The types of personally identifiable
    information that may be collected about other people at these pages include: recipient's
    name, address, e-mail address and telephone number.</p>
    <p>We also may collect certain non-personally identifiable information when you visit
    many of our web pages, such as the type of browser you are using (e.g., Firefox, Internet
    Explorer), the type of operating system you are using (e.g., Windows Vista, Mac OS)
    and the domain name of your Internet service provider (e.g., Verizon, AOL).</p>
    <h2>HOW WE USE THE INFORMATION</h2>
    <p>We may use the information you provide about yourself to fulfill your requests for
    our products, programs and services, to respond to your inquiries about our offerings
    and to offer you other products, programs or services that we believe may be of interest
    to you.</p>
    <p>We sometimes use this information to communicate with you, such as to notify you
    when you have won one of our contests or when we make changes to our subscriber agreements,
    to fulfill a request by you for an online magazine or to contact you about your account
    with us.</p>
    <p>We use the information that you provide about others to enable us to send them your
    gifts or free promotional items. From time to time, we also may use this information
    to offer our products, programs or services to them.</p>

    use the non-personally identifiable information that we collect to improve the design
    and content of our site and to enable us to personalize your Internet experience. We
    also may use this information in the aggregate to analyze site usage, as well as to

    for example, in response to a court order or a subpoena. We also may disclose such information
    in response to a law enforcement agency's request, or where we believe it is necessary
    to investigate, prevent or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud,
    situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations
    of our terms of use or as otherwise required by law. In addition, we may transfer information
    about you if we are acquired by or merged with another company.</p>
    <p>Agents and contractors of NuWire who have access to personally identifiable information
    are required to protect this information in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy
    Notice by, for example, not using the information for any purpose other than to carry
    out the services they are performing for NuWire.</p>
    <p>Although we take appropriate measures to safeguard against unauthorized disclosures
    of information, we cannot assure you that personally identifiable information that we
    collect will never be disclosed in a manner that is inconsistent with this Privacy Notice.</p>
    <p>NuWire will not disclose personally identifiable information to other companies (other
