        Microsoft CodePlex Privacy Statement</h1>
    <h3>
        Last updated: March 2009</h3>
    <p>
        Microsoft is committed to protecting your privacy, while delivering software that
        brings you the performance, power, and convenience you desire in your personal computing.
        This privacy statement explains many of the data collection and use practices of
        Microsoft CodePlex (“CodePlex”). It focuses on features that communicate with the
        Internet. It does not apply to other online or offline Microsoft sites, products,
        or services.
    </p>
    <p>
        CodePlex is Microsoft's open source project hosting web site. CodePlex enables you
        to start a new project, join an existing one, or download software created by the
        community.</p>
    <h2 class="Header HeaderDarkText">
        Collection and Use of Your Information</h2>
    <p>
        The information we collect from you will be used by Microsoft and its controlled
        subsidiaries and affiliates to enable the features you are using and provide the
        service(s) or carry out the transaction(s) you have requested or authorized. It
        may also be used to analyze and improve Microsoft products and services.</p>
    <p>
        We may send certain mandatory service communications such as welcome letters, billing
        reminders, information on technical service issues, and security announcements.
        Some Microsoft services may send periodic member letters that are considered part
        of the service. We may occasionally request your feedback, invite you to participate
        in surveys, or send you promotional mailings to inform you of other products or
        services available from Microsoft and its affiliates.
    </p>
    <p>
        Except as described in this statement, personal information you provide will not
        be transferred to third parties without your consent. We occasionally hire other
        companies to provide limited services on our behalf, such as packaging, sending
        and delivering purchases and other mailings, answering customer questions about
        products or services, processing event registration, or performing statistical analysis
        of our services. We will only provide those companies the personal information they
        need to deliver the service, and they are prohibited from using that information
        for any other purpose.</p>
    <p>
        Microsoft may access or disclose information about you, including the content of
        your communications, in order to: (a) comply with the law or respond to lawful requests
        or legal process; (b) protect the rights or property of Microsoft or our customers,
        including the enforcement of our agreements or policies governing your use of the
        services; or (c) act on a good faith belief that such access or disclosure is necessary
        to protect the personal safety of Microsoft employees, customers, or the public.
    </p>
    <p>
        Information that is collected by or sent to Microsoft by CodePlex may be stored
        and processed in the United States or any other country in which Microsoft or its
        affiliates, subsidiaries, or service providers maintain facilities. Microsoft abides
        by the safe harbor framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding
        the collection, use, and retention of data from the European Union.</p>
    <h2 class="Header HeaderDarkText">
        Collection and Use of Information about Your Computer</h2>
    <p>
        When you use software with Internet-enabled features, information about your computer
        ("standard computer information") is sent to the Web sites you visit and online
        services you use. Microsoft uses standard computer information to provide you Internet-enabled
        services, to help improve our products and services, and for statistical analysis.
        Standard computer information typically includes information such as your IP address,
        operating system version, browser version, and regional and language settings. In
        some cases, standard computer information may also include hardware ID, which indicates
        the device manufacturer, device name, and version. If a particular feature or service
        sends information to Microsoft, standard computer information will be sent as well.</p>
    <p>
        The privacy details for each CodePlex feature, software or service listed in this
        privacy statement describe what additional information is collected and how it is
        used.</p>
    <h2 class="Header HeaderDarkText">
        Security of your information</h2>
    <p>
        Microsoft is committed to helping protect the security of your information. We use
        a variety of security technologies and procedures to help protect your information
        from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. For example, we store the information
        you provide on computer systems with limited access, which are located in controlled
        facilities.
    </p>
    <h2 class="Header HeaderDarkText">
        Changes to this privacy statement</h2>
    <p>
        We will occasionally update this privacy statement to reflect changes in our products,
        services, and customer feedback. When we post changes, we will revise the "last
        updated" date at the top of this statement. If there are material changes to this
        statement or in how Microsoft will use your personal information, we will notify
        you either by posting a notice of such changes prior to implementing the change
        or by directly sending you a notification. We encourage you to periodically review
        this statement to be informed of how Microsoft is protecting your information.</p>
    <h2 class="Header HeaderDarkText">
        For More Information</h2>
    <p>
        Microsoft welcomes your comments regarding this privacy statement. If you have questions
        about this statement or believe that we have not adhered to it, please <a id="ctl00_ctl00_MasterContent_Content_SecureContactUs" href="https://www.codeplex.com/site/contact">contact us</a>.
