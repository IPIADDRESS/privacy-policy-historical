<span class="headline">Privacy Statement</span>
</p>
     <br>

<p><i>Your privacy is important to us. This Privacy Statement governs the practices of NHL Interactive CyberEnterprises, LLC ("NHL ICE", the operator of NHL.com) and its affiliates, which include NHL Enterprises, L.P., NHL Enterprises Canada, L.P., NHL Enterprises B.V. and the National Hockey League (collectively, the "NHL Parties", "us", "our" and "we"). The NHL Parties are committed to undertaking reasonable measures to protect the privacy and security of all of the personal information that is provided to us. Please read the following description of our policies and practices regarding your personal information.</i></p>

<p><b>Collection of Personal Information</b></p>
<ul>
<p></p><li class="headlinetext">The NHL Parties and their agents and representatives collect personal information in a number of circumstances. For example, when you visit NHL.com, we may collect personal information from you such as name, home address, e-mail address, age, favorite NHL team, purchase history, products used or searched for, phone number used to call customer service and credit card information for purposes such as events and contests; registrations for our newsletter, NHL Game Notes, video highlights and video offerings, chat room and bulletin board; shopping in the shopping area at shop.nhl.com (the "Shop"); and participation in other promotions and interactive online activities. We may collect personal information with your consent or as required or permitted by law.</li><p></p>

<p></p><li class="headlinetext">Specifically with respect to the Shop, we may collect personal information, for example, when you register, sign in, search, purchase products, participate in a contest or questionnaire or communicate with customer service. We may also automatically collect certain types of information, including the telephone number used to call customer service and, if you visit our Shop, information collected through "cookies" (see below for more information about how we use cookies). In addition a third party may actually operate the Shop and provide customer service and other functions with respect to the Shop described in this Statement, and will collect personal information when you visit the Shop and in connection with processing transactions at the Shop.  The third party operator of the Shop and not the NHL Parties is responsible for the treatment of your information by the third party operator of the Shop.  Information about the privacy practices of the third party operator of the Shop is on the shop.nhl.com website. </li><p></p>

<p></p><li class="headlinetext">Additionally, certain third parties (such as companies that run certain fantasy games and auction areas on the website) may collect personal information from you and share some of the personal information with us. On these parts of the website, you will see additional information about the privacy practices of the companies who actually collect the data, including information on how to opt out of having these companies use your personal information for purposes unrelated to providing you the services that you are requesting from the website. These companies and not the NHL Parties are responsible for the treatment of your information by these companies. </li><p></p>
</ul>

<p><b>Use and Disclosure of Personal Information</b></p>
<ul>
<p></p><li class="headlinetext">We may use your personal information such as your name, home address and e-mail address to send marketing communications to you. We may use other personal information you provide, such as your favorite NHL team, to send you particular communications that we believe will be of interest to you. We may also share personal information amongst the NHL Parties and with the member teams of the National Hockey League for this same purpose. The NHL teams have informed us that they will enable you to opt out of receiving information from them. The NHL teams' own web sites contain privacy statements that you should review to understand how they may use your information. While most of our fans appreciate receiving marketing communications and having their personal information shared with NHL teams, we respect the right of each fan to control how his or her personal information is used. If you do not want us to provide your personal information to our teams, or if you do not wish to receive marketing communications from us, you can opt out when the personal information is collected or by following the opt out instructions contained in the marketing communications you receive from us. Additionally, you can opt not to receive information from the NHL Parties at any time by filling out the form on <a href="http://nhl.ed4.net/enroll/login.cfm">http://nhl.ed4.net/enroll/login.cfm</a> to update your profile.</li><p></p>

<p></p><li class="headlinetext">We may also use your personal information such as your name, home address and e-mail address to send you offers from our marketing partners and other business partners, and we may share such personal information with certain of these partners so that they may send you offers directly, if you have opted to receive information from such partners. In addition, if you are a customer of our Shop residing in the U.S., and have opted to have us do so, we may furnish your personal information to entities ("Market Researchers") we believe to be trustworthy that may use this information to identify you as a prospect for one or more of the Market Researchers' customers. If they so identify you, they may provide and cross-reference information, including personally identifiable information, to certain of the Market Researchers' customers, who may contact you regarding services or products that may be of interest to you.</li><p></p>

<p></p><li class="headlinetext">If you have opted not to receive communications from us, we may share that information with third parties who send communications relating to our products or services to ensure that you do not receive those communications. </li><p></p>

<p></p><li class="headlinetext">Personal information may be used or disclosed among the NHL Parties (which includes organizations outside of Canada) for internal audit, management, billing or administrative purposes.</li><p></p>

<p></p><li class="headlinetext">We do provide personal information to agents who perform services for us or supply goods (such as fulfillment companies), including companies outside Canada. These agents are contractually prohibited from using the personal information for any purposes other than as directed by the NHL Parties, subject to requirements in relevant jurisdictions, including foreign jurisdictions, applicable to those organizations. For example, we may also share your personal information such as name, address and telephone number with certain third parties such as manufacturers of products you purchase to complete or ship your order or assist manufacturers with your questions concerning products offered by the Shop. Additionally, we employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf.  We may also employ other companies (including Market Researchers) and individuals to perform functions such as fulfilling orders, customizing products, delivering packages, sending postal mail and e-mail, analyzing data, providing marketing assistance, performing credit checks and approvals, detecting fraudulent orders, processing credit card payments, collecting on delinquent accounts and providing customer service, and we may share your personal information with these companies and individuals. In addition, we may use information automatically collected from you, including the telephone number used to call customer service and information collected through cookies, for uses such as customer service and detection of fraudulent orders.</li><p></p>

<p></p><li class="headlinetext">We may also use aggregated, non personally identifying information collected from you when shopping at the  Shop to improve our marketing and promotional efforts, to analyze site usage, improve our content and product offerings, and generally to improve the  Shop and better tailor it to meet your needs.</li><p></p>

<p></p><li class="headlinetext">Personal information may be used by the NHL Parties and disclosed to parties connected with the contemplated or actual financing, securitization, insuring, sale, assignment or other disposal of all or part of the NHL Parties or our activities or assets, including for the purpose of permitting such parties to determine whether to proceed or continue with such transaction and to fulfil reporting, inspection or audit requirements or obligations to such parties. In the event that all or part of the NHL Parties or our activities or assets is sold, assigned or otherwise disposed of, personal information we have collected will be used and disclosed by such parties for substantially the same purposes as described in this statement.</li><p></p>

<p></p><li class="headlinetext">We also use personal information for: maintaining records for reasonable periods, and generally managing and administering our activities; meeting legal, regulatory, insurance, security and processing requirements; and otherwise with consent or as permitted or required by law.</li><p></p>

<p></p><li class="headlinetext">The NHL Parties may otherwise disclose personal information as necessary to meet legal, regulatory, insurance, audit and security requirements, with your consent, or as permitted or required by law.</li><p></p>

<p></p><li class="headlinetext">If you would like more information on our personal information sharing practices or the choices you have with regard to your data, please email <a href="mailto:privacyemails@nhl.com">privacyemails@nhl.com</a>.</li><p></p>

<p></p><li class="headlinetext">Note that a third party may actually operate the Shop and use and disclose your personal information for that purpose among other purposes.  The third party operator of the Shop and not the NHL Parties is responsible for the treatment of your information by the third party operator of the Shop.  Information about the privacy practices of the third party operator of the Shop is on the shop.nhl.com website.</li><p></p>

<p><b>Consent</b></p>
<ul>
<p></p><li class="headlinetext">Consent to the collection, use and disclosure of personal information may be given in various ways. Consent can be express (for example, orally, electronically or on a form you may sign describing the intended uses and disclosures of personal information) or implied (for example, when you provide information necessary for a service you have requested, or in some circumstances where notice has been provided to you about our intentions with respect to your personal information and you have not withdrawn your consent for an identified purpose, such as by using an "opt out" option provided, if any). Consent may be given by your authorized representative (such as a legal guardian or a person having a power of attorney). When you voluntarily provide us with your personal information, we assume you consent to its collection, use and disclosure in accordance with this Privacy Statement and as described at the time of collection, subject to any uses and disclosures you have opted not to participate in. In some circumstances, we may expressly request your consent to the collection, use or disclosure of your personal information or provide you with an opportunity to opt out of certain uses or disclosures of your personal information. In some limited circumstances where permitted or required by law, we may collect, use or disclose your personal information without your consent, for example, to collect a debt that you owe to us, to comply with a court order or to comply with local or federal regulations or a legally permitted inquiry by a government agency. You may withdraw your consent to our collection, use and disclosure of personal information at any time, subject to contractual and legal restrictions and reasonable notice.

We do not require children to register or to otherwise disclose personal information to participate in the activities in the KIDS section of our website.</li><p></p>
<p></p><li class="headlinetext">From time to time, we may offer children the opportunity to enter promotions or contests via the NHL.com website. In those cases, the child will be asked only to provide an email address, as well as his or her parent's email address. Upon receipt of the information, we will send an email to the parent indicating that the child has registered, providing information on the program and giving instruction on how the parent can remove the child from the promotion or contest. We will then use the information only to notify the contest winners and their parents that they have won. We require that the winner's parent provide us with all information needed to award the prize. Information collected during the contest will not be used or stored after the contest ends, other than as needed for legal requirements in connection with the promotion. In no event will NHL.com collect any personal information from children in connection with an on-line contest or promotion other than email address and parent's email address. In no event will NHL.com use the personal information other than for purposes of awarding contest prizes.</li><p></p>
<p></p><li class="headlinetext">We may also post information on the website about other promotions or contests that are open to children but that require other personal information (such as home address or favorite hockey team) to enter. For these contests, children will be required to print a paper entry form from the website and have their parents sign and mail or fax the form to us. Children are not permitted to independently provide personal information via the website or to enter these contests online.</li><p></p>
