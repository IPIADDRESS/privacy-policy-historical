<p>We are a <b>general audience web site</b> with a children's section. Because we understand that our entire web site may be appealing to children, we seek to comply with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 ("COPPA"), which requires parental consent before we collect personal information from any child under the age of 13 or disclose such information to any third parties.  More information about this law can be found at <a href="http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/conline/pubs/buspubs/coppa.htm">http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/conline/pubs/buspubs/coppa.htm</a>.
</p><p>Children under the age of 13 are not authorized to submit personal information online without first getting the permission from a parent or guardian.
</p><p>We encourage parents to take an active interest in their children's use of the Internet. Parents should be aware that software tools are available online that permit them to screen objectionable content and to prevent children from disclosing their name, address, and other personal information without parental permission. However, the best protection for your child is for you to supervise your child's online activities. 
</p><p>If you have any questions about this policy or about how personal information collected on our website is used, you can contact us by e-mail at <a href="MAILTO:policyquestions@nhra.com">policyquestions@nhra.com</a>, or by regular U.S. mail to:

Non-personally identifying information, such as session cookies, will be used to help us improve and update our site based on recorded use.
