<p><em style="line-height: 1.6;"><a href="http://uk.practicallaw.com/5-508-3605?pit=">Regulation 6(1)</a></em><span style="line-height: 1.6;"> of the </span><a href="http://uk.practicallaw.com/1-507-2637?pit=" style="line-height: 1.6;"><em>Privacy and Electronic Communications (EC Directive) Regulations 2003 (SI 2003/2426)</em></a><span style="line-height: 1.6;"> (2003 Regulations) as amended by the </span><a href="http://uk.practicallaw.com/7-508-3063?pit=" style="line-height: 1.6;"><em>Privacy and Electronic Communications (EC Directive) (Amendment) Regulations 2011 (SI 2011/1208)</em></a><span style="line-height: 1.6;"> (2011 Regulations) requires website operators and other online providers that set cookies on their users' equipment to provide internet users with clear and comprehensive information about the purposes for which the cookie is stored and accessed.</span></p>
<p>This cookie policy forms part of a layered approach providers may take to comply with this obligation. Providers can either link to the cookie policy directly from a prominent place on their website (for example, the website header), or they can link to it from a short-form notice or the relevant place in their privacy policy.</p>

<p><span style="line-height: 1.6;">This site uses cookies to distinguish you from other users of this site. This helps us to provide you with a good experience when you browse this site and also allows us to improve this site. By continuing to browse the site, you are agreeing to our use of cookies.</span></p>
<p><strong style="line-height: 1.6;">Consent to receive cookies</strong></p>
<p>Cookies are small data files that most website operators place on the browser or hard drive of their user's computer. Cookies may gather information about the user's use of the website or enable the website to recognise the user as an existing customer when he returns to the website at a later date. More recently, cookies have also been used to collect information about the user which allows the website operator or a third party to create a profile of the user, his preferences and his interests for the purpose of serving the user with targeted, interest-based advertising.</p>
<p>Most browsers automatically accept cookies by default, but users can change those settings to block some or all cookies.</p>
<p>It has long been the opinion of the Information Commissioner that cookies can be classified as storing personal data, at least where the information collected might later be combined with other personal information the website operator or a third party holds about the user (for example, information the user has provided when first registering on the website or when purchasing goods or services). The collection and use of cookies therefore always had to comply with the <a href="http://uk.practicallaw.com/6-505-6022?pit="><em>Data Protection Act 1998</em></a>.</p>
<p>Under the 2003 Regulations as originally drafted, the user also had to be given the opportunity to refuse the storage of, or access to, such cookies. However, following the coming into force of the <a href="http://uk.practicallaw.com/7-508-3063?pit="><em>2011 Regulations</em></a>, website operators must now obtain the users' consent to the use of cookies (<a href="http://uk.practicallaw.com/5-508-3605?pit="><em>Regulation 6(2)(b)</em></a><em>, 2003 Regulations as revised by the 2011 Regulations</em>).</p>
<p>The 2011 Regulations do not include any detailed provisions on how user consent should be obtained. However, the Information Commissioner has issued guidance on the practical steps providers can take to comply with the new obligations. For more information about ways to obtain user consent, see <a href="http://uk.practicallaw.com/0-517-0695"><em>Practice note, Complying with the new cookie regime: practical steps&nbsp;(www.practicallaw.com/0-517-0695)</em></a>.</p>
<p>The ICO's guidance specifically permits the use of so-called "implied consent" solutions, provided that the website operator provides clear information to the user, which of the user's actions (for example, continuing to browse the site) will be deemed to constitute his consent to the operator's use of cookies. However, website operators should note that the use of implied consent is controversial in other member states, whose legal requirements may not be satisfied through these solutions.</p>
<p>If a user accepts cookies from the site, it might makes sense for the website operator to store that preference (for example, by setting a "cookie acceptance" cookie on the user's browser or hard drive) to avoid the need to obtain consent again when the user next visits the site. The 2003 Regulations allow website operators to make the user's access to certain web pages dependent on his acceptance of cookies. As a matter of good practice, the user should be informed, however, that restrictions on his use of the website apply if he decides to reject cookies.</p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.6;">A cookie is a small file of letters and numbers that we store on your browser or the hard drive of your computer if you agree. Cookies contain information that is transferred to your computer's hard drive.</span></p>

<p>Since they do not have a direct relationship with the user, third parties (for example, advertising networks) that want to place cookies on users' equipment through a website that they do not operate themselves will find it difficult to provide users with the necessary information and to obtain valid consent. The Information Commissioner's guidance therefore raises the possibility that third parties may wish to consider including a contractual obligation into their agreements with website owners that imposes an obligation on those website owners to satisfy themselves that appropriate steps will be taken to provide information about the third-party cookies and obtain consent.</p>
<p>Given that they have no control over the cookies set by their advertisers, website owners should ideally reject such an obligation. Instead they should bring the fact that third parties may be given access to the website for the purpose of setting cookies to the user's attention without being seen to accept any liability for the third party's compliance with its legal obligations. For more information about third-party cookies, see <a href="http://uk.practicallaw.com/7-506-2678"><em>Practice notes, Cookies: UK issues&nbsp;(www.practicallaw.com/7-506-2678)</em></a> and <a href="http://uk.practicallaw.com/0-517-0695"><em>Complying with the new cookie regime: practical steps&nbsp;(www.practicallaw.com/0-517-0695)</em></a>.</p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.6;">You can block cookies by activating the setting on your browser that allows you to refuse the setting of all or some cookies. However, if you use your browser settings to block all cookies (including essential cookies) you may not be able to access all or parts of this site.</span></p>
