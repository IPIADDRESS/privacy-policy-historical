<p>Should you subscribe to receive emails from us through our website, some data eg your name and email address might be transferred to, or stored at, locations outside the European Economic Area.</p>
<p>All information we hold is stored on our secure servers.&nbsp; Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password which enables you to access certain parts of this site, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to share your password with anyone.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we will do our best to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee complete security of your data transmitted to this site; any transmission is at your own risk. Once we have received your information, we will use strict procedures and security features to try to prevent unauthorised access.</p>
<p><strong>Retention periods – how long we keep your information for</strong></p>
<p>Subject to any requests we may receive from you for your data to be erased and subject to your data having to be retained for longer to enable us to fulfil any of the purposes for processing your data listed above, data that you provide to us or that is collected about you is held by us for two years from your last contact with us or from your last access of the data.</p>
<p><strong>Privacy policy coverage</strong></p>
<p>This privacy statement applies to this site only and our linked website for <a href="https://www.stepintothenhs.nhs.uk/">Step into the NHS.</a> It does not cover links within this site to other websites.&nbsp; If you follow a link to any third party websites, please note that these websites may have their own privacy policies and that we do not accept any responsibility or liability for these policies. Please check these policies before you submit any personal data to such websites.</p>
<p><strong>Your rights as a data subject</strong></p>
<p>The General Data Protection Regulation includes a number of rights that are more extensive than those in the Data Protection Act 1998. We must generally respond to requests in relation to your rights within one month, although there are some exceptions to this.</p>
<p>The availability of some of these rights depends on the lawful basis that applies in relation to the processing of your personal data, and there are some other circumstances in which we may not uphold a request to exercise a right. Your rights and how they apply are described below.</p>
<p><strong><em>Right to be informed</em></strong></p>
<p>Your right to be informed is met in the main by the provision of this privacy notice. We may also provide you with certain information about our use of your data when we communicate with you directly.</p>
<p><strong><em>Right of access</em></strong></p>
<p>You have the right to obtain a copy of personal data that we hold about you and other information specified in the GDPR, although there are exceptions to what we are obliged to disclose.</p>
<p><strong><em>Right to rectification</em></strong></p>
<p>You have the right to ask us to rectify any inaccurate data that we hold about you. You can do this contacting us by <a href="https://www.healthcareers.nhs.uk/contact-us">contacting us</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><em>Right to erasure (‘right to be forgotten’)</em></strong></p>
<p>You have the right to request that we erase personal data about you that we hold. If you believe we have information about you, you can <a href="https://www.healthcareers.nhs.uk/contact-us" target="_blank">contact us</a> to find out.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The right to erasure is not an absolute right, and depending on the legal basis that applies, we may have overriding legitimate grounds to continue to process the data.</p>
<p><strong><em>Right to restriction of processing</em></strong></p>
<p>You have the right to request that we restrict processing of personal data about you that we hold. You can ask us to do this for example where you contest the accuracy of the data.</p>
<p><strong><em>Right to data portability</em></strong></p>
<p>This right is only available where the legal basis for processing under the General Data Protection Regulation is consent, or for the purposes of a contract between you and us. For this to apply the data must be held in electronic form. The right is to be provided with the data in a commonly used electronic format so that you can transfer the data elsewhere.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><em>Right to object</em></strong></p>
<p>You have the right to object to processing of personal data about you in certain circumstances. The right is not absolute and we may continue to process the data if we can demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds to do so.</p>
<p><strong><em>Rights in relation to automated individual decision-making including profiling</em></strong></p>
<p>You have the right to object to being subject to a decision based solely on automated processing, including profiling. We do not currently have any automated decision-making processes, but in future should we perform any automated decision-making, we will record this in our privacy notice, and ensure that you have an opportunity to request that the decision involves personal consideration.</p>
<p><strong><em>Rights in relation to direct marketing</em></strong></p>
<p>We will only use your data for marketing purposes if you have subscribed to receive certain information or opted to receive marketing material. You can do this by logging into your account and updating your details, or you can also <a href="https://www.healthcareers.nhs.uk/contact-us" target="_blank">contact us</a>, if you have previously consented by calling us or email.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><em>Right to complain to the Information Commissioner</em></strong></p>
<p>You have the right to complain to the Information Commissioner if you are not happy with any aspect of our processing of personal data or believe that we are not meeting our responsibilities under data protection laws. The contact details for the Information Commissioner are:</p>

<p><strong>Information about our use of cookies</strong></p>
<p>The&nbsp;<a href="http://uk.practicallaw.com/1-507-2637?pit="><em>Privacy and Electronic Communications (EC Directive) Regulations 2003 (SI 2003/2426)</em></a>, as amended, (2003 Regulations) require website operators and other online providers that set cookies on their users' equipment to provide internet users with clear and comprehensive information about the purposes for which the cookie is stored and accessed.</p>
<p>This cookie policy forms part of a layered approach providers may take to comply with this obligation. Providers can either link to the cookie policy directly from a prominent place on their website (for example, the website header), or they can link to it from their <a href="#Privacy">privacy policy</a>.</p>
<p>A cookie is a small file of letters and numbers that we store on your browser or the hard drive of your computer if you agree. Cookies contain information that is transferred to your computer's hard drive.</p>
