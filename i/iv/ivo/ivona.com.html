In addition, cookies allow us to track use of our website to determine those areas which are useful or popular and those that are not, thereby enabling us to improve and update our website effectively.</p>
<p>Most web browsers can either alert you to the use of cookies or refuse to accept cookies entirely. If you are not sure how to do this or whether you have this option you should consult the information that accompanied your web browser. You should be aware that if you elect not to accept cookies, some parts of the website may not function properly or permit access.</p>
<p>In case you visit our website or use our products or services on a publicly accessible computer, e.g. in an internet cafe, please remember to delete cookies and history of the web browser.</p>
