<h1>Ivanti Privacy Policy</h1>
<p>Last Modified: April 11, 2019</p>
<p>Ivanti sells software, not data. We collect data in order to respond to your inquiries, improve our products and services, support your use of our products, help you use our products more efficiently, market our products and services, and generally perform our contractual obligations. We do not sell, rent, share, or otherwise disclose your personal data to anyone except as necessary to support your use of our products and to market and sell our products and services.</p>
<h3><br>
Scope of Policy</h3>
<p><br>
This policy applies to all the personal data that you provide and Ivanti collects through its products, apps, services, websites, events, and other communications such as our marketing efforts. References to Ivanti products in this statement include Ivanti software, apps, services, events, and websites.<br>
This Privacy Policy describes how Ivanti collects, uses, shares and secures the personal data you provide. It also describes your choices regarding use, access and correction of your personal data. For additional information, please visit our Privacy &amp; Legal web page.<br>
<br>
We encourage you to read this privacy policy and the privacy policies of all websites you visit and/or companies who send you communications.<br>
<br>
<strong>Personal Data We Collect&nbsp;</strong><br>
<br>
We automatically collect statistical information that may include personal data when you use our products. We also collect personal data when you ask for or consent to receive products or marketing materials from us. We may associate that information with personal data we collect in other ways or receive from third parties. The data we collect depends on the context of your interactions with us and the choices you make, including your privacy settings, email subscription settings, and the products and features you use. We process personal data in a manner that is compatible with the initial purpose of the data collection.</p>
<p>When you use our products, you provide us with data that may include the following:<br>
<br>
<strong>Name and contact data.</strong> Your first and last name, email address, postal address, phone number, and other similar contact data.<br>
<br>
<strong>Credentials. </strong>Passwords, password hints, and similar security information used for authentication and account access.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<strong>Demographic data.</strong> Data about you such as your age, gender, country, and preferred language.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<strong>Payment data</strong>. Data to process payments, such as your payment instrument number (e.g., a credit card number), and the security code associated with your payment instrument.&nbsp;<br>
Subscription and licensing data. Information about your subscriptions, licenses, and other entitlements to our products.<br>
<br>
<strong>Interactions.</strong> Data about your use of our products. In some cases, this is data you provide in order to use the products. In other cases, such as error reports, this is data we generate. Other examples of interactions data include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Device and usage data</strong>. Data about your device and the product and features you use, including information about your hardware and software, how our products perform, as well as your settings. For example, device, connectivity, and configuration data; error reports and performance data; troubleshooting and Help Data.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Location data</strong>. Data about your device’s location, which can be either precise or imprecise. For example, we collect location data using Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) (e.g., GPS) and data about nearby cell towers and wi-fi hotspots. Location can also be inferred from a device’s IP address or data in your account profile that indicates where it is located with less precision, such as at a city or postal code level.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Other input.</strong> Other inputs provided when you use our products.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Content. </strong>Content of your files and communications you input, upload, receive, create, and control. Please be aware that any information you provide in public areas, including our websites, may be read, collected, and used by others who access them.<br>
<br>
<strong>Feedback and ratings.</strong> Information you provide to us and the content of messages you send to us, such as feedback, survey data, and product reviews you write.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<strong>Database information.</strong> If you receive technical support for an Ivanti product, you may also provide us with database information that contains personal data of third parties such as your employees or clients. &nbsp;We have no control over what you provide to us, nor what steps you have taken to ensure that the data is reliable for its intended use, non-infringing, accurate, complete, and current. If you provide any personal information about any third parties to us, you must have an appropriate legal basis for processing as required by applicable law. You must also provide instructions on how to use that information.<br>
<br>
<strong>Data We Process on Behalf of our Customers.</strong> The use of information collected through our Services shall be limited to the purpose of providing the service for which the customer has engaged Ivanti. Ivanti collects information under the direction of its Customers, and has no direct relationship with the individuals whose personal data it processes. If you are a user of one of our Customers and would no longer like to be contacted by one of our Customers that use our service, please contact the Customer that you interact with directly. We may transfer personal data to companies that help us provide our service. Transfers to subsequent third parties are covered by the service agreements with our Customers.<br>
<br>
An individual who seeks access, or who seeks to correct, amend, or delete inaccurate data should direct his query to Ivanti’s Customer (the data controller).&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<strong>Mobile Apps. </strong>When using an app on a mobile device, we may automatically collect information about the device running the app, such as the type of device, the version of the operating system, the device identifier (“UDID”) and mobile network information. We may also record information such as how often the app is used, the events that occur within the app, aggregated usage, performance data, any exceptions that occur within the app, and the source from which the app was downloaded.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<strong>Metadata and other information.</strong> We may collect metadata and other information to analyze and benchmark your use of our products. We may use that information to generate reports, analyze product usage, administer and improve the products, both for your individual use and our user base as a whole. We may also use the information to improve or create new products and to make recommendations to you and our customers about how to better use our products and services.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Third party data. We also obtain data from third parties. We protect data obtained from third parties according to the practices described in this policy, plus any additional restrictions imposed by the source of the data. Third party data that we obtain may include, but are not limited to, the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Data brokers from which we purchase demographic data to supplement the data we collect.</li>
<li>Service providers that help us determine your device’s location.</li>
<li>Partners with which we offer co-branded services or engage in joint marketing activities.</li>
<li>Publicly-available sources, such as open government databases.</li>
</ul>
<p><br>
<strong>Data collected when you visit our websites.</strong> Our websites also gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. This information may include internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, browser language, device identifier, Internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, duration of visit, pages viewed, operating system, date/time stamp, clickstream data, crashes, system activity, hardware settings, the date and time of requests and other usage data.<br>
<br>
<strong>Data that we collect and process when being contacted otherwise.</strong> If you contact us over the telephone or via facsimile, we may also log information such as your phone number, forwarding calls, SMS routing information, and types of calls.<br>
<br>
You have choices when it comes to the technology you use and the data you share. When we ask you to provide personal data, you can decline. Many of our products require some personal data to provide you with a service. If you choose not to provide the data necessary to provide you with a product or feature, you cannot use that product or feature and we may have to suspend or cancel it. Likewise, where we need personal data to enter into or carry out a contract with you, and you do not provide the data, we will not be able to enter into the contract or perform under the contract. We will notify you if this is the case at the time. Where providing the data is optional, and you choose not to share personal data, features like personalization that use such data will not work for you.&nbsp;</p>
