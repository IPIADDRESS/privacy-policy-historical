    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Introduction:</strong> At IT Collection LLC  (IT) we have a strong commitment to providing excellent service to all of our  customers, including respecting their concerns about privacy. We understand  that visitors to our website ivankatrump.com (IT.com) may have questions about  how this website collects and uses information. We have prepared this statement  to inform you of the privacy principles that govern IT.com.</p>
    <p>This  statement contains numerous general and technical details about the steps we  take to respect your privacy concerns. The bottom line is that meeting your  needs and expectations form the foundation of everything we do - including  protecting your privacy.</p>
    <p><strong>Browsing:</strong> This website does  not collect personally identifiable information from your computer when you  browse the site. This means that, unless you voluntarily and knowingly provide  us with personally identifiable information, we will not know your name, your  e-mail address, or any other personally identifiable information.</p>
    <p><strong>Internet  Protocol (IP) Address:</strong> An IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer when  you browse the Internet. When users request a page from our site, our servers  log the user's current IP address. We use IP addresses to help diagnose  problems. We do not link IP addresses to any personally identifiable  information about you.</p>
    <p><strong>Cookies:</strong> Our website uses  cookie technology. Cookies are strings of text that a website may store on a  user's computer. Our website uses cookies but only requires them in the online  reservation process. Cookies enable our website to keep track of your  preferences and activities relating to the website. Our website creates session  cookies for each visit in order to facilitate your visit. The session cookie  expires at the end of the session.</p>
    <ul>
    <li><p>Use    of Cookies and E-Mails - We use a third party service provider to send    marketing e-mails on behalf of IT. There are no cookies in the e-mail.    However, when an e-mail recipient clicks on a link to IT.com included in the    e-mail, a persistent cookie is placed on the user's computer. This cookie is    used to measure the effectiveness of our e-mail marketing efforts and better    understand how our users navigate through the site. The cookie set by our    service provider will remain on your hard drive 30 days after the last time    you clicked on the coded link in the e-mail, or until you delete it.</p></li>
    <li><p>The  third party service providers mentioned above are contractually bound not to  use any information they gather for any purpose other than providing services  to us. Cookies do not corrupt or damage your computer or computer files. In  addition, we do not use cookies to gather information concerning your visits to  non-IT.com websites. If you do not wish to receive these cookies, you may set  your browser to reject the cookies (consult the instructions for your  particular browser on how to do this), although doing so may affect your  ability to perform certain transactions on our website.</p></li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Pixel  Tags:</strong> The third party service providers mentioned above serve and host IT  advertisements on other sites. To track the effectiveness of IT advertisements  on other sites, IT.com uses pixel tags (also known as clear gifs, beacon gifs,  1-by-1 gifs, or web bugs). Pixel tags are not visible to the user of the site  and consist of a few lines of computer coding. If you are visiting IT.com from  an advertisement on another site, the pixel tag references the cookie you  received when you clicked on the advertisement. The pixel tag then registers  this activity with the third party advertising company to allow us to count the  number of times an advertisement is accessed. In addition, we also measure the  reservations generated from a particular ad. At no time is personally  identifiable information about you or your reservation collected by the third  party advertising company, nor is any tracking information generated from the  pixel tag allowed to be used by them for any other purpose other than to report  website activity to us or allow us to better target future interactive  advertising.</p>
    <p>  Our  third party service providers may use pixel tags in IT marketing e-mails that  help us send the e-mail in a format you can read, to allow us to know which  e-mails you act upon and to better target the content of future e-mails. In  addition, we track the aggregate number of e-mails read and whether any of the  links in the e-mail were accessed. No other information is collected or used  from pixel tags.</p>
    <p>  <strong>Information  We Collect:</strong> When we need to collect personally identifiable information from you, we will  ask you to voluntarily supply us with the information we need. As indicated  below (see E-Mail section), we may also use your e-mail address to notify you  about special offers and promotions.</p>
    <p><strong>E-Mail:</strong> It is our intention  to only send you e-mail communications that will be useful to you and that you  want to receive. When you provide your e-mail address, we will occasionally  contact you via e-mail and provide information about special offers and  promotions that may be of interest to you. These communications will relate to IT  offers and/or the promotions of affiliates or select, reputable third parties  with whom IT has a strategic marketing relationship because they offer products  or services that we believe would of interest to you. We use a third party  e-mail service provider to send e-mails. This service provider is prohibited  from using your e-mail address for any purpose other than to send IT related  e-mail. Every time you receive e-mail you will be provided the choice to  opt-out of future e-mails by following the instructions provided in the e-mail,  or you may opt-out by updating your online profile.</p>
    <p><strong>IT  Use of Information:</strong> We treat the information you provide to us as confidential information; it is,  accordingly, subject to our company's security procedures and strict corporate  policies regarding protection and use of confidential information. Because laws  applicable to personal information vary by country, our retail stores or other  business operations may put in place additional measures that vary depending on  the applicable legal requirements. Information collected on the sites covered  by this privacy statement, which are listed in the first paragraph, is  generally processed and stored in the United States.<br>
      Unless  you tell us otherwise, the information you provide may be used by us for direct  marketing of other IT products, the products of affiliates or select, reputable  third parties with whom IT has a strategic marketing relationship because they  offer products or services that we believe would of interest to you. IT may use  the services of a third party mail house for the sole purpose of mailing  materials.</p>
    <p><strong>Disclosure  of Information to Third Parties:</strong> IT prohibits the sale or transfer of  personal information to unaffiliated third parties outside of IT for their use  without your approval.</p>
    <p><strong>Links  to Other Sites:</strong> If you choose to leave this IT site via links to other non-IT websites,  including those of advertisers, IT is not responsible for the privacy policies  or content of those sites, nor is IT responsible for the cookies those sites  use.</p>
    <p><strong>Legal Issues:</strong> This is a United States website and is  subject to United States law. IT will disclose personally identifiable  information without your permission when required by law, or in good faith  belief that such action is necessary to investigate or protect against harmful  activities to IT guests, visitors, associates, or property (including this  site), or to others, when entities performing business activities on  IT’s behalf necessitate such information (e.g., credit card processing or customer  support services), or in the event that IT is merged, acquired by or acquires  another company.&nbsp; As mentioned above, laws related to personal  identifiable information vary by country. For example, personally identifiable  information collected in the European Union is subject to the EU Data  Protection Directive. </p>
    <p><strong>Privacy  Policy Effective Date:</strong> The privacy policy is in effect at the time of each visit to our site. Please  check our privacy policy each time you visit our website if you are concerned  about how your information will be used.</p>
    <p><strong>IT.com  Privacy Statement Changes:</strong> In the future, we may need to change the  privacy statement for IT.com. All changes will be made here so that you will  always know what information we gather, how we might use that information and  whether we will disclose it to anyone.</p>
