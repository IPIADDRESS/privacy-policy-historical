                    <p><br>
                      Because the success of iVisit LLC ("iVisit") is dependent on the satisfaction of our customers, we are strongly committed to protecting the privacy of those using our servers. This Privacy Policy governs your interaction with our servers. Except as set forth within this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Service and other published guidelines, we do not release personally identifiable information about our members and visitors without their permission. Please note that iVisit reviews its privacy practices from time to time, and that those practices are therefore subject to change. We ask that you bookmark and periodically review this page to ensure continuing familiarity with the most current version of our Privacy Policy. To contact iVisit about privacy issues, to report a violation of our Privacy Policy, or to raise any other issue, please e-mail us at Admin@iVisit.com</p>
                    <p><strong>The Information We Gather</strong><br>
                      iVisit gathers two types of information about users: <br>
                      (1) Non-personally identifiable information: When visitors come to our servers, we collect and aggregate information indicating, among other things, which pages were visited, the order in which they were visited, and which hyperlinks were "clicked." Collecting such information involves the logging of IP addresses, operating system and browser software used by each visitor to the iVisit web site. Although such information is not personally identifiable, we can determine from the IP address a visitor's Internet Service Provider and the geographic location of his or her point of connectivity. The non-personally identifiable information we collect helps us identify the most popular areas of our servers and determine the effectiveness of our promotional activities. For the same purposes, we may use "cookies" - that is, small text files placed on your computer's hard drive - to help us determine the type of content to which you link, the length of time you spend at any particular area of the iVisit site, and the iVisit services you choose to use. Essentially, cookies are your identification cards for the iVisit computers, or servers, that placed them there. When used, cookies are only read by the server that placed them, and are unable to execute any code or virus. Cookies can allow iVisit to serve you better and more efficiently, and to personalize your experience at the iVisit web sites. Nevertheless, you should be able to control how and whether your web browser will accept cookies. For more information on how to do so, please refer to the documentation accompanying your browser. <br>
                      (2) Personally identifiable information: In certain areas of the iVisit web sites - for example, when registering to use a product - we may request that you provide us with personally identifiable information (including, for example, first name, surname, street address, email address, telephone number, and when applicable, credit card information).<br>
                      We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children (defined herein as minors younger than thirteen years of age), and explicitly prohibit minors from registering for any iVisit product or service.</p>
                    <p><strong>How We Use (And Do Not Use) The Information We Gather</strong><br>
                      Please take some time to familiarize yourself with the different ways iVisit uses the information that it gathers. <br>
                      (1) How we use (and do not use) non-personally identifiable information: We use non-personally identifiable information in aggregate form to build higher quality, more useful online services by performing statistical analyses of the collective characteristics and behavior of our customers and visitors, and by measuring demographics and interests regarding specific areas of the iVisit web sites. We may provide aggregate statistical information based on this data to current and potential business partners. <br>
                      (2) How we use (and do not use) personally identifiable information: iVisit provides notice to potential iVisit customers that personally identifiable information will be collected during the process of registering to use iVisit products. Such notice is provided simultaneously with your product registration; moreover, this Privacy Policy itself serves as notice that such information is collected under those circumstances. Although you may not "opt out" of the registration process if you wish to use iVisit products, you may choose to "opt out" of receiving promotional materials from iVisit. If you do not "opt out" of receiving such promotional materials, all solicitations which you may receive will clearly indicate the originator of the e-mail and provide the you with a method of "opting out" of receiving future communications of a similar nature. iVisit does not control the acts of its customers or visitors. All customers and visitors should be aware that, when they disclose personally identifiable information in a bulletin board, or other forum, the information may be collected and used by others to send that person unsolicited email from other parties outside iVisit. In the event that you encounter any iVisit user who is improperly collecting or using information about you or other users, please contact us at admin@iVisit.com We reserve the right to release information contained within our access logs concerning any visitor or member when that visitor or member is in violation of our Terms of Service or other published guidelines, or engages (or is reasonably suspected of engaging) in any illegal activity, even without a subpoena, warrant, or other court order, and to release such information in response to discovery requests. We cooperate with law enforcement agencies in identifying those who may be using our servers or services for illegal activities. We also reserve the right to report any suspected illegal activity to law enforcement for investigation or prosecution.</p>
                    <p><strong>Changing Or Deleting Personal Information</strong><br>
                      If you would like to have your personally identifiable information removed from iVisit's database, please contact us at admin@iVisit.com, and we will use reasonable efforts to comply with your request. Keep in mind, however, that there will be residual information that will remain within iVisit databases, access logs, and other records, which may or may not contain such personally identifiable information. The residual information will not be used for commercial purposes.</p><div class="bodytext"></div>
