              Inc. ("Eyematic") is dependent on building and maintaining goodwill 
              with our customers, we are committed to implementing measures designed 
              to protect the privacy of those using our web site.</font> </p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Although Eyematic respects the privacy 
              of all those who visit our web site, we do collect information from 
              our members and visitors. This Privacy Policy governs your interaction 
              with our web site. Except as set forth within this Privacy Policy 
              and our Terms of Service and other published guidelines, we do not

              visitors without their permission.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Please note that Eyematic reviews its privacy 
              practices from time to time, and that those practices are therefore 
              subject to change. We ask that you bookmark and periodically review 
              this page to ensure continuing familiarity with the most current 
              version of our Privacy Policy. To contact Eyematic about privacy 
              issues, to report a violation of our Privacy Policy, or to raise 
              any other issue, please e-mail us at </font><a href="mailto:info@eyematic.com"><font face="Arial" size="2">info@eyematic.com</font></a><font face="Arial" size="2">.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>The information we gather.</b></font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Eyematic gathers two types of information 
              about users:</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">(1) <b>Non-personally identifiable information:</b> 
              When visitors come to our web site, we collect and aggregate information 
              indicating, among other things, which pages were visited, the order 
              in which they were visited, and which hyperlinks were "clicked." 
              Collecting such information involves the logging of IP addresses, 
              operating system and browser software used by each visitor to the 
              Shout web site. Although such information is not personally identifiable, 
              we can determine from the IP address a visitor’s Internet 
              Service Provider and the geographic location of his or her point 
              of connectivity.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The non-personally identifiable information 
              we collect helps us identify the most popular areas of our web site 
              and determine the effectiveness of our promotional activities. In 
              addition, we may disclose some of this information to advertisers 
              to inform them of the number of people who have seen and/or clicked 
              through their advertisements.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">For the same purposes, we may use "cookies" 
              – that is, small text files placed on your computer’s 
              hard drive – to help us determine the type of content and 
              sites to which you link, the length of time you spend at any particular 
              area of the Shout3D site, and the Shout3D services you choose to 
              use. Cookies can also tell us which advertising you have seen on 
              our site. Essentially, cookies are your identification cards for 
              the Shout3D computers, or servers, that placed them there. When 
              used, cookies are only read by the server that placed them, and 
              are unable to execute any code or virus.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Cookies can allow Eyematic to serve you 
              better and more efficiently, and to personalize your experience 
              at the Shout3D web site. Nevertheless, you should be able to control 
              how and whether your web browser will accept cookies. For more information 
              on how to do so, please refer to the documentation accompanying 
              your browser.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">(2) <b>Personally identifiable information:</b> 
              In certain areas of the Shout3D web site – for example, when 
              registering to purchase a product – we request, but do not 
              require,<b> </b>that you provide us with personally identifiable 
              information (including, for example, first name, surname, street 
              address, email address, telephone number, and when applicable, credit 
              card information).</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">We do not knowingly collect personally 
              identifiable information from children (defined herein as minors 
              younger than thirteen years of age) without obtaining parental consent. 
              Before registering with Shout3D, we ask that children have their 
              parents read our Privacy Policy. Before and during the registration 
              process, we encourage children to include a parent or guardian in 
              the process.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b></b>Eyematic does not control the acts 
              of its customers or visitors. All customers and visitors should 
              be aware that, when they disclose personally identifiable information 
              in a bulletin board, guestbook or other forum, the information may 
              be collected and used by others to send that person unsolicited 
              email from other parties outside Eyematic. In the event that you 
              encounter any Shout3D user who is improperly collecting or using 
              information about you or other users, please contact us at </font><a href="mailto:info@eyematic.com"><font face="Arial" size="2">info@eyematic.com</font></a><font face="Arial" size="2">.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>How we use (and do not use) the information 
              we gather.</b></font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Please take some time to familiarize yourself 
              with the different ways Eyematic uses the information that it gathers. 
              Keep in mind that, while Eyematic encourages all third parties involved 
              to adhere to our policies regarding the privacy of our visitors 
              and members and to otherwise handle personal information in a responsible 
              manner, we cannot and do not assume any responsibility for any actions 
              or omissions of third parties, including the manner in which they 
              use information received either from Eyematic or independently. 
              Nevertheless, in the event you encounter any third party associated 
              with, or who claims association with Eyematic who you feel is improperly 
              collecting or using information about you, please contact us at 
              info@eyematic.com; we will be happy to forward your message to the 
              third party.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">(1) <b>How we use (and do not use) non-personally 
              identifiable information:</b> We use non-personally identifiable 
              information in aggregate form to build higher quality, more useful 
              online services by performing statistical analyses of the collective 
              characteristics and behavior of our customers and visitors, and 
              by measuring demographics and interests regarding specific areas 
              of the Shout3D web site. We provide statistical information based 
              on this data to advertisers, affiliates, and other current and potential 
              business partners. We also use the aggregate data to inform these 
              third parties as to the number of people who have seen and clicked 
              on links to their web sites. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The Shout3D web site contains links to 
              other Internet web sites, including co-branded or other affiliated 
              sites that may or may not be owned or operated by Eyematic. Unless 
              otherwise explicitly stated, we are not responsible for the privacy 
              practices or the content of such web sites, including such sites’ 
              use of any information (such as IP number, browser type, or operating 
              system) collected when visitors to the Shout3D web site click through 
              links to those sites. Even though such information might not identify 
              you personally, we strongly encourage you to become familiar with 
              the privacy practices of those sites.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">(2) <b>How we use (and do not use) personally 
              identifiable information:</b> Eyematic provides notice to potential 
              Shout3D customers that personally identifiable information will 
              be collected during the process of registering to receive Eyematic 
              products or participate in Eyematic contests. Such notice is provided 
              simultaneously with your Shout3D registration; moreover, this Privacy 
              Policy itself serves as notice that such information is collected 
              under those circumstances. Although you may not "opt out" of the 
              registration process if you wish to receive Eyematic products or 
              participate in Eyematic contests, you may choose to "opt out" of 
              receiving promotional materials from Eyematic and/or its affiliates, 
              advertisers, or other business partners. If you do not "opt out" 
              of receiving such promotional materials, Eyematic reserves the right 
              to release any personally identifiable registration information 
              regarding you to third parties who provide goods or services that 
              we believe may be of interest to you. We will not release your credit 
              card information to third parties unless necessary to complete a 
              transaction between you and such a third party. If you decide that 
              you would like to discontinue receiving promotional information 
              from such third parties, please contact those third parties directly, 
              or contact us at info@shoutinteractive.com.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Eyematic limits its own e-mail solicitations 
              to those customers who have not "opted out" of receiving such communications. 
              The solicitations are limited in that they, among other things, 
              will clearly indicate the originator of the e-mail and provide the 
              customer with a method of "opting out" of receiving future communications 
              of a similar nature. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b></b>In addition, Eyematic sometimes 
              uses individual data to "target" advertising — to decide which 
              advertisements and sponsor messages to show to which members. As 
              an example, if Sponsor Co. wishes to display their advertising only 
              to female Shout3D members, Eyematic uses member registration data 
              to ensure that Sponsor Co.’s ads are displayed only to female 
              members.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Finally, Eyematic may use individual members’ 
              data to "pre-populate" forms that are displayed for the purpose 
              of collecting individual data by Eyematic and/or its sponsors. In 
              no case does pre-populating a form automatically transfer any data 
              to any advertiser or third party. Only if the member voluntarily 
              requests that such data be transferred will any transfer take place 
              — for example, if/when a member clicks a "submit form" button 
              or other button.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b></b>We reserve the right to release 
              information contained within our access logs concerning any visitor 
              or member when that visitor or member is in violation of our Terms 
              of Service or other published guidelines, or engages (or is reasonably 
              suspected of engaging) in any illegal activity, even without a subpoena, 
              warrant, or other court order, and to release such information in 
              response to discovery requests. We cooperate with law enforcement 
              agencies in identifying those who may be using our servers or services 
              for illegal activities. We also reserve the right to report any 
              suspected illegal activity to law enforcement for investigation 
              or prosecution.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">If and when Eyematic sponsors contests, 
              promotions or sweepstakes, or third parties sponsor contests, promotions 
              or sweepstakes in conjunction with Eyematic, either Eyematic or 
              the third party will post relevant privacy information in the official 
              rules and/or registration area for the contest, promotion or sweepstakes. 
              That privacy information, to the extent it conflicts with this Privacy 
              Policy, will govern that particular contest, promotion or sweepstakes.</font></p>
            <p><b><font face="Arial" size="2">Changing or deleting personal information.</font></b></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">If you would like to have your personally 
              identifiable information removed from Eyematic’s database, 
              please contact us at info@eyematic.com, and we will use reasonable 
              efforts to comply with your request. Keep in mind, however, that 
              there will be residual information that will remain within Eyematic 
              databases, access logs, and other records, which may or may not 
              contain such personally identifiable information. The residual information 
              will not be used for commercial purposes; however Eyematic reserves 
              the right, from time to time, to recontact former customers or users
