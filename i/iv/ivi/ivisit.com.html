              Interfaces, Inc. ("Eyematic") is dependent on building 
              and maintaining goodwill with our customers, we are committed to 
              implementing measures designed to protect the privacy of those using 
              our web site. <br>
              <br>
              Although Eyematic respects the privacy of all those who visit our 
              web site, we do collect information from our members and visitors. 
              This Privacy Policy governs your interaction with our web site. 
              Except as set forth within this Privacy Policy and our Terms of 
              Service and other published guidelines, we do not release personally 
              identifiable information about out members and visitors without 
              their permission.<br>
              Please note that Eyematic reviews its privacy practices from time 
              to time, and that those practices are therefore subject to change. 
              We ask that you bookmark and periodically review this page to ensure 
              continuing familiarity with the most current version of our Privacy 
              Policy. To contact Eyematic about privacy issues, to report a violation 
              of our Privacy Policy, or to raise any other issue, please e-mail

              <b>The Information We Gather</b><br>
              <br>
              Eyematic gathers two types of information about users:<br>
              <br>
              (1) Non-personally identifiable information: When visitors come 
              to our web site, we collect and aggregate information indicating, 
              among other things, which pages were visited, the order in which 
              they were visited, and which hyperlinks were "clicked." 
              Collecting such information involves the logging of IP addresses, 
              operating system and browser software used by each visitor to the 
              Shout web site. Although such information is not personally identifiable, 
              we can determine from the IP address a visitor's Internet Service 
              Provider and the geographic location of his or her point of connectivity.<br>
              The non-personally identifiable information we collect helps us 
              identify the most popular areas of our web site and determine the 
              effectiveness of our promotional activities. In addition, we may 
              disclose some of this information to advertisers to inform them 
              of the number of people who have seen and/or clicked through their 
              advertisements.<br>
              <br>
              For the same purposes, we may use "cookies" - that is, 
              small text files placed on your computer's hard drive - to help 
              us determine the type of content and sites to which you link, the 
              length of time you spend at any particular area of the Eyematic 
              site, and the Eyematic services you choose to use. Cookies can also 
              tell us which advertising you have seen on our site. Essentially, 
              cookies are your identification cards for the Eyematic computers, 
              or servers, that placed them there. When used, cookies are only 
              read by the server that placed them, and are unable to execute any 
              code or virus.<br>
              Cookies can allow Eyematic to serve you better and more efficiently, 
              and to personalize your experience at the Eyematic web sites. Nevertheless, 
              you should be able to control how and whether your web browser will 
              accept cookies. For more information on how to do so, please refer 
              to the documentation accompanying your browser.<br>
              <br>
              (2) Personally identifiable information: In certain areas of the 
              Eyematic web sites - for example, when registering to purchase a 
              product - we request that you provide us with personally identifiable 
              information (including, for example, first name, surname, street 
              address, email address, telephone number, and when applicable, credit 
              card information).<br>
              <br>
              We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information 
              from children (defined herein as minors younger than thirteen years 
              of age) without obtaining parental consent. Before registering with 
              Eyematic, we ask that children have their parents read our Privacy 
              Policy. Before and during the registration process, we encourage 
              children to include a parent or guardian in the process.<br>
              <br>
              Eyematic does not control the acts of its customers or visitors. 
              All customers and visitors should be aware that, when they disclose 
              personally identifiable information in a bulletin board, guestbook 
              or other forum, the information may be collected and used by others 
              to send that person unsolicited email from other parties outside 
              Eyematic. In the event that you encounter any Eyematic user who 
              is improperly collecting or using information about you or other 
              users, please contact us at webmaster@eyematic.com<br>
              <br>
              <b>How We Use (And Do Not Use) The Information We Gather</b><br>
              <br>
              Please take some time to familiarize yourself with the different 
              ways Eyematic uses the information that it gathers. Keep in mind 
              that, while Eyematic encourages all third parties involved to adhere 
              to our policies regarding the privacy of our visitors and members 
              and to otherwise handle personal information in a responsible manner, 
              we cannot and do not assume any responsibility for any actions or 
              omissions of third parties, including the manner in which they use 
              information received either from Eyematic or independently. Nevertheless, 
              in the event you encounter any third party associated with, or who 
              claims association with Eyematic who you feel is improperly collecting 
              or using information about you, please contact us at webmaster@eyematic.com; 
              we will be happy to forward your message to the third party.<br>
              <br>
              (1) How we use (and do not use) non-personally identifiable information: 
              We use non-personally identifiable information in aggregate form 
              to build higher quality, more useful online services by performing 
              statistical analyses of the collective characteristics and behavior 
              of our customers and visitors, and by measuring demographics and 
              interests regarding specific areas of the Eyematic web sites. We 
              provide statistical information based on this data to advertisers, 
              affiliates, and other current and potential business partners. We 
              also use the aggregate data to inform these third parties as to 
              the number of people who have seen and clicked on links to their 
              web sites. <br>
              <br>
              The Eyematic web sites contains links to other Internet web sites, 
              including co-branded or other affiliated sites that may or may not 
              be owned or operated by Eyematic. Unless otherwise explicitly stated, 
              we are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content 
              of such web sites, including such sites' use of any information 
              (such as IP number, browser type, or operating system) collected 
              when visitors to the Eyematic web sites click through links to those 
              sites. Even though such information might not identify you personally, 
              we strongly encourage you to become familiar with the privacy practices 
              of those sites.<br>
              <br>
              (2) How we use (and do not use) personally identifiable information: 
              Eyematic provides notice to potential Eyematic customers that personally 
              identifiable information will be collected during the process of 
              registering to receive Eyematic products or participate in Eyematic 
              contests. Such notice is provided simultaneously with your product 
              registration; moreover, this Privacy Policy itself serves as notice 
              that such information is collected under those circumstances. Although 
              you may not "opt out" of the registration process if you 
              wish to receive Eyematic products or participate in Eyematic contests, 
              you may choose to "opt out" of receiving promotional materials 
              from Eyematic and/or its affiliates, advertisers, or other business 
              partners. If you do not "opt out" of receiving such promotional 
              materials, Eyematic reserves the right to release any personally 
              identifiable registration information regarding you to third parties 
              who provide goods or services that we believe may be of interest 
              to you. We will not release your credit card information to third 
              parties unless necessary to complete a transaction between you and 
              such a third party. If you decide that you would like to discontinue 
              receiving promotional information from such third parties, please 
              contact those third parties directly, or contact us at webmaster@eyematic.com.<br>
              <br>
              Eyematic limits its own e-mail solicitations to those customers 
              who have not "opted out" of receiving such communications. 
              The solicitations are limited in that they, among other things, 
              will clearly indicate the originator of the e-mail and provide the 
              customer with a method of "opting out" of receiving future 
              communications of a similar nature. <br>
              <br>
              In addition, Eyematic sometimes uses individual data to "target" 
              advertising - to decide which advertisements and sponsor messages 
              to show to which members. As an example, if Sponsor Co. wishes to 
              display their advertising only to United States Eyematic members, 
              Eyematic uses member registration data to ensure that Sponsor Co.'s 
              ads are displayed only to United States members.<br>
              <br>
              Finally, Eyematic may use individual members' data to "pre-populate" 
              forms that are displayed for the purpose of collecting individual 
              data by Eyematic and/or its sponsors. In no case does pre-populating 
              a form automatically transfer any data to any advertiser or third 
              party. Only if the member voluntarily requests that such data be 
              transferred will any transfer take place - for example, if/when 
              a member clicks a "submit form" button or other button.<br>

              We reserve the right to release information contained within our 
              access logs concerning any visitor or member when that visitor or 
              member is in violation of our Terms of Service or other published 
              guidelines, or engages (or is reasonably suspected of engaging) 
              in any illegal activity, even without a subpoena, warrant, or other 
              court order, and to release such information in response to discovery 
              requests. We cooperate with law enforcement agencies in identifying 
              those who may be using our servers or services for illegal activities. 
              We also reserve the right to report any suspected illegal activity 
              to law enforcement for investigation or prosecution.<br>

              If and when Eyematic sponsors contests, promotions or sweepstakes, 
              or third parties sponsor contests, promotions or sweepstakes in 
              conjunction with Eyematic, either Eyematic or the third party will 
              post relevant privacy information in the official rules and/or registration 
              area for the contest, promotion or sweepstakes. That privacy information, 
              to the extent it conflicts with this Privacy Policy, will govern 
              that particular contest, promotion or sweepstakes.<br>
