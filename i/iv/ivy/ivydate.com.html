  <p style="text-align:center"><b>Privacy Policy</b> <br></p>

  <div class="basic-view"> <h3>Overview</h3>

    <p>IvyDate, Inc. knows 
    that you care how information about you is used and shared, and we appreciate 
    your trust that we will do so carefully and sensibly when you share 
    information via IvyDate.com (the “Site”).</p>
    <p>If you have questions or concerns 
    regarding this Privacy Policy, you should contact us at the following 
    link <a href="http://www.ivydate.com/contact" target="_blank">www.ivydate.com/contact</a>.</p>
    
    <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>We collect information about 
    you and your use of the Site.&nbsp; We may collect personally identifiable 
    information such as your name, address, age, picture, phone number, 
    email address, demographic and biographical information as well as other 
    information that does not personally identify you.&nbsp; We use this 
    information to share your profile information with other users of the 
    Site and to do internal research on our users’ demographics, interests 
    and behavior to better understand, protect and serve you and our community. 
    The following sections describe how we collect information:</p>
    
    <h3><i>Registration</i></h3>
    <p>When you register or subscribe 
    to any of our services, you provide information to us and we collect 
    a wide variety of information about you.&nbsp; Such information includes 
    personally identifiable information such as your name, address, age, 
    picture, email address, phone number, demographic and biographical information 
    and other profile information.</p>
    <h3><i>Log Files</i></h3>
    <p>Like many web sites, we automatically 
    gather certain information about our Site traffic and store it in log 
    files.&nbsp; This information includes Internet protocol (IP) addresses, 
    browser type, Internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, 
    operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data.&nbsp; We use 
    this information, which does not identify individual users, to analyze 
    trends, to administer the Site, to track users’ movements around the 
    Site and to gather demographic information about our user base.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>We may use a third-party tracking 
    service that uses log files and cookies, as discussed below, to track 
    non-personally identifiable information about visitors to the Site in 
    the aggregate.&nbsp; This service captures usage and volume statistics 
    to improve our services to our users. </p>
    <h3><i>Cookies</i></h3>
    <p>We use cookies to keep track 
    of some types of information while you are visiting our Site or using 
    our services.&nbsp; A cookie is a small text file that is stored on 
    a user’s computer for record-keeping purposes.&nbsp; We may also use 
    cookies to automatically collect information about your online activity 
    on our Site, for example, which web pages you browsed, which links you 
    clicked on, which profiles you visited, or which searches you conducted 
    on our Site.&nbsp; While most browsers automatically accept cookies, 
    you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies.&nbsp; 
    If you choose to decline cookies, please note that this may affect your 
    access to some features of our Site and may make it more difficult for 
    you to sign in.&nbsp; If you choose to decline our cookies, you assume 
    all responsibility for any resulting loss of functionality or access.  
    This Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies by the Site only and does 
    not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.&nbsp; Some of our business 
    partners (e.g., advertisers) use cookies on our Site.&nbsp; We have 
    no access to or control over these cookies.&nbsp; See “Third Party 
    Advertisers.”</p>
    <h3><i>Web Beacons (Clear GIFs, Pixel Tags)</i></h3>
    <p>We employ and our third party 
    advertising partner may employ a software technology called web beacons, 
    also referred to as clear GIFs or pixel tags, that help manage content 
    on the Site by tracking what content is effective.&nbsp; Web beacons 
    are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, 
    and are used to track the online movements of users in order to further 
    personalize our Site for our users and to collect a limited set of information 
    about our users.&nbsp; In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a 
    user’s computer hard drive, web beacons are embedded invisibly on 
    web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence.&nbsp; 
    We also may include web beacons in advertisements or promotional or 
    other e-mail messages or to determine whether messages have been opened 
    or acted upon.&nbsp; This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain 
    communications and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns.&nbsp; 
    If you would like to opt-out of these emails, please see “Choice/Opt-out.”&nbsp; 
    We do not tie the information gathered by web beacons to our customers’ 
    personally identifiable information. </p>
    <p>To learn more about our advertising 
    partners’ use of web beacons, see “Third Party Advertisers.” </p>
    <h3><i>Purchase Information</i></h3>
    <p>To process purchases, we may 
    require personally identifiable information such as your name, address, 
    phone number, email address and credit card information.&nbsp; Such 
    information is used primarily to process your order or as otherwise 
    described herein.&nbsp; </p>
    <h3><i>Surveys or Contests</i></h3>
    <p>We may provide you the opportunity 
    to participate in contests or surveys on our Site.&nbsp; If you participate, 
    we will request certain personally identifiable information from you.&nbsp; 
    The requested information typically includes contact information (such 
    as name and shipping address) and demographic information.&nbsp; We 
    use this information to notify contest winners and award prizes, to 
    monitor Site traffic, or to personalize the Site (in the case of anonymous 
    information collected in surveys).</p>
    <h3><i>Information Regarding  Your Friends</i></h3>
    <p>We encourage you to refer a 
    friend to our Site by sending us a friend’s name and email address.&nbsp; 
    We will collect and keep any such information about a friend.&nbsp; 
    We will invite that person with a one-time e-mail with your name, and 
    a one-time reminder. You agree to use this feature for only friends 
    who you believe are interested in our services, and you agree not to 
    abuse this feature.&nbsp; </p>
    <h3><i>Public Forums</i></h3>
    <p>We may make discussion boards, 
    forums and chat rooms available to you.&nbsp; You participate in these 
    areas with the acknowledgement that any information you disclose becomes 
    public information, including any personally identifiable information.&nbsp; 
    Please review the guidelines for any of these areas when posting comments 
    for terms and conditions and other specific information.</p>
    <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <p>In general, we may use information 
    that we collect about you to: (i) share information with other users 
    of the Site; (ii) deliver the products and services that you have requested;

    manage your account; (v) provide you information via e-mail, postal 
    mail, telephone and/or mobile devices about products or services offered

    <h3><i>Correspondence</i></h3>
    <p>We will occasionally send you 
    information on products, services, special deals, and promotions.&nbsp; 
    We may also use your name and email address to send newsletters to you.&nbsp; 
    Out of respect for your privacy, we present the option not to receive 
    these types of communications.&nbsp; Please see the “Choice/Opt-out.”</p>
    <p>We will send you strictly service-related 
    announcements on rare occasions when it is necessary to do so.&nbsp; 
    For instance, if our service is temporarily suspended for maintenance, 
    we might send you an email. Generally, you may not opt-out of these 
    communications, which are not promotional in nature.&nbsp; If you do 
    not wish to receive them, you have the option to deactivate your account.</p>
    <h3><i>Customer Service</i></h3>
    <p>We will communicate with you 
    in response to your inquiries, to provide the services you request, 
    and to manage your account. We will communicate with you by email or 
    telephone, in accordance with your wishes.</p>
    <h3><i>Profile</i></h3>
    <p>We store information that we 
    collect through cookies, log files, web beacons, and/or third party 
    sources to create a “profile” of your preferences.&nbsp; We may 
    tie your personally identifiable information, and your purchasing history, 
    to information in the profile, in order to provide tailored promotions 
    and marketing offers and to improve the content of the Site for you.</p>
    <p>We may purchase marketing data 
    from third parties and add it to our existing user database, to better 
    target our advertising and to provide pertinent offers in which we think 
    you would be interested.&nbsp; To enrich our Profiles of individual 
    customers, we may tie this information to the personally identifiable 
    information they have provided to us.&nbsp; We may share your profile 
    with third parties for promotional purposes, but will not share such 
    profiles in any way that would identify you.</p>
    <h2>Conditions Under Which We Share Information</h2>
    <h3><i>Aggregate Information 
    (Non-Personally Identifiable)</i></h3>
    <p>We share aggregated demographic 
    information about our user base with our partners and advertisers.&nbsp; 
    We may combine non-personal information we collect with additional non-personal 
    information collected from other sources. We also may share aggregated 
    information with third parties, including advisors, advertisers and 
    investors, for the purpose of conducting general business analysis.&nbsp; 
    This information does not identify individual users and may be used 
    to develop Site content and services that we hope you and other users 
    will find of interest and to target content and advertising. We do not 
    link aggregate user data with personally identifiable information.</p>

    are delivered to users by our advertising partners.&nbsp;&nbsp; We share 
    Site usage information about users with our advertising partners for

    <p>Our advertising partners may 
    use cookies and web beacons on the Site, which allow them to recognize 
    a user’s cookie when a user visits the Site and to measure advertising 
    effectiveness.&nbsp; The information that our advertising partners collect
