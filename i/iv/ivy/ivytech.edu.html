				<p><strong>General<br></strong>Ivy Tech Community College of Indiana respects the privacy of every individual who visits our site. This Privacy Policy outlines the information the Ivy Tech website may collect and how we may use that information. Ivy Tech reserves the right to alter this policy at any time by posting a new privacy policy at this location.</p>
<p><strong>Definition<br></strong>The "Ivy Tech website" is defined as publicly accessible pages hosted under the domain www.ivytech.edu.</p>
<p>The Ivy Tech website may contain links to other sites. Please be aware that Ivy Tech is not responsible for the privacy practices of those sites. This policy applies solely to information collected by this website.</p>
<p><strong>Personal Data<br></strong>We will not collect any personally identifiable information about you, such as name, address, telephone number, or e-mail address ("personal data") through our site unless you have provided it to us voluntarily. If you do not want your personal data collected, please do not submit it to us.</p>
<p>When you do provide us with personal data, we may use that information in the following ways, unless stated otherwise: we may process that information in order to fulfill an order or request you have placed with us; we may store and process that information to better understand your needs and how we can improve our products and services; we (or a fulfillment house or other third party on our behalf in connection with a promotion) may use that information to contact you; and/or we may provide other third parties with aggregate - but not individual - information about visitors to or users of our site. We will not sell, rent, or market personal data about you to third parties.</p>
<p><strong>Children/Direct Notice To Parents<br></strong>The Ivy Tech website has no intention of collecting any personal data from individuals under 13 years of age without parental consent. Where appropriate, we will specifically instruct those under thirteen not to submit such information on our site and/or will take reasonable steps to ensure parental consent to such submission.</p>
<p><strong>Additional Information Collected Automatically<br></strong>In some cases, we may automatically (i.e. not via registration) collect information about you that is not personally identifiable. Examples of this type of information include the type of Internet Browser you are using, the type of computer operating system you are using, the IP address of your computer, and the domain name of the website from which you linked to our site.

This information also helps us produce statistics on how often our various pages are visited.</p>
<p><strong>Information Placed Automatically on Your Computer/Cookies<br></strong>When you view our site, we may store some information on your computer. This information will be in the form of a "cookie" or similar file and can help us in many ways. For example, cookies allow us to tailor a website to better match your interests and preferences.
