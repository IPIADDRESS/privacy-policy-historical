                    <p>
                        The protection of your data and privacy is of special concern to us. We use private data, which is collected due to your visit on this website, corresponding to the German Federal Data Protection Act and the German Telemedia Act. Your data will only be used in the framework of the MOOC-contest and will not be passed on to third parties.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Collection and usage of personal data</h3>
                    <p>
                        Personal data (e.g. your email address) will only be collected on this website if you enter them. The iversity GmbH does not hand over your email adress to third parties. Your e-mail address will be used to send you, at reasonable time intervals, an e-mail newsletter.

                    <h3>Logfiles</h3>
                    <p>
                        When websites are visited via iversity.org, access data is submitted by your web browser, which is stored by the iversity GmbH in the automated log files, known as server logs. These log files contain the following information:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>IP address of the computer</li>
                        <li>date, time, status, amount of data transferred and the website from which you came to the requested page (referrer)</li>
                        <li>product and version information of the browser (user agent), operating system, language settings.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        The IP addresses automatically collected via these log files are anonymized and used if needed, in this anonymous form, for the improvement of iversity and for security reasons, to be able to trace cases of abuse of the service offered by iversity GmbH. You are entitled to prohibit, at any point in time, this kind of use of the log files via e-mail or by mail.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A compilation of this data with other sources of data, particularly with the personal data of the user, is not performed. The iversity GmbH, however, reserves the right to inspect existing logs for the last known IP address of the user, in the case of a definite legal offence or contract violation by the user. This serves mainly to protect the users of iversity and the security of user data on iversity.
                    </p>
