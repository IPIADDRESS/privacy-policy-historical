      <p>You should be aware that when you share or broadcast personal information in public areas of the Website, such as channels and chat rooms, this information becomes publicly available and can be seen, used and gathered by others, and therefore is not subject to this Privacy Policy. We urge you to exercise good judgment when sharing personal information in these forums. <br>

      <p><strong><u>What information does iVlog.TV collect and for what purpose?</u></strong></p>
      <p> Our main goals in collecting information are to provide and improve the Website and its services, and to administer the membership of registered users.   <br>

        <br>
        IV) to provide you with marketing or promotional materials and other information that may be of interest to you.      </p>
