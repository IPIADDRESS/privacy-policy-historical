All prices are maximum prices valid until 21 July 2013 (Prices are subject to any alteration in VAT)</p><h4>A partnership in trust</h4><p>When IKEA set out to create a high-quality, low-priced line of home furnishings, we knew we couldn’t do it without the help of some very important partners - you, our customers. Whether you’re ordering goods online through the IKEA website, picking up your furniture in our self-serve warehouses or assembling your purchases at home - we’re working together to help you create a better everyday life at a price everyone can afford. IKEA is based on a partnership with our customers. Without you, IKEA could not exist.</p><p>This partnership extends to the way we handle your personal information. Just as shopping at IKEA is a co-operative experience, IKEA makes a point of working with our customers when it comes to their privacy. This Privacy Notice is our way of telling you what information we collect, how we use it, who we will disclose it to and how you can access, change and remove your information.</p><h4>Help us build a better IKEA</h4><p>In order to create a better IKEA, we need your help. You can help by providing us with various kinds of information to help IKEA serve you better, and ultimately improve IKEA for everyone. Below you’ll find an explanation of some of the reasons we request information from you, as well as some details about how we obtain and use that information.</p><p>Throughout this Privacy Notice where we refer to your "personal information" what we mean by this is any information you provide to us about you including your name, postal address, email address and telephone number.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p></p><h2>Where we collect your personal information</h2><h4>Catalogue</h4><p>If you ask us to mail you an IKEA catalogue, we need your name and address. We also ask for your telephone number and email address in case there are any problems with delivery. You also have the option of providing us with additional information about products that interest you and other lifestyle information. Why do we ask for this additional information? It helps us learn about the people who shop at IKEA so we can better tailor our products, stores and website to you. Of course, providing this additional information is purely optional.</p><h4>Purchases</h4><p>When you make a purchase through our website, you will need to give us your credit or debit card number and other personal information. This information is necessary in order to process your payment and make delivery of your goods.</p><h4>Customer service</h4><p>In order for a customer service representative to respond to your questions or concerns, we may need personal information like your name, address and telephone number. This information is used to answer your questions as completely and thoroughly as possible.</p><h4>Special offers, promotions, coupons and warranties</h4><p>When you register for or redeem IKEA special offers, discount coupons or other promotions, we may ask for personal information in order to note the success of our promotions for future offers.

So we promise never to sell your personal information to any unconnected third parties.</p><p>On occasion, we do need to hire other companies to help us provide some services. In some of these cases we may need to share information that these companies need, in order to provide services to us and ultimately to you. For example, a delivery service will need to know your name and address in order to deliver your goods to you. Other services provided by different companies may include providing marketing assistance, processing credit/debit card payments and providing customer services. We'll limit the personal information we give them, and they will only have access to your personal information for the purposes of performing such functions. They are strictly monitored by IKEA in order to make certain our customers' privacy is always protected.</p><p>In proceeding with your online order, you agree that both your name and postal address and those of the delivery name and address (if different) will be checked using third parties such as credit agencies. If you are providing a delivery name and address which is not your own you must have that person's permission to give us their personal information and for us to use it for the purposes specified, by providing it you are saying you have their permission.<br><strong>N.B. the transfer of financial data is always via a secure network.</strong></p><p>At times, some of your personal information may be transferred to IKEA divisions in other countries but we always maintain administrative, technical and physical safeguards to protect against unauthorised disclosure, use, alteration and destruction of the information in our possession.</p><p>In assessing an application for credit, to prevent fraud, to check your identity and to prevent money laundering, IKEA or IKANO (a company who IKEA use to carry out such searches) may search the files of credit reference agencies who will record any credit searches under your name. We may also disclose details of how you conduct your account to such agencies. This information will be used by other credit grantors for making credit decisions about you and the people with whom you are financially associated, for fraud prevention, money laundering prevention and occasionally for tracing debtors. Information used for these purposes will include publicly available information such as electoral roll, county court judgments, bankruptcy orders or repossessions.</p><p>We may disclose your personal information in order to comply with a legal or regulatory obligation, such as a request by the police. We may also transfer your personal information in the event that our business (or part of it) is sold, and the purchaser needs your personal information to carry on providing services.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p></p><h2>Marketing</h2><p>If you provide any personal information to us you give us permission to contact you for marketing purposes, which may include messages via post, telephone, SMS or email.</p><p>We'll make sure that we only send you messages that we think will be of interest to you – for instance the dates of our in-store and online sales, details of special offers or information about new products and services. If you do not want us to use your personal information to market to you, you can decide to opt-out of these types of marketing messages at any time by changing the settings in your Profile or by following the unsubscribe link at the bottom of any email we send to you.</p><h3>Storing your information and keeping it up to date</h3><h4>Out of sight, but never out of reach</h4><p>When you share your personal information with IKEA, you will always have access to this information.
