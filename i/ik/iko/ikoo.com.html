<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p>ikoo.com (together  with its subsidiaries and affiliates, "ikoo"), respects the privacy and  security of its customers and users of its website and services. ikoo strives to provide you with a personalized  internet experience that delivers to you the information, products and services  that you need. In order to achieve this goal, ikoo sometimes collects  information during your visits to our website. We will not disclose this  information to any person or organization outside ikoo, except as described in this  Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy is not intended to and does not create any  contractual or other legal rights in or on behalf of any party.</p>
<p>We have prepared  this Privacy Policy to enable you to understand which personal identifying  information of yours is collected, how and when we might use your information,  how we protect your information, who has access to your information, and how  you can correct any inaccuracies in the information.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Information We  Collect</span></strong><br> ikoo collects  certain information from and about its users three ways: (i) from our web  server logs, (ii) with cookies &amp;  pixel tags and (iii) directly from the user. <strong><br></strong></p>
<p><strong>Web  server logs:</strong> <br>When you visit our website, ikoo may collect information  to administer the site and analyze its usage. ikoo may collect information such  as: <br> <strong>-</strong>your Internet  protocol address ; <br> <strong>-</strong>the type of browser  or computer you use; <br> <strong>-</strong>the number of links  you click within our website; <br> <strong>-</strong>the state or country  from which you accessed our website; <br> <strong>-</strong>the date and time of  your visit; <br> <strong>-</strong>the name of your  Internet service provider; <br> <strong>-</strong>the Web page from  which you linked to our website; and <br> <strong>-</strong>the pages you viewed  on our website</p>
<p><strong>Cookies &amp; Pixel Tags<br></strong></p>
<p>ikoo uses ZEDO as its adserving technology partner, ikoo  may collects  anonymous information through the use of cookies and pixel tags,  which  are industry standard technologies used by many major Web sites. No   personally identifiable information is collected or used in this  process. For more details on how to opt out please visit ZEDO's privacy  policy page at: <br> <strong><a href="http://www.zedo.com/company/privacy.htm" target="_blank" style="color: #0066ff;">http://www.zedo.com/company/privacy.htm</a> </strong><strong><br> </strong></p>
<p>Cookies are small files that are stored on your computer: A cookie file simply  contains a string of alphanumeric characters, which is passed from a Web site  to your computer and back to the Web site, unchanged, for recognition purposes.  Web sites use cookies to recognize a computer that has previously visited the  site or page. Cookies are often wrongly categorized as 'Spyware', or as a virus  or other malicious program. A cookie itself cannot do anything except help a  Web site behave in a manner customized to you.</p>
<ul>
</ul>
<p>ikoo uses cookies to enhance the Web experience by  preventing users from seeing the same Internet ad over and over again. ikoo  does not use cookies to personally identify you in any way, and these cookies  cannot damage your system or files.<br> You can tell your browser to accept or reject cookies for  all sites, or for specific sites; but remember, rejecting cookies may affect  the way your favorite sites behave.<br> <br> To make certain that ads served by ikoo are targeted correctly, we may place  pixel tags on our sites. These tags are not personally identifiable, nor do  they collect personal information. They are used to match visitor browsing  behavior to a segment profile designated for targeting ads to visitors.<br> When you are on one of our customer's Web sites  (including advertisers and Web site owners), the Web site uses cookies to  collect certain non-personal information about you, including but not limited  to: your browser type (Internet Explorer, Mozilla, etc.); operating system  (Windows, Macintosh, etc.); your browsing behavior, such as the date and time  you visit the site, the content areas or pages of the site you visit (for  example, 'auto section' or 'entertainment section'), ads clicked on and other  click-stream data. None of this data contains personal information about you.</p>
<p><strong>Personal information users give us: </strong><br>On some pages of our website, users may fill  forms to contact ikoo support &amp; sales or send an application to join our  network. When you fill any of those forms, ikoo may ask you for some personal information.</p>
<ul>
</ul>
<p>If you're purchasing products or services, we may also  request financial information such as credit card or bank account information.  Any financial information we collect is used only to bill you for the products  and services you purchased. If you purchase by credit card, this information  may be forwarded to your credit card provider. For other types of  registrations, we will ask for your name, address, e-mail address or telephone  number. We may then contact you with information about ikoo's products and  services.</p>
<p>As a security measure and to ensure that our website and  computer network remain available to all customers, ikoo may use software  programs to monitor network traffic or to identify unauthorized attempts to  upload or change information, or otherwise cause damage. These software  programs may also collect information regarding your use of our website and  computer network.</p>
<p>You may also be asked to disclose personal information to  us so that we can provide technical support assistance and information to you.  For example, we may collect personal information from you (such as an e-mail  address, system information and problem descriptions) in order to provide  online technical support and troubleshooting. If you choose to correspond with  us through electronic communication (e.g. email, online chat or instant  messaging), we may retain a copy of the electronic communication together with  your email address and our responses. We provide the same protections for these  electronic communications that we employ in the maintenance of information  received by mail and telephone.</p>
<p>Finally, some pages of ikoo's website may make chat  rooms, forums, message boards, news groups or instant messaging available to  you. Please remember that any information disclosed in these areas is public.  You should exercise caution when disclosing personal information in these  areas. Don't disclose information in these public forums that might be  considered confidential – such as financial information, social security numbers,  passwords or email addresses. Users should be aware that when they voluntarily disclose  personally identifiable information on the bulletin boards or in the chat  areas, that information and any substantive information disclosed in the  communication can be collected and used by third parties. This could result in  unsolicited messages from others who post on such sites and are beyond the  control of ikoo.</p>
<p><strong>How We Use Your Information<br> </strong> ikoo uses the anonymous information it collects to customize the advertisements  that consumers see on participating Web sites and to analyze if the advertising  resulted in a desired action, such as a sale. This is sometimes referred to as  Online Preference Marketing (OPM) or Behavioral Targeting. In order to serve  appropriate ads to visitors, ikoo will temporarily assemble non-personal  behavioral and technical information to create very large audience segments.  These segments represent data that has been aggregated into large anonymous  groupings.<br> ikoo stores all anonymous, non PII data in user cookies  and not on any servers. These cookies have a lifetime of one year and can be  blocked or deleted by users using the methods described on our Opt Out page. <a href="/index.php/en/Opt-Out" style="color:#06F"><strong>Click here  to opt out</strong></a>.</p>
<p>ikoo may also use the information we collect to notify  you about your account and to notify you about changes to the terms and  conditions governing your use of our website, products and services. We may  also use the information we collect to notify you about other products and  services we think you will find valuable and about special offers. You may  notify us of your desire not to receive notifications relating to new products  and services and special offers by "opting-out" as provided for below.</p>
<p>ikoo may also provide aggregate information about our  customers, this website's traffic patterns and related website usage  information to our affiliates and reputable third parties, but this information  will not include personally identifying data. We take measures to select  product or service providers that are responsible and afford similar privacy  protections to their customers. However, we do not make any representations  about the practices and policies of these companies.</p>
<p><strong>Disclosure of Information</strong><br> ikoo does not provide any personal information to marketers when you interact  with or view a targeted ad. The user information that we collect to create  segments and profile information for our service is not shared with any other  outside party. At the same time, our advertiser customers cannot correlate or  merge any network segment information that they may collect process or store in  connection with their site, including such personal information except in  compliance with the applicable customer contracts and such customer's privacy  policy. PII may be utilized by advertiser customers at a later time, as part of  their customer relationship management (CRM) programs, for example.<br> <strong>Opting Out</strong><br> If you do not want to store this information in your browser, you can easily  deny, or opt out of, cookies. There is more than one way to opt out of cookies:  manually delete your cookies by following the instructions contained in the  "Help" section of your browser; or, <a href="/index.php/en/Opt-Out" style="color:#06F"><strong>go to our Opt Out page</strong></a> and click the "Opt Out Now" button provided. We  will no longer deliver ads targeted to your preferences and usage patterns.<br> <strong>The ikoo Opt-out Tool is cookie-based</strong>. In order for the Tool to work on your computer, your  browser must be set to accept third party cookies. If you buy a new computer,  change web browsers or delete this cookie, you will need to perform the opt-out  task again.</p>
<p><strong>How We Protect Your Information</strong><br> ikoo uses technical security measures to prevent the  loss, misuse, alteration or unauthorized disclosure of information under our  control.</p>
<p>When we ask customers or users to provide financial  information (such as a credit card number) that data is protected using Secure  Sockets Layer ("SSL") technology. However, please note that electronic communication  (e.g. email, online chat or instant messaging) that you may send to us may not  be secure unless we advise you in advance that security measures will be in  place prior to your transmitting the information. For that reason, we ask that  you do not send confidential information such as financial information, social  security numbers or passwords to us through unsecured electronic communication.</p>
<p><strong>Access to Your Information</strong><br> ikoo will share or disclosure your personal data in four  ways: <span dir="ltr"><br> <strong>-</strong></span>as required by law, in a matter of public safety or  policy, or as compelled by a court of law; <br> <strong>-</strong>with other affiliates or partners of ikoo (as described  above); <br> <strong>-</strong>with agents and contractors who use such information on  behalf of ikoo or in connection with administering or delivering products and  services on behalf of ikoo; and <br> <strong>-</strong>as needed in connection with the transfer of business  assets.</p>
<ul>
</ul>
<p><strong>Links to Other Websites</strong><br> ikoo's website contain links to sites maintained by other  companies that are not affiliated with ikoo. We are not responsible for the  privacy practices or the content of those sites, and we encourage you to use  caution when visiting them. In particular, we recommend you view the privacy  policy posted on each site.</p>
