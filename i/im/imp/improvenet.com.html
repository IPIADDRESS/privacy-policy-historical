                    <br><br>
                    This privacy policy applies to <a href="http://www.servicemagic.com">http://www.servicemagic.com</a> and all websites and URL's
                    controlled or operated by ServiceMagic, Inc., which link to this policy, unless otherwise specified. Real Estate services and
                    Home Loans services are owned, operated and provided by LendingTree, Inc., and not by ServiceMagic, and the privacy policies
                    applicable to your use of those services are governed by the privacy policies located on those websites.
                    <br><br>
                    This is a new privacy policy effective as of the date set forth above. Even if you read and approved a prior policy, you need
                    to review this new version as it has been updated and revised.
                    <br><br>
                    Titles and headings are provided for general reference and ease of use only, as information may be covered in more than one heading or under other headings.
                    <br><br>
                    If users have questions or concerns regarding this statement, they should first contact ServiceMagic's privacy
                    department at  <a href="mailto:privacy@servicemagic.com">privacy@servicemagic.com</a>.

                    <b class="redhead">Information Collection</b>
                    <br><br>

                    <b>Registration and Service Professional Enrollment</b>
                    <br>
                    In order to complete a service request or to enroll as a prospective service professional, a user must first complete a registration form.
                    During registration a user is required to give contact information (such as name and email address). We use this information to contact
                    the user about services on our site for which they have expressed interest, to inform service professionals of leads, and/or inform
                    customers about service professionals they matched to. By providing this information to us, or by submitting a service request, you
                    expressly consent to being contacted by us and by our service professionals and providers via phone, fax, email, mail or other
                    reasonable means, at any of your contact numbers or addresses, in order that we may provide the services set forth on our Web site,
                    service your account, reasonably address matters pertaining to your account or for other reasonable purposes related to our business.
                    Unique identifiers (such as username and password) are required. It is optional for the user to provide demographic information
                    (such as income level and gender) but encouraged so we can provide a more personalized experience on our Web site. We also require a
                    US service professional's social security number or federal tax id number to complete a background check (credit is not checked),
                    prior to a US service professional being approved to join our network.
                    <br><br>

                    <b>Service Request</b>
                    <br>
                    We request information from the consumer in our service request interview process. A user must provide detailed information about the service requested.
                    No financial information (such as credit card number, expiration date) is collected from the consumer. This information is used to match consumers with
                    appropriate service professionals. The information may also be used to contact the consumer to verify or clarify their service request or to customize
                    the consumer's Web site experience or future ServiceMagic communication.
                    <br><br>

                    <b>Feedback, Ratings and Reviews and Testimonials</b><br>
                    Additionally, we collect feedback from users (called ratings and reviews) about the performance of Service Professionals who work for them.
                    We also collect general feedback and testimonials from users of our service and system. By providing such feedback to us, you consent to
                    our use, publication and/or distribution of such feedback at no compensation to you, and if you are a Service Professional in our system,
                    you acknowledge that all such ratings and reviews are solely owned by ServiceMagic, and you consent to the publication of ratings and
                    reviews about you and your business.
                    <br><br><br>


                    <b class="redhead">Information Use</b>
                    <br><br>

                    <b>Profile</b><br>
                    We store information that we collect through the Web site experience and activities, cookies, log files, clear gifs, and/or third parties to
                    create a profile of our users. A profile is stored information that we keep on individual users that detail their viewing preferences,
                    activities and interactions with ServiceMagic. Consequently, collected information is tied to the user's personally identifiable information
                    to provide offers and improve the content of the site for the user. This profile is used to tailor a user's visit to our Web site and to
                    direct pertinent marketing promotions and communications to them.
                    <br><br>

                    <b>Cookies</b><br>
                    A cookie is a piece of data tied to information about the user and stored on the user's computer. We use both session cookies, which terminate
                    when a user closes his browser, and persistent cookies, which remain on the user's computer until manually deleted.
                    <br><br>
                    By setting a persistent cookie, we enable our users to not have to log in with a password more than once, thereby saving time while on our Web site.
                    If users reject these cookies, they may still use our Web site. The only drawback to this is that the experience and/or access of a user may be
                    limited in some areas of our Web site. For example, the user may not be able to participate in any of our sweepstakes, contests or monthly drawings
                    that may take place. See the "Profile" section.
                    <br><br>

                     We may use third-party advertising companies to serve ads on our behalf and to monitor certain pages of our Web site for the purpose of reporting web
                     traffic, statistics, advertisement 'click-throughs', and/or other activities on our site. These companies, which may include OPM Performance Marketing
                     ("OPM"), a division of Overture Services, Inc. ("Overture") and Microsoft, Inc., may employ cookies and action tags (also known as single pixel gifs
                     or web beacons) to measure advertising effectiveness. Any information that these third parties collect via cookies and action tags is completely
                     anonymous. If you would like more information about this practice and your choices,
               		<a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/optout_nonppii.asp " target="_blank">click here</a>.
                    <br><br>

                    <b>Third Party Advertising</b><br>
                    Some of our business partners may use cookies on our Web site (for example, advertisers). We have no access to or control over these cookies once our
                    business partners have been given permission to set cookies. This privacy statement covers the use of cookies by ServiceMagic only and does not cover
                    the use of cookies by any advertisers.
                    <br><br>

                    <b>Log Files</b><br>
                    Like most standard Web site servers we use log files. This includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP),
                    referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, and number of clicks to analyze trends, administer the Web site, track user's movement in the
                    aggregate, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use.
                    <br><br>

                    <b>Clear Gifs</b> (Web Beacons/Web Bugs)<br>
                    We employ and/or our third party advertisers employ a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs), that help us better manage
                    content on our site and marketing campaigns by informing us what content and which campaigns are effective. Clear gifs are tiny graphics, about the
                    size of a period at the end of a sentence, with a unique identifier. Clear gifs are similar in function to cookies and are used to track the online
                    movements of Web users.
                    <br><br>

                    Clear Gifs can "work with" existing cookies on a computer if they are both from the same Web site or advertising company. That means, for example,
                    that if a person visited "www.companyX.com", which uses an advertising company's clear gif, the Web site or advertising company would match the
                    clear gif's identifier and the advertising company's cookie ID number, to show the past online behavior for that computer. This collected information
                    would then be given to the advertising company or Web site. To learn more about our advertising partners' use of clear gifs, please contact us at
                    <a href="mailto:privacy@servicemagic.com">privacy@servicemagic.com</a>.
                    <br><br>

                    In addition, ServiceMagic and its advertisers use clear gifs in HTML-based emails. This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications
                    and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns by showing how may emails have been opened by the recipients. If users would like to opt-out of these
                    emails, please see the Opt-out section.
                    <br><br><br>


                    <b class="redhead">Communications from ServiceMagic and its Service professionals</b>
                    <br><br>
                    <b>Special Offers and Updates</b><br>
                    We send all new members a welcoming email to verify password and username. Established members will occasionally receive information on products,
                    services, special deals, and a bi-monthly newsletter. Out of respect for the privacy of our users we present the option to not receive these types
                    of communications. Please see the Choice and Opt-out sections.
                    <br><br>

                    <b>Newsletter</b><br>
                    If a user wishes to subscribe to our newsletters, we ask for contact information such as name and email address. Out of respect for our users
                    privacy we provide a way to opt-out of these communications. Please see the Choice and Opt-out sections.
                    <br><br>

                    <b>Service Announcements</b><br>
                    On rare occasions it is necessary to send out a strictly service related announcement. For instance, if our service is temporarily suspended for
                    maintenance we might send users an email. Generally, users may not opt-out of these communications, though they can deactivate their account.
                    However, these communications are not promotional in nature.
                    <br><br>

                    <b>Leads Notifications and Trial Lead Notifications</b><br>
                    If a user either signs up for our trial program or joins our service professional network, and elects to receive their leads via email, that user
                    will receive multiple communications from us. Other ways we contact members of our service professional network are via fax, pager, outbound IVR
                    (interactive voice response), and/or cell text (SMS) messaging. Members of our service professional network (or prospective members enrolled in
                    Free Trial) can designate and opt-in on our Web site or by contacting customer service to receive leads in one or more of these formats.
                    <br><br>

                    <b>Customer Service</b><br>
                    We communicate with users on a regular basis to provide requested services and in regards to issues relating to their account via email, fax, phone or mail,
                    and we reply to user inquiries via email or phone, or other reasonable means, in accordance with the user's wishes where applicable.
                    <br><br><br>


                    <b class="redhead">Sharing Information to Provide Services and to Conduct Our Business</b>
                    <br><br>

                    When you submit information to ServiceMagic, you authorize us to share this information with our network of service professionals and partners in
                    order to try to provide the services you request. For example, when an approved member of our service professional network accepts a lead from a
                    registered user, and that user indicates what personal information they are willing to share so that the service professional can contact the user,
                    such as telephone numbers, physical addresses and email addresses, that information is shared with our service professionals who have accepted a
                    service request lead. In addition, we have other approved contractual partners that fulfill services requests, or that utilize their own service
                    professionals to supplement our network, and we share your information with them, subject to contractual confidentiality restrictions, in order
                    to attempt to provide the services requested. If using our services pursuant to a membership with one of our partners, ServiceMagic may share
                    your service request activity information with such partner in certain circumstances. We may also post and publish users’ ratings and reviews of
                    Service Professionals' performance, as well as feedback and testimonials at our sole discretion. We may also release information to collection
                    and/or credit agencies for past due service professional accounts.
                    <br><br>

                    Though we strive to preserve user privacy, due to the existing regulatory environment, we cannot ensure that all of your private communications
                    and other personal information will always remain confidential. By way of example, we may disclose personal information when required by law wherein
                    we have a belief that such action is necessary or advisable to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, legal proceeding, process or
                    investigation served on our business or Web site(s), or when we believe parties are misusing or attempting to misuse our Web sites or services,
                    including but not limited to violating the law, committing fraud, deception, theft, attempting to harm or divert our business, engaging in
                    threatening or inappropriate behavior or threatening to place, or placing themselves or others in danger. You should also be aware that courts
                    of equity, such as U.S. Bankruptcy Courts, may have the authority under certain circumstances to require us to share or transfer your information
                    to third parties. Finally, although we strive to protect your privacy, third parties beyond our control may unlawfully intercept or access
                    transmissions or private communications. Therefore, we do not promise, and you should not expect, that your personal information or private
                    communications will always remain private.
                    <br><br>

                    ServiceMagic will not be responsible or otherwise liable for any use or disclosure of your personal information by a third party to whom ServiceMagic
                    is allowed to disclose you personal information under this privacy policy.<br><br>

                    <b>Aggregate Information</b> (non-personally identifiable)<br>
                    ServiceMagic may share aggregated activity or statistical information with partners, advertisers or others, but such information shall not contain
                    personally identifiable information.
                    <br><br>

                    <b>Business Transitions</b><br>
                    In the event ServiceMagic goes through a business transition such as a merger, being acquired by another company, or selling a portion of its
                    assets, users' personal information will, in most instances, be part of the assets transferred. See also, section entitled "Changes and updates to this policy..." set forth below.
                    <br><br>

                    <b>Choice/Opt-out</b><br>
                    Our users are given the opportunity to 'opt-out' of having their information used for purposes not directly related to our Web site at the point where
                    we ask for information. For example, our service request form has an 'opt-out' mechanism so users who submit a service request from us, but don't want
                    any marketing material, can keep their email address off of our marketing lists.
                    <br><br>

                    Users who no longer wish to receive our newsletter and promotional communications may opt-out of receiving these communications by replying to
                    unsubscribe in the email or email us at
                    <a href="mailto:customerservice@servicemagic.com">customerservice@servicemagic.com</a>.
                    <br><br>

                    Users of our Web site are always notified when their information is being collected by any outside parties (excluding our affiliates, service
                    providers, or agents) for marketing purposes. We do this so our users can make an informed choice as to whether or not they should proceed with
                    services that require an outside party.
                    <br><br>

                    <b>Links and Integrated Partnerships</b><br>
                    This Web site contains links from and to other Web sites. Please be aware that ServiceMagic is not responsible for the privacy practices of such
                    other Web sites. We encourage our users to be aware of this when they leave our Web site and to read the privacy statements of each and every Web
                    site that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by ServiceMagic’s Web site.
                    <br><br>

                    With some partners, ServiceMagic receives information concerning the service requested by a consumer including personal or contact information that
                    is inputted on a partner Web site. This information is sent from the partner to us either in a batched format, or via Internet technology such as
                    XML, FTP or HTTP Post. This information may or may not be encrypted by the partner. With other partners, ServiceMagic may provide information
                    concerning a consumer's service request, including contact information to other partners to provide services.
                    <br><br>

                    <b>Surveys &amp; Contests</b> <br>
                    From time-to-time, ServiceMagic may request information from users via surveys or contests. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely
                    voluntary and the user therefore has a choice whether or not to disclose this information. The requested information typically includes contact
                    information (such as name and mailing address), and demographic information (such as zip code). Contact information will be shared with the contest
                    or survey sponsors (if ServiceMagic elects to utilize an outside promotions or survey company) to notify the winners and award prizes. Survey
                    information will be used for purposes of monitoring or improving the use and satisfaction of our services and this Web site.
                    <br><br>

                    <b>Tell-A-Friend</b><br>
                    If a user elects to use our referral service for informing a friend about our Web site, we ask them for the friend's name and email address.
                    ServiceMagic will automatically send the friend a one-time email inviting them to visit the Web site. ServiceMagic stores this information for
                    the sole purpose of sending this one-time email and tracking the success of our referral program. The friend may contact ServiceMagic at
                    <a href="mailto:privacy@servicemagic.com">privacy@servicemagic.com</a> to request the removal of this information from
                    our database.
                    <br><br>

                    <b>Security</b><br>

                    "Perfect security" does not exist on the Internet and we do not guarantee security of information or that unauthorized access will not occur.
                    However, we take all reasonable precautions when protecting your personal information. Servers that store personally identifiable information
                    are located in a supervised and/or locked facility. Users' personal information off line is restricted by our internal security procedures,
                    and authorized access to such information is only provided to our employees and contractors who reasonably need the information for their
                    areas of responsibility (for example, a billing clerk, a sales rep, a customer service representative or management).
                    <br><br>
                    Your information may be transferred to and maintained in whole or in part on computer networks which may be located outside of the state,
                    province, country or other governmental jurisdiction in which you reside, and may be stored on equipment or in facilities leased or
                    licensed from third parties.
                    <br><br>
                    If users have any questions about the security at our Web site, users can send an email to
                    <a href="mailto:privacy@servicemagic.com">privacy@servicemagic.com</a>.
                    <br><br>

                    <b>Verification and Supplementation of Information </b>
                    <br>
                    In order for us to better conduct our business it is sometimes advisable or necessary for us to verify and/or supplement the information
                    we receive from service providers and users of our Web site with information from 3rd party sources, provided that such sources confirm
                    to us that they are permitted to share such information, such information is publicly available or the collection is required or authorized
                    by law.  Examples of collection from other sources include collections from:<br><br>
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• insurance companies;<br>
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• government agencies or registries; and<br>
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• the Better Business Bureau;
                    <br><br>

                    <b>Enhancement of Marketing Profile</b><br>
                    Occasionally, we purchase third party marketing data and add it to our existing user database to better target our advertising and provide pertinent
                    offers we think our users would be interested in. We use this information to enhance or overlay the 'profile' of individual users. This aggregate
                    marketing data is therefore tied to the users' personally identifiable information. See also the "Profile."
                    <br><br>

                    <b>Correcting/Updating/Deleting/Deactivating Personal Information</b>
                    <br>
                    If a user's personally identifiable information changes (such as zip code, phone, email or postal address), or if a user no longer desires
                    our service, we provide a means to access, correct, update or delete/deactivate users' personally identifiable information. This can be
                    done by emailing our Customer Support at
                    <a href="mailto:customerservice@servicemagic.com">customerservice@servicemagic.com</a>. Or, contact us by telephone or postal mail at the
                    contact information listed below. Please note that deleting your account information will not delete all of your contact information or
                    other information contained on our systems, as much or all of this information will be retained to preserve records of our commercial
                    relationship with you, or as required by law. Further, certain information may have already been provided to third parties as described herein.
                    <br><br>

					<b>Denial of Access to Personal Information</b>
					<br>
					Your rights to access your personal information are not absolute.  We may deny access:<br><br>
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• when denial of access is required or authorized by law;<br>
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• when granting you access would have an unreasonable impact on other people’s privacy;<br>
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; privacy;<br>
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• to protect our Company’s rights and property; or<br>
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• where the request is frivolous or vexatious.<br>
					<br>
					If we deny your request for access to, or refuse a request to correct Personal Information, we will explain why.
					<br><br>
