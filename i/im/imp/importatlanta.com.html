                            It is important for you to remain aware that when 
                            you provide personal information (e.g., last name, 
                            address, phone number) in a posting on any message 
                            board, that information is available to any other 
                            person or user having access and use of that message 
                            board, and may be used by someone in a manner unintended 
                            by you. For that reason, we discourage you from offering 
                            any personally identifying information within a posting 
                            to any message board. IA uses Mods or moderators to 
                            watch our forums for post that we do not want on our 
                            site. These Mods or moderators are not paid nor do 
                            they work for IA, but they do have a say in how the 
                            forum runs. Any post that any IA Staff member or Mod 
                            finds that needs to be deleted, edited, or locked 
                            will be. No reason is needed to do so. Types of post 
                            that fall into this would be: bashing IA Staff / Mods 
                            / Members / - Sponsors, extreme language/hostility, 
                            threats, pics of illegal nature, post of illegal activities/products, 
                            and anything else that may confilct with any laws, 
                            etc...</p>
