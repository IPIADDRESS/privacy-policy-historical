<p>7. Cookies<br>
(a) All visitors<br>
“Cookies” are small text files that contain a string of alpha-numeric characters and are used to associate an action taken by a browser with subsequent actions taken by that browser. Web beacons are small strings of HTML code that are placed in a Web page, and are sometimes called “clear GIFs” (Graphics Interchange Format) or “pixel tags.” Web beacons are most often used in conjunction with cookies.</p>
<p>We place unique identifier cookies on the hard drives of those who sign on which are used to maintain the visitor “sign on” status for the duration of the visit, for one-time customizing/tailoring of your visit and for long-term storage of user preferences. We also use cookies to track the pages visited by a visitor so that we can deliver Impact Radius web content based on the visitor’s profile (as provided by the visitor) and the visitor’s past activity on the Impact Radius website.</p>
<p>You can remove cookies by following directions provided in your Internet browser’s “help” file. In some browsers you can set up rules to manage cookies on a site-by-site basis, giving you more fine-grained control over your privacy. What this means is that you can disallow cookies from all sites except those that you trust. Cookies from Impact Radius may be stored under one or more of the following domains: impactradius.com, 7eer.net, evyy.net and/or ojrq.net.</p>
<p>(b) Minors<br>
Impact Radius does not knowingly collect any personal information about individuals under eighteen (18) years of age. If Impact Radius obtains actual knowledge that it has collected personal data about an individual under eighteen (18) years of age, that personal data will be immediately deleted from its database.</p>
<p>8. Security<br>
We have implemented security measures that are amongst the industry’s highest in order to protect our users’ personal data, business data and financial information (“Sensitive Information”) from loss, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration or destruction. Users may be general website visitors, Advertisers or Media Partners.</p>
<p>When users submit Sensitive Information on the Website, their Sensitive Information is protected both online and offline. When our registration process asks users to submit Sensitive Information and when we transmit such Sensitive Information, that Sensitive Information is encrypted and protected with SSL encryption software. While we use SSL encryption to protect Sensitive Information online, we protect all other user information online and offline.</p>
<p>The servers that we store Sensitive Information in are kept in a secure physical environment. We have security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse and alteration of Sensitive Information under our control. Our employees are made aware of, and are accountable for compliance with, these procedures. With the exception of our technology security experts, no employee has access to back-end systems that would enable them to use (or misuse) your Sensitive Information.</p>
<p>We ensure that strict procedures are followed and documented when back-end systems are accessed by our technology security experts.</p>
<p>Please be advised that, although we take every reasonable precaution available to protect your Sensitive Information, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. Therefore, we cannot warrant that your Sensitive Information will be absolutely secure. Any transmission of data at or through our Website is undertaken at your own risk. However, access to your Sensitive Information is strictly limited, and not accessible to the public. In compliance with applicable data protection legislation, we shall notify you and any applicable regulatory agencies (including the Information Commissioner) if we learn of an information security breach with respect to your Sensitive Information. You will be notified via email in the event of such a breach. Please be advised that notice may be delayed in order to address the needs of law enforcement, determine the scope of network damage, and to engage in remedial measures.</p>
<p>9. Information Sharing and Disclosure<br>
Impact Radius does not rent, sell, or share personal data about you with other people or non-affiliated companies, except under the following circumstances:</p>
<p>in order to respond to subpoenas, court orders, or legal process, or to establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims.<br>
when it is necessary to share information in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person; violations of Impact Radius’ terms of use, any agreement with Impact Radius or this Privacy Policy; or as otherwise required by law.<br>
where Impact Radius determines, in its sole discretion, that such disclosure is necessary to protect the rights of Impact Radius and/or a third party, or necessary to protect Impact Radius from liability of any kind.<br>
if Impact Radius sells any or all of its assets or their shareholders sell any or all of their shares to a third party in which case and subject always to compliance with applicable data protection legislation, your personal data may be transferred to the buyer.<br>
