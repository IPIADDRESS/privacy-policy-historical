          <strong><p align="CENTER">PNC Bank Customer Information Privacy Principles</p>
          </strong><p>At PNC Bank, our mission is to meet the desires of our customers. As financial services professionals entrusted with sensitive financial information, we respect the privacy of our customers and are committed to treating customer information responsibly. Our Customer Information Privacy Principles serve as standards for all PNC Bank employees for collection, use, retention, and security of individual customer information. </p>
          <strong></strong><p><strong>PNC Bank Collects and Retains Only Customer Information That Is Needed</strong> </p>
          <p>We limit the amount and type of customer information we collect and retain to that which is required to establish and manage customer accounts, understand customer needs, provide customer services, offer new products and services, and comply with legal and regulatory requirements. </p>
          <strong></strong><p><strong>PNC Bank Employees Are Responsible For Customer Information Protection</strong> </p>
          <p>We limit employee access to customer information to those employees with a legitimate business need for the information. We have policies, procedures, employee orientation, and communication programs designed for the protection of customer information. It is the responsibility of each PNC Bank employee to comply with our Customer Information Privacy Principles policies and procedures. Failure to comply subjects our employees to disciplinary action. </p>
          <strong></strong><p><strong>PNC Bank Strives To Maintain The Accuracy Of Customer Information</strong> </p>
          <p>We have implemented internal controls and procedures designed to keep and report customer information as accurately and completely as possible. We respond promptly when a customer tells us his or her information is not accurate. </p>
          <strong></strong><p><strong>PNC Bank Limits The Internal Disclosure Of Customer Information</strong> </p>
          <p>We share non-transactional personal information, such as applications, financial statements, and credit reports, among PNC Bank companies. We provide our consumer customers the opportunity to opt-out of such inter-company information sharing, except where such information is used to enable one PNC company to service customer accounts for another. </p>
          <strong></strong><p><strong>PNC Bank Limits The External Disclosure Of Customer Information</strong> </p>
          <p>We do not disclose customer information outside the PNC Bank companies, except: </p>

          <ul>
          <li>to conduct our business (for example, in connection with completing customer transactions, transferring customer accounts, or sharing information with credit reporting agencies, persons verifying account status, or persons providing services for us), </li>
          <li>when we suspect fraud or are otherwise required or permitted to do so by law or regulation, </li>
          <li>when a customer requests or gives us permission to do so, or </li>
          <li>to make available products or services we believe may be of interest to our customers. Those companies outside PNC Bank that we select to offer services or products to our customers must agree to respect the privacy of our customer information. </li></ul>

          <strong></strong><p><strong>PNC Bank Respects Our Customers’ Solicitation Preferences</strong> </p>
          <p>We honor our consumer customers’ requests to be excluded from marketing solicitations. </p>
