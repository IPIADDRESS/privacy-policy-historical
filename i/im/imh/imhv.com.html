	<h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
	<br>

	<p>If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please feel free to <a href="http://imhv.com/contact.php">contact us</a>.</p>
	
	<p>Last Updated: April 10, 2015</p>
	<p>imhv.com strives to offer its visitors the many advantages of 
	Internet technology and to provide an interactive and personalized experience. <br><br>	

	We may use Personally Identifiable Information (your name, e-mail address, 
	street address, telephone number) subject to the terms of this privacy policy. <br><br>

	At imhv.com, we use the "Privacy by Design" approach. This means that we think of privacy implication before building a new feature, we don't ask for information we don't need, and we protect the information we have.<br><br>
	
	We take pride in treating our users' privacy the way we'd like to be treated by a website like imhv.com, as individuals.<br><br>

	<u>We will never sell, barter, or rent your email address to any unauthorized third 
	party. Period.</u></p>
	<b>
	<h2>Data Collected</h2>
	</b>

	<p>How we collect and store information depends on the page you are visiting, 
	the activities in which you elect to participate and the services provided.<br><br>
	
	For example, you may be asked to provide information when you register for access to 
	certain portions of our site or request certain features, such as newsletters or 
	when you make a purchase.<br><br>
	
	You may provide information when you participate in 
	sweepstakes and contests, message boards and chat rooms, and other interactive 
	areas of our site.<br><br>
	
	Like most Web sites, imhv.com also collects 
	information automatically and through the use of electronic tools that may be 
	transparent to our visitors. <br><br>
	
	For example, we may log the name of your Internet 
	Service Provider, your IP address or use cookie or clear GIF technology to recognize you and hold information 
	from your visit.<br><br>
	
	We also collect information about how you use this website (including demographic information), the browser you used to visit our site (such as Internet Explorer or Firefox), the time you visited our site, which pages you visited throughout our site, and other technical information.<br><br>
	
	We may collect this information through services such as <b>Google Analytics</b> or other web analytics platform.<br><br>

	You may disable Google Analytics by visiting <a target="_blank" href="http://www.google.com/settings/ads/onweb/?sig=Aci0TCiRDcnrXrdffABE6Nifr9QppTwHkj_NTB8gd0FaMd9YV_wg5YIp3OvYIp-y-pdTWNhIhLjQXh6TyIek2jcL233J8XokduMKuR1N-zHOJP2Ls6zIAM_wKkwTu-xTmML-Aucg-KsrCOB6oLAL11n-sPX9rEefGBMsmC7iVBTJsDKZmWkr3jnzCeVGR-wzwiV8cGO96yfR&amp;hl=en">Google's Ads Preferences Manager</a>.<br><br>

	And we also collect information that you choose send to us (including website messages, blog comments, emails).<br><br>
	
	Among other things, the cookie may store your user name and 
	password, sparing you from having to re-enter that information each time you 
	visit, or may control the number of times you encounter a particular 
	advertisement while visiting our site.<br><br>
	
	As we adopt additional technology, we may 
	also gather information through other means.<br><br>
	
	In certain cases, you can choose 
	not to provide us with information, for example by setting your browser to 
	refuse to accept cookies, but if you do you may be unable to access certain 
	portions of the site or may be asked to re-enter your user name and password, 
	and we may not be able to customize the site's features according to your 
	preferences.</p>
	<b>
	<h2>Use Of Data</h2>
	</b>
	<p>Like other Web publishers, we collect information to develop and manage this website, enhance your visit, provide you web services, send to you your purchased products,  services, statements and invoices, deliver more individualized content and advertising and send you marketing communications.<br><br>
	
	<u>We respect your privacy and 
	do not share your information with anyone.</u></p>
	<p><strong>Aggregated Informatio</strong>n (information that does not personally identify you) 
	may be used in many ways.<br><br>
	
	For example, we may combine information about your 
	usage patterns with similar information obtained from other users to help 
	enhance our site and services (e.g., to learn which pages are visited most or 
	what features are most attractive).<br><br>
	
	Aggregated Information may occasionally be 
	shared with our advertisers and business partners.<br><br>
	
	Again, this information does 
	not include any Personally Identifiable Information about you or allow anyone to 
	identify you individually.</p>
	<p>We may use Personally Identifiable Information collected on imhv.com to communicate with you about your registration and customization 
	preferences; our Terms of Service and privacy policy; services and products 
	offered by imhv.com and other topics we think you might find of 
	interest. </p>
	<p>Personally Identifiable Information collected by imhv.com may 
	also be used for other purposes, including but not limited to site 
	administration, troubleshooting, tracking and improving the effectiveness of our advertising, processing of e-commerce transactions, 
	administration of sweepstakes and contests, and other communications with you.<br><br>
	
	Certain third parties who manage or provide technical support for the operation of our 
	site (our Web hosting service for example) or our newsletter (our Mailing list server provider provider for example) may access such information.<br><br>

	Our mailing list server provider is Getresponse.com. Therefore, the information you provide can be accessed by those who manage our mailing lists and newsletters at Getresponse.com. You can read Getresponse's Anti-Spam Policy <a target="_blank" href="http://www.getresponse.com/legal/antispam.html">here</a>. 
	
	<u>We will 
	use your information only as permitted by law.</u><br><br> 
	
	In addition, from time to time as 
	we continue to develop our business, we may sell, buy, merge or partner with 
	other companies or businesses.<br><br>
	
	In such transactions, user information may be 
	among the transferred assets.<br><br>
	
	We may also disclose your information in response 
	to a court order, at other times when we believe we are reasonably required to 
	do so by law, in connection with the collection of amounts you may owe to us, 
	and/or to law enforcement authorities whenever we deem it appropriate or 
	necessary.<br><br>
	
	Please note we may not provide you with notice prior to disclosure in 
	such cases.</p>

	<h2>Remarketing Program</h2>

	<p>We may use third-party cookies as part of remarketing activities we conduct with <strong>Google Adwords</strong> and/or other third-party vendors (For example SiteScout or Adroll), to help provide you with relevant promotional offers as you use the Internet.<br><br>
	
	As part of these remarketing activities, these third-party cookies may record your visits to our Websites and web sites visited prior to using our Websites.<br><br>
	
	Such cookies can then be used to serve advertisements to you on other web sites.<br><br>
	
	You may choose to be exempt from the use of Google remarketing cookies at the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.google.com/settings/ads/plugin">Google advertising privacy page</a>.<br><br>
	
	Alternatively, you may opt-out of remarketing on the Google network and similar networks at the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp">Network Advertising Initiative opt out page</a>.<br><br>
	
	Opting out will not prevent advertisements from being served to you on the Internet; it will only affect advertisements that utilize remarketing cookies to serve advertisements on the specified advertising networks.<br><br>
	
	We are not responsible for the activities of other parties that may not comply with your opt-out requests.</p>

	<b>
	<h2>Third Party Sites And Advertisements</h2>
	</b>
	<p>imhv.com expects its partners, advertisers and affiliates to 
	respect the privacy of our users. <br><br>
	
	Be aware, however, that third parties, 
	including our partners, advertisers, affiliates and other content providers 
	accessible through our site, may have their own privacy and data collection 
	policies and practices.<br><br>

	that is actually created or hosted by a third party.<br><br>
	
	Also, through 
	imhv.com you may be introduced to, or be able to access, information, Web 
	sites, features, contests or sweepstakes offered by other parties. <br><br>

	imhv.com is not responsible for the actions or policies of such third 
	parties.<br><br>
	
	You should check the applicable privacy policies of those third parties 
	when providing information on a feature or page operated by a third party.</p>
	<p>While on our site, our advertisers, promotional partners or other third 
	parties may use cookies or other technology to attempt to identify some of your 
	preferences or retrieve information about you.<br><br>
	
	For example, some of our 
	advertising is served by third parties and may include cookies that enable the 
	advertiser to determine whether you have seen a particular advertisement before. <br><br>

	Other features available on our site may offer services operated by third 
	parties and may use cookies or other technology to gather information.<br><br>
	
	imhv.com does not control the use of this technology by third parties or the 
	resulting information, and is not responsible for any actions or policies of 
	such third parties.</p>

	<p>You should also be aware that if you voluntarily disclose Personally 
	Identifiable Information on message boards or in chat areas, that information 
	can be viewed publicly and can be collected and used by third parties without 
	our knowledge and may result in unsolicited messages from other individuals or 
	third parties. Such activities are beyond the control of imhv.com 
	and this policy.</p>

	was collected.</p>
	<b>
