<h1>Privacy Policy | Buying Art Prints Online</h1>

<p>Last Updated:  May 23, 2006</p>
<p>At ImageKind we are committed to protecting your personal information and your privacy is very important to us.  We have implemented this policy to inform you of the information we collect from you and how we use that information.  By visiting ImageKind.com you expressly consent to our collection, storage, use, and disclosure of your personal information as described in this Privacy Policy in this Privacy Policy and to our Terms of Use.  </p>

<h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
<p>We may occasionally revise this Privacy Policy to reflect changes in our services and from customer feedback.  When any changes are made to this Privacy Policy, we will revise the “last updated” date at the top of this statement.  If there are material changes to this Privacy Policy, we will notify you by prominently posting a notice on our site or by directly sending you a notification to the email address you have registered on our site.  We recommend you regularly review this Privacy Policy for any updates or changes. </p>

<h2>What Information Do We Collect?</h2>
<p>You may browse the site without telling us who you are or revealing any information about yourself.  Once you register on site you are no longer anonymous to us.  When you place an order, we ask you to provide personal information such as your name, mailing address, billing address, telephone number, email address, credit card number and its expiration date.  If you are ordering for the first time, we also require that you choose a user name and password so we can create your account.  When you sell artwork on ImageKind we may also ask you for your Federal Tax ID number or your Social Security number so we may pay your earnings on any items sold.  Finally, we also maintain a history of the products you have ordered.    All of the information gained through this process may be used by ImageKind, as well as providers of related services, in order to process your transaction.  </p>
<p>We may also collect information about your visit, including the pages you view, the links you click, and other actions taken in connection with the ImageKind site or services.  We also collect information that your browser sends to every website you visit, such as your IP address, browser type and language, access times, and referring Web site addresses.</p>

<p>When you receive newsletters or promotional emails from ImageKind, we may use web beacons, customized links or similar technologies to determine whether the email has been opened and which links you click on in order to provide more focused email communications or other information.</p>

<h2>How Do We Use Your Personal Information?</h2>

We may also use your personal information to communicate with you.  We may send certain mandatory service communications such as welcome letters, billing reminders, information on technical service issues, and security announcements.  We may also occasionally send you product surveys or promotional mailings to inform you of other product or services available from ImageKind.</p>

<h2>Will We Share Your Personal Information?</h2>
<p>ImageKind will not disclose your personal information to third parties without your consent.  We will not sell, trade, or rent your personal information to outside parties.

<p>We may occasionally hire other companies to provide limited services on our behalf, such as handling the processing of delivery of mailings, providing customer support, hosting websites, processing transactions, or performing statistical analysis of our services.  Those companies will be permitted to obtain only the personal information they need to deliver the service.  They are required to maintain the confidentiality of the information and are prohibited from using it for any other purpose.</p>

<h2>How Do We Protect Your Personal Information?</h2>
<p>ImageKind is committed to protecting the security of your personal information.  We protect the security of your information during transmission by using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software, which encrypts sensitive information you input.    </p>

<p>If a password is used to help protect your account and personal information, it is your responsibility to keep your password confidential.  Do not share this information with anyone.  If you are sharing a computer with anyone you should always choose to log out before leaving the site to protect access to your information from subsequent users.</p>

<h2>How can account information be changed or updated?</h2>
<p>You may view and edit your personal information online.  In order to prevent information form being view by others, you will be required to sign in with your email address and password.  After signing in, go to the Account Info and/or Earnings tab to update your information.  </p>
