        <p>
            Last Updated: May 23, 2006</p>
        <p>
            At Imagekind we are committed to protecting your personal information and your privacy
            is very important to us. We have implemented this policy to inform you of the information
            we collect from you and how we use that information. By visiting Imagekind.com you
            expressly consent to our collection, storage, use, and disclosure of your personal
            information as described in this Privacy Policy and to our Terms of Use.
        </p>
        <h2>
            Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>
            We may occasionally revise this Privacy Policy to reflect changes in our services
            and from customer feedback. When any changes are made to this Privacy Policy, we
            will revise the “last updated” date at the top of this statement. If there are material
            changes to this Privacy Policy, we will notify you by prominently posting a notice
            on our site or by directly sending you a notification to the email address you have
            registered on our site. We recommend you regularly review this Privacy Policy for
            any updates or changes.
        </p>
        <h2>
            What Information Do We Collect?</h2>
        <p>
            You may browse the site without telling us who you are or revealing any information
            about yourself. Once you register on the site you are no longer anonymous to us.
            When you place an order, we ask you to provide personal information such as your
            name, mailing address, billing address, telephone number, email address, credit
            card number and its expiration date. If you are ordering for the first time, we
            also require that you choose a user name and password so we can create your account.
            When you sell artwork on Imagekind we may also ask you for your Federal Tax ID number
            or your Social Security number so we may pay your earnings on any items sold. Finally,
            we also maintain a history of the products you have ordered. All of the information
            gained through this process may be used by Imagekind, as well as providers of related
            services, in order to process your transaction.
        </p>
        <p>
            We may also collect information about your visit, including the pages you view,
            the links you click, and other actions taken in connection with the Imagekind site
            or services. We also collect information that your browser sends to every website
            you visit, such as your IP address, browser type and language, access times, and
            referring Web site addresses.</p>
        <p>
            When you receive newsletters or promotional emails from Imagekind, we may use web
            beacons, customized links or similar technologies to determine whether the email
            has been opened and which links you click on in order to provide more focused email
            communications or other information.</p>
        <h2>
            How Do We Use Your Personal Information?</h2>
        <p>
            We collect your personal information to carry out the transactions you have requested.
            Our goal is to provide you with a safe and efficient experience on our site. We
            may also use your information to provide you with more effective customer service,
            customize, measure, and improve our product, services, and technologies. We may
            also use your personal information to communicate with you. We may send certain
            mandatory service communications such as welcome letters, billing reminders, information
            on technical service issues, and security announcements. We may also occasionally
            send you product surveys or promotional mailings to inform you of other product
            or services available from Imagekind.</p>
        <h2>
            Will We Share Your Personal Information?</h2>
        <p>

            consent. We will not sell, trade, or rent your personal information to outside parties.
            Imagekind may release account information when we believe, in good faith, that such
            release is reasonably necessary to (i)comply with the law, (ii) enforce or apply
            the terms of any of our user agreements or (iii) protect the rights, property, or
            safety of Imagekind, our users or others.
        </p>
        <p>
            We may occasionally hire other companies to provide limited services on our behalf,
            such as handling the processing of delivery of mailings, providing customer support,
            hosting websites, processing transactions, or performing statistical analysis of
            our services. Those companies will be permitted to obtain only the personal information
            they need to deliver the service. They are required to maintain the confidentiality
            of the information and are prohibited from using it for any other purpose.</p>
        <h2>
            How Do We Protect Your Personal Information?</h2>

            Sockets Layer (SSL) software, which encrypts sensitive information you input.
        </p>
        <p>
            If a password is used to help protect your account and personal information, it
            is your responsibility to keep your password confidential. Do not share this information
            with anyone. If you are sharing a computer with anyone you should always choose
            to log out before leaving the site to protect access to your information from subsequent
            users.</p>
        <h2>
            How can account information be changed or updated?</h2>
        <p>
            You may view and edit your personal information online. In order to prevent information
            form being view by others, you will be required to sign in with your email address
            and password. After signing in, go to the Account Info and/or Earnings tab to update
            your information.
        </p>
        <h2>

            You can stop the delivery of future promotional email from Imagekind sites and services

            we have this option?)</p>
