									<p class="heading">PRIVACY STATEMENT</p>
									<p>Microsoft is committed to protecting your privacy. This privacy statement 
										explains data collection and use practices of the ImagineCup site (the "Site") 
										hosted for Microsoft by Smooth Fusion; it does not apply to other online or 
										offline Microsoft sites, products or services. By accessing the Site, you are 
										consenting to the information collection and use practices described in this 
										privacy statement. </p>
									<p class="heading">Collecting Your Personal Information</p>
									We will ask you when we need information that personally identifies you 
									(personal information) or allows us to contact you to provide a service or 
									carry out a transaction that you have requested such as requesting information 
									about Microsoft products and services, entering a contest, ordering e-mail 
									newsletters, joining a limited-access premium site, signing up for an event or 
									training, or when purchasing and/or registering Microsoft products. The 
									personal information we collect includes your name, title, company or 
									organization name, work e-mail, work phone, work or home address, information 
									about your job function, information about your company, and credit card 
									information.
									<p></p>
									<p>The Site may collect certain anonymous information about your visit, such as the 
										name of the Internet service provider and the Internet Protocol (IP) address 
										through which you access the Internet; the date and time you access the Site; 
										the pages that you access while at the Site and the Internet address of the Web 
										site from which you linked directly to our site. This information is used to 
										help improve the Site, analyze trends, and administer the Site.</p>
									<p class="heading">Use of Your Personal Information</p>
									The personal information collected on this Site will be used to operate the 
									Site and to provide the service(s) or carry out the transaction(s) you have 
									requested or authorized.
									<p></p>
									<p>In support of these uses, Microsoft may use personal information to provide you 
										with more effective customer service, to improve the Site and any related 
										Microsoft products or services, and to make the Site easier to use by 
										eliminating the need for you to repeatedly enter the same information or by 
										customizing the Site to your particular preference or interests.
									</p>
									<p>We may use your personal information to provide you with important information 
										about the product or service that you are using, including critical updates and 
										notifications. Additionally, with your permission, we may send you information 
										about other Microsoft products and services, and/or share information with 
										Microsoft partners so they may send you information about their products and 
										services.
									</p>
									<p>Microsoft occasionally hires other companies to provide limited services on our 
										behalf, such as Web site hosting, packaging, mailing and delivering prizes, 
										answering customer questions about products and services, and sending 
										information about our products, special offers, and other new services. We will 
										only provide those companies the personal information they need to deliver the 
										service. They are required to maintain the confidentiality of the information 
										and are prohibited from using that information for any other purpose.</p>
									<p>Microsoft may disclose personal information if required to do so by law or in 
										the good faith belief that such action is necessary to (a) conform to the 
										edicts of the law or comply with legal process served on Microsoft or the Site; 
										(b) protect and defend the rights or property of Microsoft and our family of 
										Web sites; or (c) act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of 
										Microsoft employees or agents, users of Microsoft products or services, or 
										members of the public.</p>
									<p>Personal information collected on the Site may be stored and processed in the 
										United States or any other country in which Microsoft or its affiliates, 
										subsidiaries or agents maintain facilities, and by using the Site, you consent 
										to any such transfer of information outside of your country. Microsoft abides 
										by the safe harbor framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce 
										regarding the collection, use, and retention of data from the European Union.
									</p>
									<p class="heading">Control of Your Personal Information</p>
									Except as otherwise described in this statement, personal information you 
									provide on the Site will not be shared outside of Microsoft and its controlled 
									subsidiaries and affiliates without your permission. 
									<p></p>
									<p>Please be aware that this privacy statement and any choices you make on the Site 
										will not necessarily apply to personal information you may have provided to 
										Microsoft in the context of other, separately operated, Microsoft products or 
										services.
									</p>
									<p class="heading">Access to Your Personal Information</p>
									Customer information is collected by Smooth Fusion, a Microsoft vendor. It is 
									stored at Smooth Fusion, plus sent back to Microsoft. You can review and edit 
									the personal information and any contact preferences provided at the Site by

									<p class="heading">Security of Your Personal Information</p>
									Microsoft is committed to protecting the security of your personal information. 
									We use a variety of security technologies and procedures to help protect your 
									personal information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. For example, 
									we store the personal information you provide on computer servers with limited 
									access that are located in controlled facilities. Additionally, when we 
									transmit sensitive personal information (such as a credit card number) over the 
									Internet, we protect it through the use of encryption, such as the Secure 
									Socket Layer (SSL) protocol. 
									<p></p>
									<p class="heading">Cookies</p>
									We use cookies on this Site to ensure the integrity of the registration process 
									and to personalize the Site. A cookie is a small text file that is placed on 
									your hard disk by a Web page server. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or 
									deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you, and can 
									only be read by a Web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you.
									<p></p>
									<p>One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to 
										save you time. For example, if you personalize a web page, or navigate within a 
										site, a cookie helps the site to recall your specific information on subsequent 
										visits. This simplifies the process of delivering relevant content, eases site 
										navigation, and so on. When you return to the web site, the information you 
										previously provided can be retrieved, so you can easily use the site's features 
										that you customized.</p>
									<p>You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most web browsers 
										automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting 
										to decline cookies if you prefer. If you choose to decline cookies, you may not 
										be able to fully experience the interactive features of this or other web sites 
										you visit.
									</p>
									<p class="heading">Use of Microsoft Passport</p>
									This Site uses .NET Passport to provide sign-in and registration services. In 
									order to sign in to this Site using .NET Passport, you will be asked to type 
									your e-mail address and a password. This same Passport sign-in allows you to 
									access many other Passport participating sites and services. If you create a 
									.NET Passport at this site, you are simultaneously registering with ImagineCup 
									and opening a .NET Passport account. To learn more about the Passport service, 
									the information stored in the Passport profile, and how Passport uses and helps 
									to protect your personal information, please read the .NET Passport privacy 
									statement at <a href="http://www.passport.net/Consumer/PrivacyPolicy.asp?PPlcid=1033">
										http://www.passport.net/Consumer/PrivacyPolicy.asp?PPlcid=1033</a>.
									<p></p>
									<p class="heading">Changes to This Privacy Statement<br>
										We may occasionally update this privacy statement. When we do, we will also 
										revise the "last updated" date at the top of the privacy statement. For 
										material changes to this privacy statement, we will notify you either by 
										placing a prominent notice on the home page of our web site or by directly 
										sending you a notification. We encourage you to periodically review this 
										privacy statement to stay informed about how we are helping to protect the 
										personal information we collect. Your continued use of the service constitutes 
										your agreement to this privacy statement and any updates. </p>
									<p class="heading">Contact Information</p>
									Microsoft welcomes your comments regarding this privacy statement. If you 
									believe that Microsoft has not adhered to this privacy statement, please 
									contact us by e-mail at hosting@smoothfusion.com or via postal mail at the 
									address provided below, and we will use commercially reasonable efforts to 
									promptly determine and remedy the problem.
