<p><strong>Information Collected Automatically</strong></p>
<p>In addition to information you submit to us, we may collect certain information using automated tools such as cookies, web beacons, and web server logs (collectively “Tracking Technologies”). The types of information we collect automatically may include IP addresses, device identifiers, browser characteristics, operating system details, language preferences, referring URLs, timing and length of visits, and pages viewed.</p>
<p>· <strong>Cookies:</strong>A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user’s device, which may be session ID cookies or tracking cookies. Session cookies make it easier for you to navigate the Site and expire when you close your browser. Tracking cookies remain longer and help in understanding how you use the Site, and enhance your user experience. Cookies may remain on your hard drive for an extended period of time. If you use your browser’s method of blocking or removing cookies, some but not all types of cookies may be deleted and/or blocked and as a result some features and functionalities of the Site may not work. A Flash cookie (or locally shared object) is a data file which may be placed on a device via the Adobe Flash plug-in that may be built-in to or downloaded by you to your device. HTML5 cookies can be programmed through HTML5 local storage. Flash cookies and HTML 5 cookies are locally stored on your device other than in the browser and browser settings won’t control them. To identify certain types of local shared objects on your computer and adjust your settings, please visit: <a href="http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager.html">www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager.html</a>. The Site may associate some or all of these types of cookies with your devices.</p>
<p>· <strong>Web Beacons (“Tracking Pixels”): </strong>Web beacons are small graphic images, also known as “Internet tags” or “clear gifs,” embedded in web pages and e-mail messages. Web beacons may be used, without limitation, to count the number of visitors to the Site, to monitor how users navigate the Site, and to count content views.</p>
<p>· <strong>Embedded Scripts: </strong>An embedded script is programming code designed to collect information about your interactions with the Site. It is temporarily downloaded onto your computer from Image’s web server, or from a third party with which Image works, and is active only while you are connected to the Site, and deleted or deactivated thereafter.</p>
<p>We may combine certain automatically-collected information with other information we obtain about you, which may include information we obtain from third parties. </p>
<p>Information about your use of this Site and other online services may be collected across time, devices, and websites, and used for numerous purposes including to associate different devices you use and to deliver relevant and/or retargeted content, including interest-based ads.</p>
<p><strong>Information We Obtain From Partners and Other Sources</strong></p>
<p>We also may obtain information about you from other sources and combine that information with information you provide to us directly or that we collect automatically through the Site.</p>
<p><strong>Sweepstakes, Contests and Promotions</strong></p>
<p>We may offer sweepstakes, contests, and other promotions (each, a “Promotion”), including Promotions jointly sponsored or offered by third parties, which may require submitting personal information. If you voluntarily choose to enter a Promotion, your information, including personal information, may be disclosed to Image, co-sponsors, service providers, and other third parties, including for administrative purposes and as required by law (e.g., on a winners list). By entering, you are agreeing to the official rules that govern that Promotion, which may include consent to additional or differing data practices from those contained in this Privacy Policy. Please review those rules carefully.</p>
<p><strong>Social Features, Advertising, and Analytics</strong></p>
<p>Certain functionalities on the Site permit interactions that you initiate between the Site and third-party services, such as social networks (“Social Features”). Examples of Social Features include features enabling you to send content such as contacts and photos between the Site and a third-party service; “liking” or “sharing” our content; and features that otherwise connect the Site to a third-party service (e.g., to pull or push information to or from the Site). If you use Social Features, and potentially other third-party services, information you post or provide access to may be publicly displayed by the third-party service you use. Also, both Image and the third party may have access to certain information about you and your use of the Site and the third-party service.</p>

<p><strong>Ability to Opt Out of Analytics and Interest-Based Advertising </strong></p>
<p>You may exercise choices regarding the use of cookies from Google Analytics <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout">by visiting this page</a>or downloading the Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on. You may exercise choices regarding the use of cookies from Adobe Analytics by going to <a href="http://www.adobe.com/privacy/opt-out.html"><strong>http://www.adobe.com/privacy/opt-out.html</strong></a>under the section labeled “Tell our customers not to measure your use of their websites or tailor their online ads for you.” </p>
<p>You may choose whether to receive some Interest-based Advertising by submitting opt-outs. Some of the advertisers and Service Providers that perform advertising-related services for us and third parties may participate in the Digital Advertising Alliance’s (“<strong>DAA</strong>”) Self-Regulatory Program for Online Behavioral Advertising. To learn more about how you can exercise certain choices regarding Interest-based Advertising, visit <a href="http://www.aboutads.info/choices/"><strong>http://www.aboutads.info/choices/</strong></a>, and <a href="http://www.aboutads.info/appchoices"><strong>http://www.aboutads.info/appchoices</strong></a>for information on the DAA’s opt-out program for mobile apps. Some of these companies may also be members of the Network Advertising Initiative (“<strong>NAI</strong>”). To learn more about the NAI and your opt-out options for their members, see <strong>http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/</strong>. Please be aware that, even if you are able to opt out of certain kinds of Interest-based Advertising, you may continue to receive other types of ads. Opting out only means that those selected members should no longer deliver certain Interest-based Advertisingto you, but does not mean you will no longer receive any targeted content and/or ads (<em>e.g.</em>, from other ad networks). Also, if your browsers are configured to reject cookies when you visit these opt-out webpages, or you subsequently erase your cookies, use a different device or web browser or use a non-browser-based method of access (<em>e.g.</em>, mobile app),your NAI / DAA browser-based opt-out may not, or may no longer, be effective. We support the ad industry’s <ins>2009 Self-regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising</ins> expects that ad networks we directly engage to serve you Interest-based Advertisingwill do so as well, though we cannot guaranty their compliance. We arenot responsible for effectiveness of, or compliance with, any third-parties’ opt-out options or programs or the accuracy of their statements regarding their programs.</p>
<p>In addition, we may serve ads on third-party services that are targeted to reach people on those services that are also identified on one of more of our data bases (“Matched List Ads”). This is done by matching common factors between our data bases and the data bases of the third-party services. For instance, we may use such ad services offered by Facebook or Twitter and other third-party services. We are not responsible for these third-party services, including without limitation their security of the data. If we use Facebook to serve Matched List Ads on Facebook services, you should be able to hover over the box in the right corner of such a Facebook ad and find out how to opt-out with us from such list. If you opt-out from our Facebook Matched List Ads, we will remove the matching Personal Information from that list, however, this will not take effect immediately and if you have multiple e-mails or other accounts you may have to opt-out separately for each one. We are not responsible for such third parties’ failure to comply with your or our opt-out instructions or to provide us notice of your opt-out elections, and they may change their options without notice to us or you.</p>
