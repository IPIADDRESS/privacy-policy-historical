Getty Images and image.net respects your ability to make informed choices about the collection and uses of your personal information. This privacy policy tells you about our online collection and use of information that identifies you personally so that you can make an informed choice about using image.net’s publicity and marketing services (the "Services") through the websites www.image.net, www.imagenet.co.uk, www.ximage.net or www.image-net. (the "Websites"). The terms of this policy apply to the Websites and sub-domains, unless different terms are specified in a form or contract provided to you online or offline. Users should also refer to the terms and conditions of service for additional information. Those terms and conditions take precedence over this policy, and apply to all businesses, including sole proprietorships and other small-business enterprises. Websites we may link to, including but not limited to the sites of  third-party content partners, may have different privacy policies and practices from those disclosed here. We assume no responsibility for the policies or practices of such linked sites and encourage you to become acquainted with them.</td></tr>

By using any of the Websites, you understand and agree that (1) that the information collected from the Website may be retained indefinitely, and may be stored, accessed and used in jurisdictions whose privacy laws may be different and less protective than those of your home jurisdiction (e.g. if you are located in the European Economic Area, image.net may need to transfer your personal data outside the European Economic Area as part of the provision of the Services); (2) image.net may use this information for a variety of purposes, including direct marketing.  As part of this direct marketing, image.net may use your personal data to send you a newsletter via email.

These companies do not retain, share, store or use personally identifiable information for any other purposes; (4) image.net may use your personal data to provide and administrate the Services. In particular, image.net may use your personal data to verify your identity at different times during your use of any of the Services ("Verification"). This may involve making calls to your telephone number and/or sending you email. image.net may pass your personal data to persons ("Owners") who have placed materials on the image.net system in order to carry out Verification. You expressly agree to this use and transfer of personal data and to such calls and emails for the purpose of Verification; (5) image.net may use your personal data to monitor how you use the Services.  When you use any Website, image.net will report such use to the relevant Owner.  You expressly agree to image.net using and disclosing your personal data to do this.
