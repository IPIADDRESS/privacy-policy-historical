As a consequence, we have established the current Policy of Confidentiality to explain you the way in which we use your Personal Data as well as all the precautions that we take to maintain confidentiality and security. When accessing to our Websites and using our services, you agree with the collection of your Personal Data and the practices described in this Policy of Confidentiality, in which we sometimes bring modifications. If we decide to modify our Policy of Confidentiality, we upload the new version on our Web sites, by updating the date contained in its last paragraph. You are invited to consult the present Policy of Confidentiality from time to time in order to be informed about possible modifications. The terms of this Policy of Confidentiality do not include any damage to the provisions of a possible contract which you could have concluded with us and which prevails upon the terms of this Policy of Confidentiality.</p><h4>1. Commitment of Confidentiality</h4><p>DIGIDNA does not collect and does not process any Personal Data that you did not provide us specifically, voluntarily and consciously. We guarantee you that our staff complies with the strict standards of safety and confidentiality and we ensure you that the processing of your Personal Data is carried out with total respect of the international legislations recognized on the data protection.</p><h4>2. Purpose of using Personal Data</h4><p>The majority of our services do not require any suscription, which enables you to visit our Websites without telling us who you are. However, certain services may require a suscription. When you subscribe, you may be asked to fill-in certain fields in forms (some of them are mandatory, other are optional), and to choose a user name and a password. In these conditions, if you decide to refuse to provide us with the Personal Data that we request from you, the access to certain parts of our Websites may be denied and it may be impossible for us to answer your request.<br> DIGIDNA only collects and process your Personal Data for specific and limited needs, about which we inform you when you wish to use certain services offered on our Websites. For example, we must collect and use your Personal Data to provide you with our services, to invoice those which you request, to market other ones that we believe are likely to interest you, to send you newsletters or to communicate with you for any other purpose. In addition, we can use your Personal Data for assessing the efficiency of our services and improving them, for the benefit of our visitors and our customers, for our internal statistics or other requirements of our business, for assessing the interest of our customers, just as to study the purchase behavior and the trends of our customers, and for better defining the development of our services. By forwarding us your Personal Data, you grant this use explicitly. DIGIDNA only keeps your Personal Data during the time required for the achievement of these purposes and in accordance with the legal or ethics requirements in relation with the obligations of information and the storage of the documents.</p><h4>3. Nondisclosure of information</h4><p>DIGIDNA never sells, rents, shares or spreads your Personal Data with third parties in whatever manner, except if legal dispositions or administrative regulations require it. However, these Personal Data can occasionally be forwarded to third parties, which act with the name or on behalf of DIGIDNA, or to other partners of DIGIDNA, with a view to carry out other processing in accordance with the purposes for which they were collected. When the disclosure of Personal Data to third parties is useful or necessary for any reason, DIGIDNA checks that these third parties have established a protection level of the data equivalent to its own level of protection and, if necessary, DIGIDNA requires a contractual guarantee that these third parties will exclusively process Personal Data with the authorized purpose from your part, with all necessary discretion and safety.</p><h4>4.

The access to Personal Data is restricted to our employees who need to know them and who have been trained with the observation of strict standards of confidentiality in the processing of your Personal Data. However, although we tried to create safe, reliable and trustful websites for of our visitors, we remind you that the Internet is generally not regarded as a completely sure environment, and as a consequence that the confidentiality of Personal Data provided by you or elements forwarded by our Web sites or e-mail cannot be guaranteed by DIGIDNA.
