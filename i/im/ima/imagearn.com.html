                        (1) the IP (Internet Protocol) address of the computer that
                        downloaded the webpage on which the Web beacon appears; (2) the URL
                        (Uniform Resource Locator) of the webpage on which the Web beacon
                        appears; (3) the time the webpage containing the Web beacon was

                        the identification number of any cookie on the computer previously

                        through HTML capable email, Web beacons let us know whether you
