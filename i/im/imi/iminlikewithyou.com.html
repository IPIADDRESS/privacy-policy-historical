<p>
Biosocia, Inc. ("OMGPOP") knows that you care about how your personal information is used and shared, and we take 

your privacy seriously.  Please read the following to learn more about our privacy policy.  By visiting the OMGPOP 

website located at http://www.omgpop.com (the "Site"), you are accepting the practices outlined in this Privacy 

Policy.
</p>
<p><b>
What Does This Privacy Policy Cover?
</b>
<br>
This Privacy Policy covers OMGPOP's treatment of personal information that OMGPOP gathers when you are on the Site 

and when you use OMGPOP's services (the "Services").  This policy also covers OMGPOP's treatment of any personal 

information that OMGPOP's business partners share with OMGPOP.
<br>
<br>
This policy does not apply to the practices of third parties that OMGPOP does not own or control, or to individuals 

that OMGPOP does not employ or manage.

<br>
<br>
What Personal Information About Customers Does OMGPOP Collect?

<br>
<br>
Our primary goal in collecting personal information is to provide you with a friendly, customized, and efficient 

experience.  We collect the following types of information from our users:
</p>
<p><b>
Information You Provide to Us
</b>
<br>
We receive and store any information you enter on the Site or provide to us in any other way. You can choose not to 

provide us with certain information, but then you may not be able to take advantage of many of our Site's features. 

 The personal information you provide is used for such purposes as responding to your requests for certain 

services, customizing the content and advertising you see, and communicating with you about specials, surveys and 

new products and services.  In order for you to use our Site, you are not required to register; however, you must 

register to take advantage of certain features of the Site.  To register, you must provide your e-mail address, a 

username and password, your age and gender.  We may also request demographic information and unique identifiers in 

order to provide you with a more personalized service, but this information is optional.
</p>
<p><b>
Automatic Information
</b>
<br>
  
We receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact with us.  OMGPOP automatically receives and 

records certain "traffic data" on our server logs from your browser including your IP address, OMGPOP cookie 

information, and the page you requested.  OMGPOP uses this traffic data to help diagnose problems with its server, 

analyze trends and administer the Site.
  
<br>
<br>
Generally, our service automatically collects usage information, such as the numbers and frequency of visitors to 

our Site and its components, similar to TV ratings that indicate how many people watched a particular show.  This 

data is only used in the aggregate.  This type of collective data enables us to figure out how often customers use 

parts of the Site, so we can make the Site appealing to as many users as possible.  In addition, we may provide 

statistical information, not information about you personally, to our partners about how our users, collectively, 

use our Site.   We share this type of statistical data so that our partners also understand how often people use 

their areas and our Site, so that they, too, may provide you with an optimal web experience.

</p>
<p><b>
E-mail Communications
</b>
<br>
We may receive a confirmation when you open an e-mail from OMGPOP if your computer supports this type of program, 

in order to help us make e-mails more interesting and helpful. We also send out e-mails with news or promotions.  

If you do not want to receive e-mail from us, please contact us at iilwy@iilwy.com
</p>
<p><b>
Information From Other Sources
</b>
<br>
For purposes such as improving personalization of our service, we may receive information about you from other 

sources and add it to our account information.  Like the information you provide to us, we do not share this 

information with anyone except authorized third parties in connection with providing you with our Service.
</p>
<p><b>
What about Cookies?
</b>
<br>
  
Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer's hard drive through your Web browser to 

enable our systems to recognize your browser and tell us how and when pages in our Site are visited and by how many 

people.  OMGPOP cookies do not collect personal information, and we do not combine information collected through 

cookies with other personal information to tell us who you are or what your username or e-mail address is.
  
<br>
<br>
The "help" portion of the toolbar on the majority of browsers will direct you on how to prevent your browser from 

accepting new cookies, how to command the browser to tell you when you receive a new cookie, or how to fully 

disable cookies.  We strongly recommend that you leave the cookies activated, however, because cookies enable you 

to take advantage of some of OMGPOP's most attractive features.
  
<br>
<br>
Some of our business partners may use cookies on our Site (for example, advertisers).  However, we have no access 

to or control over these cookies.

</p>
<p><b>
Will OMGPOP Share Any of the Information it Receives?
</b>
<br>
Information about our users is an integral part of our business.  We neither rent nor sell your personal 

information to anyone.  We share your personal information only as described below.

<br>
<br>
Affiliated Business We Do Not Control

<br>In certain situations, OMGPOP may provide services, or sell products jointly with affiliated businesses, 

including on the Site.  We will share customer information that is related to such transactions with that 

affiliated business. We require our affiliates to provide the same level of privacy protection that we do and they 

do not have the right to share or use personal information for any purpose other than for an authorized 

transaction.

<br>
<br>
Agents
<br>
We employ other companies and people to perform tasks on our behalf and need to share your information with them to 

provide products or services to you.  Examples include analyzing data, providing marketing assistance, and 

providing customer service.  Our agents subscribe to the same level of privacy protection as we do. Unless we tell 

you differently, OMGPOP's agents do not have any right to use the personal information we share with them beyond 

what is necessary to assist us.

<br>

<br>Information You Post
<br>
When you post messages or add information or photos to your OMGPOP profile, those messages, information, and 

photos, along with your OMGPOP username, are visible to other users. If you post personal information online that 

is accessible to the public, you may receive unsolicited messages from other parties in return.  OMGPOP may share 

aggregated demographic information with business partners.

<br>
<br>
Business Transfers
<br>
In some cases, we may choose to buy or sell assets.  In these types of transactions, customer information is 

typically one of the business assets that is transferred.  Moreover, if OMGPOP, or substantially all of its assets, 

were acquired, customer information would be one of the assets that is transferred.

<br>
<br>
Protection of OMGPOP and Others
<br>
We may release personal information when we believe in good faith that release is necessary to comply with the law; 

enforce or apply our conditions of use and other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of OMGPOP, 

our employees, our users, or others.  OMGPOP may disclose personal information to parties in compliance with 

OMGPOP's Copyright Policy, as OMGPOP in its sole discretion believes necessary or appropriate in connection with an 

investigation of fraud, intellectual property infringement, piracy, or other unlawful activity. In such events, 

OMGPOP may disclose name, street address, city, state, zip code, country, phone number, and e-mail address.

<br>
<br>
With Your Consent
<br>
Except as set forth above, you will be notified when your personal information may be shared with third parties.
</p>
<p><b>
Is Information About Me Secure?
</b>
<br>
  
<br>
Your OMGPOP account information is protected by a password for your privacy and security.  You need to work to 

protect against unauthorized access to your password and to your computer by signing off once you have finished 

using a shared computer.
  
<br>
<br>
We use industry-standard Secure Socket Layer (SSL) software to protect the security of your personal information 

during transmission, which encrypts all of the information you input.
  
<br>
<br>
Only employees who need personal information to perform a specific job (for example, a customer service 

representative) are granted access to it.  All of our employees are kept up to date on our privacy and security 

practices.

</p>
<p><b>
What Information Can I Access?
</b>
<br>
OMGPOP allows you to access the following information about you for the singular purpose of viewing, and in certain 

situations, updating that information.
  
<br>
<br>
You are able to add or update certain information. When you update information, however, we often maintain a copy 

of the unrevised information in our records.
  
<br>
<br>
You may request deletion of your OMGPOP account by sending an e-mail to iilwy@iilwy.com.  Please note that some 

information may remain in our records after deletion of your account.
  
<br>
<br>
If you do not wish to receive e-mail or other mail from us, please e-mail us at iilwy@iilwy.com.  Please note that 

if you do not want to receive legal notices from us, such as this Privacy Policy, those legal notices will still 

govern your use of the Site, and you are responsible for reviewing such legal notices for changes.
  
<br>
<br>
As explained earlier, the "help" portion of the toolbar on the majority of browsers will direct you on how to 

prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to command the browser to tell you when you receive a new 

cookie, or how to fully disable cookies. Please note, however, that if do not allow cookies, you will not be able 

to take advantage of some of our features.
  
<br>
<br>
As stated previously, you can always opt not to disclose information, even though it may be needed to take 

advantage of certain OMGPOP features.

</p>
<p><b>
Can Children Use OMGPOP's Services?
</b>
<br>
OMGPOP is not intended for children under 13 years old. You must be over 13 to access the site.
</p>
<p><b>
Conditions of Use
</b>
<br>
If you decide to visit the Site, your visit and any possible dispute over privacy is subject to this Privacy Policy 

and our Terms and Conditions, including limitations on damages, arbitration of disputes, and application of New 

York state law.
</p>
<p><b>
Third Party Sites
</b>
<br>
The Site may permit you to link to other websites on the Internet, and other websites may contain links to the 

Site.  These other websites are not under OMGPOP's control.  The privacy and security practices of websites linked 

to or from the Site are not covered by this Privacy Policy, and OMGPOP is not responsible for the privacy or 

security practices or the content of such websites.
</p>
<p><b>
Changes to this Privacy Policy
</b>
<br>
OMGPOP may amend this Privacy Policy.  Use of information we collect now is subject to the Privacy Policy in effect 

at the time such information is used.  If we make changes to our privacy policy, we will notify you by posting an 

announcement on our Site so you are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what 

circumstances if any, it is disclosed.
</p>
<p><b>
Questions or Concerns
</b>
<br>
If you have any questions or concerns regarding privacy at OMGPOP, please send us a detailed message to 

iilwy@iilwy.com or to Biosocia, Inc., 49 Bleecker Street, Suite 404, New York, NY 10012 .  Your privacy is 

important to us and we will make every effort to resolve your concerns.
