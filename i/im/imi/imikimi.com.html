      Imikimi Zo Privacy Policies
    </h1>
    
    <h2>Our Commitment to Your Privacy</h2>
    
    <p>We are committed to helping you, our Imikimi Zo customer to</p>
    <ul>
      <li>share your positive contributions
      </li><li>express yourself creatively
      </li><li>discover and deepen your connection with others
      </li><li>easily and fully control your privacy
    </li></ul>
    
    <p>We charge you a small fee to make it possible to do those things. We do not sell or share your data with 3rd parties. That makes your privacy and your control over your digital social life SO much easier!</p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>You pay us to work for you, our customer.
      </li><li>Other, ad-supported sites get paid by 3rd parties you don’t even know, to package up all of the data of your digital life, for purposes you have little control over. You are not their customer, you are their product.
    </li></ul>
    
    <p>Note: We do work with 3rd party services, but we do so solely for the purpose of serving you. These services include, but are not limited to: data storage, servers, analytics, and contacting you.</p>
    
    <h2>You Control Your Privacy</h2>
    
    <p>We invented “Streams” so you could control your sharing and privacy for each group of people you interact with. Your profile picture, your display-name and whether or not you are a 'member' are publicly viewable. The rest of your privacy is control Stream-byStream. Currently, there are two kinds of Streams:</p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>Private Streams: By default, private streams are only viewable by you. You can share your private streams with others by sharing one or more posts from that Stream. Whomever you share a post with will be able to see and comment on any post in that same Stream. This allows you to choose, on a Stream-by-Stream basis, who sees your content.
      </li><li>Public Streams: Anybody can see your public Streams.
    </li></ul>
    
    <h2>Deleting and Changing Your Content</h2>
    
    <p>You can change your e-mail and your account name on your Profile page. You can delete Posts individually any time your are logged in, under the 3-dot menu when you are on the Post.
    
    </p><p>We are working on tools to help you delete Streams and your whole Account more easily. In the mean time, if you wish to delete your account, please contact us directly.
    You can delete individual Posts, and if it is the last post in a Stream, the Stream will be automatically deleted.
    
    </p><h2>Imikimi Privacy Policy Details</h2>
    
    <p>
      Imikimi LLC. ("Imikimi") recognizes that its customers, visitors, users,
      and others who use www.Imikimi.com or other web sites owned or operated
      by Imikimi (the "Imikimi Sites") (collectively or individually "Users")
      value their privacy. This Privacy Notice details important information
      regarding the use and disclosure of User information collected on the
      Imikimi Sites. Imikimi provides this Privacy Notice to help you make an
      informed decision about whether to use or continue using the Imikimi
      Sites.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      This Privacy Notice is incorporated into and is subject to the Imikimi
      Terms of Use. Your use of the Imikimi Sites and any personal information
      you provide on the Imikimi Sites remains subject to the terms of this
      Privacy Notice and our Terms of Use.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Please note that image, video, or other content posted at the direction
      of Users onto the Imikimi Sites becomes published content and is not
      considered personally identifiable information subject to this Privacy
      Notice.
    </p>
    
    <h2>The Information Imikimi Collects</h2>
    
    <p>
      User Provided Information: You provide certain personally identifiable
      information (such as your name and email address) to Imikimi when
      choosing to participate in various activities on the Imikimi Sites such
      as uploading images and photographs, customizing images, e-mailing
      images, posting messages, entering contests or sweepstakes, taking
      advantage of promotions, responding to surveys, or subscribing to
      newsletters or other mailing lists.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Cookies Information: When you visit the Imikimi Sites, we may send one or
      more cookies - a small text file containing a string of alphanumeric
      characters - to your computer that uniquely identifies your browser.
      Imikimi uses both session cookies and persistent cookies. A persistent
      cookie remains after you close your browser. Persistent cookies may be
      used by your browser on subsequent visits to the site. Persistent cookies
      can be removed by following your web browser help file directions. A
      session cookie is temporary and disappears after you close your browser.
      You can reset your web browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when
      a cookie is being sent. However, some features of the Imikimi Sites may
      not function properly if the ability to accept cookies is disabled.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Log File Information: When you use the Imikimi Sites, our servers
      automatically record certain information that your web browser sends
      whenever you visit any website. These server logs may include information
      such as your web request, Internet Protocol ("IP") address, browser type,
      browser language, referring / exit pages and URLs, platform type, number
      of clicks, domain names, landing pages, pages viewed and the order of
      those pages, the amount of time spent on particular pages, the date and
      time of your request, and one or more cookies that may uniquely identify
      your browser.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Clear GIFs Information: When you use the Imikimi Sites, we may employ
      "clear GIFs" (a.k.a. Web Beacons) which are used to track the online
      usage patterns of our Users anonymously (i.e., in a
      non-personally-identifiable manner). In addition, we may also use clear
      GIFs in HTML-based emails sent to our users to track which emails are
      opened by recipients.
    </p>
    
    <h2>The Way Imikimi Uses Information</h2>
    
    <p>
      If you submit personally identifiable information to us through the
      Imikimi Sites, then we use your personal information to operate,
      maintain, and provide to you the features and functionality of the
      Imikimi Sites.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Any personal information or image content that you voluntarily disclose
      online (on discussion boards, in messages and chat areas, within your
      public profile page, etc.) becomes publicly available and can be
      collected and used by others. Your account name (not your email address)
      is displayed to other Users when you upload and modify images or send
      messages through the Imikimi Sites and other Users can contact you
      through messages and comments. Any images that you submit to the Imikimi
      Sites may be redistributed through the internet and other media channels,
      and may be viewed by the general public.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      We do not use your email address or other personally identifiable
      information to send commercial or marketing messages without your consent
      or except as part of a specific program or feature for which you will
      have the ability to opt-in or opt-out. We may, however, use your email
      address without further consent for non-marketing or administrative
      purposes (such as notifying you of major Imikimi Site changes or for
      customer service purposes).
    </p>
    
    <p>
      We use both your personally identifiable information and certain
      non-personally-identifiable information (such as anonymous User usage
      data, cookies, IP addresses, browser type, clickstream data, etc.) to
      improve the quality and design of the Imikimi Sites and to create new
      features, promotions, functionality, and services by storing, tracking,
      and analyzing User preferences and trends.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      We use cookies, clear gifs, and log file information to: (a) remember
      information so that you will not have to re-enter it during your visit or
      the next time you visit the Imikimi Sites; (b) provide custom,
      personalized content and information; (c) monitor the effectiveness of
      our marketing campaigns; (d) monitor aggregate metrics such as total
      number of visitors, pages viewed, etc.; and (e) track your entries,
      submissions, and status in promotions, sweepstakes, and contests.
    </p>
    
    <h2>When Imikimi Discloses Information</h2>
    
    <p>
      We provide personally identifiable information and
      non-personally-identifiable information to our subsidiaries, affiliated
      companies, or other businesses or persons for the purpose of processing
      such information on our behalf. We require that these parties agree to
      process such information in compliance with our privacy policy, and we
      use reasonable efforts to limit their use of such information and to use
      other appropriate confidentiality and security measures.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      We do not share your personally identifiable information (such as name or
      email address) with other, third-party companies for their commercial or
      marketing use without your consent or except as part of a specific
      program or feature for which you will have the ability to opt-in or
      opt-out.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      We do share non-personally-identifiable information (such as anonymous
      User usage data, referring / exit pages and URLs, platform types, number
      of clicks, etc.) with interested third-parties to assist them in
      understanding the usage patterns for certain content, services,
      advertisements, promotions, and/or functionality on the Imikimi Sites.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      We may release personally identifiable information and/or
      non-personally-identifiable information if required to do so by law, or
      in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with
      state and federal laws (such as U.S. Copyright Law) or respond to a court
      order, subpoena, or search warrant.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Imikimi also reserves the right to disclose personally identifiable
      information and/or non-personally-identifiable information that Imikimi
      believes, in good faith, is appropriate or necessary to enforce our Terms
      of Use, take precautions against liability, to investigate and defend
      itself against any third-party claims or allegations, to assist
      government enforcement agencies, to protect the security or integrity of
      our web site, and to protect the rights, property, or personal safety of
      Imikimi, our Users or others.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Your Choices About Privacy</h2>
    
    <p>
      You may, of course, decline to submit personally identifiable information
      through the Imikimi Sites, in which case Imikimi may not be able to
      provide certain services to you. You may update or correct your personal
      profile information and email preferences at any time by visiting your
      account profile page. Please note that image and media files uploaded by
      Users to the Imikimi Sites cannot be removed and remain subject to our
      Terms of Use.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      To protect your privacy and security, we take reasonable steps (such as
      requesting a unique password) to verify your identity before granting you
      profile access or making corrections. You are responsible for maintaining
      the secrecy of your unique password and account information at all times.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Please contact Imikimi with any questions or comments about this Privacy
      Notice, your personal information, your consent, or your opt-in or
      opt-out choices using this contact form.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Third-party Advertisers, Links to Other Sites</h2>
    
    <p>
      Imikimi allows other companies, called third-party ad servers or ad
      networks, to serve advertisements within the Imikimi Sites. These
      third-party ad servers or ad networks use technology to send, directly to
      your browser, the advertisements and links that appear on the Imikimi
      Sites. They automatically receive your IP address when this happens. They
      may also use other technologies (such as cookies, JavaScript, or Web
      Beacons) to measure the effectiveness of their advertisements and to
      personalize the advertising content you see.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Imikimi does not provide any personally identifiable information to these
      third-party ad servers or ad networks without your consent or except as
      part of a specific program or feature for which you will have the ability
      to opt-in or opt-out. However, please note that if an advertiser asks
      Imikimi to show an advertisement to a certain audience (for example, women
      ages 25-34) or audience segment (for example, women ages 25-44 who have
      viewed certain channels of content) and you respond to that
      advertisement, the advertiser or ad-server may conclude that you fit the
      description of the audience they are trying to reach. The advertiser may
      also use information regarding your use of the Imikimi Sites, such as the
      number of times you viewed an ad (but not any personally identifiable
      information), to determine which ads to deliver to you.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      You should consult the respective privacy policies of these third-party
      ad servers or ad networks (see links below) for more information on their
      practices and for instructions on how to opt-out of certain practices.
      Imikimi's privacy policy does not apply to, and we cannot control the
      activities of, such other advertisers or web sites.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      For more information, please visit <a href="http://networkadvertising.org">http://networkadvertising.org</a>.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Currently, Imikimi has relationships with the following third-party ad
      servers or ad networks:
    </p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>

      </li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Our Commitment To Data Security</h2>
    
    <p>
      Imikimi uses commercially reasonable physical, managerial, and technical
      safeguards to preserve the integrity and security of your personal
      information. We cannot, however, ensure or warrant the security of any
      information you transmit to Imikimi and you do so at your own risk. Once
      we receive your transmission of information, Imikimi makes commercially
      reasonable efforts to ensure the security of our systems. However, please
      note that this is not a guarantee that such information may not be
      accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our
      physical, technical, or managerial safeguards.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      If Imikimi learns of a security systems breach, then we may attempt to
      notify you electronically so that you can take appropriate protective
      steps. Imikimi may post a notice on the Imikimi Sites if a security
      breach occurs. Depending on where you live, you may have a legal right to
      receive notice of a security breach in writing. To receive a free written
      notice of a security breach (or to withdraw your consent from receiving
      electronic notice) you should notify us using this contact form.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Our Commitment To Childrens' Privacy</h2>
    
    <p>
      Protecting the privacy of young children is especially important. For
      that reason, Imikimi does not knowingly collect or maintain personally
      identifiable information or non-personally-identifiable information on
      the Imikimi Sites from persons under 13 years of age, and no part of our
      website is directed to persons under 13. If you are under 13 years of
      age, then please do not use or access the Imikimi Sites at any time or in
      any manner. If Imikimi learns that personally identifiable information of
      persons under 13 years of age has been collected on the Imikimi Sites
      without verified parental consent, then Imikimi will take the appropriate
      steps to delete this information.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Special Note to International Users</h2>
    
    <p>
      The Imikimi Sites are hosted in the United States and are intended for
      and directed to Users in the United States. If you are a User accessing
      the Imikimi Sites from the European Union, Asia, or any other region with
      laws or regulations governing personal data collection, use, and
      disclosure, that differ from United States laws, please be advised that
      through your continued use of the Imikimi Sites, which are governed by
      U.S. law, this Privacy Notice, and our Terms of Use, you are transferring
      your personal information to the United States and you consent to that
      transfer.
    </p>
    
    <h2>In the Event of Merger, Sale, or Bankruptcy</h2>
    
    <p>
      In the event that Imikimi is acquired by or merged with a third party
      entity, we reserve the right, in any of these circumstances, to transfer
      or assign the information we have collected from our Users as part of
      such merger, acquisition, sale, or other change of control. In the
      unlikely event of our bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization,
      receivership, or assignment for the benefit of creditors, or the
      application of laws or equitable principles affecting creditors' rights
      generally, we may not be able to control how your personal information is
      treated, transferred, or used.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Changes and updates to this Privacy Notice</h2>
    
    <p>
      This Privacy Notice may be revised periodically and this will be
      reflected by the "effective date" below. Please revisit this page to stay
      aware of any changes. In general, we only use your personal information
      in the manner described in the Privacy Notice in effect when we received
      the personal information you provided. Your continued use of the Imikimi
      Sites constitutes your agreement to this Privacy Notice and any future
      revisions.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      For revisions to this Privacy Notice that may be materially less
      restrictive on our use or disclosure of the personal information you have
      already provided to us, we will attempt to obtain your consent before
      implementing such revisions with respect to such information.
