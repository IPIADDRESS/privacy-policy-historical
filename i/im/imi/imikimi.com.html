  <p>
    Imikimi LLC. ("Imikimi") recognizes that its customers, visitors, users,
    and others who use www.Imikimi.com or other web sites owned or operated
    by Imikimi (the "Imikimi Sites") (collectively or individually "Users")
    value their privacy. This Privacy Notice details important information
    regarding the use and disclosure of User information collected on the
    Imikimi Sites. Imikimi provides this Privacy Notice to help you make an
    informed decision about whether to use or continue using the Imikimi
    Sites.
  </p>

  <p>
    This Privacy Notice is incorporated into and is subject to the Imikimi
    Terms of Use. Your use of the Imikimi Sites and any personal information
    you provide on the Imikimi Sites remains subject to the terms of this
    Privacy Notice and our Terms of Use.
  </p>

  <p>
    Please note that image, video, or other content posted at the direction
    of Users onto the Imikimi Sites becomes published content and is not
    considered personally identifiable information subject to this Privacy
    Notice.
  </p>

  <h2>The Information Imikimi Collects</h2>

  <p>
    User Provided Information: You provide certain personally identifiable
    information (such as your name and email address) to Imikimi when
    choosing to participate in various activities on the Imikimi Sites such
    as uploading images and photographs, customizing images, e-mailing
    images, posting messages, entering contests or sweepstakes, taking
    advantage of promotions, responding to surveys, or subscribing to
    newsletters or other mailing lists.
  </p>

  <p>
    Cookies Information: When you visit the Imikimi Sites, we may send one or
    more cookies - a small text file containing a string of alphanumeric
    characters - to your computer that uniquely identifies your browser.
    Imikimi uses both session cookies and persistent cookies. A persistent
    cookie remains after you close your browser. Persistent cookies may be
    used by your browser on subsequent visits to the site. Persistent cookies
    can be removed by following your web browser help file directions. A
    session cookie is temporary and disappears after you close your browser.
    You can reset your web browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when
    a cookie is being sent. However, some features of the Imikimi Sites may
    not function properly if the ability to accept cookies is disabled.
  </p>

  <p>
    Log File Information: When you use the Imikimi Sites, our servers
    automatically record certain information that your web browser sends
    whenever you visit any website. These server logs may include information
    such as your web request, Internet Protocol ("IP") address, browser type,
    browser language, referring / exit pages and URLs, platform type, number
    of clicks, domain names, landing pages, pages viewed and the order of
    those pages, the amount of time spent on particular pages, the date and
    time of your request, and one or more cookies that may uniquely identify
    your browser.
  </p>

  <p>
    Clear GIFs Information: When you use the Imikimi Sites, we may employ
    "clear GIFs" (a.k.a. Web Beacons) which are used to track the online
    usage patterns of our Users anonymously (i.e., in a
    non-personally-identifiable manner). In addition, we may also use clear
    GIFs in HTML-based emails sent to our users to track which emails are
    opened by recipients.
  </p>

  <h2>The Way Imikimi Uses Information</h2>

  <p>
    If you submit personally identifiable information to us through the
    Imikimi Sites, then we use your personal information to operate,
    maintain, and provide to you the features and functionality of the
    Imikimi Sites.
  </p>

  <p>
    Any personal information or image content that you voluntarily disclose
    online (on discussion boards, in messages and chat areas, within your
    public profile page, etc.) becomes publicly available and can be
    collected and used by others. Your account name (not your email address)
    is displayed to other Users when you upload and modify images or send
    messages through the Imikimi Sites and other Users can contact you
    through messages and comments. Any images that you submit to the Imikimi
    Sites may be redistributed through the internet and other media channels,
    and may be viewed by the general public.
  </p>

  <p>
    We do not use your email address or other personally identifiable
    information to send commercial or marketing messages without your consent
    or except as part of a specific program or feature for which you will
    have the ability to opt-in or opt-out. We may, however, use your email
    address without further consent for non-marketing or administrative
    purposes (such as notifying you of major Imikimi Site changes or for
    customer service purposes).
  </p>

  <p>
    We use both your personally identifiable information and certain
    non-personally-identifiable information (such as anonymous User usage
    data, cookies, IP addresses, browser type, clickstream data, etc.) to
    improve the quality and design of the Imikimi Sites and to create new
    features, promotions, functionality, and services by storing, tracking,
    and analyzing User preferences and trends.
  </p>

  <p>
    We use cookies, clear gifs, and log file information to: (a) remember
    information so that you will not have to re-enter it during your visit or
    the next time you visit the Imikimi Sites; (b) provide custom,
    personalized content and information; (c) monitor the effectiveness of
    our marketing campaigns; (d) monitor aggregate metrics such as total
    number of visitors, pages viewed, etc.; and (e) track your entries,
    submissions, and status in promotions, sweepstakes, and contests.
  </p>

  <h2>When Imikimi Discloses Information</h2>

  <p>
    We provide personally identifiable information and
    non-personally-identifiable information to our subsidiaries, affiliated
    companies, or other businesses or persons for the purpose of processing
    such information on our behalf. We require that these parties agree to
    process such information in compliance with our privacy policy, and we
    use reasonable efforts to limit their use of such information and to use
    other appropriate confidentiality and security measures.
  </p>

  <p>
    We do not share your personally identifiable information (such as name or
    email address) with other, third-party companies for their commercial or
    marketing use without your consent or except as part of a specific
    program or feature for which you will have the ability to opt-in or
    opt-out.
  </p>

  <p>
    We do share non-personally-identifiable information (such as anonymous
    User usage data, referring / exit pages and URLs, platform types, number
    of clicks, etc.) with interested third-parties to assist them in
    understanding the usage patterns for certain content, services,
    advertisements, promotions, and/or functionality on the Imikimi Sites.
  </p>

  <p>
    We may release personally identifiable information and/or
    non-personally-identifiable information if required to do so by law, or
    in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with
    state and federal laws (such as U.S. Copyright Law) or respond to a court
    order, subpoena, or search warrant.
  </p>

  <p>
    Imikimi also reserves the right to disclose personally identifiable
    information and/or non-personally-identifiable information that Imikimi
    believes, in good faith, is appropriate or necessary to enforce our Terms
    of Use, take precautions against liability, to investigate and defend
    itself against any third-party claims or allegations, to assist
    government enforcement agencies, to protect the security or integrity of
    our web site, and to protect the rights, property, or personal safety of
    Imikimi, our Users or others.
  </p>

  <h2>Your Choices About Privacy</h2>

  <p>
    You may, of course, decline to submit personally identifiable information
    through the Imikimi Sites, in which case Imikimi may not be able to
    provide certain services to you. You may update or correct your personal
    profile information and email preferences at any time by visiting your
    account profile page. Please note that image and media files uploaded by
    Users to the Imikimi Sites cannot be removed and remain subject to our
    Terms of Use.
  </p>

  <p>
    To protect your privacy and security, we take reasonable steps (such as
    requesting a unique password) to verify your identity before granting you
    profile access or making corrections. You are responsible for maintaining
    the secrecy of your unique password and account information at all times.
  </p>

  <p>
    Please contact Imikimi with any questions or comments about this Privacy
    Notice, your personal information, your consent, or your opt-in or
    opt-out choices using this contact form.
  </p>

  <h2>Third-party Advertisers, Links to Other Sites</h2>

  <p>
    Imikimi allows other companies, called third-party ad servers or ad
    networks, to serve advertisements within the Imikimi Sites. These
    third-party ad servers or ad networks use technology to send, directly to
    your browser, the advertisements and links that appear on the Imikimi
    Sites. They automatically receive your IP address when this happens. They
    may also use other technologies (such as cookies, JavaScript, or Web
    Beacons) to measure the effectiveness of their advertisements and to
    personalize the advertising content you see.

  <p>
    Imikimi does not provide any personally identifiable information to these
    third-party ad servers or ad networks without your consent or except as
    part of a specific program or feature for which you will have the ability
    to opt-in or opt-out. However, please note that if an advertiser asks
    Imikimi to show an advertisement to a certain audience (for example, women
    ages 25-34) or audience segment (for example, women ages 25-44 who have
    viewed certain channels of content) and you respond to that
    advertisement, the advertiser or ad-server may conclude that you fit the
    description of the audience they are trying to reach. The advertiser may
    also use information regarding your use of the Imikimi Sites, such as the
    number of times you viewed an ad (but not any personally identifiable
    information), to determine which ads to deliver to you.
  </p>

  <p>
    You should consult the respective privacy policies of these third-party
    ad servers or ad networks (see links below) for more information on their
    practices and for instructions on how to opt-out of certain practices.
    Imikimi's privacy policy does not apply to, and we cannot control the
    activities of, such other advertisers or web sites.

  <h2>Our Commitment To Data Security</h2>

  <p>
    Imikimi uses commercially reasonable physical, managerial, and technical
    safeguards to preserve the integrity and security of your personal
    information. We cannot, however, ensure or warrant the security of any
    information you transmit to Imikimi and you do so at your own risk. Once
    we receive your transmission of information, Imikimi makes commercially
    reasonable efforts to ensure the security of our systems. However, please
    note that this is not a guarantee that such information may not be
    accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our
    physical, technical, or managerial safeguards.
  </p>

  <p>
    If Imikimi learns of a security systems breach, then we may attempt to
    notify you electronically so that you can take appropriate protective
    steps. Imikimi may post a notice on the Imikimi Sites if a security
    breach occurs. Depending on where you live, you may have a legal right to
    receive notice of a security breach in writing. To receive a free written
    notice of a security breach (or to withdraw your consent from receiving
    electronic notice) you should notify us using this contact form.

  <h2>Our Commitment To Childrens' Privacy</h2>

    Protecting the privacy of young children is especially important. For
    that reason, Imikimi does not knowingly collect or maintain personally
    identifiable information or non-personally-identifiable information on
    the Imikimi Sites from persons under 13 years of age, and no part of our
    website is directed to persons under 13. If you are under 13 years of
    age, then please do not use or access the Imikimi Sites at any time or in
    any manner. If Imikimi learns that personally identifiable information of
    persons under 13 years of age has been collected on the Imikimi Sites
    without verified parental consent, then Imikimi will take the appropriate
    steps to delete this information.
  </p>

  <p>
    The Imikimi Sites are hosted in the United States and are intended for
    and directed to Users in the United States. If you are a User accessing
    the Imikimi Sites from the European Union, Asia, or any other region with
    laws or regulations governing personal data collection, use, and

    In the event that Imikimi is acquired by or merged with a third party
    entity, we reserve the right, in any of these circumstances, to transfer
    or assign the information we have collected from our Users as part of
    such merger, acquisition, sale, or other change of control. In the
    unlikely event of our bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization,
    receivership, or assignment for the benefit of creditors, or the
    application of laws or equitable principles affecting creditors' rights
    generally, we may not be able to control how your personal information is
    treated, transferred, or used.
