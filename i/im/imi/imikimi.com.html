<hr>
<p>Imikimi LLC. ("Imikimi") recognizes that its customers, visitors, users,
and others who use www.Imikimi.com or other web sites owned or operated
by Imikimi (the "Imikimi Sites") (collectively or individually "Users")
value their privacy. This Privacy Notice details important information
regarding the use and disclosure of User information collected on the
Imikimi Sites. Imikimi provides this Privacy Notice to help you make an
informed decision about whether to use or continue using the Imikimi
Sites.

</p><p>This Privacy Notice is incorporated into and is subject to the Imikimi
Terms of Use. Your use of the Imikimi Sites and any personal information
you provide on the Imikimi Sites remains subject to the terms of this
Privacy Notice and our Terms of Use.

</p><p>Please note that image, video, or other content posted at the direction
of Users onto the Imikimi Sites becomes published content and is not
considered personally identifiable information subject to this Privacy
Notice.

</p><p></p><div class="large">The Information Imikimi Collects</div>

<p>User Provided Information: You provide certain personally identifiable
information (such as your name and email address) to Imikimi when
choosing to participate in various activities on the Imikimi Sites such
as uploading images and photographs, customizing images, e-mailing
images, posting messages, entering contests or sweepstakes, taking
advantage of promotions, responding to surveys, or subscribing to
newsletters or other mailing lists.

</p><p>Cookies Information: When you visit the Imikimi Sites, we may send one or
more cookies - a small text file containing a string of alphanumeric
characters - to your computer that uniquely identifies your browser.
Imikimi uses both session cookies and persistent cookies. A persistent
cookie remains after you close your browser. Persistent cookies may be
used by your browser on subsequent visits to the site. Persistent cookies
can be removed by following your web browser help file directions. A
session cookie is temporary and disappears after you close your browser.
You can reset your web browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when
a cookie is being sent. However, some features of the Imikimi Sites may
not function properly if the ability to accept cookies is disabled.

</p><p>Log File Information: When you use the Imikimi Sites, our servers
automatically record certain information that your web browser sends
whenever you visit any website. These server logs may include information
such as your web request, Internet Protocol ("IP") address, browser type,
browser language, referring / exit pages and URLs, platform type, number
of clicks, domain names, landing pages, pages viewed and the order of
those pages, the amount of time spent on particular pages, the date and
time of your request, and one or more cookies that may uniquely identify
your browser.

</p><p>Clear GIFs Information: When you use the Imikimi Sites, we may employ
"clear GIFs" (a.k.a. Web Beacons) which are used to track the online
usage patterns of our Users anonymously (i.e., in a
non-personally-identifiable manner). In addition, we may also use clear
GIFs in HTML-based emails sent to our users to track which emails are
opened by recipients.

</p><p></p><div class="large">The Way Imikimi Uses Information</div>

<p>If you submit personally identifiable information to us through the
Imikimi Sites, then we use your personal information to operate,
maintain, and provide to you the features and functionality of the
Imikimi Sites.

</p><p>Any personal information or image content that you voluntarily disclose
online (on discussion boards, in messages and chat areas, within your
public profile page, etc.) becomes publicly available and can be
collected and used by others. Your account name (not your email address)
is displayed to other Users when you upload and modify images or send
messages through the Imikimi Sites and other Users can contact you
through messages and comments. Any images that you submit to the Imikimi
Sites may be redistributed through the internet and other media channels,
and may be viewed by the general public.

</p><p>We do not use your email address or other personally identifiable
information to send commercial or marketing messages without your consent
or except as part of a specific program or feature for which you will
have the ability to opt-in or opt-out. We may, however, use your email
address without further consent for non-marketing or administrative
purposes (such as notifying you of major Imikimi Site changes or for
customer service purposes).

</p><p>We use both your personally identifiable information and certain
non-personally-identifiable information (such as anonymous User usage
data, cookies, IP addresses, browser type, clickstream data, etc.) to
improve the quality and design of the Imikimi Sites and to create new
features, promotions, functionality, and services by storing, tracking,
and analyzing User preferences and trends.

</p><p>We use cookies, clear gifs, and log file information to: (a) remember
information so that you will not have to re-enter it during your visit or
the next time you visit the Imikimi Sites; (b) provide custom,
personalized content and information; (c) monitor the effectiveness of
our marketing campaigns; (d) monitor aggregate metrics such as total
number of visitors, pages viewed, etc.; and (e) track your entries,
submissions, and status in promotions, sweepstakes, and contests.

</p><p></p><div class="large">When Imikimi Discloses Information</div>

<p>We provide personally identifiable information and
non-personally-identifiable information to our subsidiaries, affiliated
companies, or other businesses or persons for the purpose of processing
such information on our behalf. We require that these parties agree to
process such information in compliance with our privacy policy, and we
use reasonable efforts to limit their use of such information and to use
other appropriate confidentiality and security measures.

</p><p>We do not share your personally identifiable information (such as name or
email address) with other, third-party companies for their commercial or
marketing use without your consent or except as part of a specific
program or feature for which you will have the ability to opt-in or
opt-out.

</p><p>We do share non-personally-identifiable information (such as anonymous
User usage data, referring / exit pages and URLs, platform types, number
of clicks, etc.) with interested third-parties to assist them in
understanding the usage patterns for certain content, services,
advertisements, promotions, and/or functionality on the Imikimi Sites.

</p><p>We may release personally identifiable information and/or
non-personally-identifiable information if required to do so by law, or
in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with
state and federal laws (such as U.S. Copyright Law) or respond to a court
order, subpoena, or search warrant.

</p><p>Imikimi also reserves the right to disclose personally identifiable
information and/or non-personally-identifiable information that Imikimi
believes, in good faith, is appropriate or necessary to enforce our Terms
of Use, take precautions against liability, to investigate and defend
itself against any third-party claims or allegations, to assist
government enforcement agencies, to protect the security or integrity of
our web site, and to protect the rights, property, or personal safety of
Imikimi, our Users or others.

</p><p></p><div class="large">Your Choices About Privacy</div>

<p>You may, of course, decline to submit personally identifiable information
through the Imikimi Sites, in which case Imikimi may not be able to
provide certain services to you. You may update or correct your personal
profile information and email preferences at any time by visiting your
account profile page. Please note that image and media files uploaded by
Users to the Imikimi Sites cannot be removed and remain subject to our
Terms of Use.

</p><p>To protect your privacy and security, we take reasonable steps (such as
requesting a unique password) to verify your identity before granting you
profile access or making corrections. You are responsible for maintaining
the secrecy of your unique password and account information at all times.

</p><p>Please contact Imikimi with any questions or comments about this Privacy
Notice, your personal information, your consent, or your opt-in or
opt-out choices using this contact form.

</p><p></p><div class="large">Third-party Advertisers, Links to Other Sites</div>

<p>Imikimi allows other companies, called third-party ad servers or ad
networks, to serve advertisements within the Imikimi Sites. These
third-party ad servers or ad networks use technology to send, directly to
your browser, the advertisements and links that appear on the Imikimi
Sites. They automatically receive your IP address when this happens. They
may also use other technologies (such as cookies, JavaScript, or Web
Beacons) to measure the effectiveness of their advertisements and to
personalize the advertising content you see.

</p><p>Imikimi does not provide any personally identifiable information to these
third-party ad servers or ad networks without your consent or except as
part of a specific program or feature for which you will have the ability
to opt-in or opt-out. However, please note that if an advertiser asks
Imikimi to show an advertisement to a certain audience (for example, women
ages 25-34) or audience segment (for example, women ages 25-44 who have
viewed certain channels of content) and you respond to that
advertisement, the advertiser or ad-server may conclude that you fit the
description of the audience they are trying to reach. The advertiser may
also use information regarding your use of the Imikimi Sites, such as the
number of times you viewed an ad (but not any personally identifiable
information), to determine which ads to deliver to you.

</p><p>You should consult the respective privacy policies of these third-party
ad servers or ad networks (see links below) for more information on their
practices and for instructions on how to opt-out of certain practices.
Imikimi's privacy policy does not apply to, and we cannot control the
activities of, such other advertisers or web sites.

</p><p>Currently, Imikimi has relationships with the following third-party ad
servers or ad networks:

</p><p>Google, Inc.

</p><p>http://www.google.com/privacypolicy.html


</p><p></p><div class="large">Our Commitment To Data Security</div>

<p>Imikimi uses commercially reasonable physical, managerial, and technical
safeguards to preserve the integrity and security of your personal
information. We cannot, however, ensure or warrant the security of any
information you transmit to Imikimi and you do so at your own risk. Once
we receive your transmission of information, Imikimi makes commercially
reasonable efforts to ensure the security of our systems. However, please
note that this is not a guarantee that such information may not be
accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our
physical, technical, or managerial safeguards.

</p><p>If Imikimi learns of a security systems breach, then we may attempt to
notify you electronically so that you can take appropriate protective
steps. Imikimi may post a notice on the Imikimi Sites if a security
breach occurs. Depending on where you live, you may have a legal right to
receive notice of a security breach in writing. To receive a free written
notice of a security breach (or to withdraw your consent from receiving
electronic notice) you should notify us using this contact form.

</p><p></p><div class="large">Our Commitment To Childrens' Privacy</div>

<p>Protecting the privacy of young children is especially important. For
that reason, Imikimi does not knowingly collect or maintain personally
identifiable information or non-personally-identifiable information on
the Imikimi Sites from persons under 13 years of age, and no part of our
website is directed to persons under 13. If you are under 13 years of
age, then please do not use or access the Imikimi Sites at any time or in
any manner. If Imikimi learns that personally identifiable information of
persons under 13 years of age has been collected on the Imikimi Sites
without verified parental consent, then Imikimi will take the appropriate
steps to delete this information.

</p><p></p><div class="large">Special Note to International Users</div>

<p>The Imikimi Sites are hosted in the United States and are intended for
and directed to Users in the United States. If you are a User accessing
the Imikimi Sites from the European Union, Asia, or any other region with
laws or regulations governing personal data collection, use, and
disclosure, that differ from United States laws, please be advised that
through your continued use of the Imikimi Sites, which are governed by
U.S. law, this Privacy Notice, and our Terms of Use, you are transferring
your personal information to the United States and you consent to that
transfer.

</p><p></p><div class="large">In the Event of Merger, Sale, or Bankruptcy</div>

<p>In the event that Imikimi is acquired by or merged with a third party
entity, we reserve the right, in any of these circumstances, to transfer
or assign the information we have collected from our Users as part of
such merger, acquisition, sale, or other change of control. In the
unlikely event of our bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization,
receivership, or assignment for the benefit of creditors, or the
application of laws or equitable principles affecting creditors' rights
generally, we may not be able to control how your personal information is
treated, transferred, or used.

</p><p></p><div class="large">Changes and updates to this Privacy Notice</div>

<p>This Privacy Notice may be revised periodically and this will be
reflected by the "effective date" below. Please revisit this page to stay
aware of any changes. In general, we only use your personal information
in the manner described in the Privacy Notice in effect when we received
the personal information you provided. Your continued use of the Imikimi
Sites constitutes your agreement to this Privacy Notice and any future
revisions.

</p><p>For revisions to this Privacy Notice that may be materially less
restrictive on our use or disclosure of the personal information you have
already provided to us, we will attempt to obtain your consent before
implementing such revisions with respect to such information.
