					      <p align="justify" class="txtRed"><strong>VIEWING AND/OR USE AND/OR COMMUNICATION IS CONSTRUED AS ACCEPTANCE  OF THE TERMS OF THIS POLICY</strong></p>
					      <p align="justify">Acceptance of the terms of this Privacy Policy  is a portion of the consideration required for your right to visit the  website.&nbsp; If you do not accept these  terms, you have no right to visit this site and you are fraudulently using this  site.</p>
					      <p align="justify" class="txtRed"><strong>A  NOTE TO CALIFORNIA  RESIDENTS (ONLINE PRIVACY PROTECTION ACT OF 2003 --OPPA)</strong></p>
					      <p align="justify">It is the intent of the Privacy Policy to comply with the  California Act.&nbsp; Various provisions  throughout this Privacy Policy address requirements of the act.&nbsp; In summary, you must presume that we collect  electronic information from all visitors.&nbsp;  This is not usually personally identifiable.&nbsp; If you purchase a product or service via this  website (and thereby become covered by the Act), the purchase agreement you electronically  sign prior to purchase allows the website to collect and archive all the  personal information you provide and to transmit and/or transfer that personal  information to third parties.&nbsp; There is  no way you can modify this information and you have no right to do so.&nbsp; Under the terms of the purchase agreement,  you have no right to view or receive any information about our database.&nbsp; In the event that the website, under advice  of counsel agrees to divulge information, the requesting party must submit whatever  information is demanded by the website in order to insure that the website is  releasing information to the correct party.&nbsp;  Other provisions of the OPPA may exempt this website from complying.&nbsp; While we take measures to ensure that outside  parties do not have access to any information we have about you, we do not  warranty that outside parties will not breach our system and thus have access  to your information.&nbsp; (You should know  that merchant service providers do not allow us access to your credit card  information.)&nbsp; This Privacy Policy also  is subject to change without notice.&nbsp; You  are required to read it prior to using the website.&nbsp; By interacting with the website you agree to  the terms and conditions of the Privacy Policy.&nbsp;  By using the website or purchasing a product through this website, you  waive the right to use state or federal court systems to address complaints  and, instead, agree to use the American Arbitration Association located in a  city and county specified herein.</p>
					      <p align="justify" class="txtRed"><strong>ABOUT THE PERSONAL INFORMATION THIS WEBSITE COLLECTS AND HOW IT IS  USED</strong></p>
					      <p align="justify">This website routinely collects information  about its visitors, subscribers, members, and customers.&nbsp; This information is obtained in various ways,  such as:</p>
					      <p align="justify" class="txtRed"><strong>VISITOR, SUBSCRIBER, MEMBER, OR CUSTOMER INFORMATION OBTAINED FROM  'REGISTRATION'</strong></p>
					      <p align="justify">Registration means that the Visitor, Subscriber,  Member or Customer takes active, positive steps to communicate information to  this website.&nbsp; This can include pages or  'pop ups' where you register for a newsletter or subscribe to a mailing list;  it can include your participation in visitor surveys; it can include requesting  information from the website via email, mail, or courier; it may be from  joining an affiliate program or other membership organization, paid or unpaid;  it may be from ordering a product.</p>
					      <p align="justify">Occasionally complete credit card information  may be provided to the website via fax or a fill-in form rather than regular  secure merchant service processing.&nbsp; This  information is kept at the highest level of security and is never divulged to  anyone except the merchant service provider or for the purpose of communication  with the customer.</p>
					      <p align="justify" class="txtRed"><strong>ONLINE ORDERING</strong></p>
					      <p align="justify">Online ordering via SSL encrypted communication provided by  shopping cart services supporting merchant service companies like Visa and  Master Card provides information to the website but does not provide complete  credit card numbers.&nbsp; In the process of  online ordering, the customer provides, name, address, city, state, email address,  phone number, CVV2 (back of card) number, and, occasionally a member  password.&nbsp; You should consider all this  information available to the website.&nbsp;  This information is used to deliver the product, but under the Purchase  Agreement you also approve its use for general solicitation purposes.</p>
					      <p align="justify" class="txtRed"><strong>VISITOR  EMAIL INQUIRIES</strong></p>
					      <p align="justify">Website visitors who wish to communicate with the website do  so under two conditions:&nbsp; one, they give  their permission for contact by the website; two, they are subject to any  ‘submission’ provisions of the Terms of Use, Purchase Agreement, or this  Privacy Policy.&nbsp; While your email address  may or may not be used to solicit you, it is added to the website's general  solicitation database.</p>
					      <p align="justify" class="txtRed"><strong>CUSTOMER EMAIL OR TESTIMONIALS</strong></p>
					      <p align="justify">If you are a customer and send an email to the  website, or if you communicate with the site by phone or mail, the website  collects information about your communication and by communicating with the  site you give your permission to collect, archive, retrieve, and otherwise use  any information collected as the site sees fit.</p>
					      <p align="justify">Any communication which, in its sole discretion,  the site deems to be a testimonial, may be publicized for commercial purposes.</p>
					      <p align="justify" class="txtRed"><strong>INFORMATION OBTAINED FROM VISITOR INTERACTION WITH BANNERS,  POPUPS, OR SITE ADVERTISERS</strong></p>
					      <p align="justify">Visitors clicking on banners or pop-ups or  hyperlinked advertising, appearing on this website must assume that information  is being collected about them.&nbsp; This site  is not responsible for the use of information collected in such a fashion.&nbsp; Visitors must assume that (1)  information will be collected, (2) that ‘cookies’ will usually be placed on  their hard drive, (3) that website does not have any control over what happens  with this information, (4) that website takes no responsibility over the  accuracy or content of advertisers, (5) that website is not responsible for  downloads from third party advertisers that contain viruses or worms or other  computer code that causes their computer or software harm, and (6) that website  assumes no responsibility for the data that is garnered from the click itself  or that the advertiser collects. </p>
					      <p align="justify" class="txtRed"><strong>INFORMATION OBTAINED FROM REFERRING EMAIL OR REFERRING URLS</strong></p>
					      <p align="justify">If you send a friend an email from this site or  if you send the url or one of our web pages to a friend, you must assume that  some data is collected about your IP address or your email address and that of  your friend.&nbsp; You must assume that  referred emails or web pages may appear to come from your email.&nbsp; You must accept fully responsibility for  referring pages or email to a friend and agree to indemnify this site for any  damage, intentional or unintentional that results from said referrals.</p>
					      <p align="justify" class="txtRed"><strong>INFORMATION OBTAINED FROM VOLUNTARY VISITOR, SUBSCRIBER, MEMBER OR  CUSTOMER SURVEYS</strong></p>
					      <p align="justify">Unless otherwise specified in the survey, you  must assume that any information provided to the website as part of a survey in  which you participate may be used for general solicitation for commercial  purposes and that such information will be shared with joint venture partners,  affiliates, marketing organization or used by the site itself for product  design or solicitation purposes.</p>
					      <p align="justify" class="txtRed"><strong>INFORMATION OBTAINED FROM ELECTRONIC MEANS AND 'COOKIES'</strong></p>
					      <p align="justify">Many websites, including this one, collect  information about your computer, your email address, your IP address.&nbsp; You must assume that your web-viewing or  web-use activity is monitored, tracked, and information collected.&nbsp; This information is not usually of a personal  nature, but it may help define your viewing habits and product preferences even  though the website may or may not have any idea who you are.</p>
					      <p align="justify">"Cookies" is web jargon for bits of  computer code placed on your hard drive.&nbsp;  Websites use this to keep you 'logged in', to keep track of search  criteria, to monitor use, to password protect use of the site or use of  products sold by the site.&nbsp; Cookies can  also be used to obtain information about your computer configuration or your  use of your computer.</p>
					      <p align="justify">Cookies can be used to electronically gather  information about you.&nbsp; Again, it may or  may not be personal information, but it is information and by using this site  you are expressly giving permission to use 'cookies' and to use the information  gathered from their use to benefit you.&nbsp;  You also give permission to collect, archive, retrieve, and use any  information collected for product design, product offers to you, and general  commercial solicitation purposes by this site or joint venture partners,  affiliates, and marketing organizations.</p>
					      <p align="justify" class="txtRed"><strong>HOW INFORMATION MAY BE USED</strong></p>
					      <p align="justify">The use of information as described below may or  may not be how information that is collected is customarily used by this  site.&nbsp; While actual use of any  information collected may be used quite conservatively, you must assume that it  is not.&nbsp; You must assume that information  collected is shared with other persons or entities for commercial  purposes.&nbsp; While this is uncommon in  practice, you must assume that it is as you make your decision whether or not  to view or interact with this website.&nbsp;  This type of shared information may include your name, address, phone  number, email address and buying habits, as well as other information.&nbsp; This information may be used for general  commercial solicitation by this website or other persons it is sold to, rented  to, or shared with.</p>
					      <p align="justify" class="txtRed"><strong>INFORMATION THAT IS NOT SHARED</strong></p>
					      <p align="justify">Credit card information or other financial  information is not usually known to the website.&nbsp; However, in the event that it is made known,  that information is never revealed to anyone except to processing authorities  or law enforcement agencies.&nbsp; However,  the provider of such information gives express permission to use it in fraud  investigation or for litigation.</p>
					      <p align="justify" class="txtRed"><strong>BULLETIN BOARDS AND PUBLIC FORUMS</strong></p>
					      <p align="justify">Visitors, subscribers, members, or customers who  use any site provided bulletin boards or other public forums, such as chat  rooms, do so at their own risk.&nbsp; You may  not assume that the site monitors these services or protects you in any manner  from information you post publicly or share with anyone else via these  services.</p>
					      <p align="justify" class="txtRed"><strong>SPAM&nbsp; </strong></p>
					      <p align="justify">By providing to this website information that  forms the basis of communication with you, such as an email address, you waive  all rights to file complaints concerning unsolicited email or spam from this  website since, by providing such information, you agree to receive  communication from us or other marketing organizations.&nbsp; However, all email communication with you  shall contain an 'unsubscribe' link where you may notify the website that you  no longer wish to receive solicitations or information from the website and  your name will be removed from the general solicitation database.</p>
