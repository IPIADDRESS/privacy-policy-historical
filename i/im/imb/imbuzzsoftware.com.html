<p><b><span style="FONT-SIZE: 18pt; FONT-FAMILY: Impact">Privacy Policy</span></b></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial">IMBuzzSoftware.com seeks to offer its web visitors an interactive and customised service, thereby providing individual unique experience in the area of information and technology. We may use Personally Identifiable Information (your name, e-mail address, street address, telephone number) subject to the terms of this privacy policy. </span></span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial">We will never sell, exchange, barter or rent your personal details to any unauthorized third party. </span></p>
<p><strong><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial">Collection of Information from Users</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial">Collection and storage of visitor information depends on the page that you are visiting, the activities in which you select to participate and the services provided to you. </span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial">For example, you may be asked to provide personal information to gain access to certain areas of our site or during the request for certain features, such as email updates and newsletters or when you make a purchase. You may provide information when you participate in contests, message boards and chat rooms, and other interactive areas of our site. </span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial">Like most Web sites, IMBuzzSofware.com also collects information automatically and through the use of electronic tools that may be transparent to our visitors. For example, we may log the name of your Internet Service Provider or use cookie technology to recognize you and hold information from your visit. Among other things, the cookie may store your user name and password, sparing you from having to re-enter that information each time you visit, or may control the number of times you encounter a particular advertisement while visiting our site. As we adopt additional technology, we may also gather information through other means. <br><br>In certain cases, you can choose not to provide us with information, for example by setting your browser to refuse to accept cookies, but if you do you may be unable to access certain portions of the site or may be asked to re-enter your user name and password, and we may not be able to customize the site's features according to your preferences.</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial">Use of Collected information</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial">Like other Web publishers, we collect information to enhance your visit and deliver more individualized content and advertising. We respect your privacy and do not share your information with anyone.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial">Aggregated Information (information that does not personally identify you) may be used in many ways. For example, we may combine information about your usage patterns with similar information obtained from other users to <br>help enhance our site and services (e.g., to learn which pages are visited most or what features are most attractive). <br><br>Aggregated Information may occasionally be shared with our advertisers and business partners. Again, this information does not include any Personally Identifiable Information about you or allow anyone to identify you individually.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial">We may use Personally Identifiable Information collected on IMBuzzSoftware.com to communicate with you about your registration and customization preferences; our Terms of Service and privacy policy; services and products offered by IMBuzzSoftware.com and other topics we think you might find of interest.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial">Personally Identifiable Information collected by IMBuzzSoftware.com may also be used for other purposes, including but not limited to site administration, troubleshooting, processing of e-commerce transactions, administration of <br>contests, and other communications with you. Certain third parties who provide technical support for the operation of our site (our Web hosting service for example) may access such information. We will use your information only as permitted by law. In addition, from time to time as we continue to develop our business, we may sell, buy, merge or partner with other companies or businesses. <br><br>In such transactions, user information may be among the transferred assets. <br>We may also disclose your information in response to a court order, at other times when we believe we are reasonably required to do so by law, in connection with the collection of amounts you may owe to us, and/or to law enforcement authorities whenever we deem it appropriate or necessary. Please note we may not provide you with notice prior to disclosure in such cases.</span></p>

<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial">While on our site, our advertisers, promotional partners or other third parties may use cookies or other technology to attempt to identify some of your preferences or retrieve information about you. <br><br>For example, some of our advertising is served by third parties and may include cookies that enable the advertiser to determine whether you have seen a particular advertisement before. Other features available on our site may offer services operated by third parties and may use cookies or other technology to gather information. IMBuzzSoftware.com does not control the use of this technology by third parties&nbsp;or the resulting information, and is not responsible for any actions or policies of such third parties.</span></p>
