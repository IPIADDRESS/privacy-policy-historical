This period may extend beyond the end of your relationship with us.</p><h3>Cookies</h3><p>To provide better service and more effective Websites, we use "cookies” as part of our interaction with your browsers. A "cookie" is a small text file placed on your hard drive by our web server. Our cookies cannot retrieve any other data from your hard drive, pass on computer viruses, or capture your e-mail address. Cookies are commonly used on websites and do not harm your system.</p><p>We use cookies on parts of our Websites where you need to register, such as online banking, or where you are able to customize the information you see. Recording a cookie at such points makes your online experience easier and more personalized.</p><p>We may also use cookies to record information regarding:</p><ul type="disc"><li>Visitors' preferences</li><li>User sessions on our Websites</li><li>Which web pages users visit on our website</li><li>Past activity on Websites in order to provide better service when visitors return, such as: </li><ul type="circle"><li>to alert visitors to new areas that we think might be of interest to them when they return to our Website;</li><li>to ensure that visitors are not repeatedly sent the same banner ads; and/or</li><li>to customize web page content based on visitors' browser type or other information.</li></ul></ul><p>Our cookies do not collect personally-identifiable information, and we do not combine information collected through cookies with other personal information to determine your identity or e-mail address. We may combine personal information with cookies for other purposes, such as tracking or marketing preferences. By configuring your preferences or options in your browser, you determine if and how a cookie will be accepted. However, if you configure your web browser so that cookies are turned off, our website will not be able to process your transaction. If this happens, please turn your cookies back on and log onto our site again.</p><h3>Web Beacons</h3><p>A web beacon is a graphic image (such as a pixel tag or clear GIF) that is placed on a web page or in an e-mail message to monitor user activity (such as whether the web page or e-mail message is read or clicked). They are often invisible and may be very small in size. They are also used on many web pages for alignment purposes. We sometimes use web beacons to provide an independent accounting of how many people visit our Websites or to gather statistics about web browser usage on our Websites. Some of our web pages and HTML-formatted e-mail newsletters use web beacons in conjunction with cookies. It is difficult for you to limit the use of web beacons because there is no easy way to distinguish their use from alignment and other purposes. They may be loaded from a different web server than the rest of the page.</p><h3>Protecting Children's Privacy Online</h3><p>The safety of children online is very important to us. We do not knowingly collect Personal Information from children under the age of 13 online. If we become aware that we have inadvertently received Personal Information online from a user under the age of 13, we will attempt to delete the information as soon as possible. Because we do not knowingly collect Personal Information from children under the age of 13 online, we also do not knowingly distribute such information to third parties.</p><h3>Security</h3><p>Access to our systems containing Non-Personal Information or Personal Information is only provided to those employees and agents whom we determine need it for the purpose of providing products or services to you. We maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards that comply with applicable federal and state standards to protect your information. We use industry-standard security measures to protect your information so that it is not made available to unauthorized parties, including using Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology for encryption and transmittal of information (including your personal Information) on or through our Websites. However, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, we cannot and do not guarantee or warrant the security of any information you transmit on or through our Websites, and you do so at your own risk.</p><h3>Third-Party Advertisements</h3><p>When browsing the Internet, you may see a banner ad for a OneWest Bank product or service. These ads may appear on non-OneWest Bank websites. We use third-party advertisement serving companies to serve our ad banners to sites on which we have paid to advertise. If you click on one of our ads, you will be directed to the OneWest Bank Website offering that particular product or service. Sometimes, these ads may contain web beacons or cookies to gather anonymous user data, such as how many people clicked through a particular ad. Our policy does not cover any use of information that a third-party advertisement-serving company may collect from you. The companies that distribute our ads are prohibited by contract from using information other than for the agreed-upon purpose, which is to help us market our products and services and to measure response rates.</p><h3>Links to Third-Party Websites</h3><p>We are not responsible for the information collection practices of the non-OneWest Bank links available on our Websites. We cannot guarantee how these third parties use cookies or whether they place on your computer cookies that may identify you personally. We urge you to review the privacy policies of each of the linked websites you visit before you provide them with any information.</p><h3>Encryption</h3><p>Your password, as well as all information relating to your accounts and your enrollment, are scrambled using some of the strongest forms of encryption commercially available for use over the World Wide Web.</p><h4>How does encryption work?</h4><p>Everything that travels through the Internet during your online banking session, from your password to online bill pay, becomes a string of unrecognizable numbers (also known as algorithms) before entering the Internet. Both OneWest Bank's computers and the browser you use to surf the Web understand the mathematical formulas, called algorithms, which turn your banking session into numeric code, and then back again into meaningful information.</p><p>These algorithms serve as locks on the doors of your account information. While OneWest Bank and your computer can easily translate this code back to meaningful language, this process is nearly impossible to decipher by unauthorized intruders. These complex algorithms are randomized in such a way that billions of attempts would need to be conducted to crack a single formula. Each time you begin an online banking session, your computer and OneWest Bank's systems agree on a random number that serves as the key for the rest of the session. Your browser’s encryption settings will most likely determine the algorithm. </p><p>OneWest Bank ensures that all OneWest Bank online banking sessions via the Internet are encrypted. If for any reason your secure session ends, your Online Banking session terminates.</p><p>For maximum protection, OneWest Bank encourages you to use browsers offering 256-bit encryption. This is also known as high or strong encryption. It means there are 2 to the 256th power possible keys that could fit into the lock that holds your account information. In other words, a hacker attempting to get to your account information would need to use a computer with exponentially more processing power than for 40-bit or 56-bit encryption to find the correct key.</p><p>All browsers provide detailed information on encryption and other forms of security. Consult your browser’s security options for more information.</p><h4>How do I know if my banking session is encrypted?</h4><p>You can determine if encryption is being used on a given web page by looking for a padlock icon. This is one example: <img src="/images/global/icons/secure-chrome.gif" alt="padlock"></p><p>Padlock icons vary in design and color.  Generally, padlock icons are displayed on the address bar, menu bar, status bar, tab or other areas of your browser, depending on the device used (desktop or laptop tablet or smart phone) and the type of browser used (e.g. Internet Explorer, Safari, Google Chrome, etc).</p></dd><dt><a href="#" id="notifyus"><span class="signal">expand +</span>Notify Us about Online Security Issues</a></dt><dd><p>If you believe that you've been the victim of online fraud, identity theft or a lottery scam, please notify us by either calling 1.877.331.3785 Monday through Friday, 8:00 a.m. – 9:00 p.m. (EST) or e-mail us at <a href="mailto:privacyemail@owb.com">privacyemail@owb.com</a>.</p><p>Please include your name, e-mail address, telephone number and a detailed description.</p></dd><dt><a href="#" id="safesender"><span class="signal">expand +</span>How to Add OneWest Bank to your Safe Sender Email List</a></dt><dd><p>An increasing number of e-mail clients (Outlook, AOL, Hotmail, etc.) are including spam blockers that can affect the delivery and display of some e-mail messages.

However, you must also take every step to ensure the safety and privacy of your information. In order to help educate you on identity theft, online fraud and lottery scams on all fronts, we've detailed the major threats on the Internet today, as well ways to take action to both prevent and manage these issues if they occur.</p><dl class="accordion"><dt><a href="#" id="PhishingWebsiteScam"><span class="signal">expand +</span>Phishing Website Scam</a></dt><dd><h3>Be aware of Phishing Website Scams</h3><p>OneWest Bank has created this webpage to inform and warn consumers about a type of fraud called "phishing." The term "phishing" - as in fishing for confidential information - refers to a scam that encompasses fraudulently obtaining and using an individual's personal or financial information. This is how it works:</p><ul class="circle"><li>A consumer receives an e-mail that appears to originate from a financial institution, government agency, or other well-known/reputable entity.</li><li>The message describes an urgent reason you must "verify" or "re-submit" personal or confidential information by clicking on a link embedded in the message.</li><li>The provided link appears to be the Web site of the financial institution, government agency or other well-known/reputable entity, but in "phishing" scams, the Web site belongs to the fraudster/scammer.</li><li>Once inside the fraudulent Web site, the consumer may be asked to provide Social Security numbers, account numbers, passwords or other information used to identify the consumer, such as the maiden name of the consumer's mother or the consumer's place of birth.</li><li>When the consumer provides the information, those perpetrating the fraud can begin to access consumer accounts or assume the person's identity.</li></ul><p>Recently, criminals have been using the OneWest Bank's name and reputation to perpetrate various "phishing" schemes.  It is important to note that OneWest Bank will never ask for personal or confidential information in this manner. One “phishing” scheme was perpetrated using the following domain name: www.onewstbk.com </p><p>Please do not attempt to transact any business or submit any personal information through the above web site.</p><p>Any genuine OneWest Bank communication will only utilize links to the official OneWest web page located at <a href="http://www.onewestbank.com">www.onewestbank.com</a> Any genuine link will commence with that URL as in the example below:</p><p><img title="Phishing Website Scam" alt="Phishing Website Scam" src="/images/business/footer-PhishingWebsiteScam.jpg" style="border: 1px solid rgb(204, 204, 204);"></p><p>If you click on a link that takes you to a website whose address begins with something else, or which includes apparent abbreviations of our bank name, it’s not a genuine OneWest Bank site – even if it looks familiar.  You should refrain from using any links or information found at such fraudulent sites.</p><p>If you suspect an e-mail or Web site is fraudulent, please report this information to OneWest Bank, using this number 1.877.741.9378.  If you suspect that you have been a victim of identity theft, perhaps because you submitted personal information in response to a suspicious, unsolicited e-mail or you see unauthorized charges on your credit card, immediately contact OneWest Bank and, if necessary, close existing accounts and open new ones.  Also contact the police and request a copy of any police report or case number for later reference.  In addition, call the three major credit bureaus (Equifax at 800-525-6285, Experian at 888-397-3742 and TransUnion at 800-680-7289) to request that a fraud alert be placed on your credit report.</p></dd><dt><a href="#" id="shellshock"><span class="signal">expand +</span>Bash Shellshock Bug</a></dt><dd><p><b>Your online security is always a priority to OneWest Bank.</b><br> Given the recent news of the Bash "Shellshock" bug, we want you to know what we're doing to protect your information.</p><p><b>First, what is the Bash Shellshock Bug?</b><br> The Shellshock bug refers to a coding flaw housed in utility program called "Bash," which affects computers and websites running operating systems such as Mac OS and Linux.  Bash enables computer programs to connect, and one of its chief uses is in connecting web server software to underlying operating systems.  It also enables individual computers to execute commands like "run my Web browser" and "open this application," etc.   Generically, programs like Bash are called "shells,"  and that's how the bug was given its name.</p><p>Bash has been in use all over the world for well over 20 years, but in September 2014, it was discovered that modifications to the code in the early 1990s inadvertently created a flaw that allows malicious code execution to take over an operating system and access confidential information.  As a result, lots of companies with an internet presence are potentially at risk from the Shellshock bug.  Certain personal computers may also be at risk.</p><p><b>What is OneWest Bank doing about it?</b><br> OneWest is using both automated and manual protocols to detect Bash vulnerabilities in our own systems and swiftly deploy the appropriate patches. We are also working with our vendors to detect and eliminate vulnerabilities.</p><p><b>What should I do?</b><br> There are two things you can do to protect yourself, and they are not new:</p><p>First, the best way to limit your exposure to computer bugs that target internet-based activity is to have different passwords for different websites, and to make those passwords appropriately complex, using upper- and lower-case letters, numbers and if allowed, symbols.  Change your passwords periodically.</p><p>Second, it's always wise to watch for and promptly implement operating system updates or patches designed to enhance security.  Bash is used in personal computers running the Mac operating system, though Apple has explained that OS X is safe for all but those running advanced Unix services.  A patch is coming for those users, according to Apple.  Bash is not native to Windows-based computers, but there is a window-based version in use on some machines, that is reportedly vulnerable.  So stay up to date on security patches for your machine(s)!</p><p><b>Why you can feel confident.</b><br> We're serious about security. Your online account with OneWest Bank is protected with a sophisticated information security program. Our multi-layered defense system consists of preventive, detective and response controls managed by a team dedicated to tracking threats such as the Shellshock bug.</p><p>We are vigilantly monitoring this situation and will take additional steps, as needed, to guard against the Shellshock bug and safeguard your information.</p></dd><dt><a href="#" id="phishingscam"><span class="signal">expand +</span>Voice Phishing Phone Call Scam</a></dt><dd><p><b>Calls Claiming to Come from OneWest Bank’s Security Department:</b></p><p>Recently, some of our customers have received telephone calls featuring a recorded message that claims to be from OneWest Bank’s Security Department.

Often called "phishing" or "spoofing," the most current methods of online fraud are fake e-mails, websites and/or pop-up windows.</p><p><b>OneWest Bank will never send an unsolicited request for personal information through e-mail or require customers to send personal information to us via e-mail or pop-up windows.</b> Any unsolicited request for OneWest Bank account information you receive through e-mails, websites, or pop-up windows <b>should be considered fraudulent and reported to us immediately</b> via our <a title="Notify Us" href="#" class="gtAccordion" data-tab="securitypolicy" data-acc="notifyus">Notify Us</a> link.</p><h3>Fake e-mails will often:</h3><ul class="circle"><li><b>Ask you for personal information.</b> Fake e-mails often contain an overly-generic greeting and may claim that your information has been compromised, that your account has been frozen, or ask you to confirm the authenticity of your transactions.</li><li><b>Appear to be from a legitimate source.</b> While some e-mails are easy to identify as fraudulent, others may appear to be from a legitimate address and trusted online source. However, you should not rely on the name or address in the "From" field, as this is easily altered.</li><li><b>Contain fraudulent job offers.</b> Some fake e-mails appear to be from companies offering jobs. These are often work-at-home accounting positions which are actually schemes that victimize both the job applicant and other customers. Be sure to confirm that the job offer is from a known and trusted company.</li><li><b>Contain prizes or gift certificate offers.</b> Some fake e-mails promise a prize or gift certificate in exchange for completing a survey or answering questions. In order to collect the alleged prize or gift certificate you may be directed to provide your personal information. Just like with job offers, be sure to confirm that prize or gift certificate is being issued from a known and trusted company.</li><li><b>Link to counterfeit websites.</b> Fake e-mails may direct you to counterfeit websites carefully designed to look real, but which actually collect personal information for illegal use. Check the URL in your browser’s address bar to ensure you are visiting a legitimate website.</li><li><b>Link to real websites.</b> In addition to links to counterfeit websites, some fake e-mails also include links to legitimate websites as supplements to fraudulent e-mails in order to make them appear real.</li><li><b>Contain fraudulent phone numbers.</b> Fake e-mails often contain telephone numbers that are tied to the fraudsters. Never call a number featured on an e-mail you suspect is fraudulent, and be sure to cross-check any numbers you do call with companies you know and trust.</li><li><b>Contain real phone numbers.</b> Some of the telephone numbers listed in fake e-mails may be legitimate, connecting to actual companies. Just like with links to legitimate websites (above), fraudsters include real phone numbers in an effort to make the e-mail appear legitimate.</li></ul><h3>Example of a fake email:</h3><p><img title="Fake E-mail" alt="Fake E-mail" src="/images/business/footer-FakeEmail.gif"></p><h3>Trojan horses</h3><p>These fake e-mails may also contain a virus known as a "Trojan horse" that can record your keystrokes. The virus may live in an attachment or be accessed via a link in the e-mail.</p><p>Again, OneWest Bank customers should keep in mind that we do not request personal information via e-mail or send e-mail attachments. Never respond to e-mails, open attachments, or click on links from suspicious or unknown senders.</p><p>If you're not sure if an OneWest Bank e-mail is legitimate, report it to us via our <a title="Notify Us" href="#" class="gtAccordion" data-tab="securitypolicy" data-acc="notifyus">Notify Us</a> link without replying to the e-mail you received.</p><h3>How is my e-mail address obtained by online fraudsters?</h3><p>E-mail addresses can be obtained from publicly-available sources or through randomly-generated lists. Therefore, if you receive a fake e-mail that appears to be from OneWest Bank, this does not mean that your e-mail address, name or any other information has been taken from OneWest Bank's systems.</p><h3>Counterfeit websites</h3><p>Online thieves often direct you to fraudulent websites via e-mail and pop-up windows and try to collect your personal information. In many cases there is no easy way to determine that you are on a phony website because the URL will contain the name of the institution it is spoofing. However, if you type (or cut and paste) the URL into a new web browser window and it does not take you to a legitimate website, or you get an error message, it was probably counterfeit website.</p><p>Another way to detect a phony website is to consider how you arrived there. Generally, you were directed by a link in a fake e-mail requesting your account information. Again, OneWest Bank will not request personal information from customers via e-mail. Any unsolicited request should be considered fraudulent and reported immediately via our <a title="Notify Us" href="#" class="gtAccordion" data-tab="securitypolicy" data-acc="notifyus">Notify Us</a> link.</p><h3>How can I prevent online fraud?</h3><p>With a few simple steps, you can help protect your OneWest Bank accounts and personal information from fake e-mails and websites:</p><ul class="circle"><li>Delete suspicious e-mails without opening them. If you do open a suspicious e-mail, do not open any attachments or click on any links it may contain.</li><li>Never provide sensitive account or personal information in response to an e-mail. If you have entered personal information, notify OneWest Bank immediately via our <a title="Notify Us" href="#" class="gtAccordion" data-tab="securitypolicy" data-acc="notifyus">Notify Us</a> link.</li></ul><h3>Avoiding malware:</h3><ul class="circle"><li>Keep a “clean” machine: Set your security software, Internet browser, and operating system (like Windows or Mac operating systems) to update automatically. Ensure your Internet browser setting is set to detect unauthorized downloads.</li><li>Instead of clicking on a link in an e-mail, type the URL of the site you want directly into your Internet browser. Criminals send e-mails that may appear to be from known, trusted sources, but clicking them could download malware or send you to a spoofed site designed to steal your personal information.</li><li>Don’t open e-mail attachments unless you can confirm the sender and the content of the attachment.</li><li>Download and install software only from websites you know and trust.</li><li>StaySafeOnline.org and OnGuardOnline.gov contain user-friendly information on commonly used, free security software as well as safe computing best practices.</li></ul><h3>Detecting and removing malware:</h3><ul class="circle"><li>Update your security software, and then run it to scan your computer for viruses and spyware. Delete anything it identifies as a problem. You may have to restart your computer for the changes to take effect.</li><li>If your computer is covered by a warranty that offers free tech support, contact the manufacturer. Before you call, write down the model and serial number of your computer, the name of any software you've installed, and a short description of the problem.</li><li>Many companies – including some affiliated with retail stores – offer tech support on the phone, online, at their store, and in your home. Decide which is most convenient for you. Telephone and online help generally are the least expensive, but you may have to do some of the work yourself. Taking your computer to a store usually is less expensive than hiring a repair person to come into your home.</li><li>Once your computer is back up and running, think about how malware could have been downloaded to your machine, and what you could do differently to avoid it in the future.</li></ul></dd><dt><a href="#" id="phishingschemes"><span class="signal">expand +</span>Phishing Schemes</a></dt><dd><p><b>Updated January 15, 2009</b></p><p>The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) is warning consumers, businesses and financial institutions to be aware of fraudulent e-mails allegedly from the Federal Reserve Bank.
