	<h1>Privacy Policy for Websites Under Domain imsa.edu</h1>


<!-- to dynamically include an image name it "header_privacy.png" in the appropriate directory -->

	
<h2>Preamble</h2>
<p>Pursuant to the fundamental philosophy of the American constitutional form of government, it is declared to be the public policy of the Illinois Mathematics and Science Academy® that all persons are entitled to full and complete information regarding the affairs of government and the official acts and policies of those who represent them as public officials and public employees. The access to this information is not intended to be used to violate individual privacy, nor to further a commercial enterprise, nor to disrupt the duly-undertaken work of any public body independent of the fulfillment of any of the rights of the people to access the information.</p>


<h2>Sharing of Information</h2>
<p>
</p><p>Information collected and received via any website in the domain imsa.edu is for the sole use of the Illinois Mathematics and Science Academy® (<q>IMSA</q>) and the organizations with which it is formally affiliated. Submitted information will not be otherwise shared without consent. Affiliated organizations include, in part:</p>

<ul>
	<li>student organizations at IMSA</li>
	<li>the <a href="/giving/">IMSA Fund for the Advancement of Education</a>,</li>
	<li>the <a href="http://parents.imsa.edu/">IMSA Parents' Association</a>,</li>
	<li>the <a href="http://www.iaa.org/">IMSA Alumni Association</a>,</li>
	<li>and educational institutions with which <a href="/programs/">The Center @ IMSA</a> works.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Personal Information and Choice</h2>
<p><q>Personal information</q> is information about an individual that is readily identifiable to that specific individual. Personal information includes personal identifiers such as an individual's name, address, phone number, drivers license number and social security number. A domain name or Internet Protocol address is not considered personal information. We collect no personal information about you unless you voluntarily participate in an activity that asks for information (e.g., sending an e-mail or participating in a survey). If you choose not to participate in these activities, your choice will in no way affect your ability to use any other feature of the Academy web site. If personal information is requested on the web site or volunteered by the user, State law and the federal Privacy Act of 1974 may protect it. However, this information is a public record once you provide it, and may be subject to public inspection and copying if not protected by federal or state law.</p>

<!--h2>Policies for Individuals Under 13 Years of Age</h2>
<p>The Illinois Mathematics and Science Academy&reg; is committed to complying fully with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act. Accordingly, if you are under the age of 13, you are not authorized to provide us with personally identifying information, and we will not use any such information in our database or other data collection activities. We appreciate your cooperation with this federally mandated requirement. Users are cautioned that the collection of personal information volunteered by children on-line or by e-mail will be treated the same as information given by an adult and may be subject to public access.</p-->

<h2>Webserver Logs</h2>
<p>The Illinois Mathematics and Science Academy®, like most institutions, records information about each access to its website, such as when it was accessed, the Internet Protocol address of what accessed it, and which pages were visited. While some of this information is, to a limited degree, personally identifiable, IMSA uses no webserver log information to identify any individual. The information is instead only used by a limited number of IMSA employees for identifying how popular various parts of IMSA's websites are, responding to any errors that website visitors might encounter, and otherwise improving our sites' utility.</p>

<h2>Correspondence</h2>
<p>If during your visit to the Academy's website you participate in a survey or send an e-mail, the following additional information will be collected:</p>

<ol>
	<li>E-mail correspondence: The e-mail address and contents of the e-mail. We may use your e-mail to respond appropriately. This may be to respond to you, to address issues you identify, to further improve our web site, or to forward the e-mail to another agency for appropriate action.</li>
	<li>Surveys : Any information you volunteered in response to a survey. Survey information is used for the purpose designated. The information collected is not limited to text characters and may include audio, video, and graphic information formats that you have provided.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Cookies</h2>
<p>The Illinois Mathematics and Science Academy® uses cookies to:</p>
<ul>
	<!--li>track visits to its website in accord with the purposes listed under the heading <cite>Web Logs</cite> in this document,</li-->
	<li>allow users of intranet.imsa.edu, a website for IMSA students, faculty, staff, and alumni, to remain logged in to it for a limited period of time after initially having authenticated themselves with a username and password, and</li>
	<li>ensuring that certain photos on IMSA's websites change from visit to visit.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Link Disclaimer</h2>
<p>The Illinois Mathematics and Science Academy® has links to other websites. These include links to web sites operated by other government agencies, nonprofit organizations and private businesses. When you link to another site, you are no longer on a site covered by this Privacy Notice. When you link to another web site, you are subject to the privacy policy of that new site.</p>

<!--h2>This Website and FERPA (Federal Education Records Privacy Act)</h2>
<p>
<p>IMSA acts in good faith to adhere to the <a href = "http://www.ed.gov/policy/gen/guid/fpco/ferpa/index.html">Federal Education Records Privacy Act</a> (20 U.S.C. &#167; 1232g; 34 CFR Part 99), which is a law that applies to the records of students and alumni of IMSA and its external programs.</p>

<h3>Directory Information</h3>

<p>The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) requires that IMSA, with certain exceptions, obtain written consent prior to the disclosure of personally identifiable information from a child's education records. However, IMSA may disclose appropriately designated <q>directory information</q> without written consent, unless a given student or his or her parent has advised the District to the contrary. Examples of directory information on this website include, in part:</p>

<ul>
	<li>The <a href = "/people/directory/">IMSA Community Directory</a>, which includes the names, e-mail addresses, and, at their authors' discretion, the website addresses of IMSA students, staff, faculty, and alumni.</li>
	<li>Lists of participants in or leaders of student activities, such as under <a href = "/living/">Living @ IMSA</a>.</li>
	<li>Announcements of student and alum accomplishements, such as in our <a href = "/news/releases/">press releases</a>, <a href = "/news/features/">features</a>, or the <a href = "/alumni/">Alumni</a> section of our website.</li>
</ul>

<p>Directory information, which is information that is generally not considered harmful or an invasion of privacy if released, can also be disclosed to outside organizations without a parent's prior written consent. Outside organizations include, but are not limited to, companies that manufacture class rings or publish yearbooks. In addition, two federal laws require local educational agencies (LEAs) receiving assistance under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (ESEA) to provide military recruiters, upon request, with three directory information categories - names, addresses and telephone listings -- unless parents have advised the LEA that they do not want their student's information disclosed without their prior written consent.</p>

<p>If you do not want IMSA to disclose directory information from your child's education records without your prior written consent, you must notify IMSA in writing. IMSA designates the following as directory information:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Student's name</li>
	<li>Participation in officially recognized activities and sports</li>
	<li>Address</li>
	<li>Telephone listing</li>
	<li>Weight and height of members of athletic teams</li>
	<li>Electronic mail address</li>
	<li>Website address</li>
	<li>Photograph</li>
	<li>Degrees, honors, and awards received</li>
	<li>Date and place of birth</li>
	<li>Major field of study</li>
	<li>Dates of attendance</li>
	<li>Grade level</li>
	<li>The most recent educational agency or institution attended</li>
</ul></p>

<h2>This Website and the Illinois School Student Records Act</h2>

<p>IMSA acts in good faith to adhere to the <a href = "http://www.ed.gov/policy/gen/guid/fpco/ferpa/index.html">Illinois School Student Records Act</a> (105 ILCS 10), which is a law that applies to the records of students and alumni of IMSA and its external programs.</p-->
