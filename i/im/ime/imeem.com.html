<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
imeem, inc. operates the imeem service, imeem.com and
imeem.net websites and distributes imeem software. The imeem
service allows you to connect, communicate and collaborate with
your friends across the Internet while enjoying the same privacy
and security as a private network. Friends are people you choose to
connect with and who agree to connect with you. Of course, friends
can be social friends, business associates, classmates, members of
your church, or teammates in your softball league. imeem is
implemented as a peer network where every computer that a member
downloads the imeem client onto is a peer. Peers can cache (i.e.
store locally) certain information as described below.
<p>Your privacy is very important to us. To help you
understand how your privacy is protected we provide an explanation
of various parts of the system below: By using imeem, you consent
to the collection and use of your personal information as outlined
in the Privacy Policy.</p>

<p>Users have the ability to choose who will be able to link, chat, and 
send notes to them, as well as who can invite them to join meems.  
Users may also have the option to edit their privacy settings.</p>

<h2>Information gathered by imeem</h2>
<p>
For visitors to our website and registered users, we
log standard technical information, such as your IP address. If you
choose to register with us, imeem requires you to provide your
name, email address, and each subscriber has a user ID and password
that they choose. To maintain privacy it is important not to share
your password with anyone. Selecting a longer password with a mix
of letters, numbers and symbols makes it more difficult for others
to guess your password. It is also helpful to change passwords on a
regular basis. In addition, imeem may optionally ask you to provide
your physical address and other demographic information, such as
age, gender, interests or occupation, as well as credit card
information for verification purposes. We may collect other
personal information when you provide feedback or comments, or
communicate with others through our systems.</p>
<p>imeem uses cookies to administer its website and
provide a more tailored and user-friendly service to you. For
example, we may use cookies to count the number of unique computers
accessing our website. You can set your browser to refuse
cookies.</p>
<h2>Profile information</h2>
<p>
Your user profile contains information about you that
you may want to share with others. The list of privacy setting for
your profile includes an option "myself" so that no one else will
be able to view your profile. Other options allow you to specify
how much and how broadly your profile information should be cached
and viewable throughout the imeem network or via the web.</p>
<p>Protecting the privacy of your profile is your
responsibility: We caution you not to share sensitive information
(such as social security numbers, credit card numbers, or driver's
license numbers) with other users whom you do not know or place
such information in your profile. We may use profile information
for the purposes of providing our services to you, such as to
analyze our demographics, or to better personalize our various
offerings for users.</p>
<p>Additionally, any information you choose to display on imeem.com, 
including your profile, will be viewable by the entire Web (open to the world).</p>
<h2>Meems</h2>
<p>
Meems are topics that can be shared and discussed
within the network. In many cases the meems we choose to connect
with help define our personality -- hobbies, favorite artists,
current events we are passionate about, and organizations we belong
to. The creator of a meem may choose to make it open to everyone
within the imeem network or to restrict membership to a specific
group of people they choose.</p>

<h2>Instant messages</h2>
<p>
When you communicate with a friend in an instant
message we endeavor to authenticate both sides to make sure they
are who they say they are. The system is designed to encrypt the
messages as they traverse the Internet to your friend, without
being cached in the peer network.</p>

<h2>Search</h2>
<p>
All search results in imeem are personally generated
for you based not only on what is popular, but also on what
interests you based on your profile, meems you connect to, and what
your friends connect to. In an effort to maintain your privacy,
search results are produced by an autonomous algorithm that runs
directly on your computer as part of the imeem client. Advertising
results are also designed to be most relevant to you and be
separated from your search results. Search results may link to
other locations within the imeem network or websites on the
Internet. Data about searches and search results may be maintained
by imeem to help in continually improving the service.</p>

<h2>Inviting others and sending notes</h2>
<p>
If you invite another person to join imeem, we will
ask for that person's name and online contact information. We use
this information to contact and inform that person that he or she
has been invited to download our software. We will send reminders
only with your express consent.</p>
<p>Invitations and notes do not go though our encrypted network, as 
they are sent via email.  These may be monitored for abuse.</p>

<h2>imeem's use of information</h2>
<p>
The information we collect about you in the course of
our relationship is used to provide our software and services to
you. For example, even as we endeavor to protect your identity, we
may use your demographic information to create a database of user
profiles, select advertisements based on your information and for
marketing analysis. In addition, we look at technical information
to diagnose problems with our server, to administer the imeem.com
site, to enhance our products and to provide our service to
you.</p>
<p>We may share personally identifiable information
about our users with third parties, including: (1) with your
consent or as otherwise stated in this Privacy Policy; (2) when we
have a good faith belief it is necessary pursuant to a subpoena or
other judicial or administrative order; (3) where required by law;
or (4) at our sole discretion, where we deem necessary to respond
to claims, to protect the safety of any individual or the public,
or to protect the rights or property of imeem or any third
party.</p>
<p>In the event of a change of ownership or a direct
merger with or acquisition by another entity, your information may
be transferred to the acquiring entity. You have the option to
request the removal of your account specific information at any
time.</p>

<h2>Third parties</h2>
<p>
imeem may provide links to third party websites or
allow other companies, called third-party ad servers, to display
advertisements to users. Ad server companies can write and read
their own cookies on your computer, just as if you had requested a
web page from their website. imeem is not responsible for, and does
not have any control over, the privacy practices or the content of
such third parties. We encourage users to read the privacy policies
of any website visited.</p>

<h2>Updating or removing user information</h2>
<p>
You may choose to correct or update the information
you have submitted to us by editing your profile or account
information. If you request to have your information removed, imeem
will remove it from its active database, though it may continue to
persist on back-up media.</p>

<h2>Use by children prohibited</h2>
<p>
imeem complies with the Children's Online Privacy
Protection Act and will not knowingly collect personally
identifiable information from anyone under the age of 13.</p>

<h2>Changes to our policies</h2>
<p>
imeem's Privacy Policy may change from time to time.
If we make any substantive changes to our policies, we will notify
registered users by posting bulletins on the imeem service, by
email at the address provided by you, or by posting notice of
changes at <a href="privacy.aspx">http://www.imeem.com/privacy.aspx</a>. Your use of the
website or the imeem Software after the changes constitutes your
agreement with regard to information collected from you in the past
and in the future.</p>

<h2>Information storage and security</h2>
<p>
imeem's computers store user account information, and
may cache user profile information for backup and synchronization
purposes. imeem also maintains peer servers that can provide access
to cached information when peers that would otherwise provide it
are logged off of the network. imeem employs industry standard
security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse and
alteration of the information under our control.</p>
<p>imeem allows folders to be shared privately with members of the imeem network. Only friends who
have been authorized to share a particular folder can see that the
folder exists at all, see what objects are inside or access those
objects. The objects in the folder remain on your system and are
not cached or indexed in any way by the network.
The contents of a meem are cached within the network.  When photos are shared with friends, 
they are uploaded to the imeem server, and friends may be able to cache them.
</p>
<p>The imeem software is designed so that the content
you generate within the network (meems, blogs, forums, photo albums, etc.)
will each have an associated privacy setting. If the information
being created has its own privacy control (i.e. when creating a blog), it is the users responsibility to select the desired
privacy setting upon creation. Other items may inherit an existing privacy setting. In
this case, it is the user's responsibility to understand the
associated privacy setting before creating content to ensure the
handling of their information meets their expectations.</p>
<p>Please note that information stored or cached on
other users' computers is subject to those users security
practices, which are beyond imeem's control. Although we make good
faith efforts to store information collected or stored by imeem in
a secure manner, we cannot guarantee complete security. Information
held by imeem will be maintained for a length of time appropriate
to our business needs.</p>
