<h1>IMVU, Inc. Privacy Policy</h1>

<p>You can generally visit our Site without revealing any personally identifiable information about yourself. However, in certain sections of this Site we may invite you to participate in surveys, questionnaires or contests, provide us with feedback, participate in chat / message boards, complete a profile / registration form, contact us with questions, comments, or request information. Due to the nature of some of these activities, we may collect PII such as your name, address, email address, phone number, age or date of birth, username, password, gender, credit card number, and other contact information that you voluntarily transmit with your communication to us. IMVU may also collect PII that you provide to us when you contact us (via phone, email, chat, or other method of requesting assistance) or that you voluntarily post in our world, blogs, chat rooms, forums, and message boards available from our Site.</p>
<p>Additionally, IMVU may also collect non-PII such as the aggregate information described below in the "How is your PII being used" section and such other non-PII as statistics about machines running our software, so as to further understand and enhance the user experience, marketing, security, enforcement, and system integrity (prevention of hacks, unauthorized use, etc). IMVU may also use small text files (called “cookies”) stored in the user’s browser cache to improve and track the overall Site experience. This text file does not contain PII and can be removed from your browser – for more information please see your browsers “Help” section.</p>

("Vivox") provides such chat technology and that Vivox may access certain PII about you through your use of the voice chat services on this Site, including diagnostic information sent automatically after an error.  You understand that Vivox may monitor and store your voice communications.  Vivox will use your PII it receives as set forth in the Vivox privacy policy available at <a href="http://www.nkt.vivox.com/docs/Vivox_Privacy_Notice.pdf">http://www.nkt.vivox.com/docs/Vivox_Privacy_Notice.pdf</a></p>

<h2>Third Party Advertisements</h2>
<p>Certain advertisements that appear on this Site are sometimes delivered (or "served") directly to users by third party advertisers. Some of these third party advertisers automatically receive certain of your personally identifiable information through your interaction with an advertisement. These third party advertisers may also download non-personally identifiable cookies to your computer, or use other technologies such as "web beacons" to measure the effectiveness of their ads and to personalize advertising content. Their use of your personally identifiable information will be governed by the terms of their privacy policies and their privacy policies may explain the way in which you can "opt-out" of certain tracking by their advertisements.</p>

<h1>Retention, security, and use of your PII</h1>

<h2>How is your PII retained &amp; secured?</h2>
<p>We employ procedural and technological measures that are designed to help protect your PII from loss, unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration or destruction. IMVU may use firewalls, password protection, secure socket layer, database encryption, and other security measures to help prevent unauthorized access to your PII.</p>

<p>Additionally, we may collect aggregate information regarding your transactions on this Site, such as the virtual goods you create, sell and/or purchase, the virtual price for such virtual goods, the profit you make by selling such virtual goods (collectively, “Transactional Data”).

Article 26 of the European Union’s Data Protection Directive (Directive 95/46/EC, 1995 O.J. (L 281) 31) allows for transfer of personal data from the European Union to a third country if the individual has unambiguously given his consent to the transfer of personal information, regardless of the third country's level of protection. By agreeing to the <a href="http://www.imvu.com/catalog/web_info.php?section=Info&amp;topic=terms_of_service">Terms of Service</a> and this Privacy Policy, you consent to the transfer of all such information to the United States of America which may not offer an equivalent level of protection to that required in the European Union and to the processing of that information by IMVU on its servers located in the United States of America as described in this Privacy Policy.</p>

<h2>Correction/Updating Personally Identifiable Information</h2>
<p>IMVU provides you with the ability to review, correct and delete the PII that you have provided to us in your account.

<p>If you have any questions regarding this Privacy Policy please contact us via email at <a href="mailto:privacy@imvu.com">privacy@imvu.com</a>.</p>

<h2>Disclosure</h2>
<p>We may provide your PII and the data generated by cookies and the aggregate information to the vendors and service agencies that we may engage to assist us in providing our services to you. For example, we may provide your PII to a credit card processing company to process your payment. In IMVU's sole discretion. IMVU may report to law enforcement or other appropriate government authorities any actions that may be suspicious or illegal, and any reports it receives of such conduct and in conjunction with such report, may disclose your PII to law enforcement or other appropriate government authorities. When legally required or at IMVU's discretion, IMVU will disclose your PII and may cooperate with law enforcement or appropriate government agencies in any investigation. We will not sell your PII to any company or organization except we may transfer your PII to a successor entity upon a merger, consolidation or other corporate reorganization in which IMVU participates or to a purchaser of all or substantially all of IMVU's assets to which this Site relates.</p>
<p>Additionally, if you “opt-in”, we may provide your PII to certain companies with which we have a relationship to allow them to send you targeted offers and pre-populate offers that they believe you may be interested in receiving.</p>
