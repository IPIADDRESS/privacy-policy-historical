			<h2>About the site itself</h2>
			<dl>
	<dt>What is the purpose of this site?</dt>
	<dd>This site can be used to find in which movie a particular car is visible, or to have more info about some cars visible in a particular movie.
		 You will also find lots of pictures of these cars, taken directly from the movies.</dd>
	<dt>Do you sell movies? Do you sell vehicles? Can I download a movie from your site?</dt>
	<dd>No. As said above this site is only for information purpose, we do not sell anything, and do not distribute any movie.</dd>
	<dt>How much movies/cars are listed? What is the most common make?</dt>
	<dd>You can find all these info on the <a href="stats.php">Statistics page</a>.</dd>
	<dt>Who made this site? How can I help you?</dt>
	<dd>The content of the site is the result of the cooperative work of several people that like cars and movies, especially when the two are mixed together.
		 There are some administators, of course, but anybody can contribute to the site by sending new pictures, complete missing info, add comments about cars
		 or movies or help us to recognize <a href="vehicles.php?unknown">unidentified vehicles</a>.</dd>
	<dt>Is the site complete? Why don't you list this movie? Why is this vehicle missing?</dt>
	<dd>This kind of site will never be complete. There are so many movies that we cannot list all of them. We try to include as much information as possible,
		 but we cannot put all existing info, and we also have to put some limits on what we include in the site (e.g. we cannot list all background cars of each
		 movie).</dd>
	<dt>I found an error/misnamed vehicle. I want to add a missing vehicle. I want to send you a new picture for a vehicle. How I can do that?</dt>
	<dd>To add info or correct existing info, you can directly post in the comments on the movie and vehicle pages. For that you must <a href="login.php?op=create">create
		 an account</a> and then <a href="login.php">login</a>. Then you will be also be able to add new movie/vehicle entries and pictures to be validated. You can also contact 
		 us via e-mail, cf <a href="#Contact">Contact</a> section above.</dd>
	<dt>Why can't I directly correct the info on the site? Why do I have to wait for validatrion when I add pictures? What shall I do to become administrator?</dt>
	<dd>To prevent problems only a few people are allowed to edit the data of the site or validate new entries. The administrators are the most active and reliable members, 
		 usually those who sent a lot of pictures that did not require further work (i.e. following all the rues) or that were able to identify quickly and acurately lots of cars.
		So after some time you may be prompted to become an administrator if you are in one of those cases.</dd>
	<dt>What is the source of the pictures?</dt>
	<dd>We try to use only captures coming from the movie. These can either come from the movie trailers published before the movie release, or from the full movie once it is
		broadcasted on TV, legal streaming, or available on DVD or Blu-Ray. We try to avoid captures from illegal sources (movie pre-releases or pirate cams in theatre).<br> 
		We do not use photos taken on set either, as these are often directly copyrighted and do not especially represent correctly how the vehicle appears in the movie.</dd>
	<dt>I found an image stolen from another site</dt>
	<dd>That may happen. In some cases, it may be a site that uses an image that comes from IMCDb (since we often have such requests). Sometimes webmasters of similar sites
		provide us pictures from their site. There may also be pictures that were sent by users that did not say where they found these pictures. Anyway, in such case it
		may be better to put a link to the original site of the picture. If you see a picture from your site and want it to be removed, contact us (thought these pictures
		only belong to those that have the rights on the movie).</dd>
	</dl>
			<h2>Movies</h2>
			<dl>
	<dt>How can I find a movie on the site?</dt>
	<dd>Use the title search box located in the top right corner of each page. You can also use the <a href="search.php">search page</a> or the <a href="movies.php">movie
		list page</a>.</dd>
	<dt>I cannot find a particular movie</dt>
	<dd>Try to enter only a part of the title (e.g. one word, or the title without the "The"), in some cases the title can be written either with a dash ("-") or a space.
		You may also use the "similar to" option rather than "contains", on the search page. 
		If you still cannot find the movie, it may simply mean that it is not yet listed on the site.</dd>
	</dl>
			<h2>Vehicles</h2>
			<dl>
	<dt>I saw car Y in movie Z, why is it not included?</dt>
	<dd>Maybe because only few cars for a movie were listed (i.e. nobody watched the movie completely to list important cars), maybe we missed it, or maybe it was not
		estimated important enough. For example, a Citroën DS in a 1960/1970 French movie is not especially interesting if visible in the background since they are visible
		in nearly all French movies of these years.</dd>
	<dt>I searched for Mini but I could find only new ones</dt>
	<dd>Most of them are listed under the Austin make, some under Morris or Rover. For such vehicle you can do a search on "Mini" as model and leave the "Make" field
		empty.</dd>
	<dt>What are these numbers/letters between "[...]" in the model names?</dt>
	<dd>For some makes, we use the official contructor type number since the model name is not always possible to guess, and not always useful. This is especially the
		case for the Mercedes and BMW, but we also extended it to other makes/models like Jaguar XJ, Volkswagen (mostly for Beetles and Busses), Chevrolet Corvette,
		Porsche, Lotus, Rover, VAZ-Lada, ...</dd>
	<dt>Why is this Renault 5 listed as a Renault LeCar? Why some Dodge Viper are listed as Chrysler Viper?</dt>
	<dd>We tried to keep the same convention for all cars: we use the name that the car had in the country where the movie is supposed to take place. So
		in a US movie the Renault 5 is called LeCar, and in a French movie the pre-2004 Viper models are Chrysler, for example.</dd>
	<dt>What are exactly these stars? Why only 2 stars for this car that is used by a character?</dt>
	<dd>
	 <ul>
		 <li>1 star: vehicle that has no interaction the story, character or one of the other vehicle. Some may be visible less than one second, some may be visible for
			 a long time.</li>
		 <li>2 stars: a short action, or a minor action, like a crash or a taxi that leaves one of the character. For cars used by a character only in a short sequence
			 we also sometime use this rating, since the car is not visible for a long time in the movie.</li>
		 <li>3 to 5 stars: this depends of the importance of the vehicle in the movie, the time that it is seen on the screen and the importance of the character that uses
			 it. It is quite difficult to explain but usually when the car has at least three stars it means that is seen for at least a few minutes in the movie.</li>
	 </ul>
	</dd>
	<dt>What kind of vehicles are listed?</dt>
	<dd>At first we were only listing cars, but we quickly added bikes, trucks and busses. Recently the site was extended to special vehicles like farming vehicles,
		earthmoving equipment and warehouse/airport vehicles. We won't include trains, trams, planes, boats or non-motorized vehicles.</dd>
	<dt>How are selected the years of the vehicles?</dt>
	<dd>For lots of US cars it is quite easy: some details allow to find the exact years. But for other cars it is impossible, so we put the year when the car model
		was released. For some vehicle the date may be wrong, or we may have missed a detail that allows a more precise identification of the year. In that case, do
		not hesitate to notify this (see above in the "I found an error/misnamed vehicle" section).</dd>

	<div class="Box" id="HelpGuidelines">
		<h1 class="BoxTitle"><img src="styles/gold/fond4.gif" alt="" class="Bullet"> Guidelines for pictures published on the site</h1>
		<div class="BoxContents">
			<p><i>Note: in the following, "Post" means to publish or put a picture (or comment) on the site.</i></p>
<h2>Guidelines for posting pictures as new vehicle page for a movie</h2>
<ul>
<li>Pictures must contain sufficient detail for potential identification of the vehicle.</li>
<li>Do not post trains, trams, planes, boats or non-motorized vehicles. They are tolerated in the comments, though.</li>
<li>Do not post generic cartoon cars as individual vehicle pages. If they are not identifiable as a real model, put them in comments.</li>
<li>Do not post pictures of model cars seen in a movie, except if they really have an important role. In other cases, they can be posted in comments.</li>
<li>Do not post uncensored pictures involving genital or breast nudity (or any content that may be considered as pornographic or unsuitable for viewing by the general public).</li>
</ul>
<h2>Additional guidelines for background vehicles (note that these apply only to 1-star vehicles)</h2>
<ul>
<li>Do not post very small pictures of background vehicles (note: 90 pixels wide for a 720 pixels image is about the limit for useful pictures of most background cars).</li>
<li>Similar background vehicles in a movie should be regrouped by posting additional images in the comments of a vehicle page.</li>
<li>Do not post background vehicles that are seen through the windows of another car (i.e. far away, seen between actor heads, or when the foreground car is more visible than the background one).</li>
<li>Do not post pictures of background (unrelated to the plot) golf carts or lawn mowers.</li>
<li>Do not post pictures of background vehicles that are blurred or obstructed.</li>
<li>Avoid posting pictures of vehicles that are seen for an extremely short time (for example: can only be seen in a frame by frame advance of the movie).</li>
<li>If a picture has several similar background cars, do not make a separate page for each one.  Rather, make a page for one and list the others in the comments for that page.</li>
<li>No ordinary background "traffic" cars (includes parked cars) for documentaries, reallity-TV or music videos.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note: these guidelines may be relaxed if the picture is large and sharp or a background car is rare or interesting for some other reason.
The contributor should post a comment with the reason for posting the picture if the above guidelines are relaxed for a background car.</p>
<p>Examples of "rare" may include:</p>
<ol>
<li>Only a few were made,</li>
<li>Seldom seen in movies,</li>
<li>Is not common in the country of origin for the movie,</li>
<li>Is old relative to the time frame of the movie.</li>
</ol>
<p>Examples of "interesting" may include:</p>
<ol>
<li>Special edition of an otherwise common vehicle,</li>
<li>Customized cars,</li>
<li>Unique history of a particular car,</li>
<li>Little known facts are available concerning a specific vehicle,</li>
<li>Is an anachronism (car newer than the time frame of the movie).</li>
</ol>
<h2>Deletion of posted content:</h2>
<p>For pictures that are outside these guidelines, users should suggest that they be deleted. Suggestions may be made in the comments 
  section on the IMCDB site or in a topic on the forum. The decision to delete a picture will be made by Antp (chief admin) or by the person who posted it.</p>
