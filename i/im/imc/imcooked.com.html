          <div align="left">
            <ul type="disc">
              <li><strong>User Provided Information:</strong> You provide certain personally identifiable
                information (such as your name and email address) to ImCooked when choosing to participate
                in various activities on the ImCooked Sites such as uploading videos, posting messages

                writeen recipes, taking advantage of promotions, responding to surveys, or subscribing
                to newsletters or other mailing lists. </li>
              <li><strong>Cookies Information:</strong> When you visit the ImCooked Sites, we may send
                one or more cookies - a small text file containing a string of alphanumeric characters
                - to your computer that uniquely identifies your browser. ImCooked uses both session cookies
                and persistent cookies. A persistent cookie remains after you close your browser. Persistent
                cookies may be used by your browser on subsequent visits to the site. Persistent cookies
                can be removed by following your web browser help file directions. A session cookie is
                temporary and disappears after you close your browser. You can reset your web browser to
                refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some features of
                the ImCooked Sites may not function properly if the ability to accept cookies is disabled. </li>
              <li><strong>Log File Information:</strong> When you use the ImCooked Sites, our servers
                automatically record certain information that your web browser sends whenever you visit
                any website. These server logs may include information such as your web request, Internet
                Protocol ("IP")
                address, browser type, browser language, referring / exit pages and URLs, platform type,
                number of clicks, domain names, landing pages, pages viewed and the order of those pages,
                the amount of time spent on particular pages, the date and time of your request, and
                one or more cookies that may uniquely identify your browser. </li>
              <li><strong>Clear GIFs Information:</strong> When you use the ImCooked Sites, we may employ "clear
                GIFs"       (a.k.a. Web Beacons) which are used to track the online usage patterns
                of our Users anonymously (i.e., in a non-personally-identifiable manner). In addition,
                we may also use clear GIFs in HTML-based emails sent to our users to track which emails
                are opened by recipients. </li>

          <div align="left">
            <ul type="disc">
              <li>If you submit personally identifiable information to us through the ImCooked Sites, then
                we use your personal information to operate, maintain, and provide to you the features
                and functionality of the ImCooked Sites. </li>
              <li>Any personal information or video content that you voluntarily disclose online (on discussion
                boards, in messages and chat areas, within your public profile page, etc.) becomes publicly
                available and can be collected and used by others. Your account name (not your email address)
                is displayed to other Users when you upload videos or send messages through the ImCooked
                Sites and other Users can contact you through messages and comments. Any videos that you
                submit to the ImCooked Sites may be redistributed through the internet and other media
                channels, and may be viewed by the general public. </li>
              <li>We do not use your email address or other personally identifiable information to send
                commercial or marketing messages without your consent or except as part of a specific program
                or feature for which you will have the ability to opt-in or opt-out. We may, however, use
                your email address without further consent for non-marketing or administrative purposes
                (such as notifying you of major ImCooked Site changes or for customer service purposes). </li>
              <li>We use both your personally identifiable information and certain non-personally-identifiable
                information (such as anonymous User usage data, cookies, IP addresses, browser type, clickstream
                data, etc.) to improve the quality and design of the ImCooked Sites and to create new features,
                promotions, functionality, and services by storing, tracking, and analyzing User preferences
                and trends. </li>
              <li>We use cookies, clear gifs, and log file information to: (a) remember information so
                that you will not have to re-enter it during your visit or the next time you visit the
                ImCooked Sites; (b) provide custom, personalized content and information; (c) monitor the
                effectiveness of our marketing campaigns; (d) monitor aggregate metrics such as total number
                of visitors, pages viewed, etc.; and (e) track your entries, submissions, and status in
                promotions, sweepstakes, and contests. </li>

          <h2 align="left">When ImCooked Discloses Information</h2>
          <div align="left">
            <ul type="disc">
              <li>We provide personally identifiable information and non-personally-identifiable information
                to our subsidiaries, affiliated companies, or other businesses or persons for the purpose
                of processing such information on our behalf. We require that these parties agree to process
                such information in compliance with our privacy policy, and we use reasonable efforts to
                limit their use of such information and to use other appropriate confidentiality and security

              <li>We do not share your personally identifiable information (such as name or email address)

                to opt-in or opt-out. </li>
              <li>We do share non-personally-identifiable information (such as anonymous User usage data,
                referring / exit pages and URLs, platform types, number of clicks, etc.) with interested
                third-parties to assist them in understanding the usage patterns for certain content, services,
                advertisements, promotions, and/or functionality on the ImCooked Sites. </li>
              <li>We may release personally identifiable information and/or non-personally-identifiable
                information if required to do so by law, or in the good-faith belief that such action is
                necessary to comply with state and federal laws (such as U.S. Copyright Law) or respond
                to a court order, subpoena, or search warrant. </li>
              <li>ImCooked also reserves the right to disclose personally identifiable information and/or

                claims or allegations, to assist government enforcement agencies, to protect the security

          <h2 align="left">Your Choices About Privacy</h2>
          <p align="left">You may, of course, decline to submit personally identifiable information through the ImCooked
            Sites, in which case ImCooked may not be able to provide certain services to you. You may
            update or correct your personal profile information and email preferences at any time by
            visiting your <a href="http://www.youtube.com/my_profile_email">account profile page</a>.
            Please note that media files uploaded by Users to the ImCooked Sites cannot be removed and
            remain subject to our <a href="http://www.youtube.com/t/terms">Terms of Use</a>.<br>
            To protect your privacy and security, we take reasonable steps (such as requesting a unique
            password) to verify your identity before granting you profile access or making corrections.
            You are responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your unique password and account information
            at all times.<br>
            Please contact ImCooked with any questions or comments about this Privacy Notice, your personal
            information, your consent, or your opt-in or opt-out choices using this <a href="http://www.google.com/support/youtube/bin/request.py?hl=en-US">contact

          <h2 align="left">Third-party Advertisers, Links to Other Sites</h2>
          <p align="left">ImCooked allows other companies, called third-party ad servers or ad networks, to serve
            advertisements within the ImCooked Sites. These third-party ad servers or ad networks use
            technology to send, directly to your browser, the advertisements and links that appear on
            the ImCooked Sites. They automatically receive your IP address when this happens. They may
            also use other technologies (such as cookies, JavaScript, or Web Beacons) to measure the
            effectiveness of their advertisements and to personalize the advertising content you see.<br>
            ImCooked does not provide any personally identifiable information to these third-party ad
            servers or ad networks without your consent or except as part of a specific program or feature
            for which you will have the ability to opt-in or opt-out. However, please note that if an
            advertiser asks ImCooked to show an advertisement to a certain audience (for example, men
            ages 18-34) or audience segment (for example, men ages 18-24 who have viewed certain channels
            of content) and you respond to that advertisement, the advertiser or ad-server may conclude
            that you fit the description of the audience they are trying to reach. The advertiser may
            also use information regarding your use of the ImCooked Sites, such as the number of times
            you viewed an ad (but not any personally identifiable information), to determine which ads
            to deliver to you.<br>
            You should consult the respective privacy policies of these third-party ad servers or ad
            networks (see links below) for more information on their practices and for instructions on
            how to opt-out of certain practices. ImCooked's privacy policy does not apply to, and we
            cannot control the activities of, such other advertisers or web sites.</p>
          <h2 align="left">Our Commitment To Data Security</h2>
          <p align="left">ImCooked uses commercially reasonable physical, managerial, and technical safeguards to
            preserve the integrity and security of your personal information. We cannot, however, ensure
            or warrant the security of any information you transmit to ImCooked and you do so at your
            own risk. Once we receive your transmission of information, ImCooked makes commercially reasonable
            efforts to ensure the security of our systems. However, please note that this is not a guarantee
            that such information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of
            any of our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards.<br>
            If ImCooked learns of a security systems breach, then we may attempt to notify you electronically
            so that you can take appropriate protective steps. ImCooked may post a notice on the ImCooked
            Sites if a security breach occurs. Depending on where you live, you may have a legal right
            to receive notice of a security breach in writing. To receive a free written notice of a
            security breach (or to withdraw your consent from receiving electronic notice) you should
            notify us using this <a href="http://www.google.com/support/youtube/bin/request.py?hl=en-US">contact
            form</a>.</p>
          <h2 align="left">Our Commitment To Childrens' Privacy</h2>
          <p align="left">Protecting the privacy of young children is especially important. For that reason, ImCooked
            does not knowingly collect or maintain personally identifiable information or non-personally-identifiable
            information on the ImCooked Sites from persons under 13 years of age, and no part of our
            website is directed to persons under 13. If you are under 13 years of age, then please do
            not use or access the ImCooked Sites at any time or in any manner. If ImCooked learns that
            personally identifiable information of persons under 13 years of age has been collected on
            the ImCooked Sites without verified parental consent, then ImCooked will take the appropriate
            steps to delete this information.</p>
          <h2 align="left">Special Note to International Users</h2>
          <p align="left">The ImCooked Sites are hosted in the United States and are intended for and directed to
            Users in the United States. If you are a User accessing the ImCooked Sites from the European
            Union, Asia, or any other region with laws or regulations governing personal data collection,
            use, and disclosure, that differ from United States laws, please be advised that through
            your continued use of the ImCooked Sites, which are governed by U.S. law, this Privacy Notice,
            and our <a href="http://www.youtube.com/t/terms">Terms of Use</a>, you are transferring your
            personal information to the United States and you consent to that transfer.</p>
          <h2 align="left">In the Event of Merger, Sale, or Bankruptcy</h2>
          <p align="left">In the event that ImCooked is acquired by or merged with a third party entity, we reserve
            the right, in any of these circumstances, to transfer or assign the information we have collected
            from our Users as part of such merger, acquisition, sale, or other change of control. In
            the unlikely event of our bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, receivership, or assignment
            for the benefit of creditors, or the application of laws or equitable principles affecting
            creditors' rights generally, we may not be able to control how your personal information
            is treated, transferred, or used.</p>
          <h2 align="left">Changes and updates to this Privacy Notice</h2>
          <p align="left">This Privacy Notice may be revised periodically and this will be reflected by the  "effective
            date" below. Please revisit this page to stay aware of any changes. In general, we only
            use your personal information in the manner described in the Privacy Notice in effect when
            we received the personal information you provided. Your continued use of the ImCooked Sites
            constitutes your agreement to this Privacy Notice and any future revisions.<br>
            For revisions to this Privacy Notice that may be materially less restrictive on our use or
            disclosure of the personal information you have already provided to us, we will attempt to
            obtain your consent before implementing such revisions with respect to such information.<br>
