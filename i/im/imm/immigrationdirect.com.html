		<h2><u>Information Collection and Use</u></h2>
		<p>Immigration Direct (the “Corporation,” “we” or “us”), respects the privacy concerns of each visitor (a “Visitor,” “you” or “your”) to its website www.immigrationdirect.com (the “Website”) and has created this Privacy Policy to explain the type of information gathered from the Visitor’s visit to and use of the Website and its services, and how such information may be used.  Please take a moment to review this Privacy Policy and feel free to contact us with any questions at
       <a href="mailto:privacy@immigrationdirect.com">privacy@immigrationdirect.com</a><br><br>Changes to this Privacy Policy are discussed at the end of this document.  Each time you use the Website, however, the current version of this Privacy Policy will apply.  Accordingly, each time you use the Website you should check the date of this Privacy Policy (which appears at the end of this document) and review any changes since the last time you used this Website.
<br><br>As a general policy, no “Personally Identifiable Information” (as defined below) is automatically collected from the Visitor’s visit to the Website.  However, certain non-personal information, including the type of browser being used, its operating system and the Visitor’s IP address, may be recorded by the standard operation of the Website’s internet servers.  This information can be used to help diagnose server problems, administer the Website and generally enhance the Visitor’s online experience.
<br><br>Personally Identifiable Information includes, without limitation: (i) contact data (such as a Visitor’s first and last name, physical street address, city, state, zip code, phone number and email address), (ii) financial data (such as a Visitor’s credit card number, expiration date, and verification code), (iii) demographic data (such as a Visitor’s zip code and gender), and (iv) other legal data (such as a Visitor’s social security number and other sensitive information necessary to complete and generate the proper documents).
<br><br>Corporation will collect and use Personally Identifiable Information about you to respond to your request for products or services offered through the Website.  Corporation will also collect this information in order to notify you about products, services, and other opportunities we think will be of interest to you.  By providing Personally Identifiable Information to Corporation, you are consenting to the use and disclosure of your Personally Identifiable Information as described in this Privacy Policy. The information Corporation collects may be from:
<br><br>
</p><ul>
<li>Information provided by you when registering for a form service or product offered through the Website.  For example, you will be required to submit personal information such as your name, address, email, and date of birth to verify your identity prior to establishing your account.</li><br>
<li>Billing information, such as a credit card number, which is required to process the payment for the products or services you order from us.</li><br>
<li>Other information we collect, such as the city of your birth and your mother's maiden name, which is used to verify your identity in the event you forget your login information required for our online products or services.</li><br>
<li>Information you provide Corporation in response to our communications.  For example, Corporation may request that you provide your e-mail address so that we may send you notifications, alerts, special offers and newsletters.</li><br>
<li>Information that you provide to Corporation through customer service correspondence and general feedback.</li><br>
</ul>
We will also collect certain information arising out of your use of the Website, or augment the data we collect with other information from other online or offline sources. Corporation reserves the right to collect information about you and store it in connection with other online or offline information we may possess or obtain about you.  Corrections or updates to your information, including your email address, phone number, mailing address, credit card information or password reminder phrase can be made through the edit profile section of your account if necessary.
<br><br>Personally Identifiable Information will not be sold, leased or otherwise made available to any person or entity not authorized by or associated with the Corporation.  However, please be advised that certain Personally Identifiable Information becomes public record upon the filing of certain documents with the appropriate government agency or court.
<br><br>In addition to the above, Corporation may disclose a Visitor’s information (a) in special cases when the Corporation has reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be causing injury to or interference (either intentionally or unintentionally) with the Corporation’s rights or property, another Visitor or anyone else that could be harmed by such activities; or (b) by operation of law.

Cookies enable the Corporation to track and target the interests of a Visitor to enhance his or her experience on the Website.  We may set and access cookies on your computer to provide you with customized content and to assist in providing the products that you have requested.  We also work with companies who provide services to maintain the Website and enable those service providers the right to use cookies on our website.  Most cookies automatically delete themselves from your hard drive after each session.  Like many other websites, Corporation may automatically track information based upon your behavior on the Website.  Corporation may combine information that we obtain through the use of cookies with Personally Identifiable Information, other aggregate or anonymous data, including a unique identification we may assign you.  As described above, Corporation and third parties authorized by Corporation may use this information to better understand, protect and provide products to you.  The information may include browser type, internet service provider, referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, IP address, and number of clicks, all used to analyze trends, administer the Website, track a Visitor’s movement in the aggregate, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use.  Most web browsers are initially set up to accept cookies; however, a Visitor can reset his or her web browser to reject all cookies.  If a Visitor rejects the cookie, he or she may still use the Website, although the Visitor's access to and use of some areas of the Website may be limited. In addition, if you refuse to accept cookies you agree to assume all responsibility for any resulting loss of functionality.

<p>If the Corporation decides to change its Privacy Policy, the Corporation will post those changes on the Website so that the Visitors are always aware of what information the Corporation collects, how such information is used and under what circumstances, if any, such information is disclosed.  If at any point the Corporation decides to use Personally Identifiable Information in a manner different from that stated at the time it was collected, the Corporation will notify the Visitors by way of email.  Each Visitor will have a choice whether or not we use his or her information in this different manner.

<h2><u>Visitor's Acceptance of These Terms</u></h2>
<p>By using the Website, the Visitor signifies his or her acceptance of all terms set forth in the Corporation’s Privacy Policy.  If the Visitor does not agree to accept all or any portion of such terms, then the Visitor is respectfully asked not to use the Website.  The Corporation reserves the right to modify, alter or otherwise update this Privacy Policy at any time, so Visitors are encouraged to review this Privacy Policy from time to time.

Corporation may, in its sole discretion, change this Privacy Policy from time to time.  Any and all changes to Corporation’s Privacy Policy will also be reflected on this page.  Unless Corporation obtains your express consent, any revised Privacy Policy will apply only to information collected after such time as the revised Privacy Policy takes effect, and not to information collected under any earlier Privacy Policies.  If your Personally Identifiable Information will be used in a manner different from that stated at the time you provided such Personally Identifiable Information to Corporation, Corporation will notify you via email and you will have a choice as to whether or not Corporation uses your Personally Identifiable Information in this different manner.
