    <h2><a name="privacy" id="privacy"></a>Privacy statement</h2>
    <p>The <em>Privacy Act 1988</em> defines personal information as 'information or an opinion (including information or an opinion forming part of a database), whether true or not, and whether recorded in a material form or not, about an individual whose identity is apparent, or can reasonably be ascertained, from the information or opinion'.</p>
    <p>The Department of Immigration and Citizenship 
      (DIAC) manages this website and treats personal information 
      as confidential.</p>
    <p>The <em>Privacy Act 1988</em> is the key law designed 
      to protect your rights and prevent misuse of personal information collected 
      by government agencies such as this department. </p>
    <p>Also, information received by this department is protected from unauthorised use and disclosure by virtue of specific provisions in the <em>Migration Act 
      1958</em>, <em>Crimes Act 1914</em>, <em>Public Service Act 1999</em> and the <em>Public Service Regulations 1999</em>.</p>
    <p>A breach of these laws may make an officer liable to criminal and/or civil penalty.</p>
    <p>As a general rule, we do not collect personal information about you when you visit this site. You can generally visit this site without telling 
      us who you are, unless you choose to provide such information.</p>
    <p>This website contains links to other sites. The immigration website is 
      not responsible for the content and the privacy practices of other websites 
      and the department encourages you to read each site's privacy policies.</p>
    <h2><a name="security" id="security"></a>Security of information</h2>
    <p>The <em>Privacy Act 1988</em> has specific provisions that prohibit any officer of this department (or any other government department) from collecting, using or disclosing anyone's personal information except in performing their duties and in specific situations permitted by law. </p>
    <p>Your personal information will not be disclosed unless the law permits 
      it or your permission is given.</p>
    <p>While the department provides a secure environment, you should be aware there are inherent risks associated with the transmission of information via the Internet.</p>
