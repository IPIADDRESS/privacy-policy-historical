    DIMA Internet Site - Privacy Statement</h2>
  <p>The <em>Privacy Act 1988</em> defines personal information as '....information, 
    about an individual whose identity is apparent or can be reasonably ascertained 
    from the information or opinion'.</p>
  <p>The Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (DIMA) treats personal 
    information as confidential. Information received by DIMA is protected from 
    unauthorised disclosure by virtue of the <em>Migration Act 1958, Crimes Act 
    1914, </em>the <em>Privacy Act 1988, Public Service Act 1999</em> and the 
    Public Service Regulations 1999. A breach of these laws makes an officer liable 
    to criminal and/or civil penalty.</p>
  <h3><font color="#800000">Security of Information</font></h3>
  <p>The <em>Migration Act 1958</em> has specific provisions that prohibit any 
    officer of DIMA (or any other government department) from accessing, recording 
    or disclosing anyone's personal information except in performing their duties 
    or in specific situations permitted by migration laws. Along with the legislation 
    mentioned above, the Migration Act has severe penalties for breaking these 
    provisions. </p>
  <p>Your personal information will not be released unless the law permits it 
    or your permission is given. While DIMA provides a secure environment, you 
    should be aware there are inherent risks associated with the transmission 
    of information via the Internet. For those who do not wish to use the Internet, 
    DIMA provides alternate ways (for example, fax, letter and office visits) 
    of obtaining and providing information. For alternative contact details, please 
    see the relevant entry in the DIMA <a href="../wwi/contents.htm">World Index</a>. 
    In some circumstances, DIMA guidelines may require us to send particular information 
    by non-electronic means.</p>
<p>To improve security, some (not all) of the electronic forms that include personal information have been secured under the HTTPS protocol (<b>H</b>yper<b>T</b>ext <b>T</b>ransport <b>P</b>rotocol <b>S</b>ecure).  HTTPS is a standard Web communication protocol that encrypts and decrypts a message for online transmission.  In Netscape Navigator 3.0 and earlier, the broken key symbol in the lower-left corner of your browser window becomes solid when you are in secure mode.  In Netscape Communicator 4.0 and above, the padlock symbol in the corner, usually open, is closed in secure mode.  In Internet Explorer 4.0 and above, a closed padlock appears when you are in secure mode.</p>
  <h3><font color="#800000">Site Visit Data</font></h3>
  <p>This website is operated by DIMA with outsourced technical assistance. When 
    visiting this site, a record of your visit is logged. Information is recorded 
    for statistical purposes and is used by DIMA to monitor the use of the site, 
    and to make improvements. The information we log when you access our website 
    is:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>the user's IP address; </li>
    <li>the date and time of the visit to the site; </li>
    <li>the pages accessed and the documents downloaded; </li>
    <li>the user's operating system (for example, Windows NT, Windows 95, MAC 
      etc); </li>
    <li>the user's web browser version (for example, IE4, IE5, Netscape 4 etc); 
    </li>
    <li>the time taken to transmit the information to the user. </li>
  </ul>
  <p>No attempt is made to identify users or their browsing activities except 
    in the event of an investigation into apparent improper use of the Department's 
    Internet facility, or where a law enforcement agency exercises a warrant to 
    inspect the Internet Service Provider's logs.</p>
  <h3><font color="#800000">Cookies</font></h3>
  <p>Cookies are pieces of information that a website can transfer to an individual's 
    computer hard drive for record keeping. Cookies can make using websites easier 
    to use by storing information about your preferences on a particular website. 
    The information remains on your computer after the Internet session finishes.</p>
  <p>Most Internet browsers are pre-set to accept cookies. If you prefer not to 
    receive cookies, you can adjust your Internet browser to refuse cookies or 
    to warn you when cookies are being used.</p>
  <h3><font color="#800000">Collection, Use and Disclosure of Personal Information</font></h3>
  <p>When the Department receives your email or fill-in form, your message becomes 
    accessible to staff, and your email address may be recorded. However, personal 
    information provided to us will be treated confidentially and will only be 
    used and/or disclosed in accordance with your consent and/or the provisions 
    of the Migration and Privacy Acts.</p>
  <h3><font color="#800000">Need Further Information?</font></h3>
  <p>Further information is available on this website, and in the DIMA Personal 
    Information Digest (<a href="../department/pid/intro.htm">PID</a>). If you 
    have privacy concerns, please contact your nearest DIMA Office for advice. 
    You can also obtain further information from the Privacy Commissioner's website
