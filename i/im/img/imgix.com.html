<h1><small class="pull-right">Last Revised: March 12th, 2012</small>Privacy Policy</h1>
</div>
<p class="body-text">This privacy policy (“Policy”) explains how personal information is collected, used and disclosed by Zebrafish Labs Labs, Inc. (“Zebrafish Labs”, “we” or “us”) with respect to your access and use of the website of Zebrafish Labs located at www.imgix.com (the “Site”) so you can make an informed decision about using the Site and accessing, manipulating, caching, and serving images (the “Services”).</p>
<p class="body-text">We reserve the right to change the provisions of this Policy at any time. We will alert you that changes have been made by indicating on the Policy the date it was last updated. We encourage you to review this Policy from time-to-time to make sure that you understand how any personal information you provide to us will be used.</p>
<h2>What Is Personal Information?</h2>
<p class="body-text">As used herein, the term "personal information" means information that specifically identifies an individual (such as your name, user name or e-mail address), or information about that individual that is directly linked to personally identifiable information. Personal information does not include "aggregate" information, which is data we collect about the use of the Site or about a group or category of services or users, from which individual identities or other personal information has been removed. This Policy in no way restricts or limits our collection and use of aggregate information.</p>
<h2>What Information Do We Collect?</h2>
<p class="body-text">Active Collection: We collect information from you in various ways when you visit the Site. For example, we collect information you voluntarily provide to us, such as when you create an account, send us an email, provide or request information, use the Services or post comments or other content on the Site. Such information may include personal information, such as your name, user name, email, mailing address and social network data. Personal and demographic information may also be collected if you provide such information in connection with leaving comments, posting content, or sending an email or message to another user on the Site.</p>
<p class="body-text">Passive Collection: When you use the Site, some information is also automatically collected, such as your Internet Protocol (IP) address, your operating system, the browser type, the address of a referring website, and your activity on the Site. We treat this information as personal information if we combine it with or link it to any of the identifying information mentioned above. Otherwise, it is used in the aggregate only.</p>
<p class="body-text">We may also automatically collect certain information through the use of "cookies." Cookies are small data files stored on your hard drive at the request of a website. Among other things, cookies help us improve the Site and your experience. If we link cookies to any personally identifying information, we will treat this information as personal information. If you wish to block, erase, or be warned of cookies, please refer to your browser manufacturer to learn about these functions. However, if you choose to remove or reject cookies, this could affect certain features or Services on the Site. In addition, when you view videos on the Site, a third party may also set a "flash cookie" on your computer. Removing and rejecting browser cookies does not necessarily affect third party flash cookies used in connection with the Site. For more information about deleting or disabling flash cookies, please see [insert URL].</p>
<p class="body-text">We may use Web beacons or similar technology on the Site. Web beacons are small, invisible graphic images that may be used on the Site or in emails relating to the Site to collect certain information and monitor user activity on the Site, such as to count visits, understand usage effectiveness and to tell if an email has been opened and acted upon.</p>
<p class="body-text">Third party vendors, such as Google Analytics, may serve ads on the Site or otherwise place cookies, web beacons or other devices or technologies on the Site to enable them to automatically collect nonpersonal information about you and your visits to the Site and to other websites, your IP address, your ISP and the browser you use to visit the Site. Information collected may be used, among other things, to analyze data, to deliver content and advertising on this Site or other websites (including content and advertising that is targeted to your interests), to determine the popularity of certain content, and to better understand the usage and visitation of the Site and the other websites tracked by these third parties. This Policy does not apply to, and we are not responsible for, cookies or clear gifts in third party ads, and we encourage you to check the privacy policies of advertisers and/or ad services to learn more about their use of cookies and other technologies. If you would like more information about this practice and your choices as it relates to ad networks, please visit www.networkadvertising.org.</p>
