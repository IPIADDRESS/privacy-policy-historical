				Account. When the authentication is complete, we'll be able to link
				your Account with the SNS Account and access certain PII, such as
				your name and email address, and other PII that your privacy settings
				on the SNS Account permit us to access. We don't receive or store
				passwords for any of your SNS Accounts.</font></font></font></p>
