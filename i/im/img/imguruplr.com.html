        <p style="font-family: Arial;"><strong>1.
HOW WE PROTECT YOUR PRIVACY.</strong> <br>


This privacy
policy tells you how we collect, use, and protect your personal
information. By visiting our website, you accept and agree to the terms
and conditions of this privacy policy. In particular, you consent to
our collection and use of your personal information as described in
this privacy policy.</p>


        
        <p style="font-family: Arial;"><br>


        <strong>2. MINORS. </strong><br>


We do not provide services
or sell products to children. If you are below the age of 18, you may
use our website only with the permission and active involvement of a
parent or legal guardian. If you are a minor, please do not provide us
or other website visitors with any personal information. </p>


        
        <p style="font-family: Arial;"><br>


        <strong>3. POLICY IS PART OF OUR TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF

        <p style="font-family: Arial;"><br>


        <strong>4. THE TYPE OF INFORMATION WE COLLECT FROM YOU.</strong><br>


Like most places on the Internet, simply by visiting our website you
automatically tell us certain information. This includes basic
information such as your IP address, when you visited, the website from
where you came prior to visiting us, the website where you go when you
leave our website, your computer's operating system, and the type of
web browser that you are using. Our website automatically records this
basic information about you.<br>


        </p>


        
        <p style="font-family: Arial;">And like many other
websites, we may use cookies. In plain English,
this means information that our website's server transfers to your
computer. This information can be used to track your session on our
website. Cookies may also be used to customize our website content for
you as an individual. If you are using one of the common Internet web
browsers, you can set up your browser to either let you know when you
receive a cookie or to deny cookie access to your computer.<br>


        </p>


        
        <p style="font-family: Arial;">We may also collect
any data that you provide us by posting it at our
website or by e-mail. You can always choose not to provide us with
information. However, if you do withhold information, we may deny you
access to some or all of our website's services and features.<br>


        </p>


        
        <p style="font-family: Arial;">Some transactions
between you and our website may involve payment by
credit card, debit card, checks, money orders, and/or third party
online payment services. In such transactions, we will collect
information related to the transaction as part of the course of doing
business with you, including your billing address, telephone number,
and other information related to the transaction.</p>


        
        <p style="font-family: Arial;"><br>


        <strong>5. WHAT WE DO WITH YOUR INFORMATION.</strong><br>


We use your information to operate our website's business activities.
For example, we may use this data to contact you about changes to our
website, new services, or special offers, resolve disputes,
troubleshoot issues, and enforce our website's terms and conditions.<br>


        </p>


        
        <p style="font-family: Arial;">As a general rule,
we will not give your data to third parties without
your permission. However, there are some important exceptions to this
rule that are described in the following paragraphs.<br>


        </p>


        
        <p style="font-family: Arial;">We may, in our sole
discretion, provide information about you to law
enforcement or other government officials for purposes of fraud
investigations, alleged intellectual property infringement, or any
other suspected illegal activity or matters that may expose us to legal
liability.<br>


        </p>


        
        <p style="font-family: Arial;">Although we do not
disclose individually identifiable information, we
may disclose aggregate data about our website's visitors to advertisers
or other third parties for marketing and promotional purposes. <br>


        </p>


        
        <p style="font-family: Arial;">From time to time,
we may use third party suppliers to provide services
on our website. If a supplier wants to collect information about you,
you will be notified. However, you will never be required to give
information to a third party supplier. We restrict the way third party
suppliers can use your information. They are not allowed to sell or
give your information to others.</p>


        
        <p style="font-family: Arial;"><br>


        <strong>6. USER NAMES AND PASSWORDS.</strong><br>


Your
access to parts of our website may be protected by a user name and a
password. Do not give&nbsp; your password to anyone. If you enter a
section
of our website that requires a password, you should log out when you
leave. As a safety precaution, you should also close out of your web
browser completely and re-open it before viewing other parts of the
Internet.</p>


        
        <p style="font-family: Arial;"><br>


        <strong>7. YOUR USE OF INFORMATION AND UNSOLICITED JUNK
E-MAIL.</strong><br>


If you obtain personally identifiable information about another website
user, you are not allowed to disclose this information to anyone else
without the consent of the user and our consent too.<br>


        </p>


        
        <p style="font-family: Arial;">We hate junk e-mail
(Spam). Information you obtain from our website
about us or other site users cannot be used by you or others to send
unsolicited commercial e-mail or to send unsolicited commercial
communications via our website's posting or other communication
systems. <br>


        </p>


        
        <p style="font-family: Arial;"><strong>8.
YOUR VOLUNTARY DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION TO THIRD PARTIES WHO ARE NOT
OUR SUPPLIERS</strong>.<br>


You may choose to provide personal information to website visitors or
other third parties who are not our suppliers. Please use caution when
doing so. The privacy policies and customs of these third parties
determine what is done with your information.<br>


        </p>


        
        <p style="font-family: Arial;"><strong>9.
AUTORESPONDERS.</strong><br>


We may use autoresponders to
communicate with you by e-mail. To protect your privacy, we use a
verified opt-in system for such communications and you can always
opt-out of such communications using the links contained in each
autoresponder message. If you have difficulties opting out, you may
contact us by sending an e-mail to support@rapidcashmarketing.com, or
sending us mail to the address listed below.<br>


        </p>


        
        <p style="font-family: Arial;"><strong>10.

may change from time to time. If such changes are made, we will notify
you by a notice posted on our website's home page of the changes that
have been made. If you disagree with the changes that have been made,
please contact us (by e-mail, using a website contact form, or in
writing by mail), and any changes made to this policy will not apply to
information we have collected from you prior to making the changes.<br>
