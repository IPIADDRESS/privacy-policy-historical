<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stack Sports is committed to protecting your privacy and to treating your personal information as you would want it to be treated. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose and protect your personal information.</span></p>
<p><b>Stack Sports as a Data Controller and Data Processor</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The scope of Stack Sports’ responsibilities for protection of personal data depend on whether we are acting as a “data controller” or a “data processor” with respect to a particular set of processing operations. Data controllers determine what personal data is collected, the purpose of that data collection, and the means, while data processors assist them to complete these tasks efficiently. Under the laws of many countries, and especially in the EU with the entry into force of the GDPR, data controllers bear primary responsibility for compliance with data protection laws and for respecting the privacy rights of individuals. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In providing the Services, Stack Sports acts variously as a data controller, a data processor, or both. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some of our Services are intended for use by organizations such as national governing bodies, sports clubs, and teams (“Institutional User(s)”). For those Services, it is the Institutional User which, as the data controller, collects and determines the purpose(s) for processing of personal data of athletes, coaches, fans, or other individuals (“End Users”). Stack Sports’ role as data processor is to provide Institutional User(s) with the functionalities of the particular Service utilizing the personal data made available or shared by the Institutional User. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Every Institutional User will process and store personal information in different ways, and this Privacy Policy cannot and is not intended to cover each of them. End Users with questions or wishing to exercise their privacy rights with respect to personal data processed by Stack Sports on behalf of Institutional Users should review the privacy policies Institutional Users have prepared and address inquiries to them. Nevertheless, in order to provide End Users with supplementary information and transparency, this Privacy Policy describes in general terms our data processing practices across all of our Services, regardless of whether or not we act as data controller. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stack Sports also makes some of its Services available directly to individual athletes, parents, coaches, and team managers (“Direct Users”). For example, Direct Users may create personal accounts with one or more of our Services which require them to disclose personal information in order to function properly. Finally, Stack Sports may utilize personal data provided by Institutional Users for purposes other than those determined by the Institutional Users. In these contexts, Stack Sports acts as a data controller and the terms of this Privacy Policy, including with respect to the exercise of data privacy rights, are fully applicable. </span></p>
<p><b>What information does Stack Sports collect?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We collect or are provided access to a variety of personal information about our End Users and Direct Users so that we can provide our Services. Personal information means any information about an individual from which that person can be identified. It does not include data where the identifying information has been removed (anonymous data).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We do our best to be as transparent as possible about our data practices and how we may collect, use, store, and transfer your personal information. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The categories of information we collect can include:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Identity information</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – Collected for registration and profile information when Direct Users join a Service, or provided by Institutional Users. Identity information may include username, first and last name, birthdate, phone number, email address, and other contact information required to register for a Stack Sports account, participate in a Stack Sports promotion or contest, or to correspond with us.</span></span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Financial information </b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">– We may collect billing information to provide our premium Services, or process billing information on behalf of our Institutional Users.</span></span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Profile information </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">– Data collected through the use of the Service.

<p><b>Does Stack Sports share and disclose information to third parties?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We may share your personal information in the instances described below. For further information on your choices regarding your information, see the “Your Privacy Rights” section below.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Remember, some of our Services allows Direct Users to connect with others and share information about themselves with other individuals and organizations. In some instances, your Profile Information, including your name, photo, and other personal information, will be available publicly to other members of the Service by default and may be searchable by search engines which may display a certain amount of your information publicly. You may be able to adjust your profile settings to entirely prevent the general public from viewing your profile, though it will remain visible to other Direct Users of the Service. Also, remember that Institutional Users and other third parties that use Stack Sports Services may have their own data collection and use policies that Stack Sports does not control, even in situations where Stack Sports acts as a data processor on their behalf. Please review the privacy policies of any third-party organization before sharing your personal information with that organization.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We may also share Personal Information of End Users provided by Institutional Users for marketing purposes, subject to the End Users’ affirmative consent. As described above, in such cases Stack Sports acts as a data controller and End Users may contact us directly in order to exercise their privacy rights. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We may share your personal information with:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other companies owned by or under common ownership at Stack Sports. These companies will use your personal information in the same way as we can under this policy;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Third-party vendors and other service providers that perform services on our behalf, as needed to carry out their work for us, which may include identifying and serving targeted advertisements, billing, payment processing, content or service fulfillment, or providing analytic services;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trusted business partners who may use your information to contact you about opportunities that may be of interest to you (subject to your affirmative consent).</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other Direct Users of the Stack Sports Service. Your information, including both information you provide and information we have collected about you from other Direct and/or Institutional Users, may be searchable by or made available to other Direct and/or Institutional Users of the Service. These users may contact you via email or via text messages (subject to your affirmative consent).</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">To Persons with Authority. Certain Stack Sports Services connect to colleges and universities. As such, Stack Sports may disclose your personal information directly or via a third party to colleges and universities that you have indicated you are interested in attending, as well as to other accredited colleges and universities that Stack Sports and/or our business partners believe may be of interest to you (subject to your affirmative consent).</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Certain Stack Sports Services connect to the public. Any information that you voluntarily disclose for posting to the Service is viewable by other Users and the public. As one example, a tournament director may print a list of athletes at an event and distribute that list to tournament attendees who may or may not be members of the Service.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other parties in connection with a company transaction, such as a merger, sale of company assets or shares, reorganization, financing, change of control or acquisition of all or a portion of our business by another company or third party or in the event of a bankruptcy or related or similar proceedings; and</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Third parties as required by law or subpoena or otherwise if we reasonably believe that such action is necessary to (a) comply with the law and the reasonable requests of law enforcement; (b) to enforce our Terms of Use http://stacksports.com/termsofuse or to protect the security or integrity of our Service; and/or (c) to exercise or protect the rights, property, or personal safety of Stack Sports, our Users, or others.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We may also aggregate or otherwise strip data of all personally identifying characteristics and may share that aggregated, anonymized data with third parties.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If Stack Sports receives your Personal Information in the European Union and subsequently transfers that information to a third party agent or service provider for processing, Stack Sports remains responsible for ensuring that such third party agent or service provider processes your Personal Information to the standard required by our Model Contract Clause commitments (see the sections below headed “Additional Information for Users in the European Economic Area (“EEA”)” and “International Data Transfers”).</span></p>
