They may also use other technologies (such as cookies, JavaScript, or web beacons) to measure the effectiveness of their advertisements and to personalize the advertising content. ixigo does not provide any personally identifiable information to these third-party ad servers or ad networks without your consent. However, please note that if an advertiser asks ixigo to show an advertisement to a certain audience and you respond to that advertisement, the advertiser or ad server may conclude that you fit the description of the audience they are trying to reach. The ixigo Privacy Policy does not apply to, and we cannot control the activities of, third-party advertisers. Please consult the respective privacy policies of such advertisers for more information.</p><h3 class="privacy-title"></h3><h3 class="privacy-title"><strong>How We Protect Your Information</strong></h3><p dir="ltr">ixigo uses commercially reasonable physical, managerial, and technical safeguards to preserve the integrity and security of your personal information.
