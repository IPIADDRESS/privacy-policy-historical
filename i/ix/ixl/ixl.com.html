<h2 id="PU">What standards does IXL adhere to in protecting its users' privacy?</h2>
<p>
  IXL Learning is a signatory of the
  <a href="https://studentprivacypledge.org" target="_blank">Student Privacy Pledge</a> ("SPP"),
  an industry standard approach to privacy for Kâ€“12 service providers.
  The SPP was created by the Future of Privacy Forum (FPF) and
  The Software &amp; Information Industry Association (SIIA) and has been endorsed
  by the National School Boards Association (NSBA), the National Parent-Teacher
  Association (PTA), and the White House.  This privacy policy is a statement of
  IXL's privacy policies consistent with the principles laid out in the SPP.

<h2 id="PB">What personally identifiable information does IXL Learning collect from you?</h2>
<p>
  IXL Learning collects information in several ways from different parts of our products.
</p>
<p>
  Some personal information is gathered when you register. Depending on your account type,
  IXL Learning may ask for your name, e-mail address, and/or additional information.
  We may also ask you to choose a username and password.
</p>
<p>
  In addition to the information we collect when you register, we may ask you for personal
  information at other times, such as when you contact our technical support team.
  We also collect information about your use of IXL Learning websites and any information
  that you submit to IXL Learning websites, such as answers to questions or quizzes.
</p>
<p>
  Furthermore, when you send e-mail, user surveys, or other communication to IXL Learning,
  we may retain those communications in order to process your inquiries, respond to your
  requests, and improve our services.
</p>

<h2 id="PC">What are cookies and how does IXL Learning use them?</h2>
<p>
  As part of offering and providing customizable and personalized services, IXL
  Learning and its vendors use cookies to temporarily store information.
  We use cookies to better display our website, to save you time,
  to provide better technical support, for promotional purposes, and to
  track website usage. For example, cookies help us to:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    Keep track of whether you are signed in or have
    previously signed in so that we can display all the features that are available
    to you.
  </li>
  <li>
    Remember your settings on the pages you visit, so that we can display your
    preferred content the next time you visit.
  </li>
  <li>
    Customize the function and appearance of the pages you visit based on information
    relating to your account; for example, in order to default you to a particular
    grade level, or to remember customized settings for a report.
  </li>
  <li>
    Know your username when you submit a technical support request so that you
    don't have to type it in.
  </li>
  <li>
    Advertise IXL on other websites, such as in Google search results and partner websites.
  </li>
  <li>
    Track website usage for various purposes including sales, marketing, and billing.
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
  Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies, but you can reset your
  browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent.
  However, some features and services (particularly those that require you to
  sign in) may not function properly if your cookies are disabled.
</p>
<p>
  We may also use local storage mechanisms other than cookies, including but not
  limited to Flash storage and HTML5 local storage.

<h2 id="PD">How does IXL Learning use your information?</h2>

  IXL Learning's goals in collecting information are to provide you with
  a customized experience on our sites and a high level of technical support.

  IXL Learning analyzes users' interactions with the product and their feedback submitted
  via e-mail and surveys in order to provide better service, to improve our current products
  and services, and to develop new ones.
</p>

<a href="#">Top</a>
<hr>


<h2 id="PE">Who is collecting information, and with whom is it shared?</h2>
<p>
  When you are on an IXL Learning site and are asked for personal information, you are
  sharing that information with IXL Learning, unless it is specifically stated
  otherwise.
</p>
<p>
  IXL Learning will not disclose any of your personally identifiable information to
  third parties except when we have your permission or under specific circumstances,
  such as when we believe in good faith that the law requires it.
  The following describes some of the circumstances under which your information may be disclosed.
</p>
<p>
  <u>Business Partners &amp; Sponsors</u>.
  IXL Learning will not disclose your personally identifiable information to business partners
  or sponsors for their benefit, unless it is specifically described to you prior to data
  collection or prior to transferring the data. If IXL Learning becomes involved in a merger,
  acquisition, or any form of sale of some or all of its assets, your personal information
  may be transferred to the purchaser. In such an event, we will provide notice before
  personal information is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.
  No personal information will be transferred in the event of a merger or sale unless
  the recipient has committed to the SPP principles.
</p>
<p>
  <u>Third Party Data &amp; Data in the Aggregate</u>. Under confidentiality agreements,
  IXL Learning may match non-student accountholder information with third party data. Also,
  IXL Learning discloses aggregated user statistics (for instance, the percentage of IXL users
  from a particular geographic region) in order to describe our services to current and prospective
  partners and other third parties, and for other lawful purposes.
</p>
<p>
  <u>Vendors and Service Providers</u>.
  IXL Learning may disclose information collected from you to vendors or service providers
  who are under an obligation of confidentiality to IXL Learning for the purpose of
  providing services or products for us or on our behalf, including for purposes of analytics,
  billing, and marketing. Such service providers or vendors may send you e-mails on IXL's behalf.
  However, IXL will not knowingly use student information for behavioral targeting of
  advertisements to students.
</p>
<p>
  <u>Educational Institution Affiliation</u>.
  IXL Learning may disclose information collected from users associated with an
  educational institution with other users designated by the educational institution,
  such as teachers and school administrators of that institution.
</p>
<p>
  <u>Other</u>. IXL Learning may release personal information if it has a good faith belief
  that access, use, preservation, or disclosure of such information is reasonably necessary to
  (a) satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process, or enforceable governmental request;
  (b) enforce applicable Terms of Service, including investigation of potential violations thereof;
  (c) detect, prevent or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues; or
  (d) protect against imminent harm to the rights, property, or safety of IXL Learning,
  its users, or the public as required or permitted by law.

</h2>
<p>
  We take appropriate security measures to protect against unauthorized access to or

  of our data collection, storage, and processing practices and security measures, as well as
  physical security measures to guard against unauthorized access to systems where we store

  to close all browser windows. This is to ensure that others cannot access your personal
  information if you share a computer with someone else or are using a public computer.
</p>
<p>
  We restrict access to personal information to IXL Learning employees, contractors, and
  agents who need to know that information in order to operate, develop, or improve our products
  and services. These individuals are bound by confidentiality obligations and may be subject
  to discipline, including termination and criminal prosecution, if they fail to meet
  these obligations.

<h2 id="PJ">How does IXL Learning protect children's privacy?</h2>
<p>
  IXL Learning accounts are created by parents and educational institutions.
  IXL Learning does not permit children under the age of 13 to create an account and
  does not knowingly collect personally identifying information from children under
  the age of 13 without the consent of a parent or educational institution.
  IXL Learning may collect and store question answers provided by users of accounts
  created by parents and educational institutions for the purpose of providing
  feedback to the user and educational institution and for compiling reports and awards.
  IXL Learning may also collect and store an e-mail address provided by users of
  accounts created by parents and educational institutions for the purpose of password reset.
  IXL Learning will not ask children under age 13 for more information, as a condition
  of participation, than is reasonably necessary to participate in a given activity.
  Any disclosure of information collected from children under the age of 13 to third
  parties will be pursuant to an agreement of confidentiality and may be used for
  purposes of site analytics, billing and marketing. If any information is disclosed to
  IXL Learning by a child under the age of 13, that child's parent may contact
  IXL using the contact information below to ascertain the information collected
  and/or to request its deletion.

<h2 id="PK">What else should you know about your privacy?</h2>

  accessible to the public, you may receive unsolicited messages from other parties in return.
</p>
<p>
  Some IXL Learning services may offer the ability to create public web pages and to
  show your name and e-mail address on them. The pages thus created may be accessed by anyone.
