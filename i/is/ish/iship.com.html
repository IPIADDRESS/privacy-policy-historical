		(the "Privacy Policy") to learn more about how iShip, Inc. collects, uses and safeguards the personal 
		and company information of our customers and shipping carriers ("Carrier(s)") whose services are 
		accessed through iShip services.</p>
		<h2>iShip Commitment to Privacy </h2>
		<p>This Privacy Policy describes iShip's treatment of Personal and Company Information (defined below) 
		that iShip collects from visitors of the iShip.com site and users of iShip's Web-based multi-carrier 
		shipping services and enterprise solutions ("iShip Shipping"). This Privacy Policy governs only iShip's 
		treatment of information. iShip shares Personal and Company Information with the Carrier providing the 
		requested service (e.g. DHL, Federal Express, UPS and others) and shipping service centers (e.g. Mail Boxes Etc.) 
		(as described below in <a href="#infoshare">Information Sharing and Disclosure</a>). This Privacy Policy does not control how a Carrier 
		and/or shipping service center use Personal or Company Information. Please review the privacy policy(ies) of the 
		applicable Carrier(s) and shipping service center(s) to learn how they treat information. </p>
		<h2>What this Privacy Policy Covers</h2>
		<p>The Privacy Policy applies only to United States users of iShip Shipping and United States visitors 
		to the iShip.com Web site. iShip Shipping is not available to other than United States users. If you are 
		located in the U.S. and have questions about the iShip.com Privacy Policy, please contact us at 
		<a href="mailto:privacy@iShip.com">privacy@iShip.com</a>. </p>
		<h2 class="center">INFORMATION COLLECTION AND USE</h2>
		<p>iShip collects and uses Personal and Company Information so that we can efficiently provide the iShip 
		Shipping services requested by our visitors and customers. </p>
		<h2>iShip Shipping Personal Information </h2>
		<p>In connection with iShip Shipping, iShip collects personally identifiable information (information that may 
		allow you to be identified or contacted) ("Personal Information") necessary to provide the requested services. 
		iShip collects this information when you register to set up an account and otherwise use the iShip Shipping services. </p>
		<h2 class="italicize">iShip Shipping Account </h2>
		<p>Personal Information required to register with iShip includes your name or company name, address, telephone number, 
		e-mail address and address type (business or residential). In order to complete your registration and set up your 
		iShip account, you will be required to select a User ID, after which iShip will assign you a Password by email. After 
		you have successfully registered, you will be required to provide your User ID and Password to access your iShip account. 
		Upon your initial sign-in, you may elect to have us remember your Password so that you do not have to re-enter it each time 
		to login from the computer you are currently using. iShip "remembers" your Password by placing a cookie on your hard drive. 
		See Cookies below for more information. You may also enter your credit card information and billing address and select certain 
		shipping and Carrier preferences. This information is optional for the purposes of setting up your account, however, you may 
		be required to enter credit card information (including billing address) prior to shipping any packages, as described below.</p>
		<h2 class="italicize">iShip Shipping</h2>
		<p>In order to ship packages via iShip Shipping, you may also need to provide (i) your credit card information and billing 
		address, (ii) the name, address, email address and telephone number of the shipment recipient, (iii) a description of the 
		shipment contents, and (iv) such additional information as may be required by your selected Carrier.</p>

		name or company name, address, telephone number, address type, fax number and e-mail address of people or businesses to whom 
		they frequently ship packages ("Addressee Information"). Use of the Address Book is entirely optional. It is provided as a 
		convenience so that users will not have to re-enter frequently used Addressee Information. iShip does not use Addressee 
		Information for any purpose other than to provide the iShip Shipping services and to offer you easy access to package Addressee 
		Information and for other internal business purposes.</p>
		<h2 class="italicize">Shipping Estimate</h2>
		<p>iShip offers a multi-carrier shipping estimate service that enables you to estimate potential shipping charges by providing 
		us with package weight and dimensions and the origin and destination zip codes. This information is used only to provide you 
		with estimated shipping charges based on the information you provide and other internal business purposes. </p>

		you may also include a brief message to be sent with the email notification.</p>
		<p>iShip stores collected Personal Information, including your shipping history, in your account profile for 
		your access and reference. iShip uses Personal Information to provide and enhance iShip Shipping services.

		for our internal business purposes (including performing trend analysis and market studies), to set prices, 
		establish credit, accomplish the billing function and to comply with government regulations. iShip may collect 
		other Personal Information from time to time, but it will be obvious to you that we are collecting such 
		information (e.g., through use of surveys). If iShip collects additional Personal Information in a manner that 
		is not apparent, iShip will provide you with notice as described in Changes to the Privacy Policy . All such 
		Personal Information will be treated in accordance with this Privacy Policy. </p>
		<h2>Company Information</h2>

		Information."</p>
		<p>iShip Shipping services may also include a global address book tool, which enables the company to store employee

		store customer and/or personal address and contact information.</p>
		<p>Company Information is collected during the company sign-up, installation and configuration process, as well 
		as when the company uses the iShip Shipping services. We use Company Information to provide and enhance the iShip 
		Shipping services, to ensure compatibility of data with iShip's systems, for our internal business purposes, 
		to enhance our ability to communicate with our customers about additional services they may find of value, to set prices, 
		establish credit, fulfill an Enterprise Service Agreement, accomplish the billing function and to comply with
