        <h3>Committed to Protecting Privacy </h3>
        <p>          iSoftStone  is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy applies to  activities directly related to your visit of the iSoftStone website. It does  not apply to third parties' websites linked through the iSoftStone website. We  strongly recommend that you read these third parties' privacy policies prior to  providing any information to such sites. iSoftStone has no responsibility or  liability in connection with any third parties' websites. </p>
        <h3>Collection, Use and Transfer of Your Information</h3>
        <p>          You  can visit most of the iSoftStone site without disclosing your  personally-identifiable information ("personal data"). However, you  may choose to provide us with your personal data, for example when you contact  us, register for seminars, activities and programs available on our website or  when you request information or services. <br>
          You  also may decide to provide us voluntarily with personal data of a third person,  such as your spouse, colleague or friend. In such case, we assume that you have  unrestricted permission from such person to provide his/her personal data to iSoftStone.<br>
          iSoftStone may use suppliers to collect,  process, store, use, analyze and/or transfer the data on its behalf. In such  case, it is iSoftStone practice to require that these suppliers handle the  personal data they process or transfer in a manner consistent with iSoftStone's  policies. By submitting personal data to us, you acknowledge and agree with  your data being processed and/or transferred on iSoftStone's behalf by its  suppliers. <br>
          iSoftStone  will handle the information we learn from you from your visit to our website in  the following manner:</p>
        <ul type="disc">
          <li><strong>If you visit our       site to read or download information, such as news, product information,       case studies or articles:</strong><br>
          We may collect, process or transfer only the following information about       you: the name of the domain from which you access the Internet; the date       and time you access our site; and the Internet address of the website from       which you linked directly to our site. We use the information we collect       to measure the number of visitors to the different sections of our site,       and to help us make our site more useful to visitors. We may use       "cookies" and/or technologies to collect personally non-identifiable       information from your visits to our website to enhance your overall site       experience and for statistical purposes. You can set your browser to turn       off "cookies" or to warn you when a website attempts to place a       "cookie" on your computer. However, if you turn off the       "cookies", some websites may not work properly.</li>
          <li><strong>If you submit       personal data when visiting a iSoftStone website:</strong><br>
            We may collect, process and/or transfer the specific information you       voluntarily provide to us in the contact form you choose to fill in on our       website, including the personal data you provide. By submitting any       personal data on iSoftStone's site, you authorize iSoftStone to use,       process and transfer (if necessary across borders) such data, even in and       to countries where the level of data protection may not be commensurate       with the high standard of protection adopted by certain countries, such as       the standard suggested by the EU Data Protection Directive. In such       countries, iSoftStone will still handle your personal data in the manner       described in this Privacy Policy. iSoftStone will not sell personal data       to third parties; however your personal data may be automatically       transferred to the successor to substantially all of the assets and       business of iSoftStone.</li>
          <li><strong>If you are a       client, or are part of a client organization, or are a subcontractor:</strong><br>
            Personal data you provide to iSoftStone, including personal data of a       third party, such as your spouse, colleague and friend may be collected,       stored, used and transferred as necessary for iSoftStone to carry out       business or seek potential business in the future with your company. If       you provide us with personal data, whether in the form of an e-mail,       business card, orally during business meeting or otherwise, we assume that       you have granted us a permission to collect, store, use and transfer such       information with no limitations even in and to countries where the level       of data protection may not be commensurate with the high standard of       protection adopted by certain countries, such as the standard suggested by       the EU Data Protection Directive. We also assume that you have       unrestricted permission from the third party for the transfer of its       personal data.</li>
          <li><strong>Disclosure       Required by Law:</strong><br>
            Please be aware that it is possible that personal data you provide to iSoftStone       may be subject to disclosure under the law (e.g. pursuant to a statutory       provision, a court order or a subpoena).</li>
