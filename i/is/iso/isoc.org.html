        <b>THE INTERNET SOCIETY'S COMMITMENT TO PRIVACY</b><br>
        <br>
        In keeping with the goals and objectives of the organization, the Internet 
        Society is committed to the highest degree of respect for the privacy 
        of our members and of visitors to our site. <br>
        <br>
        <b>WHAT INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT? </b><br>
        <br>
        As is standard practice for most web sites, certain visitor characteristics 
        are reflected in our web server logs (e.g. operating system, browser version, 
        and Internet Protocol (IP) address). We make no attempt to link them with 
        the individual visitors to the site. <br>
        <br>
        In the case of online balloting for Internet Society elections, Members 
        are asked to supply numbers corresponding to those on their printed ballots 
        to ensure that only a single vote is registered. The details of the actual 
        votes are maintained only during the election process solely to allow 
        proper verification and audit of the election. <br>
        <br>
        On its web site, the Internet Society gives visitors the option of providing 
        certain personally identifiable information for purposes such as joining 
        the organization, renewing membership, participating in discussion groups, 
        submitting inquiries and comments, or registering for conferences. This 
        information includes name, postal address, email address, and other pertinent 
        data.<br>
        <br>
        By voluntarily providing us with your Personal Data, you are consenting to our 
        use of it in accordance with this Privacy Statement. Due to the nature of the 
        Internet if you are visiting this site from a country other than the United 
        States, your communications will inevitably result in the transfer of 
        information across international boundaries. By visiting this web site you 
        consent to these transfers. If you provide personal data to this site, you 
        acknowledge and agree that such personal data may be transferred from your 
        current location to the offices and servers of the Internet Society and its 
        affiliates, agents and service providers located in the United States and in 
        other countries.<br>
        <br>
        <b>WHAT WE DO WITH THE INFORMATION</b><br>
        <br>
        With regard to non-personally identifiable information, we may periodically 
        analyze our web site logs to assess aggregate usage trends in order to 
        better serve the needs of visitors to the site. Under some circumstances 
        this information may be used for purposes of systems administration or 
        server troubleshooting and security.<br>
        <br>
        We do not sell, rent or share any personally identifiable information 
        voluntarily supplied by visitors or our membership mailing list. We may 
        occasionally subcontract a provide such information to third party subcontractors 
        to make specific offerings on our behalf and with our consent, but only 
        on contractual terms that protect and after measures have been taken to 
        monitor against misuse and unauthorized disclosure of that information. 
        Members may choose to participate in these offerings. More information 
        on the procedure to do so is supplied below.<br>
        <br>
        Membership information is collected and maintained solely in order to 
        provide our members with access to specific benefits accorded to them 
        through membership in the Society.<br>
        <br>
        Any further email addresses, phone numbers, or other contact information 
        submitted by visitors voluntarily in the course of inquiries and comments 
        are used only for purposes of taking action in relation to the nature 
        of the inquiry or comment.<br>
        <br>
