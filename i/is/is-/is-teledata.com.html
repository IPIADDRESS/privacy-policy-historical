            <h2 style="margin-top:10px;margin-bottom:25px;">FactSet's UK Modern Slavery Act Statement 2017</h2>
            
            <p><a id="uk-modern-slavery-act"></a>This statement is made pursuant to section 54(1) of the United Kingdom Modern Slavery Act of 2015 and constitutes FactSet’s group slavery and human trafficking statement for the financial year ending 31 August 2017.</p>
<h3>Introduction from Phil Snow, Chief Executive Officer</h3>
<p>As a major software and solutions provider globally, we recognise that our company must act responsibly and thus are committed to improving our practices to combat slavery and human trafficking. Employees are expected to report concerns, using the appropriate reporting channels, and management are expected to act upon them. We are proud of the corporate social responsibility work we carry out in our local communities. As we expand into new markets, we ensure that corporate social responsibility is a key part of our business strategic development plans.</p>
<h3>Organisation's Structure and Business</h3>
<p>We are a major supplier of online-integrated financial and economic information to the investment management and banking industries. FactSet Research Systems Inc. is the parent company of all our global subsidiaries, including our businesses in the United Kingdom (“FactSet”). FactSet has over 9,000 employees worldwide and over 60 office locations in more than 23 countries.</p>
<h3>Our Supply Chains</h3>
<p>FactSet is not in an industry with a high risk of modern slavery or human trafficking. Our supply chains include suppliers based throughout the world that provide a range of services and products, from third party data providers to IT infrastructure and local food service. FactSet is committed to high professional standards and ethics and we expect the same from all our suppliers. All suppliers are expected to comply with all local and national laws and regulations.</p>
<h3>Our Values and Policies</h3>
<p>Part of our values and culture is that we are an inclusive community, working together as a team and staying connected to our clients and each other. We are committed to ensuring that there is no modern slavery or human trafficking in our supply chains or in any part of our business. We are currently exploring implementing supplier policies to support our commitment to act ethically and with integrity in all our business relationships. We seek to implement and enforce effective systems and controls to ensure slavery and human trafficking is not taking place anywhere in our supply chains.</p>
<h3>Employees</h3>
<p>Giving back to our communities is an integral part of our culture. FactSet employees have always driven our corporate social responsibility efforts, embracing volunteerism, giving, and sustainability initiatives. We have established a globally consistent programme grounded in four Pillars of Service – ‘Inspiring Tomorrow’s Engineers,’ ‘Elevate to Educate,’ ‘Alleviating Food Insecurity’ and ‘Protecting our Environment.’ We work with our non-profit partners to develop projects within our pillars that are both highly impactful for our communities, and engage our employees in meaningful volunteer opportunities. Examples of the volunteer work include: mentoring young future science and technology leaders; introducing young people to coding and computer science; supporting financial literacy programmes for school children and adults; providing books and desks to rural school children in India; supporting food banks and food rescue programmes in many of our offices globally; and working with conservation organisations to contribute to biodiversity studies and clean up green spaces in the communities in which we operate. Our Code of Conduct and Ethics guides our employees and is available on our public website and our intranet site. If employees have any concerns about any wrongdoing or breaches of law, these can be raised through appropriate channels.</p>
<h3>Next Steps</h3>
<p>We will continue to review the effectiveness of the steps we have taken to ensure that there is no slavery or human trafficking in our supply chains, and assess emergent risks, if any arise, regarding slavery and human trafficking in our supply chains. We will also explore developing a supplier code of conduct for suppliers, setting out our standards and commitment to anti-slavery and human trafficking laws, as well other standards. This statement was approved by the board of FactSet Research Systems Inc., FactSet Europe Limited and FactSet UK Limited.</p>

            <p><strong><span><a id="uk-tax-strategy"></a>Financial year ending August 31, 2018</span></strong></p>
<p>FactSet Research Systems Inc. (the “Company” or “FactSet”) is a multinational company headquartered in Norwalk, Connecticut, United States with operations across 23 countries. FactSet was founded in 1978 and provides integrated financial information and analytical applications for the global investment community.</p>
<h3><strong>Introduction to FactSet’s UK Tax Strategy</strong></h3>
<p>FactSet has substantial local operations and presence in the UK. FactSet is committed to conduct its tax affairs in accordance with the following objectives:</p>
<ul>
<li>Act as a responsible global corporate tax citizen in compliance with applicable tax law, regulations and reporting disclosure requirements;</li>
<li>Maintain an open relationship with tax authorities based on collaboration and integrity;</li>
<li>Apply diligence and care in the management of processes and procedures by which all tax related activities are undertaken;</li>
<li>Encourage ethical and transparent business practices;</li>
<li>Use available incentives and reliefs while ensuring that these reliefs are not used for purposes which are knowingly contradictory to the intent of the legislation.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Risk Management and Governance</strong></h3>
<p>FactSet believes that it is important to pay the correct amount of tax at the right time, under all relevant laws and regulations. We are committed to provide transparent and accessible information to tax administrators in order to facilitate an understanding of our tax strategy and the underlying business models. We operate an effective tax control framework to identify key tax risks and to manage those risks through appropriately designed and operated controls, polices and processes.</p>
<h3>Tax Strategy and Strategic Objectives</h3>
<p>Generally, FactSet’s tax strategy and strategic objectives are intended to establish a clear and unequivocal approach to all aspects of tax reporting and compliance.<br><br>Our strategy is focused on ensuring that taxes (and tax risks) are managed to provide outcomes consistent with commercial reality and are within the parameters of our strategic objectives. The strategy also requires that all tax obligations are complied with in the UK and all other relevant jurisdictions.<br><br>With the tax landscape constantly changing, FactSet’s tax affairs and tax risk management procedures are regularly reviewed to ensure that processes and measures are up-to-date so that we are able to identify, assess, manage and mitigate tax risk as well as remain aligned with FactSet’s business strategy and governance framework.</p>
<h3><strong>Level of Acceptable Tax Risk</strong></h3>
<p>We aim for certainty on the tax positions we adopt, so diligent professional care and judgment is employed to assess tax risks arising from our commercial operations. We seek to reduce the level of tax risk arising from operations as far as is practically reasonable through an ongoing commitment to improving internal control effectiveness and by ensuring that all tax or tax-related processes are allocated to appropriately qualified owners.<br><br>FactSet’s level of acceptable risk is low, and we structure our affairs based on sound commercial principles and in accordance with company policy and relevant tax legislation. FactSet will consider different tax outcomes when considering how to undertake commercially motivated transactions, but does not participate in aggressive tax planning for the purposes of tax avoidance or engage in tax schemes that go against the intention of the legislative authority.</p>
<h3><strong>Approach towards Dealings with HM Revenue &amp; Customs (“HMRC”)</strong></h3>
<p>It is FactSet’s general policy to be transparent and proactive in all interactions with HMRC.</p>
<p>We have an open, honest and positive working relationship with HMRC. We are committed to prompt disclosure and transparency in all tax matters with HMRC. We recognize that there will be areas of differing legal interpretations between ourselves and HMRC and where this occurs we will engage in proactive discussion to bring matters to as rapid a conclusion as possible.</p>

<td>
<p><em>We collect and use personal details which you provide as part of the recruitment process, and may also obtain details from third parties (such as referees (references) or background checks).</em></p>
<p><em>We may retain your application for a limited period for future opportunities. Your data may be stored in systems based around the world, and may be processed by third party service providers acting on our behalf.</em></p>
<p><em>You have certain rights in respect of your personal data, which you can exercise using the contact information set out below.</em></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>2. Personal Data</strong></p>
</div>
<p>We may collect various types of Personal Data about you for the purposes described in this Notice, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Data about you:<span>&nbsp;</span></em>such as your forename, surname, gender, nationality, date of birth, home contact details (e.g. address, telephone number, e-mail), national ID number, immigration and eligibility to work data;</li>
<li><em>Data about your employment history and qualifications:<span>&nbsp;</span></em>qualifications, references, CV and application form, background checks and verification of information from LinkedIn or similar social media profile;</li>
<li>D<em>ata about your application:</em><span>&nbsp;</span>such as interview notes or assessment results; and</li>
<li><em>Legal and criminal records data:</em><span>&nbsp;</span>legal records data is processed only in compliance with the applicable laws and in specific circumstances (e.g., background checks for senior roles or roles handling sensitive information).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>3. Sources of Personal Data</strong></p>
<p>You may give us the Personal Data described above during the recruitment process, whether through the application forms on our online job portal, on the telephone or at interviews. We partner with certain third party jobsites, such as LinkedIn or JobCentre Plus, and may receive your Personal Data via these organisations.</p>
<p>We may also receive Personal Data about you from other third parties; for example, recruiters; references from a previous employer; business partners; background check providers; as well as from publicly available sources such as social media.</p>
<p><strong>4. Why we process your Personal Data&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>The Personal Data requested from you during the recruitment process is required by us in order to:</p>
<ul>
<li>assess your application for employment with the Company;</li>
<li>evaluate and grade applicants;</li>
<li>set-up and conduct interviews and tests;</li>
<li>carry out right to work checks, background checks, verify your application, contact referees (references) and, where permitted by law, carry out criminal record checks;</li>
<li>make employment offers, or communicate the rejection of applications; and</li>
<li>retain your application for a limited period of time, to consider you for future, similar opportunities.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you do not provide some or all of this Personal Data it may affect our ability to process your application, and in some cases, it may mean that we are unable to continue with your application as the Company will not have the Personal Data we believe to be necessary for the effective and efficient management of the recruitment process.</p>
<p>We process your Personal Data on one of the following legal bases:</p>
<ul type="disc">
<li>the processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which the Company is subject (such as verifying eligibility for employment or complying with obligations regarding non-discrimination);</li>
<li>the processing is necessary in order to take steps at your request prior to entering into an employment contract with you (such as verifying qualifications and work history);</li>
<li>the processing is based on consent (only used in limited circumstances, such as your option to opt-in to a longer period of retention for unsuccessful applications); or</li>
<li>the processing is necessary for the legitimate interests pursued by the Company in hiring qualified and appropriate staff members, except where such interests are overridden by your interests or fundamental rights and freedoms which require protection of personal data.</li>
</ul>
<p>The processing of legal or criminal records data will be undertaken where permitted by applicable laws, national collecting bargaining agreements and binding resolutions of the relevant Supervisory Authority for data protection.</p>
<p><strong>5.&nbsp;Disclosure and transfer of Personal Data</strong></p>
<p>For the purposes listed under section 4 above, we may share your Personal Data with other members of the FactSet group (including in countries outside EU/EEA, such as the United States of America, India and the Philippines). For example, some of our recruitment and applicant testing applications are hosted in the U.S., and some hiring decisions involve input or review from other FactSet group companies. FactSet has adopted an Intra-Group Data Transfer Agreement to ensure your Personal Data receives an adequate level of protection wherever it is processed within the FactSet group.</p>
<p>Your Personal Data may also be accessed by third parties who provide us with services, such as recruiters, and companies hosting, supporting and maintaining the IT systems supporting our recruitment system and those undertaking background checking or vetting on our behalf.</p>
<p>If your application for employment with the Company is successful, your Personal Data may also be shared with certain interconnecting systems (such as HR information, payroll and benefits systems). More information will be provided to you in a separate notice during your on-boarding.</p>
<p>Certain third parties may be located outside of the EU/EEA, and in these cases we will use legally acceptable mechanisms, such as standard contractual clauses and from time to time other mechanisms provided for under applicable data protection laws, to ensure an adequate level of protection for your Personal Data. You are entitled to, upon request, a copy of documentation showing that appropriate safeguards have been taken to protect your Personal Data during such transfer.</p>
<p><strong>6. Security of Personal Data</strong></p>
<p>We implement what we determine to be reasonable physical, technical and administrative security standards designed to protect your Personal Data from loss, misuse, alteration, destruction or damage.</p>
<p>Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password which enables you to access certain parts of our jobsites, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to share a password with anyone.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we will do our best to protect your Personal Data, we cannot guarantee the security of your Personal Data transmitted to our site; any transmission is at your own risk.</p>
<p><strong>7. Retention of your Personal Data</strong></p>
<p>Our general approach is to retain your application for a period of 6 months or, where you consent to a longer period of retention, for up to 2 years following the closure of the recruitment process for the role you applied for.</p>
<p>Otherwise, you should note that, in certain cases, legal or regulatory obligations require us to retain specific records for a set period of time.</p>
<p>If you accept employment with FactSet, your Personal Data will be held on the basis set out in our Employee Data Privacy Notice which will be shared with you.</p>
<p><strong>8. Your rights</strong></p>
<p>The Company aims to ensure that all Personal Data are correct. You have the right to request correction of any inaccurate Personal Data relating to you, but you also have a responsibility to ensure that changes in personal circumstances are notified to the Company so that we can ensure that your Personal Data is up-to-date. In many cases, you will be able to "self-serve" corrections to your Personal Data through our jobsites or by contacting us by email.</p>
<p><em>Access</em>. You have the right to request access to any of your Personal Data that the Company may hold.</p>
<p><em>Withdrawal of consent</em>. You have the right to withdraw any consents at any time, for example if you are no longer happy for us to retain your unsuccessful application for an extended period of up to 2 years.</p>
<p><em>Restriction</em>. You also have the right to restrict our processing of your Personal Data where:</p>
<ul>
<li>you contest the accuracy of the Personal Data until we have taken sufficient steps to correct or verify its accuracy;</li>
<li>where the processing is unlawful but you do not want us to erase the Personal Data;</li>
<li>where we no longer need your Personal Data for the purposes of the processing, but you require such Personal Data for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims; or</li>
<li>where you have objected to processing justified on legitimate interest grounds (see below) pending verification as to whether the Company has compelling legitimate grounds to continue processing.<br><br>
<p>Where your Personal Data is subject to restriction in this way we will only process it with your consent or for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Right to object</em>. Where we are relying upon legitimate interest to process your Personal Data (see section 4), then you have the right to object to that processing. Where we rely upon legitimate interest as a basis for processing we believe that we can demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds which permit us to continue the processing, but we will consider each case on an individual basis.</p>
<p><em>Erasure</em>. You have the right to have your Personal Data erased under certain circumstances, such as when it is no longer needed by us for a lawful purpose.</p>
<p>You also have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority if you consider that the processing of your Personal Data infringes applicable law with the relevant local data protection authorities. In the UK, the supervisory authority is the Information Commissioner's Office (<strong>ICO</strong>).</p>
<p>For further information regarding your rights, to exercise any of your rights, or if you have any questions regarding the processing of your Personal Data please contact<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="mailto:recruiting@factset.com" title="" target="_self" class="email-link">recruiting@factset.com</a>.</p>
<p><strong>9. Changes to this Notice</strong></p>
