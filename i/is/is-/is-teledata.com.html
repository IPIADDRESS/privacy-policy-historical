<h1>Interactive Data: Privacy Policy</h1>

We value our relationship with you and respect your right to privacy.  This Privacy Policy  describes how Interactive Data handles personal information that you provide to us or that we collect and maintain about you in connection with your use of our www.interactivedata.com website (“Website”) and the services made available through the Website (“Services”).<br>
<br>
1)    <b>SCOPE OF POLICY.</b><br>
This Privacy Policy applies only to information you provide to us online or that we collect from you while visiting or using our Website or Services. It does not apply to information we obtain offline or through other means. This policy does not apply to the practices of companies that Interactive Data does not own or control or operators of third party websites that you may access from the Website or from which you may access the Website.<br>
<br>
2)    <b>WHAT INFORMATION WE COLLECT AND USE.</b><br>
<br>
<blockquote>
	a)    We receive and store information that you voluntarily provide when using the Website and the Services.  For example, when you subscribe to our Services, we require you to provide personal information including your name, postal address, email address, telephone number, facsimile number, company affiliation, and other basic contact information.  You may also provide additional personal information to us when you voluntarily communicate with us, such as when you request information, register for email updates or listen to a webcast, or when you post information to the user content portion of the Website.<br>
	<br>
	b)    In addition to the information voluntarily provide to us, we automatically record information from your Internet browser, including your IP address (the Internet address of your PC), your computer's name, the type and version of your web browser, the Internet addresses of the sites from which you access the Website (referring addresses) and other generally-accepted log information. We may also record page views (hit counts) and other statistical and tracking information, which are aggregated with website utilization information from other users in order to understand how our Website is being used.  One or more of the above activities may also be carried out by third parties we have engaged to host certain portions or functions of or otherwise render services in connection with our Website, such as resume submission, or operating a webcast on our behalf.<br>
	<br>
	c)    Cookies.  We use common website management technologies called cookies.  A cookie is a small data file, which often includes a unique but non-identifying code that is sent to your browser from a website's computers and stored on your computer's hard drive. Cookies can be used to provide you with a tailored user experience and to make it easier for you to use the Website upon a future visit.  Interactive Data will also use cookies to recognize you when you return to our Website.  Our cookies are “persistent,” or permanent, cookies, since they remain on your computer after you end your visit, or “session,” on our Website.  Most web browsers are set to accept cookies by default, though you can manually disable the cookies feature of your browser. You should review the online documentation of your browser or consult with the provider of your browser for instructions on how to disable cookies.  If you disable cookies on your computer, some parts of our Website may not be available to you or may not function as intended.<br>
	<br>
	d)    Referring Sites.  Websites that contain links to our Website are known as “referring sites.”  When you enter our Website from a referring site, we automatically collect information that identifies the referring site and use this information to analyze which third party services send visitors to our Website and to present appropriate content to our potential customers. Interactive Data tabulates referrer information on an aggregate basis to identify Website trends and traffic patterns.<br>
</blockquote>
<br>
3)    <b>WHAT WE DO WITH INFORMATION WE COLLECT AND USE.  </b>In general we use the information we collect from and about you to provide information and perform Services that you request, to improve our Website and Services, for our administrative and marketing purposes, and as otherwise described in this Privacy Policy.<br>
<br>
<blockquote>
	a)    Third Party Service Providers and Vendors.  We share your personally identifiable information with third parties with whom we contract to: (i) distribute information relating to our Website or Services, (ii) maintain email alerts list and fulfill requests submitted via the Website; (iii) host certain portions or functions of our Website (such as resume submission or operating a webcast on our behalf); and/or (iv) provide technical or professional services to us. <br>
	<br>
	b)    Legal Compliance and Protection of Rights.  We may share your personally identifiable information with third parties, including law enforcement agencies or others to the extent appropriate to comply with legal requirements; to cooperate in a judicial or other legal proceeding; to enforce or apply our Website Terms and Conditions or other contractual commitments; or to assert, defend, or protect our rights or property or the rights, property, health or safety of our users or other persons.<br>
	<br>
	c)    Business Transactions.  We may disclose personal information to third parties in connection with a potential or actual transaction or proceeding involving a transfer of some or all of the businesses or assets to which the information pertains. <br>
</blockquote>
<br>
4)<b>    ACCESS, CHANGING OR REMOVING PERSONAL INFORMATION.</b>  You may update or request that we delete information that we maintain about you by sending a request to the address provided in Section 9 below, in which case we will update or remove your personally identifiable information from our databases, except as necessary for billing and routine data archiving.<br>
<br>
5)    <b>COMMUNICATIONS TO OUR USERS.</b>  Periodically, Interactive Data will send news and information to parties who have expressed interest in Interactive Data. We also may send these updates to persons who submit a request for information via email on our Website, register to receive email alerts or register to listen to a webcast offered through the Website. We may engage a third party to distribute such information and updates or operate such webcast on our behalf, which would require us to share your contact information. You can stop receiving these communications by sending an email request to the address listed in Section 9 below. As an alternative, you may write to us with your request, at the mailing address set forth in Section 9.<br>
<br>
6)    <b>SECURITY OF PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION.</b>  Interactive Data maintains controls to protect the information you provide us. Interactive Data limits access to databases containing personally identifiable information to employees who have a need to access the information. We have put in place security systems designed to prevent unauthorized disclosure of information you provide to us.  These systems are structured to deter and prevent hackers and others from accessing this information. Due to the nature of Internet communications and evolving technologies, however, we cannot assure that the information you provide us will remain free from loss, misuse, or alteration by third parties who, despite our efforts, obtain unauthorized access.<br>
<br>
7)    <b>LINKS TO OTHER SITES.</b>  The Website may contain links to other web sites operated by third parties not affiliated with Interactive Data. The inclusion of any link to such third party sites does not imply endorsement by Interactive Data of those sites. We have not reviewed the sites linked to the Website and are not responsible for the data-handling practices of any such sites.<br>
<br>
8)    <b>CHILDREN</b>.  Persons under the age of 18 are not permitted to register for the Services and Interactive Data does not knowingly collect, either online or offline, personally identifiable information from persons under the age of 18.<br>
<br>
9)    <b>NOTIFICATION OF CHANGES.</b>  Interactive Data may change or modify this Privacy Policy from time to time.  We will post notice of the new or revised policy from the Privacy Policy link on the home page of our Website.  Your use of our Website following any such change constitutes your agreement to follow and be bound by the Privacy Policy, as changed.<br>
