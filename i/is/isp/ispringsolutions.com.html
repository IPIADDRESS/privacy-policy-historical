    <h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>
    <p>
        iSpring Solutions, Inc. and its affiliates (hereinafter referred as “iSpring”) respects your right to privacy
        and we understand that, when you visit our website, use our products and services or otherwise interact with
        us (for example, by viewing our webinars), you prefer to control the way you share your personal information
        (“Personal Data”) and preferences. iSpring offers a wide range of products, including desktop products, our
        web based services, custom and support services. We refer to all of these products, together with our other
        services and websites as "Services" in this Privacy Policy.
    </p>
    <p>
        The terms “we”, “us” and “our” refers to iSpring. The terms “user”, “you”, and “your” refer to site visitors,
        customers and any other users of the site.
    </p>
    <p>
        iSpring provides this Privacy Policy ("Policy") to inform you of our practices with respect to the collection
        and use of your Personal Data.
    </p>
    <p>
        iSpring complies with the Regulation 2016/679/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016
        on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of
        such data (“GDPR”). iSpring acts as both a data controller and a data processor under GDPR.
    </p>
    <p>
        iSpring has implemented the following requirements under the GDPR, including but not limited to:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>A record of our Personal Data processing activities;</li>
        <li>Adequate organizational and technical protection measures;</li>
        <li>
            Request forms and internal instructions for Privacy by Design &amp; Default, Data Portability, Data Subject
            Rights like the Right to be Forgotten.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        We collect information globally and primarily store that information on the servers based in the United States
        and Germany. We transfer, process and store your information outside of your country of residence, to wherever
        we or our third-party service providers operate for the purpose of providing you the Services. The Personal
        Data of individuals from EEA and Switzerland is stored on servers based in Germany and processed in the United
        States. Regardless of where your information is stored or processed, we apply the same protection described in
        this Policy. iSpring offers European builds of desktop products to individuals from EEA and Switzerland to
        store the information we collect from your use of the Services on the servers in Germany. We also use the model
        contract clauses approved by European Commission as a means of ensuring adequate protection when transferring
        data outside of the EEA and Switzerland. By incorporating model contract clauses into a contract established
        between the parties transferring data,  personal data can be protected when transferred outside the EEA to
        countries which have not been deemed by the European Commission to adequately protect personal data.
    </p>

    <h3 id="roleAsProcessor">iSpring in its role as processor</h3>
    <p>
        <strong><em>Personal information and content you provide through iSpring web based services.</em></strong>
        When customers and iSpring partners use iSpring web based services to process Personal Data in their content,
        iSpring acts as a data processor. The customer of iSpring that owns an account in iSpring web based services,
        will be responsible for determining the purposes and means of the processing of the content and any Personal
        Data provided by end users of the account, and this iSpring customer (or its end users) will be the data
        controller in regards to such processing.
    </p>
    <p>
        The owner of an account in iSpring web based services has the right to update the email address associated with
        his account or deactivate an account by submitting a written request to support@ispringsolutions.com.
    </p>
    <p>
        If at any time iSpring has access to Personal Data stored in the account owned by an iSpring customer, then
        iSpring shall be a data sub-processor, and any actions performed by iSpring in relation to such data shall be
        solely governed by the agreement concluded between us and the iSpring customer. iSpring offers a GDPR-compliant
        Data Processing Addendum (DPA) that incorporates iSpring’s commitments as data processor.
    </p>
    <h3 id="legalBases">Legal bases for processing</h3>
    <p>
        If you are an individual in the European Economic Area (EEA) or Switzerland, we collect and process information
        about you only where we have legal bases for doing so under applicable EU laws.  The legal bases depend on the
        Services you use and how you use them. To process your information as described above, we rely on the following
        legal bases:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong><em>Performance of a contract:</em></strong> the use of your information is necessary to provide you the
            Services, customer support and personalized features. If you order and use our Services, we will use your
            information to carry out our obligation to complete and administer that Services under the contract
            that we have with you;
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong><em>Legitimate interests:</em></strong> the processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate
            interests pursued by us, namely for information security. We also want to provide you with the best
            suitable content of the website, to improve and promote our products and services and the content on our
            website, and for administrative, fraud detection and legal purposes;
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong><em>Consent:</em></strong> we may rely on your consent to use your Personal Data for specific purposes,
            for example, for sending newsletters and for certain direct marketing purposes.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h3 id="howWeStore">How we store and secure information we collect</h3>
    <p>
        <strong><em>Information storage.</em></strong> We use data hosting service providers in the United States and
        Germany to host the information we collect, and we use technical measures to secure your data.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong><em>Technical and organizational security procedures and data transfers.</em></strong> We observe
        reasonable procedures to prevent unauthorized access to, and the misuse of Personal Data. We use appropriate
        business systems and procedures to protect and safeguard the Personal Data. We also use security procedures
        and technical and physical restrictions for accessing and using the Personal Data on our servers. Only
        authorized personnel are permitted to access Personal Data in the course of their work.
    </p>
    <p>
        For more information on where we store your information and our security measures please contact us as provided
        in the Contact Us section below.
    </p>
    <p>
        Because iSpring is a company with customers located in many different countries around the world, it is
        important that we comply with data privacy laws in many jurisdictions. In our role as data processor we have
        implemented the model contractual clauses to enable the lawful transfer of Personal Data from the EEA and
        Switzerland to the United States. The Standard Contractual Clauses set out iSpring commitment to privacy and
        data protection when processing data in connection with the provision of products and services to our customers
        and partners, and dealing with the transfer of Personal Data outside the EEA and Switzerland in connection
        with the provision of such products and services. If you are a customer or partner that specifically requires
        the implementation of model contractual clauses directly with iSpring, where appropriate and where iSpring is
        a data processor for the customer or partner, please contact us as provided in the Contact Us section below.
    </p>
    <h3 id="keepInformation">How long we keep information (retention procedures)</h3>
    <p>
        iSpring will store your personal information as long as necessary to perform the purposes of processing as
        stated in this Policy. After such time, we will either delete or anonymize your information or, if this is
        not possible (for example, because the information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely
        store your information and isolate it from any further use until deletion is possible.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong><em>Site account information:</em></strong> We retain your account information for as long as your account
        is active and a reasonable period thereafter in case you decide to re-activate the Services. We also retain
        some of your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, to resolve disputes, to enforce
        our agreements, to support business operations, and to continue to develop and improve our Services. Where we
        retain information for Service improvement and development, we take steps to eliminate information that
        directly identifies you, and we only use the information to uncover collective insights about the use of our
        Services, not to specifically analyze personal characteristics about you.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong><em>Information you share on the Services:</em></strong> If your site account is deactivated or disabled,
        some of your information and the content you have provided will remain in order to allow your team members
        or other users to make full use of the Services.  For example, we continue to display messages you sent to
        the users that received them and continue to display content you provided.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong><em>Managed accounts:</em></strong> If the Services are made available to you through an organization
        (e.g., your employer), we retain your information as long as required by the administrator of your account.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong><em>Marketing information:</em></strong> If you have elected to receive marketing emails from us, we
        retain information about your marketing preferences for a reasonable period of time from the date you last
        expressed interest in our Services, such as when you last opened an email from us or ceased using your iSpring
        site account. We retain information derived from cookies and other tracking technologies for a reasonable
        period of time from the date such information was created.
    </p>

    <p>
        Subject to some limits, you have certain rights regarding your Personal Data and the processing thereof.
