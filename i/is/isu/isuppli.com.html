<p>IHS Markit Ltd. and its subsidiaries and affiliates (collectively "<strong>IHS Markit</strong>," "<strong>us</strong>," "<strong>we</strong>," or "<strong>our</strong>") are committed to protecting your privacy and providing you with a positive experience while using our websites, products, or services ("<strong>Platform</strong>").</p><p>IHS Markit reserves the right, at any time, to modify this Privacy Policy. If we make revisions that change the way we collect, use, or share personal information, we will post those changes in this Privacy Policy. If we make material changes to our Privacy Policy, we may also notify you by other means prior to the changes taking effect, such as by posting a notice on our Platform or sending you a notification. You should review this Privacy Policy periodically so that you keep up to date on our most current policies and practices. We will note the effective date of the latest version of our Privacy Policy at the end of this Privacy Policy.</p><p>For IHS Markit’s advertising-related policies and consumer opt-out procedures, please see the <a href="https://ad.wsod.com/privacy.php">Digital Advertising Privacy Policy</a>.</p><h4>1. Scope</h4><p>This Policy applies to IHS Markit’s Platform and provides you with guidance on your rights and obligations in relation to your personal information.</p><p>IHS Markit's Privacy Policy (the "<strong>Privacy Policy</strong>") establishes and communicates the key principles that IHS Markit follows in protecting the personal information that we collect. Please note that some privacy rights and obligations may differ in certain locations based on local law, in which case IHS Markit will comply with the local legal requirements. To the extent a notice provided at the time of collection from a website or specific product conflicts with this Privacy Policy, such specific notice or supplemental privacy statement will control.</p><h4>2. Collection of Personal Information</h4><p>"<strong>Personal information</strong>" is any information that can be used to identify an individual, and may include things such as your name, physical address, email address, phone number, login information, marketing preferences, company affiliation, geographic location, or payment card information. IHS Markit may collect personal information that is necessary for legitimate business purposes, which will be disclosed to you at the time of collection. IHS Markit will use this information for the purposes for which it was collected. IHS Markit may also collect personal information from trusted third-party sources and engage third parties to collect personal information to assist us.</p><p>One of the most common methods of collecting personal information is during the online form submission or registration process, including where a website user is requesting a free trial or a courtesy newsletter, registering for an event, or responding to similar offers such as sample reports, white papers, or further product information.</p><p>In some instances, IHS Markit and the third parties we engage may automatically collect and aggregate data using cookies, weblogs, web beacons, and other similar applications. This information is used to better understand and improve the usability, performance, and effectiveness of our Platform and to help us tailor content or offers for you. Please read the “Cookies” section below for more information.</p><h4>3. Purpose and Use of Personal Information</h4><p>IHS Markit may use your personal information for operational, legal, administrative, and other legitimate purposes permitted by applicable law. Some of the ways we may use personal information include:</p><ul><li>Providing you with requested products or services.</li><li>Providing you with information regarding similar products or events.</li><li>Analyzing and monitoring extent of use.</li><li>Providing customized product and service information.</li><li>Allowing users to participate voluntarily in mailings or other events.</li><li>Providing product service updates, information, and alerts.</li><li>Sending communications, including for marketing or other customer satisfaction purposes.</li><li>Order processing, and to provide transaction documents.</li><li>To contact users for information verification purposes.</li></ul><h4>4. Right to Access and Correct Personal Information</h4><p>We strive to make sure that our information is reliable, accurate, and up-to-date. While personal information is maintained by IHS Markit, you may access your personal information to the extent required by law to review, update, and correct inaccuracies. Upon request made to the contact listed below, we will provide you with reasonable access to the personal information we collect about you. Because personal information—for example, your email address—is required to use the Platform, we retain personal information as long as your account is active. You will have the opportunity to correct, transfer, update, modify, or delete this information by logging into your account and updating your information online. You may also limit the use and disclosure of your information by either unsubscribing from marketing communications or contacting us at the address listed below under the section titled “Contact Information” or by emailing <a href="mailto:privacy@ihsmarkit.com">privacy@ihsmarkit.com</a>. Please note that some information may remain in our records even after you request deletion of your information, to the extent permitted by the Privacy Shield Principles. Additionally, there may be limits to the amount of information we can practically provide. For example, we may limit access to personal information where the burden or expense of providing access would be disproportionate to the risks to an individual's privacy or where doing so would violate others' rights.</p><h4>5. Sharing Personal Information</h4><p>IHS Markit may disclose personal information to its parent, subsidiary, affiliates, and other related companies. IHS Markit may disclose personal information to service providers for the purposes of operating our business, delivering, improving, and customizing our products or services, sending marketing and communications related to our business, payment processing, and for other legitimate purposes permitted by applicable law or otherwise with your consent. Personal information handled by these service providers is subject to their terms of use and privacy policies. Please review the service provider’s terms of use and privacy policies to better understand how they manage your personal information. IHS Markit is responsible for the processing of personal data it receives under the Privacy Shield Framework and subsequently transfers to a third party acting as an agent on its behalf. IHS Markit complies with the Privacy Shield Principles for all onward transfers of personal data from the EU, including the onward transfer liability provisions.</p><p>There may also be instances when IHS Markit may disclose your personal information without providing you with a choice in order to honor a request that you have made through the products or services; comply with the law or in response to a court order, government request, or other legal process; protect the interests, rights, safety, or property of IHS Markit or others; protect against fraud or for risk management purposes; or respond to adverse third parties (i.e., adverse parties and their counsel and other agents) in the context of litigation. In addition, if IHS Markit sells all or part of its business or makes a sale or transfer of assets or is otherwise involved in a merger or business transfer, you agree that IHS Markit may transfer your personal information to a third party as part of that transaction.</p><p>In all cases IHS Markit requires all unaffiliated third parties to treat personal information as confidential. IHS Markit will not provide personal information to third parties for their own marketing purposes without your consent.</p><p>If you participate in a discussion forum, chat room, or provide comments related to IHS Markit on a social media or other public platform, you should be aware that the information you provide there (i.e., your public profile) will be made broadly available to others, and could be used to contact you, send you unsolicited messages, or for purposes neither IHS Markit nor you have control over. Also, please recognize that social media forums and chat rooms not controlled by IHS Markit may have additional rules and conditions.
