            corporation. </strong>&nbsp;We are committed to protecting the privacy of our
        visitors while they interact with the content, products and services on this site
        (the "Site").&nbsp; This Privacy Policy applies to the Site only. It does not apply
        to other websites to which we link.&nbsp; Because we gather certain types of information
        about our users, we want you to understand what information we collect about you,
        how we collect it, how that information is used, and how you can control our disclosure
        of it. You agree that your use of the Site signifies your assent to this Privacy
        Policy. If you do not agree with this Privacy Policy, please do not use the Site.<strong></strong></p>
    <p>
        <strong>1)&nbsp; Information Collected</strong></p>
    <p>
        We collect information that you voluntarily provide to us (e.g. through a website
        registration process, sign-ups or emails);
    </p>
    <p>
        In order to fully access this Site, you must first complete the registration process,
        during which we will collect personal information about you. The information will
        include your name, address, and email address. We do not collect personally identifiable
        information about you except when you specifically provide such information to us
        on a voluntary basis.&nbsp; When you choose to subscribe to our premium products
        then, we require you to provide your "Billing Information" in addition to other
        personal information that may be required to complete a transaction such as your
        phone number, billing and shipping addresses and credit card information. We do
        not sell your personal information to third-parties for marketing purposes. We may
        selectively send you email with special offers from external marketers that may
        interest you. The external advertisers are carefully screened and the email will
        be sent through our email provider. Please send an email to support @ istockanalyst.com
        to opt out of our email list.</p>
    <p>
        <strong>Cookie:</strong></p>
    <p>
        A cookie is a small amount of data, which often includes an anonymous unique identifier
        that is sent to your browser from a website's computer and stored on your computer's
        hard drive. Each website can send its own cookie to your browser if your browser's
        preferences allow it, but (to protect your privacy) your browser only permits a
        web site to access the cookies it has already sent to you, not the cookies sent
        to you by other sites.
        <br>
        <br>
        Our site uses "cookies" and other tracking technologies.&nbsp; Cookies enable us
        to serve secure pages to our users without asking them to sign in repeatedly.&nbsp;
        Most browsers allow you to control cookies, including whether or not to accept them
        and how to remove them. If a user's system is idle for a defined time, the cookie
        will expire, forcing the user to sign in again to continue their session. This prevents
        unauthorized access to the user's information while they are away from their computer.
    </p>
    <p>
        You may set most browsers to notify you if you receive a cookie, or you may choose
        to block cookies with your browser, but please note that if you choose to erase
        or block your cookies, you will need to re-enter your original user ID and password
        to gain access to certain parts of the Site.</p>
    <p>
        If you have set your computer to reject cookies, you may not be able to access our
        services.
    </p>
    <p>
        Third-Party Cookies:&nbsp; In the course of serving advertisements to this site,
        our third-party advertisers, including Google, may place or recognize a unique "cookie"
        on your browser. The cookie may be used to serve ads based on your prior visits
        to iStockAnalyst.com or other sites on the internet. You can opt out of third-party
        use of cookies for interest based advertising by visiting <strong><a href="http://www.aboutads.info/">
            aboutads.info</a></strong>.<br>
        <br>
        Please remember, cookies do not contain confidential information such as your home
        address, telephone number or credit card details. We do not exchange cookies with
        any third party websites or external data suppliers.

    <p>
        We may transfer personally identifiable information as an asset in connection with
        a proposed or actual merger or sale (including any transfers made as part of an
        insolvency or bankruptcy proceeding) involving all or part of our business or as
        part of a corporate reorganization, stock sale or other change in control.</p>

        terms and conditions of use or may be causing injury or interference with our rights,
        property, our customers or anyone who could be harmed by such activities.</p>
