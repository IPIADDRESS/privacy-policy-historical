<h1>iStock's Privacy Policy</h1>
<p>Last Updated: August 2012</p>
<h3>Please read this policy and if you have any questions contact us.</h3>
<br>
<h3 class="legal-subheader">By using the site you consent to the collection, use and disclosure of your personal information in accordance with this policy.</h3>
<p>iStockphoto is committed to protecting your privacy. This privacy policy tells you about our online collection, use and disclosure of personal information. The terms of this policy apply to all personal information collected by iStockphoto on the website istockphoto.com and other country-specific iStockphoto websites which may be linked to istockphoto.com. We have created this policy pursuant to the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Personal Information Protection Act</span> (Alberta) S.A. 2003, c.P-6.5, the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (Canada) S.C. 2000, c.5 and the "Anti-Spam Act" (Canada) S.C. 2010, c.23. Your home jurisdiction may have privacy laws that are more or less protective than the province of Alberta, Canada.</p>
<p>This site is operated by iStockphoto LP ("iStockphoto"), a subsidiary of Getty Images, Inc. ("Getty Images") and may be accessed in Canada and abroad. For personal information protection purposes in the European Union, iStockphoto is the controller and, unless otherwise noted, is also the processor of the personal information.</p>
<br><ol>
<li class="list-block">
<h3>Privacy Officer</h3>

<p>Joy Griffith <br> iStockphoto LP <br> Suite 200 - 1240 20th Ave SE <br> Calgary, AB T2G 1M8</p>

Limited demographic information, such as the industry you work in, may also be collected and may be linked to your personal information.</p>

<h3>Use of Cookies and Other Technologies</h3>
<p>iStockphoto uses "cookies" to enable you to sign in to our services and to help personalize and improve your online experience. A cookie is a small text file that is placed on your hard drive or device. Cookies contain information, including personal information that can later be read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you. The information that cookies collect includes the date and time of your visit, your registration information, session identification number and your navigational history and preferences.</p>
<p>Cookies offer you many conveniences:</p>
<ul>
<li> They allow us to identify registered users when they return to the site so that they can retrieve previous image search results, access lightboxes, shopping carts, and view their previous invoices. </li>

</ul>
<p>We strive to make this site user-friendly and relevant. Our goal is to deliver more personalized products and services to you.  For this purpose, iStockphoto also works with third party partners who use cookies on our site to:</p>
<ul>
<li> Measure and analyze aggregate usage and volume statistical information from our users on our site.

</ul>
<p>This privacy policy covers the collection of information and use of cookies by iStockphoto only, and does not cover the use of cookies or other technologies by third parties to collect information. If you would like to know more about this practice and your choices about not having this information used by third-parties, please visit <a href="http://networkadvertising.org">www.networkadvertising.org</a> or contact Customer Service at 1(866) 478-6251 or +1(403) 265-3062 (international).</p>
<p>In addition to cookies, we may use other technologies, including single-pixel gifs (also known as web beacons) on our websites and in promotional e-mail messages or newsletters. Web beacons allow us to measure the actions of a user opening the page that contained the web beacon. We use web beacons to assist us in determining how many users have visited certain pages or opened messages or newsletters, improve user experience and manage site content. When you click on a link on a page with a web beacon, we may record your response to customize our offerings to you.</p>
<p>You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies. Please be aware that the site is optimally designed to operate with cookies enabled in your internet browser.

</li>
<li class="list-block">
<h3>Security of Your Personal Information</h3>
<p>The security of your personal information is important to us. We follow generally accepted industry standards to help protect your personal information including without limitation:</p>
<ul>
<li> limiting access to your personal information to those of our employees who require it to provide services to you; </li>

<li class="list-block">
<h3>Forums &amp; Other Interactive Services</h3>
<p>Our sites may include discussion forums or other interactive areas or services, including blogs, chat rooms, bulletin boards, message boards, online hosting or storage services, or other areas or services in which you or third parties create, post or store any content, messages, comments, materials or other items on the sites ("Interactive Areas"). If you use an Interactive Area, you should be aware that these areas are open to the public and any personal information you post or provide at registration may be viewable by others. We are not responsible for personal information you submit in connection with the Interactive Areas, nor are we responsible for how others might use that information, including sending you unsolicited messages. Interactive Area postings may be retained indefinitely. If at any time you would like to remove a posting, please email us at <a href="mailto:service@istockphoto.com">service@istockphoto.com</a>. Keep in mind that removal of a posting from an Interactive Area does not mean that the posting will be deleted from our systems.</p>
</li>
<li class="list-block">
<h3>Referrals</h3>
<p>If you choose to use our referral services to tell a friend about our products or services (including images in your Lightbox, promotional campaigns, new websites, job postings, etc.), we will ask you for your friend's name and email address. We will use that information to send your friend a one-time email inviting him or her to visit the site, review the product or service you have selected and if they choose to join us, to track our referral services. We may use a third-party provider to administer this function, but any such third-party provider may only use the information submitted to facilitate this one-time email.</p>
<p>If you are the person who was referred (either by email or otherwise, including through our referral program by clicking on a link on a third party site or email) and you choose to join us, your iStockphoto member name and any information you choose to put on your profile page may be viewable to the person that referred you so that they may track their referral services.</p>
