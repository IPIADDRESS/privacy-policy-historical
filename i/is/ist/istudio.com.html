    <h3>iStudio Website Privacy Statement</h3>

1. Acknowledgement and acceptance of terms
<p>
iStudio is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Statement sets
forth our current privacy practices with regard to the information we
collect when you or your computer interact with our website. By accessing
iStudio.com, you acknowledge and fully understand iStudio.com's Privacy
Statement and freely consent to the information collection and use practices
described in this Website Privacy Statement.
</p>
2. Participating Merchant Policies
<p>
Related services and offerings with links from this website, including
vendor sites, have their own privacy statements that can be viewed by
clicking on the corresponding links within each respective website. Online
merchants and others who participate in iStudio services are encouraged to
participate in industry privacy initiatives and to take a responsible
attitude towards consumer privacy. However, since we do not have direct
control over the policies or practices of participating merchants and other
third parties, we are not responsible for the privacy practices or contents
of those sites. We recommend and encourage that you always review the
privacy policies of merchants and other third parties before you provide any
personal information or complete any transaction with such parties.
</p>
3. Information We Collect and How We Use It
<p>
iStudio collects certain information from and about its users three ways:
directly from our Web Server logs, the user, and with Cookies.
</p>
      a. Web Server Logs.
<p>
      When you visit our Website, we may track information to administer the
site and analyze its usage. Examples of information we may track include:

        Your Internet protocol address.

        The kind of browser or computer you use.

        Number of links you click within the site.

        State or country from which you accessed the site.

        Date and time of your visit.

        Name of your Internet service provider.

        Web page you linked to our site from.

        Pages you viewed on the site.
</p>
    
b. Use of Cookies
<p>
iStudio may use cookies to personalize or enhance your user experience. A
cookie is a small text file that is placed on your hard disk by a Web page
server. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your
computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you, and can only be read by a
Web Server in the domain that issued the cookie to you.<br clear="none">

One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature
to save you time. For example, if you personalize a web page, or navigate
within a site, a cookie helps the site to recall your specific information
on subsequent visits. Hence, this simplifies the process of delivering
relevant content and eases site navigation by providing and saving your
preferences and login information as well as providing personalized
functionality..<br clear="none">

iStudio reserves the right to share aggregated site statistics with partner
companies, but does not allow other companies to place cookies on our
website unless there is a temporary, overriding customer value (such as
merging into iStudio.com a site that relies on third-party cookies).<br clear="none">

You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most Web browsers
automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser
setting to decline cookies. If you reject cookies by changing your browser
settings then be aware that this may disable some of the functionality on
our Website.
</p>
      c. Personal Information Users
<p>
Visitors to our website can register to purchase services. When you
register, we will request some personal information such as name, address,
email, telephone number or facsimile number, account number and other
relevant information. For other types of registrations, we will ask for the
relevant information. You may also be asked to disclose personal information
to us so that we can provide assistance and information to you. For example,
such data may be warranted in order to provide online technical support and
troubleshooting.
</p>

<p>
We will not disclose personally identifiable information we collect from you
to third parties without your permission except to the extent necessary
including:

        To fulfill your service requests for services.

        To protect ourselves from liability,

        To respond to legal process or comply with law, or

        In connection with a merger, acquisition, or liquidation of the
company.
</p>
4. Use of Web Beacons or GIF files
<p>
iStudio.com Web pages may contain electronic images known as Web beacons -
sometimes also called single-pixel gifs - that allow iStudio to count users
who have visited those pages and to deliver co-branded services. iStudio may
include Web beacons in promotional e-mail messages or newsletters in order
to determine whether messages have been opened and acted upon.
</p>
<p>
Some of these Web beacons may be placed by third party service providers to
help determine the effectiveness of our advertising campaigns or email
communications. These Web beacons may be used by these service providers to
place a persistent cookie on your computer. This allows the service provider
to recognize your computer each time you visit certain pages or emails and
compile anonymous information in relation to those page views, which in turn
enables us and our service providers to learn which advertisements and
emails bring you to our website and how you use the site. iStudio prohibits
Web beacons from being used to collect or access your personal information.
</p>
5. Accessing Web Account Information
<p>
We will provide you with the means to ensure that personally identifiable
information in your web account file is correct and current. You may review
this information by contacting us by sending an email to our support
attendant -- iStudio@iStudio.com
</p>
6. Changes to this Statement
<p>
iStudio has the discretion to occasionally update this privacy statement.
When we do, we will also revise the "updated" date at the top of this
Privacy page. We encourage you to periodically review this privacy statement
to stay informed about how we are helping to protect the personal
information we collect. Your continued use of the service constitutes your
agreement to this privacy statement and any updates.
</p>
7. Contacting Us
<p>
If you have questions regarding our Privacy Statement, its implementation,
failure to adhere to this Privacy Statement and/or our general practices,
please contact us at iStudio@iStudio.com
