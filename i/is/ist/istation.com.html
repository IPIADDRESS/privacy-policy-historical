    <strong>What information is collected?</strong><br>
    We collect information voluntarily submitted to Istation. Examples of such information
    include</p>
<ul class="bullets">
    <li>identifying information, such as district and school names, first and last names
        of students, student district/school issued identification numbers, teacher and
        administrator names, and teacher and administrator e-mail addresses;</li>
    <li>responses, such as responses to interactive activities and assessments;</li>
    <li>security information, such as user names, passwords, and password hints;</li>
    <li>contact information, such as names, mailing addresses, and phone numbers;</li>
    <li>Resource-use behavior, such as pages visited, downloads, or searches requested;</li>
    <li>browser information, such as browser version, IP address, and presence of various
        plug-ins and tools; and</li>
    <li>demographic data, such as gender, race, special-education status, socioeconomic
        status, and English language learner status.</li>
</ul>
<p>
    At least some of the above information may be provided by the classroom teacher
    and/or other school administrators using the Resources.</p>
<a name="2"></a>
<p>
    <strong>How is information used?</strong><br>
    The personal information provided to Istation will be used in furtherance of the
    Resources, such as to provide access to, and use of, the Resources and to provide
    customer service and support.
</p>
<a name="3"></a>
<p>
    <strong>How are student results and student information made available?</strong><br>
    Student results from usage of the Resources are available for review to Authorized
    Users on the Web Site. Student results may  be viewed only as authorized by the applicable
    school district. Generally, teachers may  see only the results of students in his/her
    classroom, principals may  see only the results of students in his/her school,
    and district-level administrators may see only the results of students in the district.
    Student results are shared within Istation on a need-to-know basis only. Istation
    employees are required to keep the information confidential, and it may not be used
    for any purpose other than to carry out the services they are performing for Istation.
</p>
<p>
    Student user identification (first name and last initial) and user passwords assigned
    by Istation are available to applicable Authorized Users on the Web Site.</p>
<a name="4"></a>
<p>
    <strong>Does Istation share my information with third parties?</strong><br>
    Istation may engage third-party agents, contractors, vendors, and service providers
    to perform various functions on Istation’s behalf ("<strong>Service Providers</strong>"). For example,
    Istation may share personal information with Istation’s research partners provided,
    however, that students' names will not be shared with such researchers without Your
    permission. The purpose of such research is to prove the validity and efficacy of
    the Resources and to improve the Resources where appropriate. Additionally, results
    may be aggregated and reported on a de-identified basis: no personal information
    (including, but not limited to, information on specific districts, schools, or students)
    is revealed in such aggregated results without Your prior permission.</p>
<p>
    Other services provided by Service Providers may include, but are not limited to,
    (i) managing customer information, (ii) analyzing data, (iii) developing, hosting,
    and maintaining the Resources and any related databases, and (iv) communicating about
    Istation. Istation does not authorize any of the Service Providers to make any other
    use of any personal information or to contact You outside the context of the services
    related to the Resources.</p>
<p>
    Istation reserves the right to disclose personal information as required by law,
    in response to legal process and law enforcement requests, and as necessary to protect
    the property, interests, and rights of the Affiliated Group and others.</p>
<a name="5"></a>
<p>
    <strong>How do I access my information? How do I change my information? </strong>
    <br>
    Your personal information can be accessed and changed by contacting Istation using
    the Contact Information provided above. Please be sure to include Your full contact
    information, such as Your name, address, and e-mail address, as applicable, when
    contacting Istation to access or change Your personal information. Also, please
    allow one week for e-mail requests and three weeks for postal mail requests to be
    fulfilled.</p>
<a name="6"></a>
<p>
    <strong>How does Istation protect kids’ privacy?</strong><br>
    If You are a parent or legal guardian of a child under the age of 18, and Your child’s
    personal information has been provided to Istation using the Resources, You may
    contact Istation using the Contact Information provided above. You may request a
    copy of Your child’s personal information or request to change or delete any and all personal
    information about Your child. Please be sure to include Your full contact information,
    such as Your name, address, and e-mail address, as applicable, when contacting Istation
    to access, change, or delete Your child’s personal information. Also, please allow
    one week for e-mail requests and three weeks for postal mail requests to be fulfilled.</p>
<a name="7"></a>
<p>
    <strong>Support Services</strong><br>
    In addition to being able to call Istation’s support services department, users
    of the Resources may also e-mail Istation their questions using the Contact Information
    above. Other than an e-mail address, Istation does not request that users submit
    any personal information online for support services inquiries. Istation may, however,
    ask for additional nonpersonal information to better help Istation respond to support
    service questions. Istation uses the e-mail address to communicate directly with
    administrators, teachers, and parents.</p>
<p>
    Administrators and teachers may create student accounts used for participation in
    the Resources. Creation of student accounts may occasionally require e-mail exchanges
    between school personnel and Istation support services. These communications may
    include the first name and last name of a student, district/school issued student
    identification numbers, and Istation user identification. This information is transmitted
    over a secure Internet connection and is used by Istation only for the purpose of
    establishing user access.</p>
<p>
    Administrators and teachers may also make support service inquiries directly by
    e-mail using the Contact Information above or otherwise. Such inquiries may occasionally
    include the first and last names of students using the Resources in their requests.
    This information is used only by Istation to respond to user requests and for no
    other purpose.
</p>
<p>
    The Resources may generate a log when an unexpected error condition in running the
    program is encountered. This log may be automatically transmitted to Istation
    for internal debugging purposes. Other than the user identification (first name
    and last initial), this log does not contain any personal information.</p>
<a name="8"></a>
<p>
    <strong>Web Site Security </strong>
    <br>
    We recognize our responsibility to protect the information You entrust to Istation.
    Istation uses a variety of secure techniques to protect Your information, including
    secure servers, firewalls, and encryption technologies. The Web Site is registered
    with a High Assurance SSL Certificate to enable Your browser to confirm the identity
    of the Web Site before any transmission is sent. With this technology, the identity
    of our site is automatically confirmed behind the scenes prior to the transmission
    of any personal information requested. The information You send us may be encrypted,
    a process used to scramble information making it extremely difficult to read if
    wrongly intercepted. We utilize industry-standard Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology
    to allow for the encryption of Your personal information, including, but not limited
    to, Your name and address.</p>
<a name="9"></a>
<p>
    <strong>Resource Security</strong><br>
    Istation has taken steps to ensure that personally identifiable information collected
    and access to usage results are secure, including, but not limited to, limiting
    access to Istation’s database servers as well as password protections that guard
    against unauthorized access. Student usage information and passwords are encrypted
    and stored on each local computer. All personal information sent to us is encrypted
    during transmission, such as during login. Once the data reaches our server, personal
    information and student usage results are stored on a secure database. Access to
    this information is password protected and provided only to Authorized Users.</p>
<a name="10"></a>
<p>
    <strong>Use of "Cookies"</strong><br>
    A "cookie" is a small piece of information that some Web sites store on
    Your computer’s hard drive when You visit them. This element of data is a small
    file, not a program, that contains information identifying a user. When a user
    revisits a Web site, his or her computer automatically "serves up" the
    cookie, eliminating the need for the user to reenter the information. Like many
    other Web sites, Istation uses cookies for this purpose. Your user "domain"
    is the only data stored on Your hard drive by Istation. Most Web browsers automatically
    accept cookies but allow You to modify security settings so You can approve or reject
    cookies on a case-by-case basis. At a minimum, Your Web browser must allow temporary
    cookies which are not stored on Your hard disk to log in to the Web Site. Please refer
    to the "Help" file of Your Internet browser to learn how to receive
    a warning before a cookie is stored. To learn more about cookies, we encourage You
    to visit <a href="http://www.cookiecentral.com" target="_blank" class="content_inner_link">www.cookiecentral.com</a>.</p>
<a name="11"></a>
<p>
    <strong>Third-Party Sites </strong>
    <br>
    The Web Site may contain links or references to third-party Web sites, resources, and
    advertisers (collectively "<strong>Third-Party Sites</strong>"). These
    Third-Party Sites are not controlled by Istation and, therefore, are not subject
    to this Privacy Statement. You should check the privacy policies of these individual
    Third-Party Sites to see how Your personal information will be utilized by the operators
    of those Third-Party Sites before providing any personal information. Please be
    aware that these Third-Party Sites may collect personally identifiable information
    about You and may also send "cookies." Istation is not responsible for
    the content or practices of any linked Third-Party Sites, and we provide these links
    solely for the convenience and information of our visitors.</p>
<a name="12"></a>
<p>
    <strong>Other Information </strong>
    <br>
    Istation may offer managers of accounts (school administrators and teachers) the
    opportunity to receive newsletters or other information about our products or services
    that we feel may be of interest. Only Istation or agents working on behalf of Istation
    will send You these direct mailings. If at any time You want to discontinue receiving
    this information, You can unsubscribe by following the instructions
    found at the end of Istation e-mail messages or by using the Contact Information
    above.</p>
<a name="13"></a>
<p>
    <strong>Can Istation change this Privacy Statement? </strong>
    <br>
    Istation may change this Privacy Statement at any time without notice. However,
    if the Privacy Statement changes, we will post an updated version on the Web Site.
    The policy revision date will be posted at the bottom of the page.</p>
<p>
    Istation welcomes Your questions and comments about our Privacy Statement. You may
    contact us using the Contact Information above.</p>
