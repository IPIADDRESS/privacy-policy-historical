We at ISTUDIES.COM and our affiliated companies worldwide are devoted to respecting your online privacy and understand your need for appropriate protection and management of any information you share with us by using our web sites.<br><br>

ISTUDIES.COM has created the following Online Privacy Policy so that you can understand and appreciate the care with which we intend to treat your information. This policy describes the overall privacy practices of ISTUDIES.COM regarding information that we collect on our network of web sites and through our other Internet advertising mediums, including but not limited to email, newsletters, and leave-behinds. This policy does not apply to the practices of companies that ISTUDIES.COM do not own or control, or to people that ISTUDIES.COM does not employ.<br><br>

<span class="termsSubtitle">Information Collected by ISTUDIES.COM<br>
Non-Personally Identifiable Consumer Information</span><br>
ISTUDIES.COM collects various sorts of information from you to better meet your needs and to provide you with more appropriate user experience. Some of this information is gathered automatically through cookies (a small text file placed on your computer) or other Internet tracking technologies. The type of information your browser or Internet session may automatically provide us with can include the browser you are using, your Internet domain, the operating system on your computer, your IP address and the URL you saw just before coming to the ISTUDIES.COM site, the pages of the site you went to and the URL of the page you went to upon leaving the site.<br><br>

ISTUDIES.COM may also contract with honest &amp; reputable third-party advertising companies to supply ads on our behalf. These companies may also use cookies or other procedures to collect your non-personally identifiable information.<br><br>

<span class="termsSubtitle">Personally Identifiable Consumer Information</span><br>
In addition, at some of the ISTUDIES.COM web sites, we gather information that you may choose to provide to us when requesting additional information from us or from one or more of our clients. Examples of personally particular data that you may provide to us include name, address, and email address. If you provide personally identifiable data to us, you may later choose to have your information deleted from our files, or kept from being used for purposes other than for the service requested, by following the opt-out procedures set forth below.<br><br>
How Collected Information is Used

The non-personally identifiable information that ISTUDIES.COM collects is used for marketing and sales efforts to better target advertisements and other contents in an effort to create a more personally relevant experience. The information is also used to predict responses to advertisements, and to help determine which ads perform the best and which content is most fitting for different individuals.<br><br>

If you elect to provide ISTUDIES.COM with personally identifiable information, we may utilize such information for marketing purposes, and this use may result in follow-up communications from ISTUDIES.COM and from our clients.

<span class="termsSubtitle">Sharing Information with Third Parties</span><br>

We may also disclose information to a third party who provides considerably similar services as the original service about which you requested more information. In such situations, we will offer you with an opportunity to opt-out of such sharing. Please be aware that ISTUDIES.COM is very careful in selecting companies with whom it does business.<br><br>

In addition to the above situations where your information may be shared with others, there is also the possibility that ISTUDIES.COM, or part(s) of the company, may one day be purchased by, or merged with, another company.
