<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr"><em>Information we may receive from third parties:</em></p>

<p dir="ltr"><span>We may receive information about you from third parties. For example, if you access our websites or Service through a third-party connection or log-in, for example, through Facebook Connect, by “following,” “liking,” adding the Price Network Inc application, linking your account to the Price Network Inc Service, etc., that third party may pass certain information about your use of its service to Price Network Inc. This information could include, but is not limited to, the user ID associated with your account (for example, your Facebook UID), an access token necessary to access that service, any information that you have permitted the third party to share with us, and any information you have made public in connection with that service. If you allow us access to your friends list, your friends’ user IDs, and your connection to those friends, may be used and stored to make your experience more social, and to allow you to invite your friends to use our Service as well as provide you with updates if and when your friends join Price Network Inc. You should always review, and if necessary, adjust your privacy settings on third-party websites and services before linking or connecting them to the Price Network Inc Service. You may also unlink your third party account from the Service by adjusting your settings on the third party service.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr"><em>Analytics information:</em></p>

<p dir="ltr"><span>We may directly collect analytics data, or use third-party analytics tools and services, to help us measure traffic and usage trends for the Service. These tools collect information sent by your browser or mobile device, including the pages you visit and other information that assists us in improving the Service. We collect and use this analytics information in aggregate form such that it cannot reasonably be manipulated to identify any particular individual user.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr"><em>Cookies information:</em></p>

<p dir="ltr"><span>Full details can be found on our Cookie Policy.

A cookie may also convey information to us about how you use the Service (e.g., the pages you view, the links you click and other actions you take on the Service), and allow us or our business partners to track your usage of the Service over time.

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr"><em>Clear gifs/web beacons information:</em></p>

<p dir="ltr"><span>When you use the Service, we may employ clear gifs (also known as web beacons) which are used to anonymously track the online usage patterns of our Users.

<p dir="ltr"><span>When you access the Service by or through a mobile device (including but not limited to smart-phones or tablets), we may access, collect, monitor and/or remotely store one or more “device identifiers,” such as a universally unique identifier (“UUID”). Device identifiers are small data files or similar data structures stored on or associated with your mobile device, which uniquely identify your mobile device. A device identifier may be data stored in connection with the device hardware, data stored in connection with the device’s operating system or other software, or data sent to the device by Price Network Inc. A device identifier may convey information to us about how you browse and use the Service. A device identifier may remain persistently on your device, to help you log in faster and enhance your navigation through the Service. Some features of the Service may not function properly if use or availability of device identifiers is impaired or disabled.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr"><em>Location data:</em></p>

Location data may convey to us information about how you browse and use the Service. Some features of the Service, particularly location-based services, may not function properly if use or availability of location data is impaired or disabled.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr"><em>Commercial and marketing communications:</em></p>

<p dir="ltr"><span>We use the information we collect or receive, such as your email address, to communicate directly with you.

<ul>
	<li dir="ltr">

In addition, some email addresses such as blocked@Price Network Inc.com forward to a group of Trusted Users, who will use your email address to reply to the email.</span></p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p dir="ltr"><em>What happens in the event of a change of control:</em></p>

<p dir="ltr"><span>We may buy or sell/divest/transfer the company (including any shares in the company), or any combination of its products, services, assets and/or businesses. Your information such as customer names and email addresses, User Content and other user information related to the Service may be among the items sold or otherwise transferred in these types of transactions. We may also sell, assign or otherwise transfer such information in the course of corporate divestitures, mergers, acquisitions, bankruptcies, dissolutions, reorganizations, liquidations, similar transactions or proceedings involving all or a portion of the company.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr"><em>Instances where we are required to share your information:</em></p>

<p dir="ltr"><span>Price Network Inc will disclose your information where required to do so by law or subpoena or if we reasonably believe that such action is necessary to (a) comply with the law and the reasonable requests of law enforcement; (b) to enforce our Terms of Use or to protect the security, quality or integrity of our Service; and/or (c) to exercise or protect the rights, property, or personal safety of Price Network Inc, our Users, or others.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr"><em>Sharing certain service type information we collect about you:</em></p>

<p dir="ltr"><span>We may share certain service type information, including information obtained through tools such as cookies, log files, device identifiers, location data and clear gifs (such as anonymous usage data, referring/exit pages and URLs, platform types, number of clicks, etc.): (i) with our third-party business partners for the purposes described in the section above on “How We Collect and Use Information.” We may also aggregate or otherwise strip data of all personally identifying characteristics and may share that aggregated, anonymized data with third parties.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr"><em>Ads on Price Network Inc:</em></p>

<p dir="ltr"><span>We may also share certain information such as your location, browser, and cookie data and other data relating to your use of our Service with our business partners to deliver advertisements (“ads”) that may be of interest to you. Price Network Inc may allow third-party ad servers or ad networks to serve advertisements on the Service. These third-party ad servers or ad networks use technology to send, directly to your browser or mobile device, the ads and ad links that appear on the Service, and will automatically receive your IP address when they do so. They may also use other technologies (such as cookies, JavaScript, device identifiers, location data, and clear gifs, see above) to compile information about your browser’s or device’s visits and usage patterns on the Service and on other websites, and to measure the effectiveness of their ads and to personalize the advertising content delivered to you.</span></p>

<p dir="ltr"><span>For example, Google uses DART cookies in order to deliver ads to you through the Service. Google's use of the DART cookie enables it and its partners to serve ads to you based on your visit to the Service and previous websites that you may have visited. Other advertising networks also use similar cookies, clear gifs, or other mechanisms to deliver targeted advertising to you through the Service. You can delete these cookies by following the instructions here: http://www.Price Network Inc.com/Clear-Your-Browser%27s-Cookies . You may opt out of use of Google’s DART cookie and cookies placed by Network Advertising Initiative (NAI) certified ad networks here: http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp . Opting out of these cookies will be effective not only on the Service, but on all websites with NAI certified advertising networks. However, these opt-outs will be ineffective on networks that are not NAI certified.</span></p>

<p dir="ltr"><span>Please note that an advertiser may ask Price Network Inc to show an ad to a certain audience of Users (e.g., based on demographics or other interests). In that situation, Price Network Inc or our Partners determines the target audience and Price Network Inc serves the advertising to that audience and only provides anonymous data to the advertiser. If you respond to such an ad, the advertiser or ad server may conclude that you fit the description of the audience they are trying to reach.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr"><span>To enhance your user experience or help us improve and measure our effectiveness, Price Network Inc may embed code from third parties on the Service. Examples of such parties may include Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, Google, YouTube, Howcast, VideoJug, AOL, and others. These third parties may collect information about you including IP address, cookies in ways Price Network Inc does not control.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr"><span>The Price Network Inc Privacy Policy does not apply to, and we cannot control the activities of third-parties. Please consult the respective privacy policies of such third parties or contact such third parties for more information.</span></p>

<p dir="ltr"><span>Your information collected through the Service may be stored and processed in the United States or any other country in which Price Network Inc or its subsidiaries, affiliates, or service providers maintain facilities. Price Network Inc may transfer information that we collect about you, including personal information, to affiliated entities, or to other third parties across borders and from your country or jurisdiction to other countries or jurisdictions around the world. If you are located in the European Union or other regions with laws governing data collection and use that may differ from U.S. law, please note that we may transfer information, including personal information, to a country and jurisdiction that does not have the same data protection laws as your jurisdiction, and you consent to the transfer of information to the U.S. or any other country in which Price Network Inc or its parent, subsidiaries, affiliates, or service providers maintain facilities and the use and disclosure of information about you as described in this Privacy Policy.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr"><em>Keeping your information safe:</em></p>

<p dir="ltr"><span>Price Network Inc cares about the security of your information, and uses commercially reasonable safeguards to preserve the integrity and security of all information collected through the Service. To protect your privacy and security, we take reasonable steps (such as requesting a unique password) to verify your identity before granting you access to your account. You are responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your unique password and account information, and for controlling access to your email communications from Price Network Inc, at all times. However, Price Network Inc cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to Price Network Inc or guarantee that information on the Service may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed. Your privacy settings may also be affected by changes to the functionality of third party sites and services that you add to the Price Network Inc Service, such as social networks. Price Network Inc is not responsible for the functionality or security measures of any third party.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr"><em>Compromise of information:</em></p>

<p dir="ltr"><span>In the event that any information under our control is compromised as a result of a breach of security, Price Network Inc will take reasonable steps to investigate the situation and where appropriate, notify those individuals whose information may have been compromised and take other steps, in accordance with any applicable laws and regulations.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr"><strong>Your Choices about Your Information</strong></p>

<p dir="ltr"><span>You control your account information and settings: You may update your account information and email-communication preferences at any time by logging in to your account and changing your profile settings. You can also stop receiving promotional email communications from us by unsubscribing from our email list. &nbsp;&nbsp;We make every effort to promptly process all unsubscribe requests. As noted above, you may not opt out of Service-related communications (e.g., account verification, purchase and billing confirmations and reminders, changes/updates to features of the Service, technical and security notices). If you have any questions about reviewing or modifying your account information, you can contact us directly at support@isbndb.com.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr"><em>Opting out of collection of your information for Tracking / Advertising:</em></p>

<p dir="ltr"><span>Please refer to your mobile device or browser’s technical information for instructions on how to delete and disable cookies, and other tracking/recording tools. Depending on your type of device, it may not be possible to delete or disable tracking mechanisms on your mobile device. Note that disabling cookies and/or other tracking tools prevents Price Network Inc or its business partners from tracking your browser’s activities in relation to the Service, and for use in targeted advertising activities by third parties. However, doing so may disable many of the features available through the Service. If you have any questions about opting out of the collection of cookies and other tracking/recording tools, you can contact us directly at support@isbndb.com.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr"><em>How long we keep your private profile information:</em></p>

<p dir="ltr"><span>Following termination of your User account, Price Network Inc may retain your private profile information for a commercially reasonable time for backup, archival, or audit purposes. For the avoidance of doubt, any information that you choose to make public on the service may not be removable.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr"><strong>Children’s Privacy</strong></p>

<p dir="ltr"><span>Price Network Inc does not knowingly collect or solicit any information from anyone under the age of 13 or knowingly allow such persons to register as Users. The Service and its content are not directed at children under the age of 13. In the event that we learn that we have collected personal information from a child under age 13 without verification of parental consent, we will delete that information as quickly as possible. If you believe that we might have any information from or about a child under 13, please contact us at support@isbndb.com.</span></p>
