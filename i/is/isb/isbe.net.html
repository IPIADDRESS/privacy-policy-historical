    <h1><a name="content"></a>Privacy Policy</h1>
<hr>
    <p>Thank you for visiting the Web site of the Illinois State 
                    Board of Education (ISBE). The agency is committed to respecting 
    and protecting your privacy as a visitor to our Web site at <a href="http://www.isbe.net" class="link">http://www.isbe.net</a>. </p>
    <p>The ISBE takes the issue of privacy very seriously and values 
                    the trust you place in us each time you use our services and 
                    access this Web site. This Privacy Policy describes the practices 
                    and policies we have put into place to safeguard any personal 
                    information that may be gathered and used by ISBE during your 
    visit to our Web site. </p>
    <p>The policy may change from time to time without notice so 
      please check back periodically. If you have any questions 
      about our privacy policies, we encourage you to contact us 
      using any of the methods outlined at the end of this Privacy 
    Policy.</p>
    <h4><b>Personal Information and Choice</b></h4>
    <p>"Personal information" is information about an individual 
                    that is readily identifiable to that specific individual. 
                    Personal information includes personal identifiers such as 
                    an individual's name, address, phone number, and social security 
                    number. A domain name or Internet Protocol address is not 
                    considered personal information. <br>
                    <br>
      We collect no personal information about you unless you voluntarily 
participate in an activity that asks for information (e.g., 
sending an e-mail or participating in a survey). If you choose 
not to participate in these activities, your choice will in 
no way affect your ability to use any other feature of the 
ISBE web site. If personal information is requested on the 
web site or volunteered by the user, state law and the federal 
Privacy Act of 1974 (5 U.S.C. 552a) may protect it. However, 
this information is a public record once you provide it, and 
may be subject to public inspection and copying if not otherwise 
protected by federal or state law. [e.g., Electronic Communications 
Privacy Act (ECPA) (18 U.S.C. 2510-2520, 2701-2709); Illinois 
Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) (5 ILCS 140/1 et seq.); 
Data Processing Confidentiality Act (30 ILCS 585/0.01 et seq.).]</p>
    <h4><b>What Information Is Automatically Collected?</b> </h4>
    <p>If, during your visit to the ISBE Web site, you just browse 
      or download information, the following information about your 
      visit will be automatically collected and stored in the Web 
      server's log:<br>
                                </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Your Internet Protocol address (not the e-mail address).</li>
      <li>The type of web browser used to access this site (Internet 
        Explorer, Netscape, etc.). (Web pages do not always display 
        the same on every type or version of web browser and thus 
        must be coded for appropriate access.)<br>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>Our Web site logs do not contain personally identifiable 
      information, and we make no attempt to link them with the 
      individuals who browse this Web site. <br>
    </p>
    <h4><b>What Information Is Collected Only with Your Permission?</b> </h4>
    <p>If you visit our Web site and participate in a survey, fill 
      out a Web-based form, or send an e-mail, the following additional 
      information will be collected: <br>
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li> Internet Correspondence: If an individual sends ISBE 
        an e-mail message or fills out a Web-based form with a question 
        or comment that contains personal identifying information, 
        that information will only be used to respond to the request 
        and to analyze trends. The message may be redirected to 
        another government agency or person who is better able to 
        answer the question. We may retain that email address and 
        other information as appropriate for official business purposes. </li>
      <li>Surveys: Any information you volunteered in response to 
        a survey. Survey information is used for the purpose designated. <br>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h4><b>How Do We Use the Information We Collect?</b> <br>
        </h4>
    <p>The information that we gather both automatically and with 
      your permission during your visit to our Web site is used 
      in the following ways: <br>
    </p>
    <ul class="blockindent">
      <li> Monitor, review, measure, and analyze Web site utilization</li>
      <li> Modify and enhance the Web site </li>
      <li> Improve the content and design of our Web site</li>
      <li> Determine the need for new programs and services</li>
      <li> Respond to your requests</li>
      <li> Monitor the changing information needs of site visitors </li>
      <li> Monitor and improve our customer service efforts</li>
      <li> Study general usage habits and demographic information 
        for our own research purposes </li>
      <li> Unique IP addresses are counted to determine the number 
        of visitors to each web page during specific time frames. 
        Analysis of the number of visitors helps to determine how, 
        where or if the page will be delivered in the future.</li>
      <li> Distribute news and other information requested by Web 
        visitors </li>
    </ul>
    <h4><b>Access and Correction of Personal Information</b> </h4>
    <p>Upon request, we provide site visitors with access to the 
      following: </p>
    <ul class="blocklist">
      <li> A description of information (e.g., name, address, phone 
        number) that we maintain about them </li>
      <li> Communications that the visitor has directed to our site<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Individuals can access, review, and request correction to 
      this information, as necessary, by contacting us at the address 
      at the end of this Privacy Policy. </p>
    <h4><b>Our Use of Cookies</b></h4>
    <p>A cookie is a small amount of data that is sent to your browser 
      from a web server and stored on your computer's hard drive. 
      For example, a Web site may use a cookie to store and sometimes 
      track information about your preferences or the pages you 
      last visited. Cookies can be used to provide useful online 
      features for their visitors, such as customized pages and 
    personalized services.</p>
    <p>The ISBE Web site uses two types of cookies: session cookies 
      and persistent cookies. Session cookies are small text files 
      placed on your hard drive by some websites and are intended 
      for use only in the browser session in which they are created. 
      Persistent cookies maintain information over more than one 
      browser session. ISBE uses them for online authentication 
      to the password-protected classes of the IVHS web site. After 
      a user enters a Login ID and password, the cookie activates 
      details about your computer system, line connection and browser 
      version so you will be directed to the server designed to 
    provide you with optimum performance.</p>
    <p>Your browser software can be set to reject all cookies, or 
      to ask you if you would like to accept or decline a cookie 
      from a particular site before it is set. </p>
    <h4><b>Registration for Access</b> </h4>
    <p>The ISBE Web site does requires registration to access certain 
      forms requiring digital signature via the ISBE Web Application 
      System (IWAS). At registration, you are asked to provide name, 
      login name, password, and an email address. Once registered, 
      you may enter the password protected website by keying in 
      your login name and password. If the login name and password 
    match, you are granted access to forms requiring digital signature. </p>
    <h4><b>Our Children's Privacy Policy</b> </h4>
    <p>ISBE and the State of Illinois are committed to protecting 
      children's privacy and complying fully with the Children's 
      Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998. (COPPA) (15 U.S.C. 
    6501 et seq.). </p>
    <p>The ISBE site features selected information and services that 
      would be of interest to children 13 and under. </p>
    <p>We recommend that parents and teachers supervise children's 
      Internet explorations. It is particularly important for parents 
      to guide their children when children are asked to provide 
      personal information online. </p>
    <p>If you are under the age of 13, you are not authorized to 
      provide us with personally identifying information, and we 
      will not use any such information in our database or other 
      data collection activities. </p>
    <p>Users are cautioned that the collection of personal information 
      volunteered by children on-line or by e-mail will be treated 
      the same as information given by an adult and may be subject 
      to public access.</p>
    <h4><b>Links to Other Sites</b> </h4>
    <p>The ISBE Web site often provides a number of links that offer 
      direct access to other useful or interesting educational web 
      sites holding potential value to site visitors. Inclusion 
      of the other sites by links does not imply any endorsement 
    by ISBE of the material or information on the other sites. </p>
    <p>We encourage users to review the privacy policy of each linked 
      site, as we are not responsible for the privacy practices 
      of other sites. Users assume sole responsibility for use of 
      third-party links and any disclaimers set forth herein are 
      applicable to such third-party sites. </p>
    <p>We will make efforts to notify you when you are leaving our 
      site and you may be subjected to different privacy policies 
      than those we have established for our Web site.</p>
    <h4><b>Security of Communications</b></h4>
    <p>ISBE recognizes that many people are concerned about the privacy 
      and protection of information as it is transmitted over the 
      Internet. You should keep in mind that the possibility exists 
      for unauthorized individuals to intercept any e-mail message 
      you send over the Internet. In some cases, information can 
      be encrypted (scrambled or encoded) to make it very difficult 
      to read if it is intercepted during communication. Certain 
      technology and practices allow Web sites to provide an increased 
      level of security for your personal and health-related information 
      when appropriate. We use the following practices on our Web 
      site to enhance the level of security for communication and 
      the transmission of personal information: <br>
  
    </p>
    <ul class="blocklist">
      <li> We use industry-standard encryption technologies when 
        transferring and receiving consumer data exchanged with 
        our site.</li>
      <li> We have taken reasonable steps to ensure the integrity 
        and confidentiality of personally identifiable information 
        that you may provide.</li>
      <li> When we transfer and receive certain types of sensitive 
        information, we redirect visitors to a secure server.</li>
      <li> We have appropriate security measures in place in our 
        physical facilities to protect against the loss, misuse, 
        or alteration of information that we have collected from 
        you at our site</li>
      <li> We use e-mail forms to allow our customers to ask questions 
        about our services and programs. However, these are not 
        hosted on a secure server. The possibility exists that unauthorized 
        individuals may intercept e-mail messages. </li>
      <li> We are not responsible for the privacy of e-mail messages 
        except those stored in our system. <br>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h4><b>Changes in Our Privacy Policy</b> </h4>
    <p>ISBE reserves the right, at its sole discretion, to modify 
      this policy at any time without notice. ISBE will regularly 
      review and revise this Privacy Policy. If our information 
      practices change we will post the policy changes to the Web 
      site. Changes shall be effective immediately. If you are concerned 
      about how your information is used, you should check this 
    Privacy Policy periodically. </p>
    <h4><b>Web Site Contact Information</b> </h4>
    <p>If you have questions about our privacy policy, or believe 
      that this site is not following its stated information policy, 
      please contact us. <br>
