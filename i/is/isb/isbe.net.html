                    <br>
                    "Personal information" is information about an individual 
                    that is readily identifiable to that specific individual. 
                    Personal information includes personal identifiers such as 
                    an individual's name, address, phone number, and social security 
                    number. A domain name or Internet Protocol address is not 
                    considered personal information. <br>
                    <br>
                    We collect no personal information about you unless you voluntarily 
                    participate in an activity that asks for information (e.g., 
                    sending an e-mail or participating in a survey). If you choose 
                    not to participate in these activities, your choice will in 
                    no way affect your ability to use any other feature of the 
                    ISBE web site. If personal information is requested on the 
                    web site or volunteered by the user, state law and the federal 
                    Privacy Act of 1974 (5 U.S.C. 552a) may protect it. However, 
                    this information is a public record once you provide it, and 
                    may be subject to public inspection and copying if not otherwise 
                    protected by federal or state law. [e.g., Electronic Communications 
                    Privacy Act (ECPA) (18 U.S.C. 2510-2520, 2701-2709); Illinois 
                    Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) (5 ILCS 140/1 et seq.); 
                    Data Processing Confidentiality Act (30 ILCS 585/0.01 et seq.).]<br>

                    If, during your visit to the ISBE Web site, you just browse 
                    or download information, the following information about your

                      or comment that contains personal identifying information, 
                      that information will only be used to respond to the request 
                      and to analyze trends. The message may be redirected to 
                      another government agency or person who is better able to 
                      answer the question. We may retain that email address and 
                      other information as appropriate for official business purposes.

                    Our Use of Cookies</b> <br>
                    <br>
                    A cookie is a small amount of data that is sent to your browser 
                    from a web server and stored on your computer's hard drive. 
                    For example, a Web site may use a cookie to store and sometimes 
                    track information about your preferences or the pages you 
                    last visited. Cookies can be used to provide useful online 
                    features for their visitors, such as customized pages and 
                    personalized services.<br>
                    <br>
                    The ISBE Web site uses two types of cookies: session cookies 
                    and persistent cookies. Session cookies are small text files 
                    placed on your hard drive by some websites and are intended 
                    for use only in the browser session in which they are created. 
                    Persistent cookies maintain information over more than one 
                    browser session. ISBE uses them for online authentication 
                    to the password-protected classes of the IVHS web site. After 
                    a user enters a Login ID and password, the cookie activates 
                    details about your computer system, line connection and browser 
                    version so you will be directed to the server designed to 
                    provide you with optimum performance.<br>
                    <br>
                    Your browser software can be set to reject all cookies, or 
                    to ask you if you would like to accept or decline a cookie 
                    from a particular site before it is set. <br>

                    <br>
                    The ISBE Web site does requires registration to access certain 
                    forms requiring digital signature via the ISBE Web Application 
                    System (IWAS). At registration, you are asked to provide name, 
                    login name, password, and an email address. Once registered, 
                    you may enter the password protected website by keying in 
                    your login name and password. If the login name and password 
                    match, you are granted access to forms requiring digital signature.

                    <b>Our Children's Privacy Policy</b> <br>
                    <br>
                    ISBE and the State of Illinois are committed to protecting 
                    children's privacy and complying fully with the Children's 
                    Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998. (COPPA) (15 U.S.C. 
                    6501 et seq.). <br>
                    <br>
                    The ISBE site features selected information and services that 
                    would be of interest to children 13 and under. <br>
                    <br>
                    We recommend that parents and teachers supervise children's 
                    Internet explorations. It is particularly important for parents 
                    to guide their children when children are asked to provide 
                    personal information online. <br>
                    <br>
                    If you are under the age of 13, you are not authorized to 
                    provide us with personally identifying information, and we 
                    will not use any such information in our database or other 
                    data collection activities. <br>
                    <br>
                    Users are cautioned that the collection of personal information 
                    volunteered by children on-line or by e-mail will be treated 
                    the same as information given by an adult and may be subject 
                    to public access.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Links to Other Sites</b> <br>
                    <br>
                    The ISBE Web site often provides a number of links that offer 
                    direct access to other useful or interesting web sites holding 
                    potential value to site visitors. Inclusion of the other sites 
                    by links does not imply any endorsement by ISBE of the material 
                    or information on the other sites. <br>
                    <br>
                    We encourage users to review the privacy policy of each linked 
                    site, as we are not responsible for the privacy practices 
                    of other sites. Users assume sole responsibility for use of 
                    third-party links and any disclaimers set forth herein are 
                    applicable to such third-party sites. <br>
                    <br>
                    We will make efforts to notify you when you are leaving our 
                    site and you may be subjected to different privacy policies 
                    than those we have established for our Web site.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Security of Communications</b> <br>
                    <br>
                    ISBE recognizes that many people are concerned about the privacy 
                    and protection of information as it is transmitted over the 
                    Internet. You should keep in mind that the possibility exists 
                    for unauthorized individuals to intercept any e-mail message 
                    you send over the Internet. In some cases, information can 
                    be encrypted (scrambled or encoded) to make it very difficult 
                    to read if it is intercepted during communication. Certain 
                    technology and practices allow Web sites to provide an increased 
                    level of security for your personal and health-related information 
                    when appropriate. We use the following practices on our Web 
                    site to enhance the level of security for communication and 
                    the transmission of personal information: <br>
                  </p>
                  <ul>
                    <li> We use industry-standard encryption technologies when 
                      transferring and receiving consumer data exchanged with 
                      our site.</li>
                    <li> We have taken reasonable steps to ensure the integrity 
                      and confidentiality of personally identifiable information 
                      that you may provide.</li>
                    <li> When we transfer and receive certain types of sensitive 
                      information, we redirect visitors to a secure server.</li>
                    <li> We have appropriate security measures in place in our 
                      physical facilities to protect against the loss, misuse, 
                      or alteration of information that we have collected from 
                      you at our site</li>
                    <li> We use e-mail forms to allow our customers to ask questions 
                      about our services and programs. However, these are not 
                      hosted on a secure server. The possibility exists that unauthorized 
                      individuals may intercept e-mail messages. </li>
                    <li> We are not responsible for the privacy of e-mail messages 
                      except those stored in our system. <br>
                    </li>
