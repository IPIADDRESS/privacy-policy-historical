Cookies are pieces of information that a website transfers to an individual's hard drive for record-keeping purposes. Cookies make web surfing easier for you by saving your preferences while you are at our sites thus allowing easier and faster access when you return to the site at another time.

        <p>An Internet Protocol (IP) address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer by your Internet Service Provider (ISP) whenever you access the internet. This number may be the same each time you access the internet or it may change. Like other internet sites, this website uses IP addresses to collect aggregate information about numbers of visitors and site usage. The address is logged on our server when your computer requests information from our website.

We exercise great care in providing secure transmission of your information from your computer to our servers. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your personal information, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us or from our online products and services, and you do so at your own risk.
