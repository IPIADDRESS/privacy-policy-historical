					<h2>What is personal information?</h2>
					<p><strong>Personal information</strong> is any information or an opinion, in any form and whether true or not, about an identified individual or an individual who is reasonably identifiable.  Examples include an individual's name, address, contact number and email address.</p>

					<a name="hold-personal-information"></a>
					<h2>How does iSelect collect and hold your personal information?</h2>
					<p>iSelect will only collect personal information about you by lawful and fair means. iSelect collects personal information in a variety of ways.  It is iSelectâs usual practice to collect personal information directly from you (or from your authorised representative), for example when:</p>
					<ul>

					<h2>What kinds of personal information does iSelect collect and hold?</h2>
					<p>The kinds of personal information that we collect and hold about you will depend on the circumstances of collection, including whether we collect the information from you as a customer, participating provider, contractor, stakeholder, job applicant or in some other capacity.</p>
					<p>For example, if you request a quote for a product or service offered by our participating providers, we may collect your name, address, email address, telephone number, date of birth and any other information required to provide you with the quote If you deal with us in some other capacity (for example, as a participating provider, a supplier or a stakeholder), we may collect your name, contact details and any other information you choose to provide to us.</p>

					<p>If you provide your personal information to a third party via iSelect (for example, to purchase products or services on third party website which is linked to iSelect) that information is collected and managed by those third parties. You should familiarise yourself with their privacy policy prior to deciding whether you wish to provide them with your information.</p>  
					<p>We may monitor and record calls that you make to us in certain circumstances.  For example, calls to our contact center are monitored and recorded for training and customer service purposes and to meet our regulatory obligations.</p>
					<p>Some of the products offered by our participating providers can cover more than one person (for example, family and couples health insurance policies that cover two or more persons). If you provide us with information about your partner or a dependant on the policy, you must obtain that personâs permission to give us the information and inform them of this policy.</p>
					<p>If we are not able to collect your personal information, we may not be able to provide you with our products or services or do business with you or the organisation with which you are connected.</p>

You can opt-out of receiving direct marketing at any time (see below).</p>
					<p>If you want to know how we obtained your personal information, please contact our Privacy Officer using the details provided <a href="#how-to-contact" title="How to contact us">below</a> and we will let you know unless it is impracticable or unreasonable to do so.</p>

					<h2>Does iSelect disclose your personal information to overseas recipients?</h2>
					<p>Some of our service providers are located overseas.  As a result, iSelect may disclose your personal information to overseas recipients, including recipients located in the United States, Singapore and Hong Kong. For example, sometimes we use third party platforms to deliver or store information. These are sites hosted and managed by organisations other than ourselves, and some of these sites are located overseas.</p> 
					<p>The email platform used by iSelect is maintained overseas by Exact Target Inc which has its principle place of business in the United States of America. Exact target's privacy policy is available at <a href="http://www.exacttarget.com" title="www.exacttarget.com" target="_blank">www.exacttarget.com</a>.

					<p>We rely on the personal information we hold in conducting our business.  Therefore, it is very important that the information we hold is accurate, complete and up-to-date.

					<h2>Website usage</h2>
					<p>Our website is professionally hosted and operates in a secure environment. You should however be aware that there is always an inherent risk in transmitting your personal information via the Internet.</p> 
					<p>Cookies are pieces of information that a website transfers to your computer for record-keeping purposes. The information collected may be used by iSelect to improve and customize your experience on our website. In addition, we collect aggregated non-personally identifiable data from our website to help us maintain and improve delivery of the iSelect online service and marketing. This aggregated information assists iSelect to improve content and website navigation.</p> 
					<p>When you visit any of our online resources, our system may collect information about your visit for statistical purposes, including:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>server address;</li>
						<li>top level domain name (for example .com, .gov, .au, .uk etc.);</li>
						<li>the date and time of your visit to the site;</li>

						<li>the previous site you visited;</li>
						<li>if you've visited our site before; and</li>
						<li>the type of browser used.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>We record this data to maintain our server and improve our services. There are several methods and packages that we use to collect visitor behaviours on each of our online platforms.

					<h2>How you can access or correct your personal information</h2> 
					<p>You can request access to the personal information we hold about you by contacting our Privacy Officer using the details provided <a href="#how-to-contact" title="How to contact us">below</a> and we will generally provide you with access, subject to some exceptions permitted by law</p>
					<p>Access to personal information may be refused in a number of circumstances, such as where:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>providing access would have an unreasonable impact on the privacy of others;</li> 
						<li>the request is frivolous or vexatious;</li>
						<li>the information relates to existing or anticipated legal proceedings and would not normally be accessible as part of those proceedings;</li>
						<li>providing access would be unlawful;</li>
						<li>denying access is required by law;</li>
						<li>providing access would be likely to prejudice enforcement related activities conducted by an enforcement body;</li>
						<li>giving access would reveal evaluative information in connection with a commercially sensitive decision-making process; or</li>
						<li>access would pose a threat to the life, health or safety of any individual or to public health or safety.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>If we deny or restrict access to the information you have requested, we will give you written reasons for this decision when we respond to your request. We may charge a fee to cover our costs of providing access to you and will advise you of any fee payable before we provide you with access.</p>
