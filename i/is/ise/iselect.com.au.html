<h2>How does iSelect collect and hold your personal information?</h2>
<p>iSelect will only collect personal information about you by lawful and fair means. iSelect collects personal information in a variety of ways. It is iSelect's usual practice to collect personal information directly from you (or from your authorised representative), for example when:</p>

<li>you apply for or purchase a product offered by an iSelect business and or our participating providers;</li>

<h2>What kinds of personal information does iSelect collect and hold?</h2>
<p>The kinds of personal information that we collect and hold about you will depend on the circumstances of collection, including whether we collect the information from you as a customer, participating provider, contractor, stakeholder, job applicant or in some other capacity.</p>

You should familiarise yourself with their privacy policy prior to deciding whether you wish to provide them with your information.</p>

<p>Some of the products offered by our participating providers can cover more than one person (for example, family and couples health insurance policies that cover two or more persons). If you provide us with information about your partner or a dependant on the policy, you must obtain that person's permission to give us the information and inform them of this policy.</p>
