                        <h3>General.</h3>
                        <p>This privacy policy (this "Privacy
                        Policy") is designed to inform you about the type
                        of information that GENWI, Inc ("we,"
                        "us," or "our") may gather or

                        site (this "Site").  It also explains the

                        information, and your rights in relation to that
                        information.</p>

                        <p>The procedures for modifying or changing this
                        Privacy Policy in the future are discussed in Section 6
                        of this document.</p>

                        years of age.  We do not knowingly collect personal

                        Information and Personally-Identifying Information from

                        Information" is information that, without the aid
                        of additional information, cannot be directly
                        associated with a specific person or entity.
                        "Personally-Identifying Information," by
                        contrast, is information such as a name or email
                        address that, without more, can be directly associated
                        with a specific person or entity.</p>

                                        object that is embedded in a web page.
                                        It is usually invisible to you but
                                        allows site operators to check whether
                                        you have viewed a particular web page
                                        or email communication.  We may place
                                        Web Beacons on pages of this Site and

                                        <p>You may not decline Web Beacons.
                                        However, they may be rendered

                                        <p>We may make an email service
                                        available to you whereby you may tell a
                                        friend about this Site or any of the
                                        features, materials or postings on the
                                        Site, in which case we will ask you for
                                        your name and email address, and your
                                        friend's name and email address.  We
                                        will automatically send your friend a
                                        one-time email from your email address
                                        with a link to the Site. If your friend
                                        replies to this email, the response
                                        will be sent to your email address.  We
                                        store your friend's name and email
                                        address only for the purposes of
                                        sending this one-time email. </p>

                        <p>Third parties are under no obligation to comply with
                        this Privacy Policy with respect to
                        Personally-Identifying Information that you provide
                        directly to those third parties or that those third
                        parties collect for themselves.  We do not control the
                        third-party sites that may be accessible through this
                        Site.  Thus, this Privacy Policy does not apply to
                        information provided to third-party sites or gathered
                        by the third parties that operate them.  Before
                        visiting a third-party site, whether by means of a link
                        on this Site or otherwise, and before providing any
                        Personally-Identifying Information to any third party,
                        you should inform yourself of the privacy policies and
                        practices (if any) of the third party responsible for
                        that site, and should take those steps necessary to
                        your discretion, to protect your privacy.</p>

                        <h3>Privacy Policy Changes.</h3>
                        <p>Because of changes in technology and the growth and
                        development of our business, or for other business
                        reasons, we may need to modify this Privacy Policy from
                        time to time.  We will alert you by email if this
                        policy is revised (if you have given us your email
                        address), and we will post a copy of the new policy
                        with its effective date on this Site.  It is therefore
                        important that you register with the site and notify us
                        if you change your email address.  If you do not
                        provide us with a current email address, you should
                        regularly review this policy to ensure that you are
                        informed of any changes.</p>
