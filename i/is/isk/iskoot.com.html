The <span class="caps">EEA </span>and Switzerland also have recognized the Safe Harbor as providing adequate data protection.

The web notification service allows you to receive incoming online messages from your personal accounts in web content services, such as web-mail services, <span class="caps">RSS </span>feeds and messaging services, to your cellular phone.

The Service will retrieve and aggregate Online Content from your preferred services and deliver highlights of the Online Content to your cellular phone.

When you use the Services, we may automatically collect further information and store it in web-server log files. For example, we may record the frequency and scope of your use of the Website, the duration of your sessions, the web pages that you visit, advertisements that you view or click on, and the geographic location of the computer system that you are using to sign-in or use the Services.<br>
<br>

<p>We may use anonymous, statistical or aggregated information, including by posting, disseminating, transmitting or otherwise communicating or making available such information through the Services, and by providing the information to users, suppliers, business partners, affiliates and any other third party, at our sole discretion, provided however, that the information will not identify you personally and that we will not knowingly, or intentionally use such information to reveal your identity without your consent, under the terms of this policy.</p>

<h4>Accessing your personal account</h4>
At any time, you may contact us at: <a href="mailto:support@iskoot.com">support@iskoot.com</a> and request to edit, correct, or amend your personal information. Please keep in mind that providing false, incorrect, incomplete, or out dated information may prevent you from registering with or using the Services, and/or may impair our ability to provide you with the Services.<br>
<br>

<h4>Data retention</h4>
We retain your personal information as necessary to provide our Services as well as support our internal needs. However, by doing so we do not either expressly or impliedly endorse, affirm or in any manner assume any responsibility for such information. If you would like us to delete your personal information from your account, see the section “Deletion of information” below.<br>
<br>

<h4>Deletion of information</h4>
If you wish to delete your personally identifiable information that is stored in our databases, please use the ‘Contact us’ page on the Website. We will remove the personal information we have about you from our publicly viewable database within a reasonable time but we may retain personal information about you in our non-public databases for a reasonable period of time to support our operational requirements (for example only, reconciling your transactions). Notwithstanding the foregoing, there may be circumstances where we are legally required to retain the information we collect about you (for example, in connection with court proceedings) and despite your request for us to delete your personal information, we will retain what we are legally required to keep. Moreover, we reserve the right to make anonymous the personal information so that it is no longer associated with you rather than deleting it. We also reserve the right to use previously obtained personal information to verify your identity or take other actions that we believe are appropriate. If you close your account, we have no obligation to retain your personal information, and may delete any or all of your personal information without liability.<br>
<br>

<h4>Information security</h4>
We implement information security systems and procedures to secure the information stored on our servers. Such systems and procedures reduce the risk of security breaches, but they do not provide absolute security. Therefore, we cannot guarantee that our services are immune to unauthorized access to the information stored therein and to other information-security risks.<br>
<br>

<p>We do not warrant that your personal information will be stored for the required durations, or that your personal information will not be retrieved after being deleted.</p>

Our Services are intended for general audiences and are not directed to children under 14. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 14. If you become aware that your child has provided us with personal information without your consent, please contact us as set forth in the section “Contact Us” below. If we become aware that a child under 14 has provided us with personal information without parental consent, we will take steps to remove such information and terminate the child’s account.<br>
<br>

We participate in the EU and Swiss Safe Harbor Privacy Framework as set forth by the United States Department of Commerce. As part of our participation in the safe harbor, we have agreed to <span class="caps">TRUST</span>e dispute resolution for disputes relating to our compliance with the Safe Harbor Privacy Framework. If you have any complaints regarding our compliance with the Safe Harbor you should first contact us (as provided above). If contacting us does not resolve your complaint, you may raise your complaint with <span class="caps">TRUST</span>e by Internet here, fax to 415-520-3420, or mail to <span class="caps">TRUST</span>e Safe Harbor Compliance Dept., click for mailing address.

<h4>Changes to this Privacy Policy</h4>
We may change and update the terms of this policy from time to time. We therefore recommend that you read it periodically. All substantial changes that we make to this policy will be posted on the Website and take effect 7 days after their initial posting, unless we amend the policy to comply with legal requirements. In the latter cases the amendments will become effective immediately upon their initial posting, or as required.<br>
