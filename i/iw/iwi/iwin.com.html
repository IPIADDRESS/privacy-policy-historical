<h3><font color="black" face="Arial">Privacy Policy</font></h3>
<p class="privacy_paragraph">Your privacy on the
Internet is important to iWin. As part of the operation of iWin.com,
certain information is gathered about those who visit iWin.com's Web site
and/or who register on iWin.com's Web site ("Players"). Below are
explanations regarding the type of information collected, what is done with it,
and how to correct or change the information. </p>

<p class="privacy_paragraph">BY REGISTERING
THROUGH iWin.COM OR ANY OF ITS PARTNERS, YOU AGREE TO THE TERMS OF THIS
PRIVACY POLICY. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH THE PRACTICES DESCRIBED IN THIS
PRIVACY POLICY, YOU MUST NOT REGISTER, OR, IF YOU ARE ALREADY REGISTERED, YOU
MUST END YOUR MEMBERSHIP.</p>

<p class="privacy_paragraph"><b>What Information
is Collected</b></p>

<p class="privacy_paragraph"><b>Required
Information:</b>
As part of the iWin.com registration process, our Players are asked to
provide a name, e-mail address, postal address, telephone number, birth date,
user name, password, and gender. We use this information to send Players their
winnings, confirm their credit card information and determine if the
jurisdiction that you are a resident of allows you to play these games for real
money. <br>
<br>
<b>Use of Information</b></p>

<p class="privacy_paragraph">iWin.com uses
information to deliver the iWin.com services. Thus, Player Information is
used by iWin.com in identifying information that may be of interest to its
Players. A Player's e-mail address will be used by iWin.com to contact that
Player about Player-selected interests. iWin.com does not use Player
information for purposes unrelated to the services offered by iWin.com. </p>

<p class="privacy_paragraph">The "Refer A
Friend" option authorizes us to send an email to your friends. Your
friends will not receive any other e-mail from iWin.com not relating to
that promotion. Additionally broadcast e-mails are occasionally sent to our
Players to keep our Players aware of our promotions, prizes, and sponsor
offers. In addition, iWin.com also
reserves the right to use the information collected to occasionally notify you
about important functionality changes to the Web site, new services, and special
offers you'll find valuable. </p>

<p class="privacy_paragraph">Players may, at any
time, choose not to receive promotional emails from iWin.com by following
the "unsubscribe" instructions in the iWin.com e-mail.</p>

<p class="privacy_paragraph">By registering for
an account, you agree that iWin.com may display your player name and
tournament records. </p>

<p class="privacy_paragraph"><b>Confidentiality</b>
</p>

<p class="privacy_paragraph">iWin.com will
not provide personally identifiable information of a iWin.com Player to
third parties.Personally identifiable
information means the Player's name, residence address, e-mail address,
telephone number or other information from which the Player's identity may be
reasonably ascertained. </p>

<p class="privacy_paragraph">All iWin.com
employees are required to comply with the terms of this Privacy Policy. This
Privacy Policy provides that employees are obligated to keep Player information
confidential. This obligation continues once an employee has left our Company.
 </p>

<p class="privacy_paragraph"> </p>


<p class="privacy_paragraph"><b>Using Your
Social Security Number</b></p>

<p class="privacy_paragraph">If your total
winnings on the Site in any given calendar year are greater than $600,
iWin.com will request that you submit your social security number in order
to send you a Form 1099, as required by Internal Revenue Service regulations.
Failure to provide your social security number at that time will result in the
Site's inability to credit your account for any winnings in excess of $600.
</p>


<p class="privacy_paragraph"><b>The Use of
Cookies and Clear GIFs</b>
</p>

<p class="privacy_paragraph">As an important and
necessary part of providing customizable and personalized services to our
Players, iWin.com uses cookies to store and sometimes track information
about Players. A cookie is a small amount of data that is sent to a Player's
browser from a Web server and stored on a Player's computer hard drive. Areas
of iWin.com's Web Site where Players are prompted to login or that are
customizable require acceptance of cookies. Cookies are also used to help iWin.com
track the response to messages sent to Players on behalf of marketers so that
iWin.com can monitor and report campaign results to the marketer and track
response history. In addition, banner advertisements are displayed on our Web
Site which may contain cookies. While iWin.com uses cookies in other parts
of our Web Site, the cookies received with banner ads are collected by our
advertising partners, and iWin.com does not have access to this
information. With respect to cookies, you have a choice. By modifying your
browser preferences, you have the choice to accept all cookies, to be notified
when a cookie is set, or to reject all cookies. If you choose to reject all
cookies, you will be unable to use those iWin.com services that require the
use of cookies in order to participate. </p>

<p class="privacy_paragraph">iWin.com also
uses a common technology known as a clear gif or action tags on the Web Site
and in e-mail communications with Players. A clear gif (standing for
"graphic interface format") is a small graphic image that is 1x1
pixel that iWin.com or one of its Partners places on a page of the Web
Site. iWin.com may also occasionally place clear gifs in e-mail messages
that it sends to Players. Clear gifs provide iWin.com with important
information about how Players use the Web Site and respond to e-mail messages.
This helps iWin.com to better track certain promotions and understand the
effectiveness of its outreach to Players. iWin.com may also allow its
advertisers and Partners the ability to use clear gifs on the Web Site solely
to track Players who link from their respective sites to this Site, though this
ability to track such activity does not allow these entities access any
Player's personal information to which they are not otherwise entitled.</p>

<p class="privacy_paragraph"><b>Changing User
Information</b></p>

<p class="privacy_paragraph">To change, update,
or delete any information in your Member Account click ?Preferences? and then
?User Profile?.
</p>

<p class="privacy_paragraph"><b>Children's
Online Privacy Protection</b></p>

<p class="privacy_paragraph">The safety of
children is important to us. iWin.com's Web Site is a general audience site
that is not directed to children under the age of 18. Similarly, iWin.com's
services are not directed to or intended for anyone under the age of 18.
iWin.com will not knowingly accept Players who are under the age of 18 years
nor will it knowingly collect or maintain personally identifiable information
from or about anyone under the age of 18 years iWin.com relies on the
truthfulness of the registration when accepting new Players. In the event that
iWin.com receives information that establishes that a Player is under the
age of 18 years, iWin.com reserves the right, but not the obligation, to
terminate that Player's membership or take other steps that it determines are
appropriate in the circumstances, such as providing parental notification.
iWin.com may also delete all information in our databases about that
terminated Player. </p>

<p class="privacy_paragraph"><b>Sale or
Acquisition of iWin.com</b>
</p>

<p class="privacy_paragraph">Notwithstanding
anything in this Privacy Policy to contrary, we may, and you authorize us to,
disclose your personally identifiable to an entity which purchases or acquires
all or substantially all of iWin.com's assets or all or substantially all
of iWin.com's Web Site operations.</p>

<p class="privacy_paragraph"><b>Protection of
Player Information and Credit Card Processing</b> </p>

<p class="privacy_paragraph">iWin.com
undertakes substantial efforts to protect the confidentiality of the identity,
preferences and other information it has collected about individual Players and
will not knowingly allow access to this information to anyone outside
iWin.com other than to the Player or as described in this Privacy Policy.
iWin.com has made a substantial investment in its server, database, backup
and firewall technologies to protect the information assets of the iWin.com
Web Site, including the confidentiality of information collected about
iWin.com Players. These technologies are deployed as part of a
sophisticated security architecture and protocol. </p>

<p class="privacy_paragraph">You should also do
your part in protecting your information. Your iWin.com Player name and
password are confidential and we recommend that you not divulge them to anyone.
Unfortunately, neither iWin.com's Web Site nor data transmission over the
Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to
protect Player information, iWin.com cannot ensure or warrant the security
of Player information. Thus, any information a Player transmits to us is done
so at the Player's own risk. Once we receive Player information, iWin.com
undertakes substantial efforts to protect the confidentiality of this
information consistent with this Privacy Policy. Your information may be
stored, processed and transferred to or from the United States or any other
country where iWin.com, its Partners, affiliates or agents are located.</p>

<p class="privacy_paragraph">When you are
entering your credit card information and this information is being processed
iWin.com uses a secure server, and the secure server software (SSL)
encrypts the information you input. </p>

<p class="privacy_paragraph"><b>Policy Changes</b>
</p>

<p class="privacy_paragraph">The foregoing
policy is effective as of November 2001. iWin.com reserves the right to
change this policy at any time. Please check this page periodically for
changes. Your continued use of iWin.com's services following the posting of
changes to these terms will mean you accept those changes. In the event that
iWin.com intends to change this policy, iWin.com will post a message on
the home page of its Web Site that states that the Privacy Policy has been
changed, and will provide a link to the Privacy Policy. These postings will
occur on iWin.com's Web Site for at least 30 days prior to any material
change. For more information, see our Official Rules. </p>

<p class="privacy_paragraph">If you have any
questions about this Privacy Policy, iWin.com practices, or feel that your
privacy has been compromised, please <a href="mailto:support@iwin.com">e-mail</a> us.</p>
