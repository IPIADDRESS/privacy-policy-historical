Survey information will be used for the purposes of monitoring or improving the functionality of this website.</p><p><strong>Correcting/updating personal data</strong><br>If a user's personal data changes (such as their postcode), or if a user no longer desires IOP's service, IOP will correct, update or remove that user's personal data provided to it. &nbsp;This can usually be done by the user within any personalisation options of this website or by sending an email to <a href="mailto:custserv@iop.org">custserv@iop.org</a>.</p><p><strong>Notification of changes</strong><br>If IOP decides to change its Privacy Policy, it will make the updated version available via this website so its users are always aware of what information it collects, how it uses it and under what circumstances, if any, it discloses it. &nbsp;If, at any point, it decides to use personal data in a manner different from that stated at the time it was collected, it will notify users. &nbsp;Users will have a choice as to whether or not IOP uses their information in this different manner. &nbsp;IOP will use information in accordance with the Privacy Policy under which the information was collected.</p><p><strong>Your privacy is important to us</strong><br>IOP strives to do everything it can to protect the privacy of its users. &nbsp;IOP will not sell or rent personally identifiable information obtained via this website to any third parties.</p><p>If a user would like to ensure that they are not contacted by IOP with any promotional marketing information as a result of having accessed this website, please contact IOP at <a href="mailto:data.protection@iop.org">data.protection@iop.org</a>, stating the name of this website in the subject line of the e-mail. &nbsp;Please note that, if a user is a subscriber to an IOP product or service, and/or a member of IOP, sending such an e-mail will not affect any existing contract and IOP shall continue to send the information covered by such a contract until the contractual relationship between IOP and the user comes to an end.</p>									</div>						<!-- START middleslot -->
