			<h1>Privacy Policy Statement</h1>
			<hr>
			<p><em>Last Updated: 5 February 2013</em></p>
			
			<p>inMusic Brands, Inc. (“inMusic”) has created this Privacy Policy Statement in order to inform you of our commitment to privacy and to describe our policies for the collection, use, and disclosure of personal information that may be collected by InMusic when you use our products or visit our websites. </p>
			
			<p>PLEASE REVIEW THIS PRIVACY POLICY BEFORE USING THIS OR ANY OTHER ION AUDIO PRODUCT. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH OUR PRIVACY POLICY, DO NOT USE OUR PRODUCTS. WHERE APPLICABLE, BY SUBMITTING ANY PERSONAL INFORMATION TO US, YOU AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS PRIVACY POLICY STATEMENT.</p>
			
			<h2>GENERAL INFORMATION</h2>
			
			<p>Generally speaking, you may use our products while remaining anonymous and not revealing any personal information. From time to time, a hardware product of ours may communicate with one or more software applications on your computer or mobile device for the purpose of providing its stated functionality to you; e.g. an image scanner sends scanned photographs to your photo library, or a record player digitizes the audio on an LP and sends it to an application on your computer or mobile device for editing and archiving. However, at no time do our products transmit any personally identifying information to the computer or mobile device.</p>
			
			<h2>Submission and Use of Personal Information</h2>
			
			<p>In order to register your product and be eligible for warranty service and support, we may require that you submit some personal information to us for the purposes of identifying you and details about your product if you contact our service and support department.</p>

			<p>In addition to the usage of your submitted personal information for providing service and support, inMusic uses information it collects to provide the services and information you select, to better understand its customers, to provide better products and services, and (in the case of submission online) to assist with site administration, such as with troubleshooting any problems, detecting fraud, resolving disputes, and for any purposes deemed necessary or required by inMusic to enforce the Terms of Use and other terms or conditions applicable to any portion of our websites.</p>

			<p>We may also use this information to send you information about inMusic, our products and brands, services, or other topics inMusic thinks may be of interest to you, such as brand, product and service information or updates.</p>

			<p>We do not share any personal information collected from our customers with any non-affiliated third parties (except as outlined in the “Law Enforcement” section below), nor do we sell any personal information collected from our customers for any purpose whatsoever.</p>
			
			<h2>Law Enforcement</h2>
			
			<p>As noted in the Terms of Use, inMusic intends to cooperate with any order or request from law enforcement officials or a court of competent jurisdiction for information as to the identity of individuals submitting or posting information to inMusic or on our websites. Such orders or requests supersede the terms of this Privacy Policy. Similarly, notifications of claimed copyright infringement, counter notifications or other information submitted to and necessary to process a notification under our Copyright Complaint Policy are also exempt from this Privacy Policy.</p>
			
			<h2>inMusic Links to Other Sites and Advertising</h2>
			
			<p>Our websites may display advertisements and/or links to third parties. inMusic is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of those websites. Please refer to the privacy policies of the respective third parties for further information.</p>
			
			<h2>Surveys</h2>
			
			<p>From time to time, inMusic may make online surveys available to users of our websites. Participation in those surveys is voluntary. Some online surveys may ask participants for personal information, such as an email address, in addition to requesting answers to survey questions. inMusic may use that personal information to contact the participant if necessary, or as otherwise described above. inMusic may make the results of any survey publicly available, although inMusic will not attribute any particular response to you without your permission.</p>
			
			<h2>Contests</h2>
			
			<p>On occasion inMusic may make available contests, sweepstakes, or similar events to visitors to our websites in which they may qualify for participation. Participation is always voluntary and subject to the applicable rules. The rules may ask participants to provide personal information as a condition of participation. inMusic may also make the winner's names public, as provided in the applicable rules, or as required by law. inMusic may also use that information as described above. In some instances, the applicable rules may contain additional or different uses for the information you provide; please be sure to review those rules carefully before entering.</p>

			<p>inMusic may permit a third party to sponsor a survey, contest, sweepstakes, or other similar event ("third party event") with inMusic, such as through posting it on our websites. Such third party events are governed solely by any applicable rules, and may require you to provide information to that third party as a condition for participation. While inMusic will treat any information it receives in accordance with this Privacy Policy, inMusic is not responsible for the information gathered by that third party, and inMusic reminds you to review the rules and privacy policies separately applicable to those third party events.</p>

We encourage parents and guardians to spend time online with their children and to participate in the interactive activities offered on the sites their children visit. No information should be submitted to, or posted at, inMusic websites by visitors under 18 years of age without the consent of their parent or guardian.</p>
