			<p>Generally speaking, you may visit our sites while remaining anonymous and not revealing any personal information.</p>
			
			<p>Our websites automatically log your IP address and domain name, and non-personal information such as the type of web browser you use, to help us administer the sites and to compile statistics such as the number of visitors.</p>
			
			<p>Our websites use cookies to identify you over multiple visits to the site, for example to remember your country and provide country-specific content. Cookies are optional, and you can block or delete them. However, some parts of our websites will not work without cookies.</p>
			
			<p>It is not possible for a cookie stored by us to be read by any other company's website, nor can a cookie read information from your computer that you have not already provided to us.</p>

			<h4>Use of Personal Information</h4>
			
			<p>InMusic uses information it collects to provide the services and information you select, to better understand its customers, to provide better products and services, and to assist with site administration, such as with troubleshooting any problems, detecting fraud, resolving disputes, and for any purposes deemed necessary or required by InMusic to enforce the Terms of Use and other terms or conditions applicable to any portion of our sites.</p>
			
			<p>We may also use this information to send you information about InMusic, our products and brands, services, or other topics InMusic thinks may be of interest to you, such as brand, product and service information or updates.

			<h4>Aggregation and Use of Anonymous Data</h4>
			
			<p>InMusic aggregates information provided by you to create anonymous statistical and demographic data. This anonymous data helps InMusic to understand and know its customer base better. That anonymous data may be provided to third parties but never in such a fashion as to identify you personally.</p>
			
			<h3>Third Parties</h3>

			<hr>
			
			<p>InMusic does not sell to third parties information you have submitted to our sites that identifies you personally.</p>
			
			<p>On occasion, InMusic may offer in conjunction with third parties certain products or services that may require you to share your personal information with that third party as a condition for receiving that service.

			<h4>Public Forums for User Materials</h4>
			
			<p>Certain portions of our sites are designed to offer you the opportunity to post information on our sites, including but not limited to information about yourself ("User Materials"). You should always remember that publicly displayed information is public. For example, you may be permitted to post your resume information, a video you have created, or to post messages in any chat rooms, message boards, mailing lists, and/or news groups our sites make available to its users.

InMusic is not responsible for the personally identifiable information you choose to submit in these forums.</p>

			<h3>Law Enforcement</h3>

			<hr>
			
			<p>As noted in the Terms of Use InMusic intends to cooperate with any order or request from law enforcement officials or a court of competent jurisdiction for information as to the identity of individuals submitting or posting information to InMusic or on this site. Such orders or requests supersede the terms of this Privacy Policy. Similarly, notifications of claimed copyright infringement, counter notifications or other information submitted to and necessary to process a notification under our Copyright Complaint Policy are also exempt from this Privacy Policy.</p>
			
			<h3>InMusic Links to Other Sites and Advertising</h3>
			
			<p>Our sites may display advertisements and/or links to third parties. InMusic is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of those websites. Please refer to that company's privacy policy for further information.</p>
			
			<h3>Surveys</h3>

			<hr>
			
			<p>From time to time, InMusic may make online surveys available to users of our sites. Participation in those surveys is voluntary.

			<p>InMusic may permit a third party to sponsor a survey, contest, sweepstakes, or other similar event ("third party event") with InMusic, such as through posting it on our sites. Such third party events are governed solely by any applicable rules, and may require you to provide information to that third party as a condition for participation.

			<h3>Children</h3>

			<hr>

			<h3>Security</h3>

			<hr>
			
			<h4>General Issues</h4>
			
			<p>Generally speaking, our sites have security measures in place to protect against the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control. Since our sites under general usage do not collect financial information, InMusic uses the standard internet connections for those general usage portions of the site, without secured sockets.</p>
			
			<h4>Specific Services</h4>
			
			<p>inMusic websites may provide certain additional, optional services that may use additional security measures to protect the information, such as financial information, provided by you to obtain the service. Those additional security measures may vary, depending upon the particular service offered. You will be informed of any specific security measures at the time you register for a particular service. Please review that information where applicable for further detail.</p>
			
			<h3>Site Registration</h3>

			<hr>
			
			<p>In some cases, you may be prompted to register with our sites to undertake a particular site activity or obtain a particular service. As part of that registration, you may be asked to choose your own password. InMusic reminds you to protect your password, and not provide it to others to use. Allowing others to access and use your account and password can compromise the security of your information. InMusic disclaims any responsibility or obligation for your decision to provide your password to others.</p>
			
			<h3>Changes To This Policy</h3>

			<hr>
			
			<p>If and when InMusic makes changes to this site, InMusic may have to update this Privacy Policy Statement to better reflect those changes. Because changes to our sites or updates to this Privacy Policy Statement may occur, you should review this Privacy Policy Statement from time to time.

			<h3>Notice To European Users</h3>

			<hr>
