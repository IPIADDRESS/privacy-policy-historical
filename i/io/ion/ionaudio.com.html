			<h4>Use of Personal Information</h4>
			
			<p>InMusic uses information it collects to provide the services and information you select, to better understand its customers, to provide better products and services, and to assist with site administration, such as with troubleshooting any problems, detecting fraud, resolving disputes, and for any purposes deemed necessary or required by InMusic to enforce the Terms of Use and other terms or conditions applicable to any portion of our sites.</p>

			<p>InMusic aggregates information provided by you to create anonymous statistical and demographic data. This anonymous data helps InMusic to understand and know its customer base better.

			<h3>Third Parties</h3>

			<hr>
			
			<p>InMusic does not sell to third parties information you have submitted to our sites that identifies you personally.</p>
			
			<p>On occasion, InMusic may offer in conjunction with third parties certain products or services that may require you to share your personal information with that third party as a condition for receiving that service.

			<h4>Public Forums for User Materials</h4>
			
			<p>Certain portions of our sites are designed to offer you the opportunity to post information on our sites, including but not limited to information about yourself ("User Materials").

InMusic is not responsible for the personally identifiable information you choose to submit in these forums.</p>

			<h3>Law Enforcement</h3>

			<hr>
			
			<p>As noted in the Terms of Use InMusic intends to cooperate with any order or request from law enforcement officials or a court of competent jurisdiction for information as to the identity of individuals submitting or posting information to InMusic or on this site. Such orders or requests supersede the terms of this Privacy Policy. Similarly, notifications of claimed copyright infringement, counter notifications or other information submitted to and necessary to process a notification under our Copyright Complaint Policy are also exempt from this Privacy Policy.</p>
			
			<h3>InMusic Links to Other Sites and Advertising</h3>
			
			<p>Our sites may display advertisements and/or links to third parties. InMusic is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of those websites. Please refer to that company's privacy policy for further information.</p>
			
			<h3>Surveys</h3>

			<hr>
			
			<p>From time to time, InMusic may make online surveys available to users of our sites. Participation in those surveys is voluntary.

			<h3>Security</h3>

			<hr>
			
			<h4>General Issues</h4>
			
			<p>Generally speaking, our sites have security measures in place to protect against the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control. Since our sites under general usage do not collect financial information, InMusic uses the standard internet connections for those general usage portions of the site, without secured sockets.</p>
			
			<h4>Specific Services</h4>
			
			<p>inMusic websites may provide certain additional, optional services that may use additional security measures to protect the information, such as financial information, provided by you to obtain the service.

Please review that information where applicable for further detail.</p>
			
			<h3>Site Registration</h3>

			<hr>
			
			<p>In some cases, you may be prompted to register with our sites to undertake a particular site activity or obtain a particular service. As part of that registration, you may be asked to choose your own password. InMusic reminds you to protect your password, and not provide it to others to use. Allowing others to access and use your account and password can compromise the security of your information. InMusic disclaims any responsibility or obligation for your decision to provide your password to others.</p>
			
			<h3>Changes To This Policy</h3>

			<hr>
