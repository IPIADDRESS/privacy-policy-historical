			<h3>Law Enforcement</h3>

			<hr>
			
			<p>As noted in the Terms of Use InMusic intends to cooperate with any order or request from law enforcement officials or a court of competent jurisdiction for information as to the identity of individuals submitting or posting information to InMusic or on this site.

			<h3>Security</h3>

			<hr>
			
			<h4>General Issues</h4>
			
			<p>Generally speaking, our sites have security measures in place to protect against the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control. Since our sites under general usage do not collect financial information, InMusic uses the standard internet connections for those general usage portions of the site, without secured sockets.</p>
			
			<h4>Specific Services</h4>
			
			<p>inMusic websites may provide certain additional, optional services that may use additional security measures to protect the information, such as financial information, provided by you to obtain the service.

Please review that information where applicable for further detail.</p>

			<hr>
			
			<p>In some cases, you may be prompted to register with our sites to undertake a particular site activity or obtain a particular service. As part of that registration, you may be asked to choose your own password. InMusic reminds you to protect your password, and not provide it to others to use. Allowing others to access and use your account and password can compromise the security of your information. InMusic disclaims any responsibility or obligation for your decision to provide your password to others.</p>
			
			<h3>Changes To This Policy</h3>
