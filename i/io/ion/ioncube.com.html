</font></p><p><font class="poo">
As providers of the ionCube.com Online PHP Encoding Service, the "Service", 
we regard the privacy of our members data as crucial to all concerned, and this
statement reflects our sincere commitment to providing a secure and safe service and environment for every member.   
</font></p><p><font class="poo">
INFORMATION GATHERING AND USE
</font></p><p><font class="poo">
The Service gathers and keeps only the minimal information as is necessary to
provide a reasonable and satisfactory service. Members information will not be
imparted in any form whether for profit or otherwise 
in ways different from those which are disclosed in this statement. Currently
this means that the information is not disclosed to anyone.
</font></p><p><font class="poo">
INFORMATION FOR PURCHASE OF CREDITS
</font></p><p><font class="poo">
For your security, information gathered and processed for effecting the purchase
of credits is handled on a secure server by a trusted company whose proven business is 
performing such transactions. Contact information is passed back to the 
Service for the purposes of order matching and contacting you in the event
it is necessary in relation to a particular order, however no
information is returned concerning account details of credit or debit cards.
</font></p><p><font class="poo">
THE USE OF COOKIES
</font></p><p><font class="poo">
A cookie is a piece of data stored on the members computer
containing information sent from the Service, and it's passed to the 
Service
when the user requests pages. The Service uses a cookie
to establish and authenticate a private session between a member and the
Service. Cookies cannot be used to obtain any information from the users
computer other than that which was stored in the cookie by the Service
in the first place. The cookie is invalidated and may be deleted 
by the members browser when the member elects to log out of the Service.
</font></p><p><font class="poo">
TRANSACTION AND LOG FILES
</font></p><p><font class="poo">
Web server log files are kept for the purpose of analysing patterns of usage,
and to detect problems with the Service. Log files contain the IP address
of the user. The IP address is not currently used for any purposes, but can
be informational in providing broad demographic information.
Transaction logs are kept for the purpose of detecting site
problems and to assist in effecting an accurate restoration of 
state in the event of site failure.
</font></p><p><font class="poo">
LINKS
</font></p><p><font class="poo">
Whilst the site may contain links to other sites and services, 
the Service is not responsible for nor endorses any such sites or services, and 
such sites may very well have privacy policies and practices different to
those of ionCube.com. Members are encouraged to review and be aware of any such
policies in effect by other sites.
</font></p><p><font class="poo">
SECURITY
</font></p><p><font class="poo">
In particular because using the Service requires a member to disclose the
very code that is desired to be protected, we take protection of this
information very seriously. We provide a 128 bit strong encryption server
for access to the members area, which encrypts transactions from and including
the member login, file uploads, and viewing of file archive contents and 
encoded jobs. We are looking to also support PGP encrypted files.
</font></p><p><font class="poo">
The site stores source code in a secure area that is unique to each member,
and in a way that prohibits access in or out during encoding and archive
unbundling. Source files are kept purely for the purpose of encoding, and 
once encoded, whether successfully or unsuccessfully, source files
are removed. Despite being tested, this process will be monitored to ensure
that no unforseen event occurred that caused the removal process to fail.
In
the event that it did, we will investigate this thoroughly until the cause can
be identified and resolved.
</font></p><p><font class="poo">
As stated above, secure credit card processing is performed by a third party 
who specialise in such transactions, and who use 128 bit encryption on
an SSL server.  In testing we have noticed that the latest Opera browsers
on at least Linux incorrectly report that the checkout page is unsecured. This is incorrect, and is 
a bug in Opera that we have reported, although to which we have received
no feedback. Rest assured that the page is secure, as shown by other 
browsers, and that refreshing the page with Opera then correctly shows the
page to be secure, and can be done before any sensitive information is passed
for processing.
