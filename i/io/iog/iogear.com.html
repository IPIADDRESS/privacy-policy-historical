Protecting your privacy is important to IOGEAR. We strive to keep your personal
  information confidential. By ensuring that you are aware of and understand
  the IOGEAR Customer Privacy Policy, we can provide you with better service.
  Please take a moment to read the following policy to learn how we handle
  your personal information. <br>
  <br>
<strong>Why we collect personal information</strong> <br>
<br>
IOGEAR collects and uses your personal information to give you superior customer
service, to provide you with convenient access to our products and services,
and to make a wider range available to you. In addition, we use your personal
information to keep you up to date on the latest product announcements, software
updates, special offers, and other information we think you'd like to hear
about. From time to time, we may also use your personal information to contact
you to participate in a market research survey, so that we can gauge customer
satisfaction and develop better products. <br>
<strong><br>
How we collect personal information</strong> <br>
<br>
We collect information about you in several ways. For example, we might ask
for your contact information when you correspond with us, call us to make a
purchase or request service, register your product warranty, or participate
in an online survey. When you register a new IOGEAR product, sign up for IOGEAR
Internet services, or ask to be included in an email mailing list, we collect
and store the information you provide in a secure database. <br>
<br>
To save you time and make our web services even easier to use, some areas of
the IOGEAR website allow you to create an "IOGEAR ID" using your
  personal information. Here's how it works: Simply fill out a brief profile-your
  name, phone number, and email address-then choose a password and password hint
  (such as the month and day of your birth) for security. The system saves your
  information and assigns you a personal IOGEAR ID. Next time you order something
  from the IOGEAR services, you may simply enter your required information and
  the system will recall it for you. <br>
<strong><br>
When we disclose personal information</strong> <br>
<br>
Because IOGEAR is a global company, your personal information may be shared
with other IOGEAR business units around the world. They will protect your personal
information in accordance with the IOGEAR Customer Privacy Policy. IOGEAR never
shares your personal contact information with any other companies that are
not IOGEAR companies. If you do not want to receive promotional information
from IOGEAR, click <a href="mailto:privacy@iogear.com" target="_self">privacy@iogear.com</a> and
  send us a message stating that you would like to not be included in such updates. <br>
  <br>
IOGEAR works with other companies that help us provide IOGEAR products and
services to you, and we may provide your personal information to these companies.
For example, we give shipping companies this information so they can deliver
your products efficiently. The information they receive is for shipping and
delivery purposes only, and we require that the companies safeguard your personal
information in accordance with IOGEAR's policies. <br>
<br>
At times we may be required by law or legal process to disclose your personal
information. We may also disclose information about you if we believe that
disclosure is necessary for the public interest. <br>
<strong><br>
How we protect your personal information</strong> <br>
<br>
IOGEAR safeguards the security of the data you send us with physical, electronic,
and managerial procedures. We urge you to take every precaution to protect
your personal data when you are on the Internet. When using IOGEAR services,
change your passwords often, use a combination of letters and numbers, and
make sure you use a secure browser. <br>
<br>
The IOGEAR Online Store uses industry-standard Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption
on all web pages where personal information is required. To make purchases
from the IOGEAR Online Store, you must use an SSL-enabled browser such as Netscape
Navigator 3.0 or later, or Internet Explorer. This protects the confidentiality
of your personal and credit card information while it is transmitted over the
Internet. <br>
<strong><br>
Access to your personal information</strong> <br>
<br>
You always have access to the information we have about you. To review and
update your personal contact information, simply email your request to <a href="mailto:privacy@iogear.com">privacy@iogear.com</a>,
  be sure to include your previous information so we can locate you in our database.
  If you would like to review other personal information that IOGEAR may have
  about you, email us at <a href="mailto:privacy@iogear.com">privacy@iogear.com</a>. <br>
<strong><br>
Collecting other personal information</strong> <br>
<br>
When you browse IOGEAR's website, you are able to do so anonymously. Generally,
we don't collect personal information when you browse - not even your email
address. Your browser, however, does automatically tell us the type of computer
and operating system you are using. <br>
<br>
Like many websites, the IOGEAR website uses "cookie" technology.
  When you first connect to our site, the cookie identifies your browser with
  a unique, random number. The cookies we use do not reveal any personal information
  about you, except perhaps your first name so we can welcome you on your next
  visit. Cookies help us understand which parts of our websites are the most
  popular, where our visitors are going, and how long they spend there. We use
  cookies to study traffic patterns on our site so we can make the site even
  better. <br>
  <br>
In some of our email to you, we use a "click-through URL." When you
  click one of these URLs, you pass through our web server before arriving at
  the website that is your destination. We track click-throughs to help us determine
  your interest in particular topics and measure the effectiveness of our customer
  communications. <br>
<strong><br>
Our companywide commitment to privacy</strong> <br>
<br>
To make sure your personal information remains confidential, we communicate
these privacy guidelines to every IOGEAR employee. In addition, IOGEAR adheres
to industry initiatives such as the Online Privacy Alliance (<a href="http://www.privacyalliance.org/" target="_self">http://www.privacyalliance.org</a>)
  to preserve privacy rights on the Internet and in all aspects of electronic
  commerce. Though not a member, IOGEAR works to maintain the same standards
  outlined by the organization. <br>
  <br>
IOGEAR does not knowingly solicit personal information from children or send
them requests for personal information. <br>
<br>
IOGEAR's website contains links to other sites. IOGEAR does not share your
personal information with those websites and is not responsible for their privacy
practices. We encourage you to learn about the privacy policies of those companies. <br>
<br>
If we are going to use your personal information differently from that stated
at the time of collection, we will try to contact you via email using the most
recent information we have. If you have not given us permission to communicate
with you, you will not be contacted, nor will we use your personal information
in a new manner. <br>
<strong><br>
The IOGEAR Customer Privacy Policy is subject to change at any time.
We encourage you to review the privacy policy regularly for any changes.</strong> <br>
