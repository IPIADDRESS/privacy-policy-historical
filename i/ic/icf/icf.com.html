<h3><a name="types"></a>Personal Information Types We Collect</h3>

As such, we may share information about you within ICF and transfer it to countries in the world where we conduct business in connection with the uses identified in accordance with this Privacy Statement. Our Privacy Statement and our practices are designed to provide a globally consistent level of protection for Personal Information all over the world. This means that even in countries whose laws provide for less protection for your information, we will still handle your information in the manner described here. <br>
    <br>
    In some cases, ICF uses trusted suppliers located in various countries to collect, use, analyze, and otherwise process information on our behalf. It is our practice to require such suppliers to handle information in a manner consistent with this Privacy Statement and our policies.<br>
    <br>
    From time to time, we may disclose information that identifies you at an individual level and which we collected on our Site to other non-ICF entities that are not acting as our suppliers, such as our business partners or alliances. Except as described in this Privacy Statement, we only will do so with your prior consent.<br>
    <br>
    ICF regards its databases, which may include your Personal Information, as a valuable asset. Circumstances may arise where, whether for strategic or other business reasons, ICF decides to sell, buy, merge or otherwise reorganize businesses in some countries. Such a transaction may involve the disclosure of Personal Information or the sale or transfer of such databases of Personal Information to prospective or actual purchasers, or the receipt of such information from sellers. It is our practice to seek appropriate protection for information in these types of transactions. With the exception of such sale or transfer, we do not sell or lease Personal Information.</li>

    To allow you to interact with other websites on which you may have accounts (such as Facebook and other social media sites) or join communities on such sites, we may provide links or embed third-party applications that allow you to login, post content, or join communities from our Sites. We provide links to other websites for your convenience and for informational purposes only.

<h3>Personal Information Accuracy, Privacy, and Security</h3>
<p>We intend to maintain Personal Information accuracy, completeness current status, and security. In the event of changes in your Personal Information, you may inform us to make sure that our information is up-to-date.</p>
<p>We implement commercially reasonable physical, administrative and technical safeguards to help us protect the confidentiality, security, and integrity of your Personal Information and prevent the loss, misuse, unauthorized access, unauthorized interception, or information alteration. For example, ICF takes appropriate measure to make sure that the Personal Information you provide is stored on computer servers in controlled, secure environments.</p>
<p>In some instances, ICF contracts with third-party vendors for website hosting and data storage, including Personal Information. These third-party vendors are required to implement security measures and are subject to contractual prohibitions on selling or sharing any Personal Information. When Personal Information (such as a credit card number) is transmitted to other websites, it is protected through the use of encryption, such as the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol. </p>
<p>Your choice to disclose Personal Information in an email submission or online form is voluntary. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet is 100% secure. While we strive to protect your Personal Information, we cannot ensure or warranty the security of any such Personal Information or fully ensure that your private communications and other Personal Information will not be inadvertently disclosed to third parties by ICF or its business partners, agents, subcontractors, or other third-party vendors. Although we take commercially reasonable precautions to maintain the security of our Sites and servers, third parties may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private communications.</p>

    ICF studies Automated Non-Identifiable Data in our Internet access logs at both an aggregate and individual level to help us tailor content toward your interests and needs. For instance, to determine the usefulness of a particular Site feature, we may analyze collective traffic to a portion of our Sites. This collective data contains no Personal Information and is used to help us operate and enhance our Sites and services. Some of our business partners, such as Taleo and Thomson Reuters, also use cookies when you interact with sections of the Sites, which are hosted by these third-party vendors. We have no access to or control over these cookies.<br>
    <br>
    Cookies perform many different jobs. Some are "necessary" because they are required to make the website perform properly. Other cookies are "functional" and are used to improve the way the website functions for you. The majority of our cookies are "first-party," meaning that they are set by the same website where they are read. Third-party cookies are set and read by contracted vendors that provide services to ICF, such as web analytics or online advertising. A list of cookies on our Sites and the purposes for which such cookies are used are set out below. By using our Sites, you agree that we can place cookies and other similar technologies on your device as explained below. Please bear in mind that current “Do Not Track” initiatives are not recognized by our Sites. Please, however, follow the steps under the below Your Rights section if you would like to decline cookies.

    <li><a name="techs"></a><strong>Web beacons and other technologies</strong><br>
    We also may include Web beacons (including conversion pixels) or other technologies in marketing e-mail messages or our newsletters to determine whether you have opened messages, clicked links, or implemented similar actions. Web beacons do not place information on your device, but may work in conjunction with cookies to monitor website activity and the information on cookies above also applies to Web beacons and similar technologies. Conversion pixels are small codes located on a particular Web page which are triggered when someone visits a page resulting in an increase in the conversion count. <br>
    <br>
    Please bear in mind that you cannot remove or block Web beacons or personalized URLs, as they form part of the content of Web pages and emails rather than placing information on your device. But, as they work in conjunction with cookies, turning off cookies also will prevent any Web beacons from tracking your user activity on our Sites. Web beacons will still account for an anonymous visit, but your unique information will not be recorded.<br>
    <br>
    Some of our business partners or alliances set Web beacons and cookies on our Sites. In addition, third-party social media buttons may log certain information such as your IP address, browser type and language, access time, and referring website addresses, and, if you are logged in to those social media sites, they may also link such collected information with your profile information on that site. We do not control third party tracking technologies.</li>
