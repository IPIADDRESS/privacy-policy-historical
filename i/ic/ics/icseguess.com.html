      <p class="text12">ICseguess.com has created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to privacy. The following discloses our information gathering and usage practices. For additional information about icseguess.com, please review our Terms of Service. <br>
      icseguess.com does not sell or rent your personal identification to third parties. icseguess.com does provide your personal identification to selected, affiliated companies to allow them to perform services for members on our behalf.</p>    
      <p class="heading1">Personal Messaging</p>
      <p class="text12"> It is the policy of icseguess.com to send our members only the types of pm they elect to receive in addition to icseguess.com customary business communications (address confirmation, renewal notifications, new product offerings, etc.) Further, it is our policy to remove members from any icseguess.com mailing list to which they have subscribed upon request (members will continue to receive customary business communications from icseguess.com). At any time, members can update their email preferences list via the "My Page" button. In addition, every subscribed email communication from icseguess.com will contain clear and obvious instructions for how the member can remove himself or herself from that mailing list.</p>
      <p class="heading1">Membership Registration</p>
      <p class="text12"> Demographic and profile data is also collected at our site. We use this data to tailor your experience at icseguess.com, showing content that we think you might be interested in, and displaying the content according to your preferences. We do this in two ways. First, we analyze member’s information in aggregate - that is, we collect information about thousands of site visits and analyze it as a whole. This kind of study involves looking for trends among many visitors to icseguess.com, rather than analyzing information about any individual member. Examples include researching which parts of the site are accessed most frequently, or determining which products are most attractive to our users. Second, we may use information gathered during your visit to help customize our communications with you. <br>
    icseguess.com may periodically conduct individual voluntary member surveys. We encourage our members to participate in these surveys because they provide us with important information that helps us to improve the types of services we offer, and how we provide them to you. The responses we collect in online surveys are anonymous. In the end, we hope to tailor our communications with you to fit your needs - so that you receive more of what you want from us and less of what you don't want.</p>
      <p class="heading1">Cookies</p>
      <p class="text12">Cookies are small pieces of information that are stored in a browser-related file on your computer's hard drive when you use our Web site. We use cookies to improve the member experience, like allowing the member to login without typing the registered email address or registration number and password.

      <p class="heading1"> IP Address</p>
      <p class="text12">Like most Internet sites, we use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server, and to administer our Web site. Your IP address is also used to gather broad demographic information. This information is distributed to current and potential advertisers, but only in aggregate form. It does not contain information that identifies individual members.</p>
      <p class="heading1">Advertising and Third Party Links</p>
      <p class="text12">Some icseguess.com advertisers and affiliate partners may request information directly from users, or link to sites that do so. icseguess.com has no control over its advertisers' privacy policies, and encourages users to review such policies prior to submitting any personal information to them.<br>
        icseguess.com contains non-advertising links to a variety of third party sites to enhance the member experience. icseguess.com has no control of either the content or privacy policies of such sites, nor should such links be considered an endorsement of these sites except where otherwise noted.</p>
      <p class="heading1">Updates to our information practices</p>
      <p class="text12">From time to time, we make changes to our information practices or alter the functionality of our Web site. We always update this statement accordingly, so we encourage you to periodically review this page for the latest information on privacy practices at icseguess.com.</p>
