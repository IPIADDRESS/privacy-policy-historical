<br><br>
<b>Public Areas and My Details Area</b>
<br><br>
If you use the ICQ Services to disclose information about yourself publicly, for example, in or through: chat rooms, message boards, groups, lists, blogs, ICQ directories, your My Details Area (as defined below) or any other area reasonably understood to be a public area (collectively, the "Public Areas"), other online users may obtain access to and use any such information you provide.  You should therefore carefully consider whether you wish such information to be accessible by others.  You should also note that others may be able to record certain information even if not made available in a Public Area, such as the content at a session (e.g. instant messages) or your IP address.  The IP address is an integral part of the TCP/IP standard protocol of the Internet and can be extracted by any party to the communication session using certain software and/or hardware.
<br><br>
The My Details Area is the area on ICQ that users are able create a personal profile for themselves by providing various details about themselves. Users may add details to the My Details Area during registration or any time thereafter through the Software or the ICQ Web sites.  You may be required to provide a nickname and/or email address (which will be displayed in the My Details Area) that will be used as your ICQ identifier (e.g. your login name which may be used by others to locate you on ICQ). ICQ does not require you to input any other personally identifiable information about yourself.   Except if explicitly stated otherwise, any information you choose to provide in the My Details Area will be deemed to have been provided to a Public Area.  
<br><br>
The holder of an ICQ or Compad account and ICQ or Compad password (as applicable) has the ability and discretion to edit the details provided in the My Details Area.  For this reason and other reasons it is very important to keep your password in a safe place.  It is your responsibility to keep your password and username secure.  In some instances additions or amendments to your My Details Area may not be immediately visible to all users (e.g. users who already have that account on their contact list will be required to press "Update" in order to view the new or revised details or information entered).
<br><br>
Please be aware of where you choose to provide information.  In certain Public Areas you may not be able to delete the information you have provided.  For example, on message boards, chat sessions, or other services that are maintained by third parties (e.g. ICQ lists, ICQ Groups, ICQ virtual private networks etc.).  
<br><br>

<br><br>
<b>General Internet Hazards</b>
<br><br>
You should be aware that receiving files from third parties, via any application (e.g. ICQ, email, etc.) may be harmful. Before receiving any files from any user, and even if the account from which the file transfer notice is sent looks familiar to you, it is strongly recommended that you verify that the person sending you these files is indeed the person you think he is, for example by asking him for some kind of information known only to the two of you. Please make sure not to receive files from users you do not trust, from users you are not sure they are whom they say they are or whenever you are not sure you want to receive the files.
<br><br>
You should be aware that communications over the Internet are not secure unless they have been encrypted.  ICQ does not encrypt your communications.  In addition, your communications may be routed through different countries - that is the nature of the Internet.  ICQ cannot accept any responsibility for any unauthorised access or loss of Data.
