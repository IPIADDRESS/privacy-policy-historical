Upon receipt of your consent ICQ (or ICQ's business partners) may use your ICQ Services Information to send email, SMS, or any other electronic communications (including, without limitation any electronic means available through the Software) ("Direct Marketing") to you about certain promotions on behalf of selected third parties. 
<br><br>
Direct Marketing does not apply to communications and information sent by ICQ (whether by email, through the Software, or other means) that is directly related to your registration with the ICQ Services and the various features (including notifications of new features) contained within the ICQ Services, or the fulfillment of a specific transaction you have requested (for example, a service advisory from the ICQ Services, or an acknowledgment of a purchase order). Please note if you have chosen to use a version of the Software Co-Branded with a third party, Direct Marketing shall not apply to communications and information sent by such third party through the Software that is directly related to your registration with the third party's services and the various features (including notifications of new features) provided to you by such third party, or the fulfillment of a specific transaction you have requested (for example, an acknowledgment of a purchase order). In addition, Direct Marketing does not apply to advertisements provided to you through the ICQ Services, including from ICQ business partners. These business partners and advertisers receive aggregate data about groups of users, but do not receive information that personally identifies you, except if otherwise agreed by you.
<br><br>
<b>Public Areas and My Details Area</b>
<br><br>
If you use the ICQ Services to disclose information about yourself publicly, for example, in or through: chat rooms, message boards, groups, lists, blogs, ICQ directories, your My Details Area (as defined below) or any other area reasonably understood to be a public area (collectively, the "Public Areas"), other online users may obtain access to and use any such information you provide. You should therefore carefully consider whether you wish such information to be accessible by others. You should also note that others may be able to record certain information even if not made available in a Public Area, such as the content at a session (e.g. instant messages) or your IP address. The IP address is an integral part of the TCP/IP standard protocol of the Internet and can be extracted by any party to the communication session using certain software and/or hardware.
<br><br>
The My Details Area is the area on ICQ that users are able create a personal profile for themselves by providing various details about themselves. Users may add details to the My Details Area during registration or any time thereafter through the Software or the ICQ Web sites. You may be required to provide a nickname and/or email address (which will be displayed in the My Details Area) that will be used as your ICQ identifier (e.g. your login name which may be used by others to locate you on ICQ). ICQ does not require you to input any other personally identifiable information about yourself. Except if explicitly stated otherwise, any information you choose to provide in the My Details Area will be deemed to have been provided to a Public Area. 
<br><br>
The holder of an ICQ or Compad account and ICQ or Compad password (as applicable) has the ability and discretion to edit the details provided in the My Details Area. For this reason and other reasons it is very important to keep your password in a safe place. It is your responsibility to keep your password and username secure. In some instances additions or amendments to your My Details Area may not be immediately visible to all users (e.g. users who already have that account on their contact list will be required to press "Update" in order to view the new or revised details or information entered).
<br><br>
Please be aware of where you choose to provide information. In certain Public Areas you may not be able to delete the information you have provided. For example, on message boards, chat sessions, or other services that are maintained by third parties (e.g. ICQ lists, ICQ Groups, ICQ virtual private networks etc.).
<br><br>
<b>Cookies and Web Beacons </b>
<br><br>
The ICQ Services may use cookies, web beacons, or similar technologies in combination with your ICQ Services information to enhance and personalize your experience on the ICQ Services, including, without limitation, to operate and improve offerings through the ICQ Services; to help authenticate you when you use the ICQ Services; to remember your preferences and registration information; to enable a shopping cart; to present and help measure and research the effectiveness of ICQ Services offerings, advertisements, and e-mail communications (by determining which Network e-mails you open and act upon); and to customize the content and advertisements provided to you through the ICQ Services. 
<br><br>
A cookie is a small text file transferred from ICQ to your computer that records information about your preferences and use of services provided by ICQ. Such cookies may also include cookies which help ICQ to identify your location (ie. by determining your IP address) while others may assist ICQ in remembering certain settings that you have chosen. Web beacons are small pieces of code placed on Web pages that can be used, among other things, to count the users who visit that Web page, or to deliver a cookie to the browser of a user viewing that page. You can control cookies through your browser's settings. If you reject all cookies, however, you may not be able to take advantage of many of the ICQ Services offerings. 
<br><br>
The ICQ Services and its advertisers may also use ad network providers and other service providers, to help present customized content and advertisements on the ICQ Services and other Web sites. These providers may use cookies, web beacons, or similar technologies on your computer to help present, better target, and measure the effectiveness of their content and advertisements, using data gathered over time and across their networks of Web pages to determine or predict the characteristics and preferences of their audience. The ICQ Services may share certain non-personally identifiable information about you as an ICQ Services user (such as age or zip code) with certain ad network and service providers, to help them deliver more relevant content and advertisements through their networks. The use of cookies, web beacons, or similar technologies by content and ad network providers is subject to their own privacy policies, not the ICQ Service's.
<br><br>
<b>Our Commitment to Security </b>
<br><br>
ICQ has established safeguards to help prevent unauthorized access to or misuse of your ICQ Services Information, but cannot guarantee that your personally identifiable information will never be disclosed in a manner inconsistent with this Privacy Policy (for example, as a result of unauthorized acts by third parties that violate applicable law or the policies of the ICQ Services and its affiliated providers). 
<br><br>
<b>General Internet Hazards </b>
<br><br>
You should be aware that receiving files from third parties, via any application (e.g. ICQ, email, etc.) may be harmful. Before receiving any files from any user, and even if the account from which the file transfer notice is sent looks familiar to you, it is strongly recommended that you verify that the person sending you these files is indeed the person you think he is, for example by asking him for some kind of information known only to the two of you. Please make sure not to receive files from users you do not trust, from users you are not sure they are whom they say they are or whenever you are not sure you want to receive the files. 
<br><br>
You should be aware that communications over the Internet are not secure unless they have been encrypted. ICQ does not encrypt your communications. In addition, your communications may be routed through different countries - that is the nature of the Internet. ICQ cannot accept any responsibility for any unauthorised access or loss of Data. 
<br><br>
<b>European Union Members - International Transfer of Data </b>
<br><br>
The ICQ Services is international in scope. By using the ICQ Services you consent to your ICQ Services Information being sent and processed in other jurisdictions, including the United States and other jurisdictions outside the European Union and European Economic Area where there may be less stringent data protection laws. 
<br><br>
