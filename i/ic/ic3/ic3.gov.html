					<h1>
						IC3 Website Privacy Policy
					</h1>
					<p>
						The <a target="_blank" href="http://www.fbi.gov">Federal Bureau of Investigation</a> (FBI) and the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nw3c.org">National White Collar Crime 
						Center</a> (NW3C) co-sponsor the Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3). The NW3C is a private, non-governmental, 
						not-for-profit organization, which provides analytical support for white collar 
						crime cases for state and local agencies.
					</p>
					
						<h2>Information Collected and Stored Automatically</h2>
					
					<p>
						The IC3 uses the data collected at this website to process complaint 
						information and to collect and store certain information. When you visit our 
						site, we may automatically collect and store the following information whether 
						or not you file a complaint:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Your domain name (for example, "xyz123abc-company.com" if you use a private 
							Internet account, or "yourschool.edu" if you are connecting from a university's 
							domain) and the IP address (a number automatically assigned to your computer 
							when you go online) from which you access our website.</li>
						<li>The IP address, a number automatically assigned to your computer when you go online,
                            from which you access our website.</li>
						<li>The type of browser and operating system used to access our site.</li>
						<li>The date and time you access our site.</li>
						<li>The Internet address of the website from which you accessed our site.</li>
						<li>The pages you visit on our site.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>
						We use this information to measure the number of visitors to the different 
						sections of our site, and to help make our site more useful to future 
						visitors. We do not sell or transfer to third parties any of this information 
						that we automatically collect from every visitor unless it relates to a site 
						security matter as discussed below.
					</p>
					
					<h2>Information Collected from Emails and Web Forms</h2>
					<p>
						The IC3 uses the data voluntarily submitted by complainants at this website to 
						help victims of Internet-related fraud. Your complaint, should you choose to 
						submit one, is maintained and controlled by the NW3C. Thereafter, the IC3 may 
						pursue preliminary inquiries and information from the complaint, along with 
						other information developed at IC3, may be referred to a federal, state, local, or international law 
						enforcement or regulatory agency, as appropriate, including the FBI. Whether 
						your complaint is referred to another agency or not, the data you voluntarily 
						submit on the complaint form will be maintained by the NW3C at the IC3 and be 
						available for future retrieval and possible referral to one or more enforcement 
						agencies.
					</p>
					<p>
						Information solicited by IC3 on the complaint form assists personnel in 
						processing complaints. Disclosure of such information is strictly voluntary, 
						however, failure to provide certain information solicited will result in the 
						complaint not being properly registered. No action will be taken on 
						incomplete complaints. However, data submitted from incomplete complaints may 
						still be stored and maintained for potential retrieval and dissemination. Any 
						complaint information you affirmatively choose to provide to the IC3 may be 
						referred to one or more appropriate enforcement agencies that have jurisdiction 
						over your complaint. This may include agencies at all levels of government, 
						including federal, state, local, and international law enforcement and regulatory agencies having 
						administrative, civil, and/or criminal law enforcement authority. Such referrals 
						are the principal purposes for which the information voluntarily submitted is 
						intended to be used. The confidentiality of the complaint information you 
						provide may be affected by differing state law. As such, we cannot guarantee 
						that your complaint will remain confidential. People who voluntarily choose to 
						file a complaint do so knowing that all information provided may be 
						disseminated to one or more enforcement agencies, which may or may not take 
						action on the complaint. The IC3 does not decide which complaints will be 
						actively investigated by any agency.  The IC3 cannot make any representations 
						or guarantees as to the action that may or may not be taken on any complaint.
					</p>
					<p>
						You may volunteer to provide us personal identifying information, for example 
						your mailing address, in an electronic mail message or by filing a complaint. 
						Before you do so, you should know that various people might see the material 
						you submit. We may enter the information into a database and we may share it 
						with other agencies. Information collected may be used for responding to 
						complaints, as well as other authorized purposes.
					</p>
					
					
					<h2>Security and Consent to Monitor</h2>
					<p>
						For site security purposes, and to ensure that this service remains available 
						to all users, all network traffic is monitored in order to identify 
						unauthorized attempts to upload or change information, or otherwise cause 
						damage or conduct criminal activity. To protect the system from unauthorized 
						use and to ensure that the system is functioning properly, individuals using 
						this computer system are subject to having all of their activities monitored 
						and recorded by authorized personnel and such monitoring and recording will be 
						conducted. Anyone using this system expressly consents to such monitoring and 
						is advised that if such monitoring reveals evidence of possible abuse or 
						criminal activity, system personnel may provide the results of such monitoring 
						to appropriate officials. Unauthorized attempts to upload or change 
						information, or otherwise cause damage to this service, are strictly prohibited 
						and may be punishable under applicable federal law. Except for complainants who 
						voluntarily provide us with personally identifying information, and except for 
						authorized systems security purposes or enforcement investigations such as discussed herein, no attempts are 
						made to identify individual users or their usage habits.
					</p>
					<p>
						Site information may be distributed or copied, subject to Sections 701 and 709 
						of Title 18, U.S. Code. Unauthorized use of the FBI seal, the words "Federal 
						Bureau of Investigation," the initials "FBI," or any imitation "in a manner 
						reasonably calculated to convey the impression that such [activity]...is 
						approved, endorsed, or authorized by the Federal Bureau of Investigation" is 
						prohibited.
					</p>
					<p>
						When you file a complaint, we use secure socket layer (SSL) encryption to 
						protect the information you submit. The information you provide is securely 
						stored offline.
					</p>
					<h2>Cookies</h2>
					<p>
						A "cookie" is a file placed on your computer's hard drive or in memory by a website 
						that allows the site to monitor your use of the site, usually without your 
						knowledge. Navigation through the "Complaint" section of our site requires the 
						use of session cookies. This means that cookies are placed on your computer's 
						memory during the time you are filing a complaint. These cookies are active 
						only when a user is actually filing a complaint. Disabling cookies on your 
						browser will prevent you from filing a complaint. Users of our site who do not 
						file a complaint do not encounter session cookies.
