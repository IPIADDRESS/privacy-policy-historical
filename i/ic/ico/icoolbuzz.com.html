<li><b>Information sharing</b></li>
</ol>
<p>The iCool Buzz values your privacy, and shares information about our users only under certain circumstances. We will make information about you available to other companies, applications, or people in the circumstances listed below:</p>
<ul type="DISC">
<li>We may share aggregated information or information that does not directly identify you with third parties to help us develop content, services, and advertising that we hope you will find of interest. Please note that we do not share contact information with third parties that advertise on the Site.</li>
<li>We may employ third parties to perform Site-related services, including database management, maintenance services, analytics, marketing, data processing, and email and text message distribution. These third parties have access to your information only to perform these tasks on our behalf.</li>
<li>If you choose to engage in public activities on the site, such as posting comments on community message boards, any information you submit can be read, collected, or used by others. Please exercise caution when deciding to disclose any personal<b>&nbsp;</b>information in public activities or submissions.</li>
<li>We may share information about you in the event that the Site is acquired by or merged with another company or a similar corporate transaction takes place. However, the Site will notify you by placing a prominent notice on our site or sending a notice to the primary email address specified in your account before your information is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.</li>
<li>We may share information about you to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety or other rights and interests of any person, violations of the Site’s&nbsp;<a href="http://icoolbuzz.com/terms" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Terms and Conditions</a>, or as otherwise required by law.</li>
<li>We may share information about you to respond to subpoenas, search warrants, judicial proceedings, court orders, legal process, or other law enforcement measures, to establish or exercise our legal rights, or to defend against legal claims.</li>

<ol start="5" type="1">
<li><b>Third-party services</b></li>
</ol>
<p>To customize your experience on the Site and to simplify the Site’s registration process, we provide you with the opportunity to access or interact with third-party services, such as Facebook and Twitter. When you connect to the Site through these third-party services, we may share information about you with these third-party service providers and they may share data about you with us.</p>
<p>When you allow us to access your data through a third-party service to create a Site profile, we may use this data for several purposes, including:</p>
<ul type="DISC">
<li><i>Creating relationships automatically within our system</i>. For example, if you connect to us via a service with a public friend list, like Twitter, we may check to see if any people you follow on Twitter are also Site members. If we find a match, we will replicate your Twitter relationship with those members, setting them to be fans, followers, or friends on our Site.</li>
<li><i>Suggesting relationships</i>. For example, if you connect via a service that has a private contact list (like Google and Yahoo!), we check for people in your contacts who are Site members and suggest that you become a fan of these users. This process is not automatic; you must affirmatively choose to become a fan of these suggested users.</li>
<li><i>Populating a list of potential friends to whom you can send emails.</i>&nbsp;When users share content with their friends using, for example, the forward-to-a-friend feature on the Site, we may use friend lists from third-party services to create a list of contacts to whom you may choose to send the email message.</li>
<li><i>Populating a list of potential friends to whom you can send service-specific messages.</i>&nbsp;For example, we may use friend lists from a third-party service to create a list of contacts to whom you may choose to send an invitation to view an interactive slideshow.</li>
<li><i>To enhance and personalize your experience on the Site</i>. When you are connected via a third-party service, we may access certain account information, such as your profile picture, what stories are popular in your network, and what your friends are saying about certain articles or blog posts, in order to enhance and personalize your experience on the Site.</li>
</ul>
