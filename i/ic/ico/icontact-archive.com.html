				<h2 id="privacy-data-types">What Type of Data Do We Collect?</h2>
				<p>
					Generally, we collect or maintain the following categories of data:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li><strong>Customer Registration Data</strong>: when a customer, whether an individual or an entity, activates our services, creates an account at the Site or registers at an event we collect account information from that customer, which we refer to in this Policy as "Customer Registration Data." The Customer Registration Data we collect includes individual or contact name, company name, e-mail address, phone number and other contact information, as well as information about services requested and payment information, such as credit card number, expiration date and billing address. We also assign customers a unique username and password to access their account information through the Site;</li>
					<li><strong>Customer Message Recipient Data</strong>: we also maintain data that has been provided to us or uploaded to the Site by our customers, which we refer to in this Policy as "Customer Message Recipient Data." Typically, Customer Message Recipient Data relates to individuals or entities who have opted in to receive email messages or other types of communications from our customers, and may include name, e-mail address, contact information, and other information. Under our Anti-Spam Policy, customers must obtain a recipient's consent prior to sending the recipient an e-mail through our service. For more information, please see the section below entitled "Why Do You Receive E-mails"; and</li>
					<li><strong>Site Data</strong>: we use cookies, web beacons, and other automated devices to automatically collect information about visitors to our Site and users of our services, which we refer to in this Policy as "Site Data." The Site Data we collect includes browser type, operating system and IP address, as well as information of the web pages viewed and links clicked by visitors and/or customers. We may combine Site Data with other data we have collected from users, such as Customer Registration Data.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Although the majority of our customers are businesses, some of the Customer Registration Data submitted or maintained by us may identify or relate to an individual ("personal data"), rather than a business.</p>

				<h2 id="privacy-data-collection">How Do We Use the Data We Collect?</h2>
				<p>We may use the information we collect and maintain, including any personal data, for the following purposes:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>If you have provided your contact information to us, we may use such information to contact you for marketing and promotional purposes by various means, including regular mail, email or telephone. If we receive your express consent, we may also send you pre-recorded messages or SMS text messages.</li>
					<li>To process orders, requests and payments, and to communicate with our customers about their accounts or any requests, orders or payments;</li>
					<li>To provide requested services to our customers. The services we provide to our customers may include certain marketing and promotional services, including sending or facilitating the delivery of communications on behalf of and at the request of our customers. In such cases, our customers are responsible for the content and delivery of such communications.</li>
					<li>To respond to any inquiries submitted to us and to provide technical support to customers and Site visitors.</li>
					<li>To tailor the content and information that we may send or display to customers or Site visitors, to display targeted advertisements, and to otherwise personalize experiences at the Site;</li>
					<li>To better understand how users access and use our Site and services, both on an aggregate and individualized basis, for the purposes of improving our Site and services and responding to customer and visitor desires and preferences; and</li>
					<li>To detect violations of applicable policies. For example, we may use automated filters to screen the content of e-mails sent by or on behalf of our customers in order to restrict the sending of pornography or other prohibited content. We may also track or screen certain e-mail activities, such as the importation of large e-mail lists or the receipt of returned e-mails, to detect and prevent illegal spamming activities.</li>
				</ul>

				<h2 id="privacy-data-disclosure">How Do We Disclose the Data We Collect?</h2>
				<p>We do not sell, rent or trade personal information, whether Customer Information or Customer Recipient Data, without prior consent. We may however, disclose the information we collect or maintain, including personal information, without prior consent as described below:</p>
				<ul>
					<li><strong>Service Providers</strong>.  We may disclose the information we collect from you to third- party vendors, service providers, contractors or agents who perform the following functions on our behalf: such as credit card processing to bill you for goods and services and a live chat vendor to assist us with customer service marketing analysis services to help manage our online advertising, customer relationship management services, and internal system monitoring and performance services. These third parties are required to maintain the confidentiality, security and integrity of personal information and to use such information only as directed by us.</li>
					<li><strong>Business Transfers</strong>.  If we are acquired by or merged with another company, if part or of our assets are transferred to another company, or as part of a bankruptcy proceeding, we may transfer the personal information we have collected to the acquiring company or entity. You will be notified via email or prominent notice on our Web site for 30 days of any such change in ownership or control of your personal information.</li>
					<li><strong>In Response to Legal Process</strong>.  We may also disclose the information we collect in order to comply with the law, a judicial proceeding, court order, or other legal process, such as in response to a court order or a subpoena.</li>
					<li><strong>To Protect iContact and Others</strong>.  We also may disclose the information we collect from you where we believe it is necessary to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the safety of any person, or violations of this Policy, our <a href="/permission-email-marketing" title="Terms &amp; Conditions">Terms &amp; Conditions</a>, our <a href="/anti-spam-policy" title="Anti-Spam Policy">Anti-Spam Policy</a>, or our <a href="/permission-email-marketing#endUser" title="End User Service Agreement">End User Service Agreement</a>.</li>
					<li><strong>Aggregate and De-identified Information</strong>.  We may share aggregate, anonymous, or de-identified information, such as Site Data, about users with third parties for marketing, advertising, research or similar purposes; however, we do not disclose personal data to such third parties.</li>
				</ul>

Customers and visitors who link to other third party websites from the Site should check the privacy and security policy statements of such third party websites to understand the policies and practices of such third party websites as we are not responsible for those policies and practices. Customers and visitors who access a linked site may be disclosing their private information to the owner of such third party websites. It is your responsibility to keep such information private and confidential.</p>

				<h2 id="privacy-cookies-and-tracking">How Do We Use Cookies &amp; Other Tracking Technologies?</h2>
				<p>When you interact with the Site, we strive to make your experience easy and meaningful. We may use or engage others to use cookies, clear gifs and Flash LSOs to track user activity and collect Site Data. In addition, we may combine the Site Data we collect with the other data we collect.</p>
				<p><strong>Cookies</strong>: When you come to the Site, our web server sends a cookie to your computer. Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer's hard drive through your web browser for record-keeping purposes. There are two types of cookies: session-based and persistent-based cookies. In addition, we may permit certain third parties to place cookies through our website. We do not link the information we store in cookies to any personally identifiable information you submit while on our site, other than by linking persistent cookies to our current customers as defined below.</p>
				<ul>
					<li><strong>Session Cookies</strong>.  Session cookies exist only during an online session. They disappear from your computer when you close your browser or turn off your computer. iContact uses session cookies to allow the system to uniquely identify you while you are logged in to the Site. This allows us to process your online transactions and requests, and to verify your identity, after you have logged in, as you move through our Site.</li>
					<li><strong>Persistent cookies</strong>.  Persistent cookies remain on your computer after you have closed your browser or turned off your computer. iContact uses persistent cookies that only iContact, or its service providers, can read and use, to identify the fact that you are an iContact customer or prior Site visitor. We are especially careful about the security and confidentiality of the information stored in persistent cookies. For example, we do not store account numbers or passwords in persistent cookies.</li>
					<li><strong>Third Party Cookies</strong>. We may also engage third parties to track and analyze non-personally identifiable Site Data. We use the data collected by such third parties to help us administer and improve the quality of the Site, and to analyze Site usage. We do not share this data with other third parties, except as described above in the section "How We Disclose the Data We Collect." You should note, however, that we do not have access to or control over these third party cookies nor does this Privacy Policy cover such third parties' use of data.</li>
				</ul>
				<p><strong>Disabling Cookies</strong>: Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but if you prefer, you can edit your browser options to block them in future. The Help portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your computer from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. Site visitors who disable their web browsers' ability to accept cookies will be able to browse the Site; however, you must enable cookies in order to use our services.</p>
				<p><strong>Clear Gifs (Web Beacons/Web Bugs)</strong>: We or the third parties we engage to track and analyze Site Data may employ clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs) to help us better manage content on the Site. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on your computer's hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on Web pages. We do not tie the information gathered by clear gifs to our customers' personally identifiable information.</p>
				<p>We also use clear gifs in our HTML-based emails. They let us know which emails have been opened by recipients, allowing us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and marketing campaigns. For information on how to opt-out of receiving marketing e-mails from iContact, or from an iContact customer, please see the section "How to Stop Receiving E-mails" above.</p>
				<p><strong>Flash LSOs</strong>: We may use local shared objects, also known as Flash cookies, to store your Site preferences, to personalize your visit, or to display content based upon what you view on our Site. Third Parties with whom we partner to provide certain features on our Site or to display advertising based upon your Web browsing activity, may use Flash cookies to collect and store information. We do not have access to or control over these third party cookies nor does this Privacy Policy cover such third parties' use of data.</p>
				<p>Flash cookies are different from browser cookies because of the amount and type of data stored. In addition, you can not control, delete, or disable the acceptance of Flash cookies through your browser.

				<h2>iContact Safe Harbor Policy</h2>
				<p><strong>Effective date: October 17, 2011</strong></p>
				<p><strong>Updated March 14, 2013</strong></p>
				<p>
					iContact LLC ("iContact") understands and values the importance of individual privacy.
					This Privacy Policy ("Policy") is designed to inform our European Customers of: (1) how we
					collect, use and disclose Personal Data that is transferred to iContact in the United States; (2)
					individuals' choices with regard to how such Personal Data will be used or disclosed by
					iContact; and (3) individuals' other rights with regard to that Personal Data.
				</p>
				<p>This Policy complies with the Safe Harbor Principles as agreed upon by the U.S. Department of
					Commerce with the European Commission, as well as those agreed upon with the Federal Data
					Protection and Information Commissioner of Switzerland (collectively, "Safe Harbor
					Principles"), which can be found at <a title="http://www.export.gov/safeharbor/" target="_blank" href="http://www.export.gov/safeharbor/">http://www.export.gov/safeharbor/</a>.
				</p>
				<h2>1. SCOPE OF POLICY</h2>

				<p>This Policy applies only to the processing of Personal Data (defined below) that iContact
					receives in the United States from its European Customers (defined below). Most iContact
					Customers are businesses, not individuals. However, iContact may also receive Personal Data
					about individual Message Recipients (defined below) on a Customer's e-mail marketing or
					contact lists. We process the Personal Data of a Customer's Message Recipients only on
					behalf of and under the direction of the Customer, and the collection, use and disclosure of
					such data is subject to the Customer's privacy policy.
				</p>
				<p>This Policy does not cover data through which individuals are no longer identifiable, or
					identifiable only with a disproportionately large expense in time, cost or labor, or data combined
					with pseudonyms rather than actual names or other identifiable information.
				</p>
				<p>Capitalized terms in this Policy are defined at the end of this Policy.</p>

				<h2>2. COLLECTION AND USE OF PERSONAL DATA</h2>

				<p>iContact may collect Personal Data: (1) directly or indirectly from Customers; (2) from Third
					Parties; (3) from iContact affiliates in Europe, or (4) through other means. We also collect
					information in the course of conducting our business operations or in furtherance of our
					legitimate business interests that may lead to the incidental collection of Personal Data.
				</p>

				<p>iContact uses Personal Data for legitimate business purposes, including: (1) to process orders and
					for billing purposes; (2) to provide our services to Customers, including facilitating the delivery
					of e-mails or other communications to a Customer's Message Recipients; (3) to provide technical
					support or customer service; (4) to respond to Customer inquiries or to otherwise communicate
					with customers about their iContact accounts, orders or services; (5) to assess and improve the
					quality of our website, products, services and business operations; (6) to create reports and track
					the effectiveness of Customer campaigns and iContact services; (7) to analyze and improve our
					website and services; (8) to satisfy governmental reporting and tax requirements; (9) to satisfy
					security, health, and safety concerns; (10) to plan and implement potential acquisitions and
					mergers; (11) for other business-related purposes permitted or required under applicable local
					laws and regulations; and (12) for other purposes expressly consented to by Data Subjects.
				</p>

				<p>Where permitted, iContact also may use the Personal Data we collect to contact our Customers
					about services and other information that we believe will be of interest or to send marketing
					information. Our Customers may opt-out of being contacted for such purposes by e-mailing

				<h2>3. DISCLOSURES/ONWARD TRANSFERS OF PERSONAL DATA</h2>

				<p>Except as otherwise provided herein, iContact discloses Personal Data only to Third Parties who
					reasonably need to know such data for a legitimate business purpose of iContact's. Such
					recipients must agree to abide by confidentiality obligations.
				</p>
				<p>iContact may provide Personal Data to Third Parties who act as agents to perform tasks on behalf
					of and under the instructions of iContact. These Third Parties must agree to use such Personal
					Data only for the purposes for which they have been engaged by iContact and they must either:
					(1) comply with the EU-US Safe Harbor principles or another method permitted by the EU Data
					Protection Directive for transfers and processing of Personal Data outside of the EU; or (2) agree
					to provide adequate protections for the Personal Data that are no less protective than those set out
					in this Policy. iContact may also disclose Personal Data for other purposes or to other Third
					Parties, when a Data Subject has consented to such disclosures.
				</p>
				<p>The disclosure of a Customer's Message Recipient Personal Data is subject to the Customer's
					Privacy Policy. iContact will not use or disclose such Personal Data other than as directed by the
					Customer.
				</p>
				<h2>4. SENSITIVE DATA.</h2>

				<p>iContact does not intentionally collect Sensitive Data from Customers. Except as stated
					otherwise herein, iContact will not disclose Sensitive Data to any Third Parties, other than its
					service providers as stated above, unless it receives a Data Subject's express consent. Further,
					iContact will not use Sensitive Data for any purpose other than: (1) the purpose for which it was
					originally provided, (2) a purpose expressly consented to by the Data Subject; or (3) a purpose
					expressly described below.
				</p>
				<p>Notwithstanding the above, should iContact receive Sensitive Data, it may disclose Sensitive
					Data (and Personal Data) without prior express consent, where such disclosure or use: (a) is in
					the vital interests of the Customer, or another person; (b) is necessary for the establishment of
					legal claims or defenses, to obtain legal advice, or for the purposes of establishing, exercising or
					defending iContact's legal rights; (c) is required to provide medical care or diagnosis; (d) is
					necessary to carry out iContact's obligations under applicable employment or other laws; (e) is
					data manifestly made public by the Customer; or (f) as otherwise required by law.
				</p>
				<h2>5. DATA INTEGRITY AND SECURITY</h2>

				<p>iContact uses reasonable efforts to maintain the accuracy and integrity of Personal Data and to
					update it as appropriate. iContact also uses reasonable physical, administrative and technical
					safeguards designed to protect against the loss, misuse and alteration of data that we collect or
					maintain. For example, all electronically stored Personal Data is stored on a secure network with
					monitored firewall protection, and access to iContact's electronic information systems requires
					user authentication via password or similar means. Despite these precautions, no data security

				<a name="endUser"></a><h2>End User Services Agreement</h2>
				<p>PLEASE REVIEW THIS END USER SERVICES AGREEMENT (THIS "<strong>AGREEMENT</strong>") CAREFULLY, AS IT CONSTITUTES A LEGAL AGREEMENT BETWEEN YOU ("<strong>YOU</strong>" OR "<strong>CUSTOMER</strong>") AND ICONTACT LLC ("<strong>ICONTACT</strong>" OR "<strong>WE</strong>") WITH RESPECT TO YOUR USE OF ICONTACT'S ON DEMAND SOFTWARE AND SERVICES AND APPLICATIONS (THE "<strong>SERVICES</strong>").  BY USING THE SERVICES, YOU AGREE TO BE BOUND BY EACH OF THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS SET FORTH HEREIN. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS, YOU WILL NOT BE ALLOWED TO USE THE SERVICES.</p>

				<ol>
					<li><strong>Services</strong>. The Services assist customers to distribute electronically customer-created content to customers' lists of subscribers, each of whom must have consented previously to the receipt of such content ("<strong>Recipients</strong>"). While Customer retains iContact to assist with the transmittal of content to its Recipients, Customer acknowledges that iContact does not actually send Customer content to Recipients on Customer's behalf. The Services comprise primarily of a web-based technology platform through which such content is delivered once Customer sends such content. Among other things, iContact provides customer support and formatting assistance for the electronic content Customer desires to distribute. In all cases, iContact simply acts as agent for Customer with its authorization. Customer agrees that the Services are used only for Customer's business purposes. If Customer does not intend to use the Services for business purposes, Customer must contact us at <a href="mailto:customercare@icontact.com" title="customercare@icontact.com">customercare@icontact.com</a>.</li>

					<li><strong>Site and Policies</strong>. During the Term (as defined below) and subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein and in any guidelines, rules or operating policies that iContact may establish and post from time to time on <a href="http://www.icontact.com" title="iContact - Email Marketing Made Simple">www.icontact.com</a> (the "<strong>Site</strong>"), including, without limitation, iContact's anti-spam policy, privacy policy and prohibited content and commerce statement, each of which is incorporated herein by reference (collectively, the "<strong>Policies</strong>"), iContact agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts to provide Customer with the Services. From time to time, iContact may modify the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement and/or in the Policies. All such changes shall become effective once posted on the Site, and Customer's use of the Services thereafter shall be subject thereto. In the event of any conflict between any term or condition set forth in this Agreement and in a Policy, the former shall govern. Customer agrees that its purchase of the Services is neither contingent upon the delivery of any future functionality or features, nor is it dependent upon any oral or written comments made by iContact with respect to future functionality or features.</li>

					<li><strong>Professional Services</strong>. In addition to the Services, Customer may purchase certain premium services by making its selection therefor in accordance with the instructions posted at <a href="http://www.icontactplus.com" title="iContactPlus">www.icontactplus.com</a> (the "<strong>Professional Services</strong>"), which Professional Services may be customized pursuant to a mutually agreed upon written statement of work provided to Customer upon the earlier of its request or its selection of desired Professional Services (each, a "<strong>Statement of Work</strong>"). The Professional Services are provided by iContact separate and distinct from the Services and are not required for Customer's use or enjoyment of the Services. In the event of any conflict between any term or condition set forth in this Agreement and in a Statement of Work, the terms and conditions of this Agreement shall govern, unless the parties expressly agree otherwise in such Statement of Work. Any Statement of Work may be modified or amended only with the written consent of each of iContact and Customer.</li>

					<li><strong>Free Trial Period</strong>. In the event Customer elects to use the Services on a trial basis, Customer will not be billed for such use for a period equal to thirty (30) days or, if a different number of days are posted on the landing page through which Customer subscribes to use the Services, that different number of days, beginning on the date on which Customer first subscribes to use the Services and indicates its agreement with the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement (the "<strong>Trial Period</strong>"). During the Trial Period, Customer's subscriber level limit may not exceed 100 Recipients and Customer's monthly email send limit may not exceed four (4) times the number of permitted Recipients (i.e., 400 emails per month), unless a higher subscriber level and/or a higher monthly email send limit are posted on the landing page through which Customer subscribes to use the Services. The subscriber level and email send limits for the Trial Period are subject to change at any time. Once Customer completes its free trial period or exceeds any such limit (even if Customer manually removes names from its Recipient list), whichever occurs first, the Trial Period will terminate. Upon such termination, Customer may purchase a monthly or annual subscription for the Services. Customer's access to the Services will be disabled until payment therefor is received. iContact reserves the sole and exclusive right to modify the duration of the Trial Period.</li>

					<li><strong>iContact Free Edition</strong>. If Customer subscribes to use the Services through a free customer account ("<strong>iContact Free Edition</strong>"), Customer's use of the Services will be subject to the terms, conditions and restrictions (including subscriber level limits) set forth herein and posted on the landing page through which Customer subscribes to iContact Free Edition. If Customer exceeds any such limit (even if Customer manually removes names from its Recipient list), its access to the Services may be disabled. In such event, Customer may purchase a monthly or annual subscription for the Services. Customer's access to the Services will be disabled until payment therefor is received. iContact reserves the sole and exclusive right to modify any of these terms, conditions and restrictions. All such modifications shall become effective once posted on the Site. Customer acknowledges and understands that its use of the Service through iContact Free Edition may be limited in terms of functionality, features and support as compared with the Services provided through iContact's standard paid customer accounts. Customer may upgrade from iContact Free Edition to a standard paid customer account at any time.</li>

					<li><strong>Purchase</strong>. Pricing for the Services is based upon the subscriber level Customer chooses to purchase as indicated on the landing page through which Customer subscribes to use the Service or in a negotiated sales order, as the case may be (in either case, the "<strong>Sales Order</strong>"). The Sales Order records Customer's subscriber level, term, subscription fee, payment method and other account information. If the number of Recipients stored in Customer's account exceeds the subscriber level set forth in the Sales Order, Customer's access to and use of the Services will be disabled until Customer: (i) reduces the number of Recipients stored in Customer's account; or (ii) upgrades its subscriber level to at least equal the number of Recipients stored in its account. Customer may upgrade (but not downgrade) Customer's subscriber level at any time during the term of this Agreement. The total number of emails per month that may be sent by Customer cannot exceed six (6) times the subscriber level limit. For example, if Customer's subscriber level limit is 100,000, Customer can send up to 600,000 emails per month. If Customer requires a sending limit higher than six (6) times Customer's subscriber level limit per month, Customer should contact iContact's sales group at <a href="mailto:sales@icontact.com" title="mailto:sales@icontact.com">sales@icontact.com</a> or 866-775-4254.</li>

					<li><strong>Fees and Payment</strong>. In consideration for the Services to be provided by iContact (other than through iContact Free Edition), Customer agrees to pay the monthly subscription fees set forth in the Sales Order (the "<strong>Subscription Fees</strong>"). Paid Subscription Fees are non-refundable. Customer acknowledges that from time to time, delivery of email messages sent using the Services may be blocked or prevented at destination email servers. Customer's payment obligation set forth herein continues regardless of whether delivery of such email messages is prevented or blocked. In consideration for the Professional Services to be provided by iContact, if any, Customer agrees to pay the fees posted at <a href="http://www.icontactplus.com" title="iContactPlus">www.icontactplus.com</a>, set forth in the Statement of Work or as otherwise provided to Customer by iContact, (the "<strong>Professional Fees</strong>," together with the Subscription Fees, the "<strong>Fees</strong>"). All Fees are exclusive of taxes, levies, or duties imposed by taxing authorities.  Unless collected and remitted by iContact, Customer is responsible for payment of all taxes due to a governmental authority, if any, except for taxes imposed on iContact's net income.  Customer shall provide to iContact any certificate of exemption or similar document required to exempt any transaction under this Agreement from sales tax or other tax liability.  Payments for Fees and reimbursements for expenses, if any, will be billed monthly and will be due immediately upon receipt of invoice; or may be pre-paid in advance; or otherwise may be paid pursuant to the terms set forth in the Sales Order. If Customer is paying for the Services with a credit card, Customer hereby authorizes iContact to charge such credit card for Fees on a regular basis until such time as Customer's account is terminated.  If Customer is paying for the Services by credit card and such credit card is declined, iContact will send Customer notice thereof to Customer's email address on record. If Customer misses a payment, iContact may notify Customer by phone or mail, but has no obligation to do so. Any payment due and not received by iContact by the due date may be subject, at iContact's sole discretion, to a late fee equal to 1.5% (or the maximum rate permitted by law) of the amount then due, for each month overdue until paid in full. In the event Customer fails to make timely payments when due, iContact may, at its election, discontinue, terminate or suspend the Services, without incurring any liability to Customer. Despite any such discontinuation or suspension, Customer acknowledges and agrees that it will be required to pay the Fees until this Agreement is terminated in accordance with the termination provisions set forth herein. For amounts outstanding after ninety (90) days from its receipt of the invoice therefor, Customer shall be responsible for and agrees to pay reasonable costs and expenses of collection, including, but not limited to, court and attorneys' fees and expenses. From time to time, and at any time, iContact may require reasonable credit guarantees before continuing its provision of the Services or the Professional Services hereunder.  </li>

					<li><strong>Customer's Recipient Data</strong>. In offering the Services, we may collect personal information about Recipients. iContact will not own any data, information or material that Customer submits to iContact in connection with the Services ("<strong>Customer Recipient Data</strong>").  Customer is solely responsible for the accuracy, quality, integrity, legality, reliability, and appropriateness of all Customer Recipient Data, and Customer is responsible for maintaining, securing and storing all Customer Recipient Data in accordance with applicable law. Upon any termination or expiration of this Agreement and Customer's payment of all unpaid and outstanding Fees, and Customer's written request received by iContact within thirty (30) days of such expiration or termination, iContact will provide Customer with an electronic file of the Customer Recipient Data. Customer acknowledges and agrees that after the thirtieth (30th) day following any such termination or expiration, iContact has no obligation to retain the Customer Recipient Data and may delete and destroy such Customer Recipient Data without providing Customer with notice of such deletion. If Customer uses the Services during a Trial Period and fails to convert its account to iContact Free Edition or a standard paid customer account upon the expiration or other termination thereof, iContact has no obligation to retain the Customer Recipient Data after the date of such expiration or termination. If Customer uses the Services through iContact Free Edition and fails to use the Services for at least sixty (60) consecutive days, as of the sixty-first (61st) day after Customer's last use of the Services, Customer acknowledges and agrees that iContact has no obligation to retain the Customer Recipient Data and may delete and destroy such data without providing Customer with notice of such deletion. iContact will not be responsible or liable for the deletion, correction, destruction, damage, loss or failure to store any Customer Recipient Data.</li>

					<li><strong>Customer Information</strong>. iContact collects certain personal and business-related information about its Customers, which generally includes, but is not limited to, contact information and payment information (the "<strong>Customer Information</strong>"). iContact collects such information in order to provide the Services or the Professional Services, as the case may be, and related technical support. If you have provided your Customer Information, iContact may contact you for marketing purposes by various means, including, but not limited to, regular mail, email or telephone. When you activate an iContact account (including during the Trial Period), you expressly consent to receive marketing communications via direct mail, email (at the email address you provided when you activated your account), telephone (at the number you provided when you activated your account), pre-recorded messages (at the number you provided when you activated your account), text messages (if you provided a wireless telephone number), instant messages or other communications methods. </li>

					<li><strong>Data Disclosures</strong>. Except as otherwise set forth herein, iContact does not disclose, sell or rent Customer Recipient Data or Customer Information (collectively, the "Data"), without Customer's prior consent or unless required by order or other requirement of a court, administrative agency, or other governmental body or applicable law. Customer expressly permits iContact to disclose the Data to: (i) iContact personnel who access and manage the Data in connection with the Services; (ii) service providers for purposes of providing functions or services related to the Services and iContact's customers' accounts; and (iii) iContact marketing partners through which Customer purchased the Services, if any. Except as otherwise set forth herein, iContact will not provide any Data to any third party without Customer's authorization and will use commercially reasonable efforts to prohibit any third party that receives any such Data from selling or redistributing such Data without Customer's authorization.</li>

					<li><strong>Passwords</strong>. In connection with iContact's provision of the Services, iContact will send to Customer's email address (as designated by Customer at the time an account is established), information such as user-IDs and/or passwords which will enable Customer to access the Services (the "<strong>Passwords</strong>"). Customer agrees to maintain the Passwords in strict confidence and not to provide the Passwords to any third party. Customer will notify iContact promptly if there is a loss or compromise of any Passwords and Customer will be solely responsible for all actions and fees incurred as a result of such incident resulting from the Customer's negligence or intentional misconduct. Any unauthorized use of the Passwords by Customer will constitute a material breach of this Agreement.</li>

					<li><strong>Proprietary Rights</strong>. This is an agreement for services and Customer is not granted any license hereunder. All software embedded in the Services, the Professional Services, and in any applications developed, owned or controlled by iContact (as applicable) (the "<strong>Software</strong>"), and the Services, are and shall remain the sole and exclusive property of iContact. Accordingly, Customer acknowledges that, as between iContact and Customer, iContact owns all right, title and interest in and to the Software and the Services, including, without limitation, all United States and international patent rights, copyrights, trademark rights, trade secret rights, and all other proprietary rights pertaining thereto. Except as expressly granted in this Agreement, Customer will not have or acquire any rights or interest in or to the Software or the Services. Customer acknowledges that the Software contains proprietary information and trade secrets of iContact. Customer will not take any actions inconsistent with iContact's ownership of each of iContact's rights in and to the Software. Customer agrees that Customer will not directly or indirectly: (i) assign, distribute, license, sublicense, transfer, sell, rent, lease, time share, grant a security interest in, or otherwise transfer any rights in or to the Software, or make the Software available to third parties except as authorized by this Agreement; (ii) modify, translate, reverse engineer, decompile or disassemble the Software for any purpose, including, without limitation, the creation of derivative works or similar products; (iii) upload, link to or post any portion of the Software on a bulletin board, intranet, extranet or web site; (iv) use or distribute the Software in violation of any applicable laws, regulations or export restrictions; or (v) possess or use the Software in any format other than machine-readable format. All rights in the Software not explicitly granted herein, are reserved by iContact. If you are using the Services in any country within the European Union, the prohibitions set forth herein will not affect your rights under any legislation implementing the E.C. Council Directive on the Legal Protection of Computer Programs.</li>

					<li><strong>Use of Services</strong>.  Customer acknowledges and agrees that it will use the Services (and the Professional Services as the case may be) only to access, employ, utilize, or display the Software solely for Customer's "<strong>internal business purposes</strong>" by Customer's employees or by independent contractors hired by Customer. For the avoidance of doubt, the term "internal business purposes," as used herein, does not include, among other things, the right to: (i) send spam or otherwise duplicative or unsolicited messages in violation of applicable laws; (ii) send or store infringing, obscene, threatening, harassing, libelous, or otherwise unlawful or tortuous material, including material harmful to children or violative of third party privacy rights; (iii) send messages to any purchased (email) lists, purchased distribution lists, purchased newsgroups, or purchased email addresses; (iv) send or store material containing malicious code, including, without limitation, software viruses, worms, Trojan horses or other harmful computer code, files, scripts, agents or programs; or (v) use the Services (and the Professional Services as the case may be) in any other manner which violates any Policy or any applicable law. Customer agrees to report immediately to iContact, and to use best efforts to stop immediately, any violation of the terms and conditions set forth in this Section 13 or in any of the Policies. In the event of any suspected violation of any term, condition or restriction set forth in this Section 13 or in any Policy, or in the event iContact otherwise reasonably objects to any inappropriate or improper content uploaded by Customer in connection with its use of the Service, iContact may immediately disable Customer's access to the Services and suspend its provision thereof.</li>

					<li><strong>No Tampering</strong>.  Each email message that is sent using the Services must contain an "unsubscribe" link that allows Recipients to remove themselves from Customer's mailing list and a link to iContact's Policies. Customer agrees that it will not remove, disable, modify or attempt to remove, disable or modify either link. Further, each such email message may contain an automatic identifying footer such as "Powered by iContact." Except as otherwise expressly permitted in writing by iContact, Customer agrees that it will not remove, disable or modify or attempt to remove, disable or modify such footer. </li>

					<li><strong>Confidential Information</strong>.  Each of iContact and Customer, as a Receiving Party (as defined below), will hold confidential, not use except as otherwise authorized herein, and protect from disclosure to unauthorized third parties the Confidential Information (as defined below) of the Disclosing Party (as defined below). For purposes hereof, "<strong>Confidential Information</strong>" means any information disclosed by one party (the "<strong>Disclosing Party</strong>") to the other party (the "<strong>Receiving Party</strong>") that relates to such Disclosing Party's business affairs, internal operations, personnel, subscribers, customers, financial matters, technology, research and development, product plans or offerings, markets, or know-how. Confidential Information will not include information that: (i) was publicly available, or that subsequently becomes publicly available, except by wrongful disclosure hereunder by the Receiving Party; (ii) was in the Receiving Party's possession prior to receipt of the same hereunder, as evidenced by the Receiving Party's prior written records; (iii) was received from a third party who was not known by the Receiving Party to be under any obligation of confidentiality with respect to such information or to have violated any applicable law; (iv) can be proven by competent written evidence to have been independently developed by the Receiving Party; or (v) is approved in writing for release by the Disclosing Party. For purposes hereof, Customer Recipient Data and Customer Information are considered Customer's Confidential Information. Nothing set forth herein shall be construed to prohibit iContact from disclosing Customer's Confidential Information to any third party that has a need to know such information in connection with its performance of the Services. From time to time, iContact may be required to disclose Customer's Confidential Information by order or other requirement of a court, administrative agency, or other governmental body or applicable law, as determined by iContact or its legal counsel. In such event, Customer hereby permits iContact to disclose such information to the extent necessary to comply with such order or legal requirement, which disclosure shall not be construed as a breach of this Section 15.</li>

					<li><strong>Representations, Warranties and Covenants</strong>. Customer represents, warrants and covenants to iContact that: (i) if an individual, Customer is at least eighteen (18) years old; (ii) if an entity, it is a company duly organized and validly existing in good standing under the laws of the state in which it was organized; (iii) it has full power and authority to enter into this Agreement, which constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation enforceable against it in accordance with the terms hereof; (iv) all information provided by it in the Sales Order and that will be provided it during the term of this Agreement, is and will be truthful and accurate; (v) its use of the Customer Recipient Data, the Services and the Professional Services, including, without limitation, its right to email Recipients, is and will at all times be in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, the Policies and all applicable laws, rules and regulations, and without infringement or misappropriation of any intellectual property right or other right of a third party; (vi) it is not directly or indirectly (as an owner, strategic partner or otherwise) engaged in any business relationship or activity that competes with the Services; and (vii) neither Customer nor any of its officers, directors or personnel is located in a United States embargoed country, or is, or has been, named on the United States Treasury Department's listing of specially designated nationals and blocked persons or is, or has been, otherwise blacklisted by any instrumentality of the United States.</li>

					<li><strong>Third Party Products and Services</strong>.  From time to time, certain third parties may offer products and services related to the Services (and the Professional Services, as applicable). Any subsequent business relationship, exchange of data or other interaction between Customer and such a third party, and/or any purchase, download or use by Customer of any product or service offered by such third party, is solely between Customer and such third party. Regardless of any recommendation by iContact or use of such third party products or services, iContact does not make any representations, warranties or guarantees with respect to any such third parties or any of their products or services. While iContact may rely on data or information provided or generated by such third party products and services in the course of providing the Services (and the Professional Services, as applicable), Customer hereby acknowledges that iContact specifically does not warrant the accuracy, reliability or completeness of any such data and information; and agrees that iContact shall not be liable for any acts or omissions based on its reliance thereon. Accordingly, Customer hereby releases and holds harmless iContact from and against any and all claims, losses, liability, damages, expenses, costs (including, but not limited to, reasonable attorneys' fees) and/or actions arising therefrom.  </li>

					<li><strong>Open Source Software</strong>. Customer acknowledges and understands that certain open source code may be incorporated into the Service (the "<strong>Source Code</strong>").

					<li><strong>Disclaimer of Warranties</strong>. THE SERVICES (AND THE PROFESSIONAL SERVICES, AS APPLICABLE) ARE PROVIDED "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" AND WITHOUT REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY OF ANY KIND. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, iCONTACT AND ITS AFFILIATES, RESELLERS, DISTRIBUTORS, AGENTS, DEALERS AND SUPPLIERS (COLLECTIVELY, THE "REPRESENTATIVES") DISCLAIM ANY AND ALL REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES, WHETHER ORAL OR WRITTEN, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING (WITHOUT LIMITATION) ANY WARRANTY AS TO MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR USE, TITLE, OR NON-INFRINGEMENT, WITH RESPECT TO THE SERVICES OR THE PROFESSIONAL SERVICES. THE REPRESENTATIVES DO NOT WARRANT THAT THE SERVICES OR THE PROFESSIONAL SERVICES WILL MEET CUSTOMER'S REQUIREMENTS NOR DO THEY GIVE ANY WARRANTY ABOUT THE RESULTS THAT MAY BE OBTAINED BY USING THE SERVICES OR THE PROFESSIONAL SERVICES.</li>

					<li><strong>Limitation of Liability</strong>. IN NO EVENT WILL iCONTACT OR ANY REPRESENTATIVE BE LIABLE TO CUSTOMER OR ANY OTHER PARTY FOR ANY SPECIAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, EXEMPLARY, CONSEQUENTIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES ARISING FROM OR RELATED TO THE SERVICES (OR THE PROFESSIONAL SERVICES, IF APPLICABLE), OR TO THIS AGREEMENT, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF DATA, LOSS OF USE, OR LOSS OF PROFITS, EVEN IF iCONTACT OR ITS REPRESENTATIVE HAS BEEN ADVISED IN ADVANCE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSS OR DAMAGES. FURTHER, IN NO EVENT WILL iCONTACT OR ANY REPRESENTATIVE'S TOTAL CUMULATIVE LIABILITY TO CUSTOMER OR ANY OTHER PARTY FOR CLAIMS, LOSSES, OR DAMAGES OF ANY KIND, WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT, NEGLIGENCE, INDEMNITY OR OTHERWISE, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED IN ANY WAY TO THIS AGREEMENT, THE SERVICES, OR THE PROFESSIONAL SERVICES, EXCEED THE ACTUAL FEES CUSTOMER PAID TO iCONTACT FOR THE SERVICES DURING THE TWELVE (12) MONTH PERIOD ENDING ON THE DATE OF THE CAUSE OF ACTION GIVING RISE TO THE CLAIM, LOSS, OR DAMAGE. No claim may be asserted by Customer against iContact more than twelve (12) months after the date of the cause of action underlying such claim. In the event of any failure, or iContact's non-provision, of the Services (or the Professional Services as the case may be), Customer's sole and exclusive remedy shall be for iContact to use commercially reasonable efforts to repair or provide the Services (or the Professional Services as the case may be).</li>

					<li><strong>Indemnification</strong>. Customer agrees to indemnify, defend and hold harmless iContact, the Representatives, and its and their respective affiliates, subsidiaries, officers, directors, stockholders, employees, consultants, representatives, agents, successors and assigns from and against any and all claims, losses, liabilities, sums of money, damages, expenses, costs (including, but not limited to, reasonable attorneys' fees) and/or actions arising from: (i) Customer's acts or omissions; (ii) Customer's violation of any applicable law, including, without limitation, the United States CAN SPAM Act and Canada's Fighting Internet and Wireless Spam Act, or the Policies; (iii) Customer's breach of any term or condition set forth in this Agreement (including in the Policies); (iv) Customer's breach of any of its representations or warranties set forth herein; and/or (v) Customer's infringement or misappropriation of any intellectual property rights or other rights of any person or entity.</li>

					<li><strong>Term and Termination</strong>. The Sales Order determines the initial term (the "<strong>Initial Term</strong>") of your Agreement.  Upon expiration of the Initial Term, this Agreement will automatically renew for successive terms equal to the same period of time as the Initial Term (each, a "Successive Term," together with the Initial Term, the "<strong>Term</strong>"), and you will continue to be billed for the Fees until this Agreement is terminated in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth herein. At any time during the Term, either Customer or iContact may terminate this Agreement for any reason. If Customer desires to terminate this Agreement, Customer may request a termination by calling iContact at 866-936-5680, Monday through Friday, between the hours of 8:00 a.m. (EST) and 12:00 a.m. (EST) (a "<strong>Valid Termination Notice</strong>").  Customer acknowledges that allowing a credit card to expire or failing to submit payment by check does not constitute a Valid Termination Notice. Any Customer termination request that occurs in the middle of a payment term (whether monthly, quarterly or annually, as set forth in the Sales Order) will be made effective on the final day of such term. If Customer wishes to terminate only the Professional Services, it should contact its account manager prior to such services being performed. iContact may terminate this Agreement immediately effective upon delivery to Customer of notice thereof. Such right to terminate this Agreement shall include iContact's right to terminate its provision of the Services and/or the Professional Services (as applicable) and to pursue all available equitable and legal remedies (in the event Customer breaches any term or condition, or any of its representations or warranties set forth herein). Upon termination of this Agreement for any reason, all Customer Recipient Data may be destroyed and deleted in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth in Section 8 above. Notwithstanding any termination or expiration of this Agreement, Customer will remain obligated to pay iContact Fees which were incurred prior to (and on) the effective date of such termination or expiration, as the case may be. </li>

This Agreement will be governed by the laws of the State of North Carolina as applied to agreements entered into and performed entirely within the State of North Carolina, except for those conflicts of law rules thereof that would require or permit the application of the laws of another jurisdiction. The rights and obligations of the parties under this Agreement shall not be governed by the provisions of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods.</li>

					<li><strong>Arbitration</strong>. Any dispute or controversy arising under, out of, or in connection with this Agreement shall be resolved by binding arbitration under the commercial rules of the American Arbitration Association before a single arbitrator. Any such arbitration shall be conducted in Raleigh, North Carolina. Judgment upon any award may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. The arbitrator shall be designated by mutual agreement of the parties or, if the parties cannot agree on an arbitrator within ten (10) days after a request for arbitration hereunder, each party shall designate one (1) arbitrator and the arbitrators so designated shall designate a third arbitrator who shall conduct the arbitration. The decision of the arbitrator shall be binding and conclusive upon the parties.

At any time prior to, or during, its use of the Services, Customer may enter into certain other agreements with iContact which are subject, expressly or otherwise, to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement. In the event of any conflict between a term or condition set forth therein and herein, the term or condition which most favors iContact, as determined by iContact, shall govern.</li>

					<li><strong>No Waivers</strong>. iContact's failure to exercise any of its rights under this Agreement will not constitute or be deemed to constitute a waiver or forfeiture of such rights or of any preceding or subsequent breach or default.</li>

					<li><strong>Notice</strong>.  iContact may provide Customer with general notice by electronic mail to Customer's e-mail address of record, or by written communication sent by first class mail or pre-paid post to Customer's address of record, or to such other address designated by Customer and communicated to iContact in accordance with the notice delivery provisions of this Section 31.

				<a name="affiliate"></a><h2>Affiliate Agreement</h2>
				<p>Effective Date:  March 27, 2012</p>
				<p>PLEASE REVIEW THIS AFFILIATE AGREEMENT (THIS "AGREEMENT") AS IT CONSTITUTES A LEGAL AGREEMENT BY AND BETWEEN ICONTACT LLC ("iCONTACT") AND YOU ("AFFILIATE"), TO BE EFFECTIVE ON THE DATE YOU SUBSCRIBE TO AN ICONTACT CUSTOMER ACCOUNT (THE "EFFECTIVE DATE"). BY USING THE SERVICES (AS DEFINED IN ICONTACT'S END USER SERVICES AGREEMENT (THE "EUSA"), YOU AGREE TO BE BOUND BY EACH OF THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS SET FORTH HEREIN. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH ALL OF THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, YOU WILL NOT BE ALLOWED TO USE THE SERVICES.</p>
				<p>iContact is the licensed provider of iContact email marketing and list management software (the "Software"). Affiliate wishes to promote the Software via a landing page pursuant to the terms and conditions set forth herein.</p>
				<p>NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing, the mutual covenants and agreements contained herein, and of other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto, intending to be legally bound, agree as follows:</p>
				<ol>
					<li><strong>Appointment</strong>: Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, iContact hereby appoints Affiliate, and Affiliate hereby accepts such appointment, to promote and market the Software in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth herein, with the intention of referring to iContact each month unique and bona fide subscribers for the use of the Software (each, an "iContact Customer").</li>

					<li><strong>Affiliate Landing Page</strong>:  Within thirty (30) days after the Effective Date, unless otherwise agreed by iContact in writing, iContact will create and maintain during the Term (as defined below) for Affiliate a landing page upon which iContact's Marks (as defined below) will be displayed prominently. This landing page will be coded with an Affiliate ID # so that all transactions and sales from iContact Customers can be tracked and correctly applied and credited to Affiliate's account. Once a visitor to such page becomes an iContact Customer, an Affiliate ID # will be hard coded to such iContact Customer's account, through which Affiliate's account will be credited for every payment made by such iContact Customer. At any time during the Term, Affiliate may log onto Affiliate's account and use the link found within the 'Partner Central' section to track total number of iContact customers and commissions for each month.</li>

					<li><strong>Licenses</strong>:  In connection with each party's performance of its obligations set forth herein, each party (in such capacity, the "Licensor") : (i) represents and warrants to the other party (in such capacity, the "Licensee") that it is the sole and exclusive owner of any trade names, trademarks, service marks, "d/b/a"s, names, URLs, or logos (collectively, the "Marks") that Licensor provides to Licensee hereunder, and that such provision will not violate or otherwise infringe upon any intellectual property or other rights of any third party; and (ii) hereby grants to Licensee a limited, nonexclusive, royalty-free license to use Licensor's Marks during the Term in connection with the performance of Licensee's obligations hereunder. Licensee hereby agrees not to: (x) alter or otherwise modify any of Licensor's Marks; (y) attack ownership of, or rights to, any of Licensor's Marks; or (z) intentionally use the Licensor's Marks in a way that might deceive others, create a likelihood of confusion or destroy or diminish the goodwill in any of the Licensor's Marks.</li>

					<li><strong>Term and Termination</strong>: This Agreement shall commence on the Effective Date, and shall continue until terminated by iContact, by providing Affiliate with prior written notice of its intention to so terminate; or by Affiliate, by providing iContact with fifteen (15) days' prior written notice of its intention to so terminate (the "Term"). Upon any termination of this Agreement, the licenses granted in Section 3 above shall terminate effective immediately as of the date of such termination. Notwithstanding any such termination, the terms and conditions set forth in Sections 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 14 and 18 hereof shall survive; provided, however, that if this Agreement is terminated by iContact due to Affiliate's breach of any term or condition set forth in this Agreement or of any of Affiliate's representations and warranties set forth herein, as determined by iContact in its sole discretion, Affiliate shall not be entitled to any commission payments arising pursuant to Section 5 below after the date of such breach.</li>

					<li><strong>Commission</strong>: During the Term, iContact agrees to pay Affiliate a commission equal to: (i) fifteen percent (15%) of all Revenue (as defined below) actually received from each iContact Customer referred to iContact by Affiliate; and (ii) five percent (5%) of all Revenue generated by affiliates referred to iContact by Affiliate, which enter into affiliate agreements with iContact substantially similar to this Agreement (each, a "Second Tier Affiliate"); provided, however, that: (A) for iContact Customers which iContact determines, in its sole discretion, are iContact for Salesforce or Agency customers, iContact will not pay Affiliate any commission; (B) for iContact Customers which iContact determines, in its sole discretion, are enterprise, large sender, or managed account customers, iContact agrees to pay Affiliate a commission equal to ten percent (10%) of all Revenue (as defined below) actually received from each iContact Customer referred to iContact by Affiliate; and (C) iContact will pay Reseller a monthly commission of no more than $175 for each iContact Customer. Except as otherwise set forth in Section 4 above, Affiliate will continue to receive the commission payments described in this Section 5 for the life of each iContact Customer in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth herein. Commission payments will be based on Revenue actually received by iContact from iContact Customers in a calendar month, as calculated on the first day of the immediately subsequent calendar month (the "Month of Payment"), and will be mailed to Affiliate no later than the fifteenth (15th) day of the Month of Payment, by check made payable to Affiliate. Such payments will be made after Affiliate's cumulative commissions exceed $30.00 (or in the case of non-U.S.-based Affiliate, such payments will be made after cumulative commissions exceed US$100.00). For purposes hereof, "Revenue" means gross revenue actually received by iContact from each iContact Customer minus any refunds, rebates, setoffs, discounts, promotions, charge backs, non-payments, or defaults, any of which may be set-off against amounts already paid to Affiliate.</li>

					<li><strong>Marketing Materials</strong>: During the Term, Affiliate may use graphics, text, and sample promotions provided in Affiliate Central to promote the Software. Affiliate may not use unsolicited commercial email to promote the Software, which includes mass emails sent to recipients who have not requested it (not opted-in) and with whom Affiliate has no prior relationship, and any other definition of "spam" as defined under applicable law. Any such use will be considered a material breach of this Agreement and will result in the termination of this Agreement in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth in the last sentence of Section 4 above.</li>

					<li><strong>iContact Pricing and Customer</strong>: iContact reserves the sole and exclusive right to review, modify or change its posted pricing, and to accept, reject, suspend or terminate service to any iContact Customer or prospect, at any time and without regard to, limitation from, or restriction by Affiliate or any of the terms or conditions set forth herein.</li>

					<li><strong>Disclaimer of Warranty</strong>: THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" WITHOUT REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY OF ANY KIND. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, iCONTACT AND ITS AFFILIATES, LICENSORS, DISTRIBUTORS, DEALERS AND SUPPLIERS (COLLECTIVELY, THE "REPRESENTATIVES") DISCLAIM ANY AND ALL REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES, WHETHER ORAL OR WRITTEN, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING (WITHOUT LIMITATION) ANY WARRANTY AS TO MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR USE, TITLE, OR NON-INFRINGEMENT WITH RESPECT TO THE SOFTWARE AND THIS AGREEMENT. iCONTACT AND THE REPRESENTATIVES DO NOT WARRANT THAT THE SOFTWARE WILL MEET iCONTACT CUSTOMER'S REQUIREMENTS NOR DO THEY GIVE ANY WARRANTY ABOUT THE RESULTS THAT MAY BE OBTAINED BY USING THE SOFTWARE.</li>

					<li><strong>Affiliate's Representations, Warranties and Covenants</strong>: Affiliate represents and warrants to iContact that: (i) in connection with the appointment described herein, Affiliate will at all times comply with all applicable laws; (ii) Affiliate will at all times present the Software to potential customers, accurately, fairly and truthfully and will not make any misleading, unfair or deceptive statements about iContact or the Software, or misrepresent either in any way; (iii) Affiliate will not disparage iContact or the Software during the Term or at any time after the termination thereof; (iv) Affiliate will do all things reasonable to promote the good reputation of iContact and the Software; (v) Affiliate's execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement will not result in any violation of any other agreement or arrangement; and (vi) none of the Affiliate's Marks will violate or infringe upon the intellectual property, or other rights, of any third party.</li>

					<li><strong>Limited Liability</strong>:  In no event will iContact be liable to Affiliate or iContact Customers for any special, direct, indirect, incidental, exemplary, consequential or punitive damages arising from or related to the Software or this Agreement, including, but not limited to, damages for losses of profits, loss of business or goodwill, loss of data or use of data, interruption of business, even if iContact was advised in advance of the possibility of such losses or damages. iContact's total cumulative liability to Affiliate or to any other party for claims, losses or damages of any kind, whether based on contract, tort, negligence or otherwise, arising out of or related in any way to this Agreement or the Software will not exceed the commission actually paid to Affiliate in the calendar month immediately preceding the month in which such claim, loss or damage arose. iContact is not, and will not be, responsible or liable for any downtime or failure of performance or slowdown in deliverability that may occur from time to time.</li>

					<li><strong>Entire Agreement</strong>: This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement of the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof, and supersedes all previous proposals, oral or written, and all negotiations, conversations of discussion heretofore and between the parties related to this Agreement. Each party acknowledges that it has not been induced to enter into this Agreement by any representation or statements, oral or written, not expressly contained herein.</li>

					<li><strong>Governing Law</strong>:  This Agreement shall be governed by, and enforced in accordance with, the laws of the State of North Carolina, without regards to its conflicts of law provisions. Both parties hereto irrevocably consent to the jurisdiction of the state and federal courts located in Wake County, North Carolina.</li>

					<li><strong>Relationship of the Parties</strong>:  Although references are made in this Agreement to the term "Affiliate," the parties do not intend to create a partnership or joint venture in the legal sense, but only a referral relationship. The parties agree that they are independent contractors and that neither of them has any fiduciary duty to the other. Neither party is the agent of the other. Neither party may represent to any person that it has the power to bind the other party on any service contract or other agreement, or take any action reasonably likely to lead a third party to believe that it is the agent or representative of the other party.</li>

					<li><strong>Indemnification</strong>:  Affiliate hereby agrees to indemnify, defend and hold harmless iContact, and its officers, directors, stockholders, employees, agents, successors and assigns (the "Indemnified Parties") from and against any and all liabilities, losses, damages, claims, suits, judgments, costs, expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees and costs of any investigation or action related thereto) and actions suffered or incurred by the Indemnified Parties as a result of: (i) Affiliate's performance, failure to perform or improper performance of this Agreement; (ii) Affiliate's material breach of any of its representations or warranties set forth herein, or any term or condition set forth in this Agreement; (iii) the Indemnified Parties' use of Affiliate's Marks in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth herein; or (iv) Affiliate's acts, omissions or intentional misconduct.</li>

					<li><strong>Assignment and Binding Effect</strong>:  Affiliate may not assign this Agreement without first seeking and obtaining iContact's prior written consent. All assignments in violation of this restriction set forth in this Section 15 shall be considered null, void and of no legal effect. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective permitted successors and assigns.</li>

					<li><strong>Waiver</strong>:  No waiver by iContact of any provision or condition of this Agreement shall be effective unless such waiver is expressed in writing and signed by an authorized representative of iContact. iContact's failure to enforce any provision of this Agreement will not constitute a waiver of its right to subsequent enforcement of such provision or any other provision of the Agreement.</li>

					<li><strong>Amendment</strong>:  Any modification or amendment of any provision of this Agreement must be made in writing and signed by an authorized representative of each party.</li>

					<li><strong>Other Agreements</strong>:  Affiliate has entered into certain other agreements with iContact, including, without limitation, the EUSA (the "Other Agreements"). While each of the Other Agreements constitutes a separate legal agreement between the parties, such agreements may address subject matter related to this Agreement. In the event of any conflict between any term or condition set forth in this Agreement and in any of the Other Agreements, the term or condition which most favors iContact, as determined in iContact's sole discretion, shall prevail.</li>
