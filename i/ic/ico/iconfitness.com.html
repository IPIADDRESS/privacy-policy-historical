Privacy refers to information that we at ICON Health &amp; Fitness, Inc. ("ICON"), owner of this site, gather about you and the use that we make of it in the course of our business.<br><br>
ICON collects personally identifying information only during contests, sweepstakes and site membership registration. In addition, information is collected in certain portions of the site in which guests specifically and knowingly provide such information along with content submissions, community postings (i.e., chat or bulletin boards), suggestions, or voting. ICON may use such information for editorial and feedback purposes (to the extent that is explained when guests provide the information). In the event ICON plans to post any such information on a site, guests are provided prior notification of such posting and can decline from having such information posted.<br><br>
