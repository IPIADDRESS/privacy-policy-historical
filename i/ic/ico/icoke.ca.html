<strong>Disclosure of your Personal Information </strong><br>
Personal information will not be used or disclosed for purposes other than those for which it was collected, except with your consent or as required or permitted by law or this Policy.

<p>
Coca-Cola discloses personal information in the following circumstances: <br>
<strong>Strategic Partners:</strong> From time to time, we may enter into a special relationship with another company that is not owned by or affiliated with Coca-Cola. We may share your name, email address and zip code with such third-party strategic partners; however, we will provide you with the opportunity to either opt into or opt out of such sharing when you set up an account and when you log in after we add a new strategic partner. Because these third parties will use your personal information in accordance with their own privacy practices, you should check their websites for information regarding their privacy practices. 
</p><p>
<strong>Affiliates:</strong> If you consent, Coca-Cola may also disclose personal information to our parents, affiliates, or their authorized agents (including those located outside of Canada) so that they may provide you with information or offers relating to products or services that may be of interest to you, for internal audit, management, billing or administrative purposes, including defending and bringing legal actions. 
In addition, we may provide affiliates or unaffiliated third parties with aggregate information about visitors to our sites. For example we might disclose the median ages of visitors to our websites, or the numbers of visitors to our websites that come from different geographic areas. Such aggregate information will not include personal information of any individuals such as individual visitors to our websites. 
</p><p>
<strong>Service Providers:</strong> Coca-Cola may transfer personal information to outside agents or service providers (including to our affiliates acting in this capacity) ("service providers") that perform services on our behalf, helping us operate our business and this Site. For example, mailing, call center, marketing, information technology and/or data hosting or processing services or similar services for the purposes described in this Policy, may collect, use, disclose, store or process personal information on our behalf for the purposes described above and in this Policy.

</p><p>
<strong>Your Consent </strong><br>
Consent to the collection, use and disclosure of personal information may be given in various ways. Consent can be express (for example, by checking a box on a registration form that describes the intended uses and disclosures of personal information) or implied (for example, when you provide your telephone number so that we may respond to your inquiry). You may provide your consent in some circumstances where notice has been provided to you about our intentions with respect to your personal information and you have not withdrawn your consent for an identified purpose, such as by using an "opt out" option provided, if any. Consent may be given by your authorized representative (such as a legal guardian or a person having a power of attorney). Generally, by providing us with personal information, we will assume that you consent to our collection, use and disclosure of such information for the purposes identified or described in this Policy, if applicable, or otherwise at the time of collection. 
</p><p>
You may withdraw your consent to our collection, use and disclosure of personal information at any time, subject to contractual and legal restrictions and reasonable notice. Note that if you withdraw your consent to certain uses of your personal information, we may no longer be able to provide certain of our products or services. Note also that where we have provided or are providing goods or services to you, your consent will be valid for so long as necessary to fulfil the purposes described in this Privacy Policy or otherwise at the time of collection, and you may not be permitted to withdraw consent to certain necessary uses and disclosures (for example, but not limited to, maintaining reasonable business and transaction records, and disclosure to Canadian and foreign government entities as required to comply with laws). 
</p><p>
Coca-Cola collects, uses and discloses your personal information with your consent, except as permitted or required by law. We may be required or permitted under statute or regulation to collect, use or disclose personal information without your consent, for example to comply with a court order, to comply with local or federal regulations or a legally permitted inquiry by a government agency, or to collect a debt owed to us. </p><p>

<strong>Personal Information of Minor Children </strong><br>
<strong>Important Note to Parents </strong><br>
Several portions of our websites are dedicated to brands directed in whole or in part to kids under the age of majority. In communicating with minor children, Coca-Cola is especially mindful of the need to protect their personal privacy. 
At the present time, we do not knowingly collect personal information from kids under 13 years of age. Where appropriate, Coca-Cola will specifically instruct children not to submit personal information to our websites. 
Parents should be aware that information that is voluntarily given by children or others in chat sessions, email exchanges, bulletin boards or the like may be used by other parties to generate unsolicited email or other contacts. We encourage all parents to instruct their children on the safe and responsible use of the Internet. 
We do, however, permit minor children 13 years of age or older but under the age of majority in their home province to communicate with us by e-mail, enter contests, and register for promotions, newsletters, and other similar items. In doing so, your child will be asked to provide parental information confirming your consent for him/her to do so. 
If the parent permits a minor child's participation in a contest and the child wins, we contact the parent (not the child) for further personal information needed for any prize delivery. 
</p><p>
<strong>Important Note to Children </strong><br>
Before providing your name, address, e-mail address, or any other personal information to us, be sure to ask your parents if it's ok. 
</p><p>
