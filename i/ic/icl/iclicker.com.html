Information We Collect</strong></p>
<p>We may collect both Personally Identifiable Information and Non-Personally Identifiable Information by and through our Sites. For purposes of this Notice, “Personally Identifiable Information” means any information or combination of information that we collect or use by or through a Site that identifies you personally. “Non-Personally Identifiable Information” means information that we collect or use by or through a Site that does not identify you personally or contain direct personal identifiers about you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Personally Identifiable Information that we may collect includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>contact information, such as your first and last name, and for visitors to our catalog Sites, postal address, e-mail address and telephone number;</li>
<li>registration information such as a username, password, user ID;</li>
<li>information that personally identifies you in any content that you voluntarily provide on or through our Sites (such as through blogs, forums and discussion groups);</li>
<li>instructor educational information, such as your school name and location, course information, and the textbook or product you are using when combined with information that personally identifies you;</li>
<li>information concerning your interests and product preferences when combined with information that personally identifies you;</li>
<li>transaction information associated with any purchases made on our Sites;</li>
<li>student ID, polling responses, attendance data, participation and performance points, analytics and usage data, location and subscription information, and remote ID; and</li>
<li>Student Data (defined below)</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Student Data” is information obtained about a “Student” through the use of our Site(s) that, alone or in combination with other information, is linked or linkable to a specific student by a reasonable person. A “Student” is a student using our Site(s) at the direction of or in connection with a school, educational institution, teacher, school district, or to aid in school administration activities. For example, Student Data includes a student’s name, email address or other online contact information, student number, school test results, school biometric records, such as a video or audio recording, and indirect identifiers such as date of birth, mother’s maiden name, and search activity, when related to use of a Site in connection with or at the direction of a school, educational institution, teacher, school district, or to aid in school administration activities.</p>
<p>Non-Personally Identifiable Information that we may collect includes information about your device or internet browser, information obtained from cookies that have been placed on your device or internet browser at our Site, demographic information, aggregated information, anonymous or de-identified information about how you use our Sites, including the transactions you perform using our Sites, and other information obtained through your access to or use of a Site that does not identify you personally. We may supplement the information we collect from you with information we receive about you from other sources; if we combine this data with Student Data, it will be treated as Student Data.</p>
<p>In addition, when you visit our Sites, we may collect certain information by automated means, such as cookies and web beacons. The information we collect in this manner includes IP address, browser characteristics, device characteristics, operating system, language preference, referring URLs, information on actions taken on our Sites, and dates and times of website visits.</p>
<p>A “cookie” is a text file that websites send to a visitor’s computer or other Internet-connected device to uniquely identify the visitor’s browser or to store information or settings in the browser<u>. </u>Your browser may tell you how to be notified when you receive certain types of cookies or how to restrict or disable certain types of cookies. For more information on cookies and how to disable them, you can consult the information provided by the Interactive Advertising Bureau at <a href="http://www.allabout">www.allaboutcookies.org</a>. Please note, however, that without cookies you may not be able to use all of the features of our Sites. For more information on how we use cookies and other tracking technologies, see the <a href="#onlinetracking">Online Tracking</a> section below.</p>
<p><a name="howweuseinformationwecollect"></a><strong><br>
How We Use The Information We Collect</strong></p>

<p>Except as noted below in this section under NOTE FOR STUDENT DATA, we may use the information we collect to:</p>
<ul>

<li>perform data analyses and other processing (including market and consumer research, trend analysis and anonymization);</li>
<li>protect against, identify and prevent fraud and other criminal activity, claims and other liabilities; and</li>
<li>comply with and enforce applicable legal requirements, relevant industry standards and our policies, including the provisions of this Notice and any applicable Terms.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We use information collected online through cookies, web beacons and other automated means for purposes such as (i) recognizing your computer when you visit the Sites, (ii) tracking you as you navigate the Sites, and enabling the use of e-commerce capabilities, (iii) improving the Sites’ usability, (iv) analyzing use of the Sites, (v) managing the Sites, and (vi) personalizing the Sites. We also use this information to help diagnose technical and service problems, administer our Sites, and gather demographic information about our users.</p>
<p>We also may from time to time acquire from third parties information on individuals who may be interested in our products. We may use this information for marketing and advertising. However, we do not combine that information with Student Data.</p>
<p>We also may use the information we obtain about you in other ways for which we provide specific notice at the time of collection.</p>
<p>NOTE FOR STUDENT DATA: WE DO NOT USE STUDENT DATA TO MARKET OR ADVERTISE, EXCEPT FOR CONTEXTUAL ADVERTISING OR ADVERTISING AS OTHERWISE PERMITTED BY LAW, E.G., WITH AN ACCEPTABLE OPT-IN FROM THE STUDENT OR GUARDIAN, AS APPLICABLE.</p>
<p><a name="onlinetracking"></a><strong><br>
Online Tracking</strong></p>
<p>Our Sites use two kinds of cookies: session cookies and persistent cookies. Session cookies exist only for as long as your browser remains open. Once you close your browser, they are deleted. Persistent cookies, in contrast, last beyond each visit to the Sites and remain on your hard drive after you close your browser. The cookies used on the Sites include those that are strictly necessary cookies for access and navigation, cookies that track usage (performance cookies) and remember your choices (functionality cookies), and for visitors to our catalog Sites, cookies that provide you with targeted content or advertising (described more below).</p>
<p>We may use the information we obtain from cookies for the following purposes:</p>
<ul>
<li>to recognize your computer when you visit the Sites</li>
<li>to track you as you navigate the Sites, and to enable the use of e-commerce capabilities</li>
<li>to improve the Sites’ usability</li>
<li>to analyze use of the Sites</li>
<li>to manage the Sites</li>
<li>to personalize the Sites, including for visitors to our catalog Sites, to enable targeted advertisements that may be of particular interest to you (excluding Students)</li>
<li>to recognize you when you move between devices so that your work can be synchronized</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We also may use “web beacons” on some of our Sites. A web beacon, also known as a pixel tag or clear GIF, may be used to transmit information collected through cookies to our service providers’ servers, such as the server of Google Adwords. These web beacons enable our service providers to compile information about your browsing activity on the Sites. We do not share with third parties (other than our service providers), Personally Identifiable Information we may collect through such web beacons, such as names, e-mail addresses and phone numbers without your express permission.</p>
<p>On some of our Sites and where permitted by law, we partner with third party advertising companies who may utilize cookies, web beacons or other technologies to provide advertisements about our goods and services that may be of interest to you, or to serve advertisements about other products on our Sites. The third parties may use these technologies to collect information about you when you use the Sites. They may collect information about your online activities over time and across different websites and other online services, as well as across different devices. They may use this information to provide you with interest-based advertising or other targeted advertising. They may also use persistent identifiers to track your Internet usage across other websites in their networks beyond the Sites. Such third parties may, with sufficient data from other sources, be able to personally identify you, unknown to us.</p>
<p>NOTE FOR STUDENT DATA: While some of our Sites collect information for advertising purposes, we do not collect or use Student Data for these purposes, nor do we deliver targeted advertising to Students. We may, however, display to Students contextual advertisements on our Sites and engage in other advertising activities, as permitted by law, e.g., with the appropriate opt-in from the Student or parent/guardian, as applicable.</p>
<p>We also use third-party web analytics services on our Sites, such as Google Analytics and ClickTale. These service providers help us analyze how users use our Sites. The information collected for this purpose (including your IP address and other information collected by automated means) will be disclosed to or collected directly by these service providers.
