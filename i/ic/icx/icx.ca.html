    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <img src="/images/common/content/pp-Introduction-Header.jpg" alt="Banner image with “information” stamped onto a folder.">
    <p><strong>Welcome!</strong></p>

    <p>The Canadian Real Estate Association (“CREA”) is committed to clearly explaining to you what it does with your personal information. On this webpage you’ll find information about the types of personal information we gather, how we use it, and whether we provide some of that information to anyone else.</p>

    <p>For starters, you’ll see that we refer to “privacy policy” and “privacy policies” throughout this webpage.  Don’t get confused! The simplest way to wrap your head around this is to think of CREA’s “privacy policy” as the combined total of all of CREA’s “privacy policies”, which are specific portions of our overall policy.</p>

    <p>When we say “personal information” what we mean is any information about an identifiable individual not including:</p>

    <ol class="pp_order_list">
        <li>The name, title, business email, business address or telephone number of an individual when collected, used and disclosed solely for the purpose of communicating or facilitating communication with the individual in relation to their employment, business or profession;</li>
        <li>Aggregated information that cannot be associated with a specific individual.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>It’s also important to note that CREA interacts with people falling into several different categories. This includes:</p>
    <div class="tableImgBlock">

    <p>The personal information we may gather about REALTORS® is very different than the personal information about REALTOR.ca users. For this reason, we’ve broken down CREA’s privacy policy into discrete chunks organized under four key headings:</p>

                <li>CREA works with advertising networks and publishers to serve personalized display ads for CREA products and services on third-party websites. Third parties may use cookies or web beacons to collect non-personally identifiable information (e.g., click stream information, browser type, time and date) about users’ interactions with products and services on CREA.ca to help determine which ads are likely to be most interesting to you.

                        CREA’s mobile applications may also collect and use similar information to serve personalized display ads within those apps. These ads are personalized based on your use of apps, as well as online activities on your mobile device and other devices (sometimes referred to as “cross-device personalization”). Mobile application technology works a bit differently than browser technology so follow the following instructions if you wish to opt out: 
                        <ul class="pp_order_list">
                            <li><strong>Apple (iOS)</strong> - on your iPhone or iPad, go to Settings &gt; Privacy &gt; Advertising and turn on Limit Ad Track to opt-out of interest-based ads from “iAd”, Apple’s advertising network.</li>

                </ul>
                </li>
                <li>CREA also uses social media matching tools, such as Facebook Custom Audiences and Google Customer Match. This allows us to deliver personalized ads to CREA Members or users of our websites/apps who are also users of these sites/apps. This requires CREA to provide a minimal amount of information (e.g., name and email address) to these sites so they can determine which Members/users also belong to those sites. This information is “hashed” before it is disclosed, is deleted once the matching process is complete, and is not used for any other purpose by social media sites or any other third-party. You can opt-out of this process by:
                    <ul class="pp_order_list">
                        <li><strong>Facebook</strong>: clicking on the icon on the top right corner of the ads from CREA that you see on Facebook. To learn more about advertising on Facebook generally and how to control your preferences, visit <a href="https://www.facebook.com/about/ads" target="_blank">www.facebook.com/about/ads</a>.</li>
                        <li><strong>Google</strong>: Go to <a href="https://adssettings.google.com" target="_blank">https://adssettings.google.com</a> and ensure that the “Ads based on your interests” setting is turned off.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>We may use non-identifiable information to personalize the content you see on a CREA website based on a site you have previously visited. For example, if you click on a hyperlink on a third party website that brings you to a CREA website, the banking website may place a cookie in your browser that contains a numerical code, and based on that code, the CREA website might display a widget. The cookie will persist for 30 days, so if you clear your cookies, the content will no longer be personalized.</li>

                <strong>IP Addresses</strong><br>
                CREA websites collect information about how our websites are used. Each time a visitor comes to one of our websites our web server collects the visitor's domain name or IP address. CREA cannot determine an individual’s identity from only an IP address; however, periodically users may inform CREA support staff of their IP addresses during the provision of support services. Users that submit their name when using the email functionality on our websites will also have their names associated with their IP addresses. At such time, CREA treats such information as personal information.

                Many CREA websites have “Contact Us” or similarly named functionality that allows you to contact us. It is probably obvious but CREA collects the e-mails provided through this functionality, so CREA can respond to your questions or suggestions. Less obvious is the fact that we may use this information for security purposes, such as screening the emails for spam.

            <p>CREA doesn’t operate in a vacuum. We work with other companies (known as “third parties”) to bring you information and services. While we always strive to work with third parties operating using high privacy standards, working with third parties could have an impact on how your personal information is handled.

                <p><strong>Third Party Links and Sources of Information</strong>
                Many CREA products, including REALTOR.ca, may include links to third party websites. Before using those third party websites, you should carefully examine their privacy policies because any personal information that you choose to provide to them will be subject to their privacy policies.
                </p>
                <p><strong>Storage</strong><br>
                Many CREA products, including REALTOR.ca, use third party service providers, for example, to store information in the Cloud. Some of these service providers, and the databases where they store personal information, are located outside of Canada. You should note that where personal information is located outside of Canada, it is subject to the laws of that jurisdiction in which it is located, and could be subject to lawful demands for access by law enforcement agencies.

            <p>We have an obligation to tell you if there are any risks to you that could result if someone (not us!) misuses the personal information you provide us. Honestly, we’ve struggled what to say here as most of the information we collect is not particularly sensitive. 
            </p>
            <p>One thing we wanted to flag, however, is that whenever you share your email with another person using our websites, there is a risk that other person could misuse that email.  We’ve taken legal (e.g. terms of use), technological (e.g. anti-spam filters and CAPTCHA technology) and design (e.g. designing our systems to reduce the likelihood of your email being misused) measures to try to limit such abuse, but no system is perfect. Please feel free to report any potential abuse to us.
            </p>
            <p>Also, keep in mind that when you provide your personal information to a REALTOR® (for example to, advertise your listing), the REALTOR® may use a variety of CREA, Board/Association and third party systems and software solutions to promote that property and conduct the transaction. So your personal information may end up in more places than you originally anticipated. Talk to your REALTOR® to find out just what exactly they do with your personal information, so you aren’t surprised.
