		<p>
			We at iChange Network, Inc. feel that your privacy is of the highest priority. 
			We will make our best efforts to keep everything you do on iChange, referred to

			Network, Inc., "Third Parties", or "Third Party". These Third Party links may include,

			The Site or The Service. 
		</p>
		<p>
			It is important to note that this Privacy Policy does not apply to information that you 
			voluntarily write, post, or share in public areas of the iChange websites. For example, 
			if you let other people see your name or other personal information you post or comments 
			you make on discussion boards or forums, that information will be made public. Your 
			messages and other information you make available in public areas of the iChange website 
			will be seen by people and organizations not related to or controlled by iChange.

			in to The Site or The Services, you are not anonymous to iChange Network, Inc. 
		</p>

			As you interact with iChange, we collect information about your activities. 
			This might include, but not be limited to, transactions with some of our business partners.

			from your browser including your IP address, cookies, pages you request, the kind of computer 
			operating system, and the type of browser used by you. 
		</p>
		<p>
			In order to provide you with the best set of services, experience, and value, we use your

			personal information only to iChange employees and contractors who need access to the information 
			and data in order to provide you with products and services as part of their jobs. 
		</p>
		<h2>Information Sharing and Disclosure</h2>
		<p>
			Except to provide products or services you request, or when you have given us explicit permission, 
			we do not rent, sell or share your personal information or data with nonaffiliated entities, people 
			not employed or contracted by iChange, or Third Parties, except:
		</p>
		
			<ul>
				<li>
					When using trusted partners who work on behalf of or with iChange under confidentiality agreements. 
					For example, we might use a third party to distribute an iChange newsletter or other communications. 
					However, these companies will not have any independent rights to share this information with any 
					individuals, groups, or entities not affiliated with iChange. 
				</li>
				<li>
					We may sometimes aggregate and share general, non-personal information with third parties such as 
					advertisers, the media, and government agencies. Such aggregate information may be gathered from 
					individual members' activities and information but is untraceable to specific, identifiable members. 
				</li>
				<li>
					We will respond to court orders, subpoenas, or legal process, or to exercise our legal rights or 
					defend against legal claims, in a method we deem is most appropriate. 
				</li>
				<li>
					We believe it is necessary to share information in order to investigate, prevent or take action 
					regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical 
					safety of any person, violations of the iChange terms and conditions, or as otherwise required 
					or permitted by law.
				</li>
				<li>
					If iChange is acquired by or merged with or into another company, we will provide notice on The Site 
					before personal information is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy. Your 
					member information and profile, or Me information, may be displayed on The Site in order to facilitate

		<h2>Cookies</h2>
		<p>
			iChange, like many websites, may use cookies to serve the Web pages we feel

			transfer to your computer, to be stored there for use at a later time. With 
			cookies in place, whenever you use your Web browser to connect to iChange,

			requests.
		</p>
		<p>
			In addition to iChange cookies, when you visit iChange your computer may receive 
			cookies from our advertisers, and from other sites you visit after clicking on 
			links and leaving iChange. The cookies inserted by those third parties are not 
			included in The iChange Privacy Policy, but rather, by the policies of those 
			advertisers and outside websites.
		</p>
		<p>
			iChange may also use tags or other electronic methods in connection with iChange 
			products and services, The Site or The Service, in order to assess the value of 
			material posted on the iChange website, or in an e-mail sent to iChange members.  
		</p>
		<h2>Third-party Ad Serving</h2>
