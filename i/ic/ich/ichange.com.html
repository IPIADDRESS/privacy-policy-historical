	<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
		<p>
			We at iChange Network, Inc. feel that your privacy is of the highest priority. 
			We will make our best efforts to keep everything you do on iChange, referred to 
			as "The Service" or "The Site", confidential, and anonymous, unless you choose 
			to share your identity, and corresponding activities, with others. 
		</p>
		<p>
			In line with this policy, we collect personal information in order to provide 
			you with services for self-improvement.
		</p>
		<p>
			Personal information may include your name, address, e-mail address, phone number, 
			activities, traits, and characteristics. 
		</p>
		<p>
			The iChange Privacy Policy ONLY applies to services and websites owned and operated 
			by iChange Network, Inc. We may link to other sites not owned and operated by iChange 
			Network, Inc., "Third Parties", or "Third Party". These Third Party links may include, 
			but not be limited to, advertisements, links to purchase products and services, or 
			other links with iChange, "The Site". Any time you might feel concerned about your privacy, 
			the privacy of each Third Party should be reviewed. iChange Network, Inc. does not review 
			Third Party privacy and is not responsible for any Third Party actions when you leave 
			The Site or The Service. 
		</p>
		<p>
			It is important to note that this Privacy Policy does not apply to information that you 
			voluntarily write, post, or share in public areas of the iChange websites. For example, 
			if you let other people see your name or other personal information you post or comments 
			you make on discussion boards or forums, that information will be made public. Your 
			messages and other information you make available in public areas of the iChange website 
			will be seen by people and organizations not related to or controlled by iChange. 
		</p>	
		<h2>Information Collection and Use</h2>
		<p>
			We collect your personal information whenever you interact with iChange.  For 
			example:
		</p>
	
			<ul>
				<li>iChange Registration</li>
				<li>use of The Service or The Site</li>
				<li>visiting The Service or The Site</li>
				<li>enrolling in an iChange program</li>
				<li>creating an iChange program</li>
			</ul>
		<p>
			When you register, you share information that might include your name, birth date, 
			gender, e-mail address, ZIP code, and more. Once you register with iChange and sign 
			in to The Site or The Services, you are not anonymous to iChange Network, Inc. 
		</p>
		<p>
			As you interact with iChange, we collect information about your activities. 
			This might include, but not be limited to, transactions with some of our business partners. 
		</p>
		<p>
			As you interact with iChange we automatically track, receive, record, and store information 
			from your browser including your IP address, cookies, pages you request, the kind of computer 
			operating system, and the type of browser used by you. 
		</p>
		<p>
			In order to provide you with the best set of services, experience, and value, we use your 
			information to serve you appropriate content and advertising. We also use your information 
			to improve The Site and The Service through research. In general, we provide access to your 
			personal information only to iChange employees and contractors who need access to the information 
			and data in order to provide you with products and services as part of their jobs. 
		</p>
		<h2>Information Sharing and Disclosure</h2>
		<p>
			Except to provide products or services you request, or when you have given us explicit permission, 
			we do not rent, sell or share your personal information or data with nonaffiliated entities, people 
			not employed or contracted by iChange, or Third Parties, except:
		</p>
		
			<ul>
				<li>
					When using trusted partners who work on behalf of or with iChange under confidentiality agreements. 
					For example, we might use a third party to distribute an iChange newsletter or other communications. 
					However, these companies will not have any independent rights to share this information with any 
					individuals, groups, or entities not affiliated with iChange. 
				</li>
				<li>
					We may sometimes aggregate and share general, non-personal information with third parties such as 
					advertisers, the media, and government agencies. Such aggregate information may be gathered from 
					individual members' activities and information but is untraceable to specific, identifiable members. 
				</li>
				<li>
					We will respond to court orders, subpoenas, or legal process, or to exercise our legal rights or 
					defend against legal claims, in a method we deem is most appropriate. 
				</li>
				<li>
					We believe it is necessary to share information in order to investigate, prevent or take action 
					regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical 
					safety of any person, violations of the iChange terms and conditions, or as otherwise required 
					or permitted by law.
				</li>
				<li>
					If iChange is acquired by or merged with or into another company, we will provide notice on The Site 
					before personal information is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy. Your 
					member information and profile, or Me information, may be displayed on The Site in order to facilitate 
					community and user interaction in The Site or The Service.  
				</li>
			</ul>
	
		<h2>Advertising</h2>
		<p>
			Your personal information is not shared with our advertisers. However, we target 
			particular users with particular services and content based on their personal 
			characteristics. 
		</p>
		<h2>Cookies</h2>
		<p>
			iChange, like many websites, may use cookies to serve the Web pages we feel 
			are most appropriate for you. A cookie is a data containing code that we 
			transfer to your computer, to be stored there for use at a later time. With 
			cookies in place, whenever you use your Web browser to connect to iChange, 
			our systems are able to recognize the cookie. This enables iChange to present 
			you with custom Web pages. So, for example, you might see your name listed 
			on the page and information related to your specific needs, interests, and 
			requests.
		</p>
		<p>
			In addition to iChange cookies, when you visit iChange your computer may receive 
			cookies from our advertisers, and from other sites you visit after clicking on 
			links and leaving iChange. The cookies inserted by those third parties are not 
			included in The iChange Privacy Policy, but rather, by the policies of those 
			advertisers and outside websites.
		</p>
		<p>
			iChange may also use tags or other electronic methods in connection with iChange 
			products and services, The Site or The Service, in order to assess the value of 
			material posted on the iChange website, or in an e-mail sent to iChange members.  
		</p>
		<h2>Third-party Ad Serving</h2>
		<p>
			iChange contracts with third party companies. This might include, but not be limited 
			to, serving content and advertising, providing site statistics, analysis and reporting 
			through cookies and other electronic methods. The type of information we collect might 
			include, for example, the pages you visited at iChange. 
		</p>
		<p>
			The ads on iChange may be delivered to you by third party web advertising partners 
			or iChange Network, Inc. Your activities on The Service or The Site is tracked and 
			used to serve you ads while on The Site and The Service. These companies may use 
			non-personally identifiable information about your visit to our site in order to 
			provide relevant information. 
		</p>
		<h2>Updating and Deleting Your Account Settings</h2>
		<p>
			You can update your iChange Account Settings, by going to the Account Settings page. 
		</p>
		<p>
			Throughout the term of your personal iChange account, without offering you the 
			opportunity to opt-out of receiving these communications, we reserve the right 
			to send you important or critical communications relating to The Service or The 
			Site, such as service announcements and administrative messages.
		</p>
		<p>
			You can terminate your iChange account at any time by sending an email to 
			<a href="mailto:support@ichange.com" target="_blank">support@ichange.com</a>.
