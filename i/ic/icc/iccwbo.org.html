Your rights</strong></h3><ul><li><strong>Right to request access, rectification, erasure, restriction processing, object to the processing, portability</strong></li></ul><p>The collected information is necessary for your registration and, more generally, for the purposes described in section 4. It is subject to data processing at ICC.

If you wish to exercise these rights and obtain all relevant information, please contact us at&nbsp;<a href="mailto:dataprotection@iccwbo.org">dataprotection@iccwbo.org</a></p><p>In which circumstances can you exercise your rights with ICC?</p><ul><li><strong>Right of access</strong></li></ul><p>1. You&nbsp;have the right to obtain from the controller, confirmation as to whether or not your personal data is being processed, and, where that is the case, access to your personal data and the following information:</p><ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman;"><li>the purposes of the processing;</li><li>the categories of personal data concerned;</li><li>the recipients or categories of recipient to whom the personal data has been or will be disclosed, in particular recipients in third countries or international organisations;</li><li>where possible, the envisaged period for which the personal data will be stored, or, if not possible, the criteria used to determine that period;</li><li>the existence of the right to request from the controller rectification or erasure of personal data or restriction of processing of personal data concerning the data subject or to object to such processing;</li><li>the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority;</li><li>where the personal data is not collected from you, any available information as to it source;</li><li>subject to the conditions provided by the GDPR,&nbsp;the existence of automated decision-making.</li></ol><p>2. Where personal data is transferred to a third country or to an international organisation,&nbsp;you shall have the right to be informed of the appropriate safeguards relating to the transfer.</p><p>3. The controller shall provide a copy of the personal data undergoing processing. For any further copies you may request, the controller may charge a reasonable fee based on administrative costs.</p><p>4. The right to obtain a copy referred to in paragraph 3 shall not adversely affect the rights and freedoms of others.</p><ul><li><strong>Right to rectification</strong></li></ul><p>You&nbsp;have the right to obtain from the controller without undue delay the rectification of inaccurate personal data. Taking into account the purposes of the processing,&nbsp;you&nbsp;have the right to have incomplete personal data completed, including by means of providing a supplementary statement.</p><ul><li><strong>Right to erasure (‘right to be forgotten’)</strong></li></ul><ol><li>You shall have the right to obtain from the controller the erasure of personal data without undue delay and the controller shall have the obligation to erase personal data without undue delay where one of the following grounds applies:<ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman;"><li>the personal data is no longer necessary in relation to the purposes for which it was collected or otherwise processed;</li><li>you&nbsp;withdraw your consent;</li><li>you&nbsp;object to the processing on grounds relating to&nbsp;your particular situation including profiling and there are no overriding legitimate grounds for the processing, or&nbsp;you object to the processing for direct marketing;</li><li>the personal data has been unlawfully processed;</li><li>the personal data has to be erased for compliance&nbsp;in accordance with European Union or French law.</li></ol></li></ol><ol start="2"><li>Where the controller has made the personal data public and is obliged pursuant to paragraph&nbsp;1 to erase the personal data, the controller, taking account of available technology and the cost of implementation, shall take reasonable steps, including technical measures, to inform controllers which are processing the personal data that&nbsp;you have requested the erasure by such controllers of any links to, or copy or replication of the personal data.</li><li>The right to erasure shall not apply to the extent that processing is necessary for:<ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman;"><li>exercising the right of freedom of expression and information;</li><li>compliance with a legal obligation to which the controller is subject or for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller;</li><li>archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research purposes or statistical purposes in so far as the right referred to in paragraph 1 is likely to render impossible or seriously impair the achievement of the objectives of that processing;</li><li>the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims.</li></ol></li></ol><ul><li><strong>Right to restriction of processing</strong></li></ul><p>1. You shall have the right to obtain from the controller restriction of processing where one of the following applies:</p><ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman;"><li>you contested the accuracy of the personal data, for a period enabling the controller to verify the accuracy of the personal data;</li><li>the processing is unlawful and&nbsp;you oppose the erasure of the personal data and requests the restriction of its use instead;</li><li>the controller no longer needs the personal data for the purposes of the processing, but it is required by&nbsp;you&nbsp;for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims;</li><li>you&nbsp;have objected to processing on grounds relating to&nbsp;your&nbsp;particular situation including profiling pending the verification of whether the legitimate grounds of the controller override yours.</li></ol><p>2. Where processing has been restricted under paragraph 1, such personal data shall, with the exception of storage, only be processed with the data subject’s consent or for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims or for the protection of the rights of another natural or legal person or for reasons of important public interest of the European Union or of a Member&nbsp;State.</p><p>3. When you&nbsp;have obtained restriction of processing pursuant to paragraph&nbsp;1, you shall be informed by the controller before the restriction of processing is lifted.</p><ul><li><strong>Notification obligation regarding rectification or erasure of personal data or restriction of processing</strong></li></ul><p>The controller shall communicate any rectification or erasure of personal data or restriction of processing carried out to each recipient to whom the personal data has been disclosed, unless this proves impossible or involves disproportionate effort. The controller shall inform&nbsp;you about those recipients if&nbsp;you request it.</p><ul><li><strong>Right to data portability</strong></li></ul><p>1.&nbsp;You shall have the right to receive personal data which&nbsp;you have provided to a controller, in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format and have the right to transmit that data to another controller without hindrance from the controller to which the personal data has been provided, where:</p><ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman;"><li>the processing is based on consent; and</li><li>the processing is carried out by automated means.</li></ol><p>2. In exercising&nbsp;your right to data portability pursuant to paragraph 1,&nbsp;you shall have the right to have&nbsp;your personal data transmitted directly from one controller to another, where technically feasible.</p><p>3. The exercise of your right to data portability shall be without prejudice to the right of erasure. That right shall not apply to processing necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller.</p><p>4. The right to data portability shall not adversely affect the rights and freedoms of others.</p><ul><li><strong>Right to object</strong></li></ul><ol><li>You&nbsp;shall have the right to object, on grounds relating to&nbsp;your particular situation, at any time to processing which is based on legitimate interests. The controller shall no longer process your personal data, unless the controller demonstrates compelling legitimate grounds for the processing which override your interests, rights and freedoms or for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims.</li><li>Where personal data is processed for direct marketing purposes,&nbsp;you shall have the right to object at any time to processing of personal data for such marketing, which includes profiling to the extent that it is related to such direct marketing.</li><li>Where&nbsp;you object to processing for direct marketing purposes, the personal data shall no longer be processed for such purposes.</li><li>At the time of the first communication with you, the right referred to in paragraphs&nbsp;1 and 2 shall be explicitly brought to your attention of the data subject and shall be presented clearly and separately from any other information.</li><li>In the context of the use of information society services, and notwithstanding Directive&nbsp;2002/58/EC,&nbsp;you may exercise your right to object by automated means using technical specifications.</li><li>Where personal data is processed for scientific or historical research purposes or statistical purposes, you, on grounds relating to&nbsp;your particular situation, shall have the right to object to processing of your personal data, unless the processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out for reasons of public interest.</li></ol><ul><li><strong>Right to object to automated individual decision-making, including profiling</strong></li></ul><p>1. You shall have the right not to be subject to a decision based solely on automated processing, including profiling, which produces legal effects concerning&nbsp;you or similarly significantly affects you.</p><p>2. This right&nbsp;shall not apply if the decision:</p><ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman;"><li>is necessary for entering into, or performance of, a contract between you and&nbsp;the&nbsp;data controller;</li><li>is authorised by European Union or French law and which also lays down suitable measures to safeguard the data subject’s rights and freedoms and legitimate interests; or</li><li>is based on&nbsp;your explicit consent.</li></ol><p>3. In the cases referred to in&nbsp;sub-paragraph (i) and (iii) above, the data controller shall implement suitable measures to safeguard&nbsp;your rights and freedoms and legitimate interests, including the right to obtain human intervention on the part of the controller, to express their point of view and to contest the decision.</p><ul><li><strong>Right to unsubscribe </strong></li></ul><p>If you no longer wish to receive communications from ICC, you may opt out by cancelling your subscription on the ICC Site through the link sent in each email you receive from ICC, or by sending an email to&nbsp;<a href="mailto:ICC_Connect@iccwbo.org">ICC_Connect@iccwbo.org</a>.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>9. Cookies Policy</strong></h3><ul><li>General</li></ul><p>Subject to your prior explicit consent where such consent is required by the applicable law in your jurisdiction, ICC Sites use “cookies” (i.e., small text files which are downloaded to a user’s device when visiting the ICC Sites) in order to improve navigation around the ICC Sites for the user and improve the quality of the ICC Sites.</p><p>By using <a href="https://iccwbo.org/">https://iccwbo.org/</a>, you consent to the use of cookies. If you do not consent to such use, you may disable these cookies through your browser.</p><ul><li><u>Which cookies are we using? </u><ul><li>ICC uses cookies to save your logged in status and track that you have visited the site. This is useful for you and means that you do not have to login to access your preferences each time you visit the ICC website. This is also useful for us as it helps us gauge how many users have visited our site.</li></ul></li></ul><p>The Site also uses Google Analytics with the anonymizer function, a web analytics service provided by Google. Google Analytics collects first-party cookies, data related to the device/browser, IP address and on-site/app activities to measure and report statistics about user interactions on the websites and/or apps that use Google Analytics. Google Analytics uses IP addresses to derive the geolocation of a visitor, and to protect the service and provide security to our customers. When anonymizer function is enabled, Google Analytics uses only a portion of an IP address collected, rather than the entire address. The last octet of the user’s IP address prior to its use and storage is removed, which means that the full IP address is never written to disk. This does slightly reduce the accuracy of geographic reporting.<br> More information on Google Analytics is available under:&nbsp;<a href="https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/6004245" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/6004245</a><br> More information about IP Anonymization in Analytics:&nbsp;<a href="https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/2763052?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/2763052?hl=en</a></p><ul><li><a href="https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/2763052?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Managing Cookies</u></a></li></ul><p>Parameters of web browsers by default are generally set up in such a manner to accept cookies but you can easily change those parameters by modifying your preferences.
