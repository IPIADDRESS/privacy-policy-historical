              We have created this email privacy policy to demonstrate our firm 
              commitment to your privacy and the protection of your information. 
            </p>
            <p><em>Why do you receive an email from us? </em></p>
            <p>If you received a mailing from us, (a) your email address is either 
              listed with us as someone who has expressly shared this address 
              for the purpose of receiving information in the future ("opt-in"), 
              or (b) you have registered or purchased or otherwise have an existing 
              relationship with us. We respect your time and attention by controlling 
              the frequency of our mailings. </p>
            <p class="bodyhead">How we protect your privacy </p>
            <p>We use security measures to protect against the loss, misuse and 
              alteration of data used by our system. </p>
            <p class="bodyhead">Sharing and Usage </p>
            <p>We will never share, sell, or rent individual personal information 
              with anyone without your advance permission or unless ordered by 
              a court of law. Information submitted to us is only available to 
              employees managing this information for purposes of contacting you 
              or sending you emails based on your request for information and 
              to contracted service providers for purposes of providing services 
              relating to our communications with you. </p>
            <p><em>How can you stop receiving email from us?</em> </p>
            <p>Each email sent contains an easy, automated way for you to cease 
              receiving email from us, or to change your expressed interests. 
              If you wish to do this, simply follow the instructions at the end 
              of any email. </p>
            <p>If you have received unwanted, unsolicited email sent via this 
              system or purporting to be sent via this system, please forward 
              a copy of that email with your comments to <a href="mailto:unsubscribe@icesoft.com">unsubscribe@icesoft.com</a>
