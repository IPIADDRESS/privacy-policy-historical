<p><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Tahoma">ICE's primary goal in collecting
personal information from you is to give you a useful, efficient and customized
experience while using the ICE service, and to help you use the content

allows us to provide services and features that most likely meet your needs,

views any Content or uses the e-mail feature. </span></p>
