<h1>Iloho Privacy</h1>
<ol>
    <li>
        <p>Iloho knows that you care about how your personal information is used
         and shared, and we take your privacy seriously.  Please read the following to learn
          more about our privacy policy.  By visiting the Iloho website, you are accepting the
           practices outlined in this Privacy Policy.</p>
    </li>
    <h5>What Does This Privacy Policy Cover?</h5>
    <li>
        <p>This Privacy Policy covers Iloho's treatment of personal information
         that Iloho gathers when you are on the Iloho website and when you use Iloho services.</p>
        <p>This policy does not apply to the practices of third parties that Iloho does not own
         or control, or to individuals that Iloho does not employ or manage.</p>
        <h5>What Personal Information About Users Does Iloho Collect?</h5>
        <p>Our primary goal in collecting personal information is to provide you
         with a friendly, customized, and efficient experience.  We only collect personal
          information that is relevant to the purpose of our website.  We do not process this
           information in a way that is incompatible with the purpose for which it has been
            collected or subsequently authorized by you.  We collect the following types of
             information from our users:</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <ol>
            <li>1.Information You Provide to Us:<br>
            We receive and store any information you enter on our website or provide to us in any
             other way. You can choose not to provide us with certain information, but then you may
              not be able to take advantage of many of our special features.  The personal information
               you provide is used for such purposes as:
                <ol>
                    <li>Registration: In order for you to use Iloho services, such as submitting new
                     links to the website, you must complete a registration form.  As part of this
                      registration form, we require your email address.
                    </li>
                    <li>Email: From time to time, Iloho may send you email notifications regarding news from iloho or changes in service. Iloho will never ask for your password nor ask you to divulge personal information via email. For periodic email, users will be given the option to opt out. If you do not recieve the option, you may always opt out by contacting <img src="/images/email/service.gif" style="margin: 0px 1px -1px 1px">.

                </li></ol>
            </li>
            <li>2.Automatic Information:
                <ol>
                    <li>We receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact with us.
                      Iloho automatically receives and records certain "traffic data" on our server logs
                       from your browser including your IP address, Iloho cookie information, and the page
                        you requested.  Iloho uses this traffic data to help diagnose problems with its
                         servers, analyze trends and administer the website.
                         </li>
                    <li>Iloho may also add on any page display the total counts that page has been viewed.
                      This includes member profile pages.
                      </li>
                    <li>Social sharing of data:  Iloho allows other users to browse stories that you have
                     rated, submitted, blogged, or commented on.  This information is made available via
                      your member profile (iloho.com/users/username), on the Iloho spy page (iloho.com/spy)
                       or within the permalink URL of the story in which you performed the action on. Iloho
                        may choose to post this data on other site features in the future.
                        </li>
                    <li>Profile information:  Iloho allows other users to browse your full name, location,
                     and instant messaging URL, within your member profile should you provide this
                      optional information.
                      </li>
                    <li>Syndication:  Iloho allows for the RSS syndication of all of its public content
                     within the website.
                     </li>
                    <li>Friends Data: Much like other social services Iloho allows non-friends to browse
                     through your friends activities (iloho.com/users/usersname/friends).
                     </li>
                    <li>API: Iloho will allow 3rd parties access to all Iloho data this is already publicly
                     available through iloho.com.  Iloho will forever keep private passwords and blog settings.</li>
                    <li>Many companies offer programs that help you to visit websites anonymously.  While
                     Iloho will not be able to provide you with a personalized experience if we cannot
                      recognize you, we want you to be aware that these programs are available.
                    </li>
                </ol>
            </li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <h5>What About Cookies?</h5>
    <li>
        Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer's hard drive
             through your Web browser to enable our systems to recognize your browser and tell us
              how and when pages in our website are visited and by how many people.  Iloho cookies
               do not collect personal information, and we do not combine information collected
                through cookies with other personal information to tell us who you are or what your
                 screen name or email address is. 
            </li>
            <li>The "help" portion of the toolbar on the majority of browsers will direct you on how
             to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to command the browser to tell
              you when you receive a new cookie, or how to fully disable cookies.  We strongly recommend
               that you leave the cookies activated, however, because cookies enable you to take
                advantage of some of Iloho's most attractive features.
                </li>
            <li>Some of our business partners may use cookies on our website (for example, advertisers).
              However, we have no access to or control over these cookies.
            </li>
    <h5>Will Iloho Share Any of the Information it Receives?</h5>
    <li>
        <p>Information about our users is an integral part of our business.  We neither
         rent nor sell your personal information to anyone.  We share your personal information only
          as described below.</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Iloho Personnel:</strong>
            <br>Iloho personnel (including, for the avoidance of doubt, consultants and/or contractors)
             may have access to user information while carrying out their duties in the normal course of
              Iloho business. 
            </li>
            <li><strong>Business Transfers:</strong>
            <br>In some cases, we may choose to buy or sell assets.  In these types of transactions,
             user information is typically one of the business assets that is transferred.  Moreover, if
              Iloho, or substantially all of its assets, were acquired, user information would be one of
               the assets that is transferred.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Protection of Iloho and Others:</strong><br>We may release personal information
             when we believe in good faith that release is necessary to comply with that law; enforce or
              apply our conditions of use and other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or
               safety of Iloho, our employees, our users, or others.  This includes exchanging information
                with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction.
            </li>
        
            <li><strong>With Your Consent:</strong><br>Except as set forth above, you will be notified
             when your personal information may be shared with third parties or used for a purpose
              incompatible with the purpose(s) for which it was originally collected, and you will be
               able to prevent the sharing of this information by opting out.
            </li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <h5>Is Information About Me Secure?</h5>
    <li>
        <ol>
            <li>Your Iloho account information is protected by a password for your privacy and security.
              You need to work to protect against unauthorized access to your password and to your computer
               by logging off once you have finished using a shared computer.
            </li>
            <li>Only employees who need personal information to perform a specific job (for example,
             a customer service representative) are granted access to it.  All of our employees are kept
              up to date on our privacy and security practices.
            </li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <h5>What Information Can I Access?</h5>
    <li>
        <p>You can access your personal information on our website and correct, amend,
         or delete information that is inaccurate.  Upon logging in visit your user profile setting
          page located at: http://iloho.com/users/&lt;usersname&gt;/profile </p>
         <h5>What Choices Do I Have?</h5>
        <ol>
            <li>As stated previously, you can always opt not to disclose information, but then you may
             be unable to use certain features on our website, such as posting new links.
             </li>
            <li>You are able to add or update certain information on pages, such as those listed in the
             "What Personal Information About Users Does Iloho Collect?" section above.  When you update
              information, however, we often maintain a copy of the unrevised information in our records.
            </li>
            <li>You may request deletion of your Iloho account by emailing us at
            <img src="/images/email/support.gif" style="margin: 0px 1px -1px 1px">.
            </li>
            <li>As explained earlier, the "help" portion of the toolbar on the majority of browsers
             will direct you on how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to command
              the browser to tell you when you receive a new cookie, or how to fully disable cookies.
               Please note, however, that if your browser does not accept cookies, you will not be able
                to take advantage of some of our attractive features.
            </li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <h5>Can Children Use Iloho's Services?</h5>
    <li>
        <p>You must be 13 years and older to register to use the Iloho website.  As a
         result, Iloho does not specifically collect information about children.</p>
        <h5>Changes to this Privacy Policy</h5>
        <p>Iloho may amend this Privacy Policy from time to time, at its sole
         discretion.  Use of information we collect now is subject to the Privacy Policy in effect at
          the time such information is used.  If we make changes to the Privacy Policy, we will notify
           you by posting an announcement on the Iloho website so you are always aware of what
            information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances if any, it is
             disclosed.</p>
    </li>
    <h5>Conditions of Use</h5>
    <li>
        <p>If you decide to visit the Iloho website, your visit and any possible dispute
         over privacy is subject to this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Use, including limitations
          on damages, arbitration of disputes, and application of California state law.</p>     
    </li>
    <h5>Effective Date of this Privacy Policy</h5>
