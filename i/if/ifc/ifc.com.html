<p>    This Privacy Policy describes what information AMC Networks Inc. and its United States-based affiliate and subsidiary companies (together, “AMC” or “we” and sometimes “us”) collect about you and why, how we use and share that information, and the choices we offer.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-the-scope-of-this-privacy-policy">1. <strong>WHAT IS THE SCOPE OF THIS PRIVACY POLICY?</strong></h2>
<p>    This Privacy Policy (“Policy”) is incorporated into the <a href="/terms-mobile-app">AMC Terms of Service</a>, and applies to information obtained by us when you sign up for, use, access, download or otherwise interact with any AMC applications, mobile applications, games, sweepstakes, products, services, or websites and anywhere else where this policy is posted, including applications we make available on third party sites or platforms, if disclosed to you in connection with your use of the application (collectively, “Services”). This Policy does not apply to information that is collected outside the Services. This Policy applies regardless of whether you access the Services using a personal computer, mobile device, gaming console or other equipment or device. If you disagree with the terms of this Policy, please do not use the Services.</p>
<p class="to-top"><a href="#">Back To Top</a></p>
<h2 id="will-this-policy-ever-change">2. <strong>WILL THIS POLICY EVER CHANGE?</strong></h2>
<p>    We may change this Policy from time to time. If we make changes, we will notify you by posting the updated policy and revising the “Effective Date” above. Use of the Services after the posted Effective Date means you accept the current version of the Policy, including any changes made prior to the posted Effective Date. If we make any material changes to this Policy, we will also notify you by email or by means of a notice on the Services. We encourage you to review the Policy whenever you use our Services to stay informed about our information practices and the choices available to you.</p>

<p>    <strong><em>Information you provide to us:</em></strong> We collect information that you submit to us.

We may use this data alone or in aggregate form, as a statistical measure, but not in a manner that is intended to identify you personally. This type of data enables us to understand how often individuals use parts of the Services so we can analyze and improve them. To collect this information, we use cookies and web beacons, and may in the future use other similar technologies.

<!-- verifyEmail:
    This is the landing screen after a user clicks on the link in the
    verification email sent to the user when they've registered with a
    non-verified email address.

    HOW IT WORKS: The code that is generated by Capture and included in the
    link sent in the verification email is sent to the server and, if valid,
    the user's email will be marked as valid and the verifyEmailSuccess
    screen will be rendered. If the code is not accepted for any reason,
    the verifyEmail screen is shown and the user has another opportunity
    to have the verification email sent to them.

    NOTE: The links generated in the emails sent to users are based on
    Capture settings found in Janrain's Capture Dashboard. In addition to
    entering the URL of your email verification page, you will need to add
    'screenToRender' as a parameter in the URL with a value of 'verifyEmail'
    which is this screen.
