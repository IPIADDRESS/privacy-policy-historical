<p class="titling">Privacy Statement for the iFriends Network</p>

<p class="header2Hansel">Overview</p>

<p class="header2Hansel">Effective on: March 2005

</p><p class="bodyHansel"><a href="http://www.truste.org/ivalidate.php?url=www.ifriends.net&amp;sealid=101"><img src="http://images.ifriends.net/iFriends/images/clickseal.gif" width="91" height="73" border="0" align="right"></a>The iFriends Network respects and safeguards the privacy of
every individual who visits our website. This Privacy Statement is a formal
document that outlines the information which may be collected about you while
you use the IFriends Network, and how that information may be used. This
Statement will also instruct you on what to do if you do not want your personal
information collected or shared when you visit the iFriends Network website.
This Statement incorporates our <a href="http://www.ifriends.net/legal/tos.htm">Terms of Service</a> and if there is a conflict between this
Statement or other stated policies and our Terms of
Service, the Terms of Service prevail. If you would like to review a plain-spoken
presentation of how iFriends protects your privacy, and the practical ways that
our policy might affect your life, please <a href="javascript:showPrivacy();">click here</a> for our "side
bar" article, "How iFriends Protects Your Privacy", or <a href="javascript:showPrivacyFaq();">click here</a> for a list of
frequently-asked questions and answers concerning iFriends' privacy policies.</p>

<p class="header2Hansel">Personally-Identifiable Information</p>

<p class="bodyHansel">The iFriends Network collects any
personally-identifiable information about you (including, but not limited to,
your name, address, telephone number, email address, Social Security number,
Bank account or credit card information, or any combination of data that could
be used to identify you, such as birth date, zip code, and gender) when you
provide it to us voluntarily or authorize our access to it.</p>

<p class="bodyHansel">To become a registered member of the iFriends Network, you only need to
provide us with a screen name, password, and email address; however, if you wish to access
the premium services offered via the iFriends Network, then, prior to accessing those
premium services, you must provide us with information about your age, as well as your
credit card information.  To become a video chathost on the iFriends Network,
you must provide us with your name, address, email address, date of birth, SSN,
screenname(s) and other information which we use to verify your age and identity.

</p><p class="bodyHansel">When you provide us with personally-identifiable
information ,<u>including email address</u>, or authorize our access to it, such information will be gathered
solely by the iFriends Network for use by the iFriends Network. Companies who provide services, such as email delivery services and other professional services, on behalf of iFriends may have limited access to personally-identifiable information in order to provide that service. These service providers do not use this information for other purposes beyond providing the service.  At any point on
our website where personally-identifiable information is requested, any
information that is optional to provide, rather than mandatory, will be clearly
marked as such. We may use personally-identifiable information in the following
ways, unless stated otherwise in our Terms of Service: we may store and process
that information to better understand your needs and how we can improve our
products and services, we may use that information, including your email address, to contact you about billing issues, technical issues, or as a follow up to your request to receive more information about our products and services and we may
use that information to ensure the protection of our rights. Financial
information that is collected is used to check the users' qualifications for
registration and to ensure proper payment by the user for products and
services. If you are a video chathost, the information that you authorize the
iFriends Network to collect or access is used to verify your age and identity, as well as to
provide you with support services while you are using the iFriends Interactive Computer
Service (a third party service may be used to validate chathosts' age and
identification information).</p>

<p class="bodyHansel">If you have already submitted personally-identifiable
information to us and would like for us to remove it from our records, please
contact us at the website listed at the bottom of this Statement. We will use
reasonable efforts to remove your information from our existing files.</p>

<p class="bodyHansel">The iFriends Network may utilize electronic newsletters to
reach all or a subset of all registered users, using the e-mail address
provided. When users opt-in to receive email notifications sent on behalf of video
chathosts, the iFriends Network does not, and will not, provide video chathosts with
access to such user information (in other words, we NEVER disclose user email addresses
or other personally-identifying information to the video chathosts.)
Users may opt-out from such mailing lists at any time by following
the instructions found at <a href="http://www.ifriends.net/legal/unsubscr.htm">http://www.ifriends.net/legal/unsubscr.htm</a> or by
following the instructions that shall be sent as part of any such mailings.</p>

<p class="bodyHansel">If you are a video chathost, you may receive email communications related to the support services that the iFriends Network provides to you. Video chathosts may opt-out from such email communications at any time by contacting vchhelp@ifriends.net and discontinuing their use of the iFriends Interactive Computer Service.

</p><p class="bodyHansel">If your personally identifiable information changes, <u>including your email address</u>, or if you no longer desire our service, you may update or deactivate your information. If you are a user or member, simply update or deactivate your information by emailing our Customer Support at help@ifriends.net  or by contacting us by telephone or postal mail at the contact information listed below. If you are a video chathost, simply update or deactivate your information by emailing our Chathost Support at vchhelp@ifriends.net or by contacting us by telephone or postal mail at the contact information listed below.


</p><p class="bodyHansel">The iFriends Network may request personally-identifiable
information, <u>such as email address</u>, on specific pages that allow users to contact the iFriends Network,
including the "Sheriff's Office", "Unsubscribe from
e-mail", "Cancel my account", "Report Bugs", and
"Help" services. In all of the above cases, such information is being
collected to assist us in solving a specific issue addressed by the user and/or
to allow us to contact the user with an appropriate response.</p>

<p class="bodyHansel">We will not disclose your personally-identifiable
information, <u>such as your email address</u>, unless we have to, to comply with applicable laws or valid legal
process (including without limitation search warrants, court orders or
providing assistance to law-enforcement authorities), or, if the disclosure to
a credit-card bank helps us prove the legitimacy of a credit-card charge.</p>

<p class="header2Hansel">Non-Personally-Identifiable Information Collected
Automatically</p>

<p class="bodyHansel">In some cases, information that is not personally-identifiable may be automatically collected about you
 either through server log files or cookies (examples of this type of information
include without limitation  your IP address, the type of Internet Browser you are using, the type
of computer operating system you are using, and the domain name of the website
from which you linked to our site). For our registered members, at the time of registration, and only at the time of registration, we link this information to your account information, <u>such as your email address</u>, however, for non-registered users, we never link this information to any personally identifiable information.
To learn how to prevent iFriends from using
cookies during your visit to iFriends and how to erase cookies from
your hard drive, see our <a href="javascript:showCookies();">Guide to Managing Cookies</a>.</p>

<p class="header2Hansel">Information That May Be Placed Automatically On Your
Computer's Hard Drive</p>

<p class="bodyHansel">When you view one of our websites or email communications, we may store some
information on your computer. This information will be in the form of a
"Cookie" or similar file and will help us in many ways. For example,
Cookies allow us to tailor web pages and email communications to better match your interests and preferences, and maintain your login session.
For our registered members, we link this information to your account informationsuch as your email address; however, for non-registered users, we never link this information to any personally identifiable information.
With most Internet Browsers, you can erase Cookies from your computer hard
drive, block all Cookies, or receive a warning before a Cookie is stored.
Please refer to your Browser instructions or help screen to learn more about
these functions. To learn how to prevent iFriends from using
cookies during your visit to iFriends and how to erase cookies from
your hard drive, see our <a href="javascript:showCookies();">Guide to Managing Cookies</a>.

</p><p class="header2Hansel">Public Forums</p>

<p class="bodyHansel">This site makes chat rooms, forums, message boards, and/or news groups available to its users, registered members, and video chathosts. Please remember that any information, <u>such as your email address</u>, that is disclosed in these areas becomes public information and you should exercise caution when deciding to disclose your personal information.</p>

<p class="header2Hansel">Security</p>

<p class="bodyHansel">The security of your personal information is important to us.  When you enter sensitive information (such as credit card number and/or social security number) on our registration or order forms, we encrypt that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL).

</p><p class="bodyHansel">We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information, <u>including your email address</u>, submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it.  No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however.  Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

</p><p class="bodyHansel">If you have any questions about security on our Web site, you can send an email to us at security @ ifriends.net.


</p><p class="header2Hansel">Minors</p>

<p class="bodyHansel">Because iFriends is an e-commerce-driven web-conferencing
platform, the company's services are directed to adults who possess validated
credit-card information, and are never marketed to individuals under the age of
18. <span class="GramE">iFriends</span>' tens of thousands of registered
"video chathosts" host chatrooms
under a potentially infinite number of different categories, ranging from
how/to instruction to adult-oriented topics.</p>

<p class="bodyHansel">Certain portions of iFriends which may contain content
considered offensive to some, are inaccessible to
individuals under the age of 18 via a standard "credit-card" wall, as
advocated by the Communications Decency Act. For those portions which may be
accessible to individuals under the age of 18, such as the iFriends home page
and other areas presenting non-offensive content, iFriends has no intention of
collecting any personally-identifiable information (that is, name, address,
telephone number, or email address) from individuals under eighteen years of
age. Where appropriate, the iFriends Network will specifically instruct minors
not to submit such information on our websites or advertisements. If a minor
has provided us with personally-identifiable information, a parent or guardian
of that minor should contact us at the email address listed at
the bottom of this Statement and we will use reasonable efforts to remove this information from
our existing files.</p>

<p class="header2Hansel">Changes to Privacy Policy

</p><p class="bodyHansel">If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes to this privacy statement and other places we deem appropriate so that you are aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it.

</p><p class="bodyHansel">We reserve the right to modify this privacy statement at any time, so please review it frequently.  If we make material changes to this policy <u>or in how we use personal information such as your email address</u>, we will notify you here, by email, or by means of a notice on our home page.

</p><p class="header2Hansel">TRUSTe

</p><p class="bodyHansel">The iFriends Network is a licensee of the TRUSTe Privacy Program. TRUSTe is an independent, non-profit organization whose mission is to build users' trust and confidence in the Internet by promoting the use of fair information practices. This privacy statement covers the site www.ifriends.net .

</p><p class="bodyHansel">If you have questions or concerns regarding this statement, you should first contact the iFriends Privacy Department at privacy @ ifriends.net. If you do not receive acknowledgment of your inquiry or your inquiry has not been satisfactorily addressed, you should then contact TRUSTe http://www.truste.org/consumers/watchdog_complaint.php.
