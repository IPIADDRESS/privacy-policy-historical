	<span class="head">Online Privacy Policy For The IFILM Network<br><i>Updated as of April 1, 2001</i></span>
	
	<p class="body">
		IFILM Corp. ("IFILM") is committed to respecting the privacy rights of all visitors 
		to the IFILM Network. For purposes of this Online Privacy Statement, the term 
		"IFILM Network" means any and all of IFILM's web sites, including, without limitation, 
		<a class="link" href="http://www.ifilm.net"> www.ifilm.net</a>, <a class="link" href="/">www.ifilm.com</a>, 
		<a class="link" href="http://www.ifilmpro.com">www.ifilmpro.com</a>, <a class="link" href="http://www.scriptshark.com">www.scriptshark.com</a>, 
		<a class="link" href="http://www.hcdonline.com">www.hcdonline.com</a>, <a class="link" href="http://www.tvtracker.com">www.loneeagle.com</a>, 
		as well as any other web sites that may now or hereafter 
		contain an authorized IFILM branded area or window, wholly controlled by IFILM. 
		The following policy describes how IFILM protects information it receives from 
		visitors to the IFILM Network, and provides additional information of interest 
		to the parents of children who may visit us. <br>
		<br>

		<span class="head"><u>What information does IFILM collect and how does IFILM use it?</u></span><br>
		<br>

		<span class="head">Information Collection and Use</span><br>
		 <br>
		IFILM is the sole owner of the information collected on the IFILM Network unless 
		specifically stated otherwise. We will not sell, share, or rent this information 
		to others in ways different from what is disclosed in this Online Privacy Statement. 
		IFILM collects information from our users at several different points on the IFILM 
		Network. <br>
		<br>

		<span class="head">Registration and Ordering</span><br>
		<br>
		When ordering products or services from us, or when registering on the IFILM Network, 
		we may need you to provide your name, email address, mailing address, daytime 
		phone number and for the purpose of ordering products or services only, you credit 
		card information. We will also ask you to create a username and password. This 
		information, among other things, allows us to keep a user profile that we may 
		use to customize our sites to the preferences of individual users. This information 
		also allows us to provide for faster communication with and product-related customer 
		service from IFILM. When you order products or register, we provide you discretion 
		whether or not to submit other information, which may include, your evening phone 
		number, fax number, date of birth, gender, income level, occupation, and other 
		various marketing data, demographic information, and your personal consumer preferences. 
		This information allows us better to know the needs and interests of our visitors 
		and possibly to tailor any specific features, promotions or other notifications 
		to individuals in the IFILM Network community. Visitors will also be given a choice 
		when registering whether they would like to be on one or more IFILM Network mailing 
		lists, or whether they would prefer not to receive such mailings. Should we allow 
		our sponsors or other affiliated third parties to send offers to IFILM Network 
		users independently of an IFILM newsletter or announcement, you will also be given 
		an opportunity to opt out of receiving such offers. <br>
		<br>

		<span class="head">Special Offers, Contests &amp; Updates</span> <br>
		<br>
		When you enter a contest or other promotional feature, IFILM may again ask for 
		the visitor's name, address, email address, username, password, and other various 
		marketing data, demographic information, and consumer preferences so that they 
		are able to better administer the contest and notify winners. We may also use 
		the information we collect to occasionally notify you about important functionality 
		changes to the IFILM Network, new IFILM services, and special offers we think 
		you'll find valuable. If you would rather not receive this information, or would 
		like to opt-out of any other information request or distribution, simply submit 
		such a request to IFILM at <a href="mailto:feedback@ifilm.com" class="link">feedback@ifilm.com</a>. 
		For more information about opting out, please see below. <br>
		<br>

		<span class="head"><u>How does IFILM protect visitor information?</u></span><br>
		<br>

		<span class="head">Security</span><br>
		<br>
		IFILM implements a variety of security measures to maintain the safety of your 
		personal information. User personal information is contained behind secured networks 
		and is only accessible by a limited number of employees who have special access 
		rights to such systems. When you place orders or access your personal information, 
		we offer the use of a secure server. All sensitive credit information supplied 
		by users is transmitted via Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology and then encrypted 
		into IFILM's databases to be only accessed as stated above. However, when IFILM 
		makes chat rooms, forums, message boards, individual web pages, and/or news groups 
		available to its users, please remember that any information that is disclosed 
		in these areas becomes public information and you should exercise caution when 
		deciding to disclose any of your personal information.<br>
		<br>

		<span class="head">Cookies</span><br>
		<br>
		Cookies are bits of electronic information that a web site can transfer to a visitor's 
		hard drive to help keep records of his or her visit to the site. Cookies allow 
		web site operators to better customize visits to the site to the visitor's individual 
		preferences. The use of cookies is standard on the Internet and many major web 
		sites use them. Although most web browsers automatically accept cookies, you can 
		usually change your browser either to prevent this or to notify you whenever you 
		are sent a cookie. This notification gives you the chance to decide whether or 
		not to accept the cookie. Even without accepting a cookie, you can still access 
		most of the features on the site. IFILM uses cookies to provide visitors to the 
		IFILM Network with a better experience on its site. <br>
		<br>

		<span class="head"><u>Does IFILM disclose the information it collects from visitors to outside 
		parties?</u></span><br>
		<br>

		<span class="head">Log Files</span><br>
		<br>
		We use IP addresses to analyze trends, administer the IFILM Network, track users' 
		movements, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses 
		are not linked to personally identifiable information. <br>
		<br>

		<span class="head">Sharing</span><br>
		<br>
		We may share aggregated demographic information with our partners and advertisers. 
		This is not linked to any personal information that can identify any individual 
		person. We may partner with other parties to provide specific services. When the 
		user signs up for these services we will share names, or other contact information 
		that is necessary for the third party to provide these services. These parties 
		are not allowed to use personally identifiable information except for the purpose 
		of providing these services.<br>
		<br>

		<span class="head">Sale or Transfer</span><br>
		<br>
		IFILM reserves the right at its sole discretion to sell, trade or otherwise transfer 
		outside the company personally identifiable information that visitors voluntarily 
		provide in any registration or contest submission. This information is used to 
		better understand visitors' use of the IFILM Network, to support related transactions 
		made on the site, and to better know our visitors and possibly tailor any specific 
		features, promotions, or other notifications to them. Additionally, such data, 
		both in an individual as well as in an aggregate form, may be provided to other 
		parties for marketing, advertising, or other uses in the future. Each email newsletter 
		always contains instructions on how to discontinue receipt of the newsletter. 
		However, if a visitor at anytime chooses to no longer receive such information 
		and opt-out from any future mailings, they should simply reply to IFILM's removal 
		instructions and request to be removed from any such list and/or mailings, or 
		they may also send such a request to <a href="mailto:feedback@ifilm.com" class="link">feedback@ifilm.com</a>. 
		<br>
		<br>

		<span class="head"><u>How can I talk back to IFILM?</u></span><br>
		<br>

		<span class="head">Opting Out; Removing and Modifying Information Provided to IFILM</span><br>
		<br>
		After gathering any user information, IFILM offers users the opportunity to remove 
		their user-identifiable information from our database so as not to receive future 
		communications or to no longer interact with the IFILM Network until they later 
		chose to. IFILM additionally provides users the opportunity to update and modify 
		any information they have previously provided by viewing their information sent 
		directly to them following such a request from feedback@ifilm.com, or by 
		U.S. Mail to IFILM Corp., Attn: Privacy Administrator, 1024 N. Orange Dr., Hollywood, 
		California 90038, and updating and/or modifying the information previously provided. 
		<br>
		<br>

		<span class="head">Feedback</span><br>
		<br>
		IFILM welcomes your questions, comments, and concerns about privacy. Please send 
		us any and all feedback pertaining to this, or any other issue, at <a href="mailto:feedback@ifilm.com" class="link">feedback@ifilm.com</a>, 
		or by U.S. Mail to IFILM Corp., Attn: Privacy Administrator, 1024 N. Orange Drive, 
		Hollywood, California 90038. <br>
		 <br>
		<span class="head"><u>Some final notes</u></span><br>
		<br>

		<span class="head">Third Party Links</span><br>
		<br>
		In an attempt to provide increased value to our visitors, IFILM may choose various 
		third party web sites to link to from, and frame within, its own site. However, 
		even if the third party is affiliated with IFILM, IFILM has no control over these 
		linked sites and each site will have its own, independent privacy and data collection 
		practices. IFILM has no responsibility or liability for these independent policies 
		or actions and is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of 
		such web sites. These linked sites are only for your convenience and you therefore 
		access them at your own risk. Nonetheless, IFILM seeks to protect the integrity 
		of the IFILM Network and the links placed upon it and therefore requests any feedback 
		on not only its own site, but for sites it links to as well (including if a specific 
		link does not work) to <a href="mailto:feedback@ifilm.com" class="link">feedback@ifilm.com</a>. 
		<br>
		<br>

		<span class="head">IFILM's special note to parents</span><br>
		<br>
		IFILM realizes that many children will visit IFILM Network on the Internet, and 
		IFILM therefore encourages parents and guardians to spend time online with their 
		children, to participate in the interactive activities offered online, and for 
		children to consult with their parents before submitting any information to any 
		web site, including the IFILM Network. No information should be submitted to or 
		posted on the IFILM Network by guests under 18 years of age without the consent 
		and supervision of their parent or guardian. Although guests under 18 years of 
		age may be allowed, with their parent permission and supervision, to participate 
		in noted contests, if such a guest wins, notification and prizes are sent to the 
		parents or guardian. However, IFILM believes that it is ultimately the parents' 
		responsibility to supervise their children's online activities and consider using 
		parental control tools available from online services and software manufacturers 
		that help provide a kid-friendly online environment. These tools can also prevent 
		children from disclosing their name, address, and other personal information online 
		without parental permission. For additional information about parental control 
		tools, please consult the "Consumer Assistance" page of the <a href="[CURL /db/redirect " "="" ""]?redir="[URL_ESCAPE" "http:="" www.the-dma.org"]"="" class="link"> 
		Direct Marketing Association home page</a>.<br>
		<br>

		<span class="head">Terms of Service</span><br>
		<br>
		Please also visit IFILM's terms of use establishing the use, disclaimers, and 
		limitations of liability governing the use of the entire IFILM Network. <br>
		<br>

		<span class="head"><u>Your consent</u></span><br>
		<br>
		By using the IFILM Network, you consent to the collection and use of this information 
		by IFILM. If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes 
		on this page so that you are always aware of what information we collect, how 
		we use it, and under what circumstances we disclose it.<br>
