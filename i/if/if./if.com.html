    <h1>How your personal information is used by Lloyds Banking Group Companies</h1>
<p>
  <strong>Last  updated September 2013</strong>
</p>
<p>Your information will be held by Bank of  Scotland plc which trades as Intelligent Finance, part of the Lloyds Banking  Group.</p>
<p>
    More  information on the Group can be found at <a href="http://www.lloydsbankinggroup.com">www.lloydsbankinggroup.com</a>.
  </p>
<p>
  <strong>Where we obtain your  information</strong>
</p>
<p>Your  personal information will be held securely in Lloyds Banking Group systems so  that we and any other companies in our Group that you have dealings with,  either now or in the future, can manage your relationship with us. This will  include information you provide when you apply to us, and any additional  information provided by you or others in various ways, including:</p>
<p>(a)  in applications, emails and letters, during telephone calls and conversations  in branch, when registering for services, in customer surveys, when you  participate in competitions and promotions, through Lloyds Banking Group  company websites, and during financial reviews and interviews.<br>
  (b)  from analysis (for example, the amount frequency, location, origin, and  recipient) of your payments and other transactions, and your use of services  involving other Lloyds Banking Group companies and what they know from  operating your account; and <br>
  (c)  information Lloyds Banking Group companies receive from each other, from our  business partners, and from other organisations such as credit reference  agencies and fraud prevention agencies.</p>
<p>We  will not retain your personal information for longer than is necessary for the  maintenance of your account, or for legal or regulatory requirements.</p>
<p>
  <strong>How we share your  information</strong>
</p>
<p>
    We  may share the personal information we hold about you across the Lloyds Banking  Group for the following administrative activities:</p>
<p>
    (a)  providing you with products and services and notifying you about either  important changes or developments to the features and operation of those  products and services;<br>
    (b)  responding to your enquiries and complaints;<br>
    (c)  administering offers, competitions, and promotions;<br>
    (d)  undertaking financial reviews;<br>
    and  also for the following data sharing activities:<br>
    (e)  updating, consolidating, and improving the accuracy of our records;<br>
    (f)  undertaking transactional analysis;<br>
    (g)  arrears and debt recovery activities;<br>
    (h)  testing new systems and checking upgrades to existing systems;<br>
    (i)  crime detection, prevention, and prosecution;<br>
    (j)  evaluating the effectiveness of marketing, and for market research and  training;<br>
    (k)  customer modelling, statistical and trend analysis, with the aim of developing  and improving products and services;<br>
    (l)  assessing lending and insurance risks across the Lloyds Banking Group;<br>
    (m)  managing your relationship with the Lloyds Banking Group companies.</p>
<p>By  sharing this information it enables us, and other companies in the Lloyds  Banking Group, to better understand your needs and run your accounts in the  efficient way that you expect.
  </p>
<p>Your  data may also be used for other purposes for which you give your specific  permission, or, in very limited circumstances, when required by law or where  permitted under the terms of the Data Protection Act 1998.</p>
<p>
  <strong>When we may share  your information</strong>
</p>
<p>We  will treat your personal information as private and confidential, but may share  it with each other and disclose it outside the Lloyds Banking Group if:</p>
<p>
    (a)  allowed by this agreement;<br>
    (b)  you consent;<br>
    (c)  needed by our agents, advisers or others involved in running accounts and  services for you or collecting what you owe Group companies;<br>
    (d)  needed by subcontractors to help us manage your records;<br>
    (e)  HM Revenue &amp; Customs or other authorities require it;<br>
    (f)  the law, regulatory bodies, or the public interest permits or requires it;<br>
    (g)  required by us or others to investigate or prevent crime;<br>
    (h)  needed by market research companies to assist us in providing better products  and services for you; or<br>
    (i)  to any other parties connected with your account (including guarantors).<br>
    (j)  required as part of our duty to protect your accounts, for example we are  required to disclose your information to the UK Financial Services Compensation  Scheme (FSCS).
  </p>
<p>We  will always ensure your information remains safe and secure.</p>
<p>
  <strong>Using your  information to help prevent terrorism and crime</strong>
</p>
<p>The  Government also requires us to screen applications that are made to us to  ensure we are complying with the international fight against terrorism and  other criminal activities. As a result of this we may need to disclose  information to government bodies.</p>
<p>
  <strong>Sharing your  information to assist with asset buying or selling</strong>
</p>
<p>Lloyds  Banking Group companies may in the future wish to sell, transfer or merge part  or all of their business or assets, or any associated rights or interests, or  to acquire a business or enter into a merger with it. If so, they may disclose  your personal information to a potential buyer, transferee, or merger partner  or seller and their advisers so long as they agree to keep it confidential and  to use it only to consider the possible transaction. If the transaction goes  ahead, the buyers, transferee or merger partner may use or disclose your  personal information in the same way as set out in this notice.</p>
<p>
  <strong>Sharing your personal  information with credit card providers</strong>
</p>
<p>If  you hold a credit or debit card with us, we will share transaction details with  our scheme providers (e.g. Visa or Mastercard).</p>
<p>
  <strong>Searching insurance records</strong>
</p>
<p>If  you apply to us for insurance, we will pass your details to the insurer. If you  make a claim, any information you give to us, or to the insurer, may be put  onto a register of claims and shared with other insurers to prevent fraudulent  claims. A list of the participants is available from the insurer. We may also  disclose your information within our group of companies, to our agents and  other insurers to investigate or prevent fraud.</p>
<p>
  <strong>Sharing your personal  information between 1st and 2nd charge lenders</strong>
</p>
<p>If  you have a secured loan or mortgage with us, we may need to share information  with other lenders who also hold a charge on your property.</p>
<p>
  <strong>Joint Applicants</strong>
</p>
<p>If  you give personal information about someone else (such as a joint applicant)  then you should not do so without their permission. Where information is  provided by you about someone else, or someone discloses information about you,  it may be added to any personal information that is already held by us and it  will be used in the ways described in this privacy notice.</p>
<p>Sometimes,  when you open a joint account or product, this may mean that your personal data  will be shared with the other applicant.  For example, transactions made  by you will be seen by your joint account holder and vice versa.</p>
<p>
  <strong>How we manage  sensitive personal information</strong>
</p>
<p>The  Data Protection Act defines certain information as 'sensitive' (racial or  ethnic origin, political opinions, religious beliefs, trade union membership,  physical or mental health, sexual life, criminal proceedings and offences). If  you apply to us for insurance, a pension, health insurance or life assurance,  we may ask you for some sensitive' details. We will only use this information  to provide the service you require and we will ask for your explicit consent.  As a customer, there may be times when you give us sensitive information. We  may share it with other parts of the group and our subcontractors to keep your  records up to date.</p>
<p>
  <strong>How we manage  information collected on credit card statements</strong>
</p>
<p>Some  transactions that you or additional card holders make on a card account may  cause sensitive or confidential details to appear on your statement.  By  using your card to make such transactions you give us your explicit consent to  process this information.</p>
<p>
  <strong>Using companies to  process your information outside the EEA</strong>
</p>
<p>All  countries in the European Economic Area (EEA), which includes the UK, have  similar standards of legal protection for your personal information. We may run  your accounts and provide other services from centres outside the EEA (such as  the USA and India) that do not have a similar standard of data protection laws  to the UK. If so, we will require your personal information to be protected to  at least UK standards.  We may process payments through other financial  institutions such as banks and the worldwide payments system operated by the  SWIFT organisation if, for example, you make a CHAPS payment or a foreign  payment. Those external organisations may process and store your personal  information abroad and may have to disclose it to foreign authorities to help  them in their fight against crime and terrorism. If these are based outside the  EEA, your personal information may not be protected to standards similar to  those in the UK.</p>
<p>
  <strong>Using credit scoring</strong>
</p>
<p>
    When  you apply for credit, an automated system known as credit scoring may be used  when considering whether to agree the borrowing. It is a method of assessing  your likely conduct of an account based on a range of data, including the  conduct of previous similar accounts. It is a system widely used by credit providers  to help make fair and informed decisions on lending.<br>
    Credit  scoring takes account of information from three sources - the information you  provide on your application, information provided by credit reference agencies  and information that may already be held about you by companies in the Lloyds  Banking Group. A credit scoring system will consider information from these  sources, to make an overall assessment of your application.
  </p>
<p>The  credit scoring methods used are regularly tested to ensure they remain fair,  effective and unbiased.&nbsp; Using a credit  scoring system helps our Group companies to lend responsibly. If you submit an  application and it is declined through this automated process, you can contact  us within 21 days to have the decision reconsidered. You also have the right to  ask that the decision is not made based solely using a credit scoring system.</p>
<p>
  <strong>How we use Credit  Reference Agencies</strong>
</p>
<p>Credit  Reference Agencies (CRAs) collect and maintain information about consumers' and  businesses' credit behaviour. This includes Electoral Register, fraud  prevention, and credit information - including details of previous applications  and the conduct of your accounts - and public information such as County Court  Judgements, decrees, and bankruptcies.</p>
<p>The  information that Lloyds Banking Group companies and other organisations provide  to credit reference agencies about you, your financial associates and your  business (if you have one) may be provided to other organisations and used by  them and us to: </p>
<p>
    (a)  help make decisions, for example when:<br>
    (i) checking details on applications for credit and credit-related or other  facilities;<br>
    (ii) managing credit and credit-related accounts or facilities;<br>
    (iii) recovering debt;<br>
    (iv) checking details on proposals and claims for all types of insurance;<br>
    (v) checking details of job applicants and employees;<br>
    (b)  detect and prevent crime, fraud and money laundering.<br>
    (c)  check your credit history;<br>
    (d)  verify your identity if you, or someone financially linked with you, applies  for services;<br>
    (e)  trace your whereabouts; and<br>
    (f)  undertake research, statistical analysis and systems testing.
  </p>
<p>If  a Lloyds Banking Group company needs to make a credit decision when you apply  for a credit-based product or service (e.g. mortgage, personal loan, credit  card, or current account) or to review the amount of credit it provides under  an existing agreement, such as an overdraft, your records will be searched,  along with those of anyone who is financially associated with you such as your  spouse or partner. The CRA will keep a record of this search and place a  "footprint" on your credit file, whether or not the application  proceeds.</p>
<p>We  may give details of your account and how you conduct it to credit reference  agencies, including if you borrow and do not repay in full and on time. If you  fall behind with your payments and a full payment or satisfactory proposals are  not received within 28 days of a formal demand being issued, then a default  notice may be recorded with the CRAs. Similar information may also be given  about your other lending/credit relationships with members of the group. Any  records shared with CRAs will remain on file for 6 years after your account is  closed, whether it has been settled by you or as a result of a default. Other  organisations may see these searches and updates if you apply for credit in the  future, and these may affect your ability to borrow from other lenders.</p>
<p>If  you apply for or hold an account in joint names, or tell us that you have a  spouse or financial associate, a financial association will be created between  your records, including any previous and subsequent names used by you. This  means that your financial affairs may be treated as affecting each other. These  links will remain on your and their files until such time as you or your  partner is successful in applying for a disassociation with the CRAs to break  that link. You must be sure that you have their agreement to disclose  information about them. Searches may be made on all joint applicants, and  search footprints will be left on all applicants' records.</p>
<p>
    You  have a right to apply to the credit reference agencies for a copy of your file. <br>
    We  carry out most of our credit searches using Experian, but details of how you  have run your account(s) may be disclosed to all the credit reference agencies.  The information they hold may not be the same and there is a small fee that you  may need to pay to each agency that you apply to.&nbsp; Their addresses are:

</ul>
<p>
</p><p>
  <strong>Using Fraud  Prevention Agencies</strong>
</p>
<p>We  have systems that protect our customers and ourselves against fraud and other  crime. Customer information can be used to prevent crime and trace those  responsible. We will share your personal information from your application with  fraud prevention agencies. If false or inaccurate information is provided and  fraud is identified, details of this fraud will be passed to these agencies.  Law enforcement agencies may access and use this information. We and other  organisations may also access and use this information to prevent fraud and  money laundering, for example, when:</p>
<ul class="list">
  <li>Checking  details on applications for credit and credit related or other facilities.</li>
  <li>Managing  credit and credit related accounts or facilities.</li>
  <li>Recovering  debt.</li>
  <li>Checking  details on proposals and claims for all types of insurance.</li>
  <li>Checking  details of job applicants and employees.</li>
</ul>
<p>Please  contact us on 0845 602 7174 if you want to receive details of the relevant  fraud prevention agencies. We and other organisations may access and use from  other countries the information recorded by fraud prevention agencies.</p>
<p>
  <strong>How we check your  identity</strong>
</p>
<p>We  may ask you to provide physical forms of identity verification when you open  your account.  Alternatively, we may search credit reference agency files  in assessing your application.  The agency also gives us other details and  information from the Electoral Register to verify your identity.  The  agency keeps a record of our search, whether or not your application  proceeds.  Our search is not seen or used by lenders to assess your  ability to obtain credit.</p>
<p>
  <strong>Undertaking  Anti-Money Laundering checks</strong>
</p>
<p>To  comply with money laundering regulations, there are times when we need to  confirm (or reconfirm) the name and address of our customers. This information  may be shared with other group companies. </p>
<p>
  <strong>Obtaining information  about you, and other personal details</strong>
</p>
<p>When  you apply for a mortgage or further borrowing it may be necessary to obtain  references, details of your existing financial commitments, and any other  information that is required to assess or review lending risks, to recover  debts, and to prevent or detect fraud. Where applicable, your current and  previous employers, accountant, landlord, lender, bank, insurance or pension  company may be contacted to obtain this information. In limited circumstances  these references may need to be obtained after you open your account. This may  be for regulatory purposes, or if the lending decision needs to be reviewed.  Your permission to obtain these references will therefore continue to apply  after your account has been opened. It may also be necessary to obtain information  or documentation from your solicitor relating to any work they carry out either  on your or our behalf.</p>
<p>
  <strong>Using your details  for service contact</strong>
</p>
<p>Making  sure we deliver excellent customer service is very important to us and to do  this various methods of communication may be used when sending you information  about your account. Most of the time you will be contacted by letter or  telephone, but you may also be sent updates by text message or email when it is  believed to be appropriate.  You can ask us to stop sending these messages  at any time. Additionally, in extraordinary circumstances (such as natural  disaster or civil unrest) we may also send you updates by text message or  email. If we decide to use email to contact you, we will only do this if we  have ensured that using email will not put your information at risk, or, if you  have requested we email you, that we have explained the risks of sending an  "insecure" email and that you are happy to accept that risk.</p>
<p>In  addition you may wish to choose a channel of communication that suits you when  you need to contact us.   If you need to email a Lloyds Banking Group  company, we recommend you check their website to see if a secure email facility  exists so that your email can be sent securely.  If you send us emails in  other ways, such as from your personal account, then remember that the message  may not be secure and there is a risk that it could be intercepted.  If  you choose to send an "insecure" email, please keep the amount of  confidential information you include to a minimum.</p>
<p>
  <strong>Recording phone calls</strong>
</p>
<p>We  may monitor or record phone calls with you in case we need to check we have  carried out your instructions correctly, to resolve queries or issues, for  regulatory purposes, to help improve our quality of service, and to help detect  or prevent fraud or other crimes.  Conversations may also be monitored for  staff training purposes.</p>
<p>
  <strong>Using information on  social networking sites</strong>
</p>
<p>As  part of our ongoing commitment to understanding our customers better, we may  research comments and opinions made public on social networking sites such as  Twitter and Facebook.</p>
<p>
  <strong>Obtaining a copy of  your information</strong>
</p>
<p>Under  the Data Protection Act you have the right of access to your personal data. The  Act allows us to charge a fee of £10 for this service. If anything is  inaccurate or incorrect, please let us know and we will correct it. For further  details on how to request a copy of your information, please write to the:</p>
<p>
    Intelligent Finance<br>
    PO Box 17316<br>
    Edinburgh<br>
    EH12 1AY
  </p>
<p>
  <strong>Using your personal  information to contact you about products and services.</strong>
</p>
<p>Unless  you have asked us not to, we and other Lloyds Banking Group companies may  contact you by mail, telephone, email or text message about products and  services available from the Group. In addition we may also contact you about  products and services from selected companies outside the Group, which we  believe may be of interest to you or benefit you financially. </p>
<p>We  promise not to contact you about everything - only if we think it could be  appropriate and relevant to you, such as preferential savings opportunities,  account upgrades or special offers. This contact may continue after your  relationship with us ends. You may opt out of receiving this information at any  time by calling us, writing to us or contacting your local branch.</p>
<p>Unless  you have given us your consent, we will not provide information about you to  companies outside our group to use for their own marketing purposes.</p>
<p>
  <strong>Using cookies</strong>
