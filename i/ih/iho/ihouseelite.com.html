<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

<p>Your privacy is important to us. To better protect your privacy we provide this notice explaining our online information practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used.</p>

<p>This privacy policy applies to the <a href="http://www.ihouseweb.com" target="_blank">ihouseweb.com website</a> and other Internet-accessible <a href="http://www.ihouseweb.com" target="_blank">iHOUSEweb, Inc.</a> services. Please note that this policy applies only to <a href="http://www.ihouseweb.com" target="_blank">iHOUSEweb, Inc. websites</a>, and not to other companies’ or organizations’ websites to which we link from our products.</p>

<h5>How We Use Your Information</h5>

<p>Your information once collected is never sold, traded or bartered with any 3rd party companies. The information you supply to us is used by our staff and trusted partners only.</p>

<h5>Information About All iHOUSEweb.com Visitors</h5>
<p>In general, our website automatically gathers certain usage information like the numbers and frequency of visitors to <a href="http://www.ihouseweb.com" target="_blank">iHOUSEweb, Inc. websites</a>. We only use such data in the aggregate. This aggregate data helps us determine how much our clients use parts of the website, so we can improve our website to assure that it is as appealing as we can make it for as many of you as possible. For example, <a href="http://www.ihouseweb.com" target="_blank">iHOUSEweb.com</a> uses a technology called “cookies” that tells us how and when pages in our website are visited, and by how many people. These cookies do not collect personally identifiable information and we do not combine information collected through these cookies with other personally identifiable information to tell us who you are.</p>

<h5>Information About You</h5>
<p>Additionally, we may specifically ask for information about you when you sign up to use a service, or when you request information. We will need certain information – such as name, phone number etc., in order to provide that service or information to you. We may also use that information to let you know of additional products and services about which you might be interested. We may ask you for information about your interests so that both you and we can take advantage of the interactivity of the online medium, but you may always choose to respond or not. We also use cookies or server-side session technology in order to improve your experience, including to remember your preferences or customized settings when you use iHOUSEweb, Inc. websites and its related services, and to authenticate your access to your personal information.</p>

<h5>Our Commitment to Data Security</h5>
<p>To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the correct use of information, we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online.</p>

<h5>Our Commitment to Children’s Privacy</h5>
<p>Protecting the privacy of the very young is especially important. For that reason, we never collect or maintain information at our web site from those we actually know are under 13, and no part of our web site is structured to attract anyone under 13.</p>
