        address, demographic information (such as zip code, age), or payment information (such as account or credit card number). The types of Personal Information

    <h3>Information We Collect Automatically</h3>

    <p>

        that automatically or passively collect information about how the Platforms are accessed and used ("Usage Information"). Usage Information may include
        browser type, device type, operating system, application version, the page served, the time, the preceding page views, and your use of features or
        applications on the Platforms, such as song history, interaction with friends and group activities. This information helps us keep our Platforms fresh and
        interesting to our visitors and allows us to tailor content to a visitor's interests.

        computers identify your Device by its Device Identifier. We may use a Device Identifier to, among other things, administer the Platforms, help diagnose
        problems with our servers, analyze trends, track users' web page movements, help identify you and your shopping cart, and gather broad demographic
        information for aggregate use.

        cookies (data files placed on a Device when it is used to visit the Platforms), mobile analytics software and pixel tags (transparent graphic image,
        sometimes called a web beacon or tracking beacon, placed on a web page or in an email, which indicates that a page or email has been viewed). Cookies may
        also be used to associate you with social networking sites like Facebook and Twitter and, if you so choose, enable interaction between your activities on
        the Platforms and your activities on such social networking sites We, or our vendors, may place cookies or similar files on your Device for security
        purposes, to facilitate site navigation and to personalize your experience while visiting our Platforms (such as allowing us to select which ads or offers

        content from another server.
    </p>

        cookie folder, please refer to your browser's help menu or other instructions related to your browser. If you do disable or opt out of receiving cookies,
        please be aware that some features and services on our Platforms may not work properly because we may not be able to recognize and associate you with your

    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Third Parties Providing Services On Our Behalf</strong>
        We may share your Personal Information with third parties that perform functions on our behalf (or on behalf of our partners) such as service providers
        that host or operate our Platforms, analyze data, process transactions and payments, fulfill orders or provide customer service; advertisers; sponsors or
        other third parties that participate in or administer our promotions, contests, sweepstakes, surveys or provide marketing or promotional assistance and

        Channel, that website will submit to us your email address and other information about you so that we may contact you as requested. You may also choose to
        participate in a third party application or feature (such as one of our Facebook or Twitter applications or a similar application or feature on a third
        party website) through which you allow us to collect (or the third party to share) information about you, including Usage Information and Personal
        Information such as lists of your friends, "likes", comments you have shared, groups and location. Services like Facebook Connect give you the option to
        post information about your activities on our Platform to your profile page to share with others within your network. In addition, we may receive
        information about you if other users of a third party website give us access to their profiles and you are one of their "connections" or information about
        you is otherwise accessible through your "connections'" web page, profile page, or similar page on a social networking or other third party website or
        interactive service. We may supplement the information we collect about you through the Platforms with such information from third parties in order to
        enhance our ability to serve you, to tailor our content to you and/or to offer you opportunities to purchase products or services that we believe may be of
        interest to you.
    </p>

        arising out of, or related to, the destruction of such Personal Information. It may not always possible to completely remove or delete all of your
        information from our databases without some residual data because of backups and other reasons. We will retain your information (including geo-location
        data) for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you services. If you wish to cancel your account or request that we no longer use your
        information to provide you services contact us at privacy@iheartradio.com. We will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal
        obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements. We do not control certain privacy settings and preferences maintained by our social media
        partners like Facebook and Twitter. If you wish to make changes to those settings and preferences, you may do so by visiting the settings page of the
        appropriate social media site.

    <h3>6.	ADVERTISING/BEHAVIORAL TARGETING; HOW TO OPT-OUT.</h3><a name="advert"></a>

    <p>
        We may use third party ad network providers to help present ads on the Platforms, as well as other service providers to evaluate and provide us with
        information about the use of the Platforms and viewing of our content. We do not share Personal Information with these providers (unless, of course, you
        give us permission). Such providers may place and access cookies, pixel tags, or similar technologies on your Device to serve you ads or other content
        personalized to your interests which they infer from your browsing on the Platforms and other sites you have visited. In doing so, the provider collects or
        has access to non-Personal Information such as your Usage Information. The use of cookies, pixel tags, or similar technologies by these providers is
        subject to their own privacy policies, not ours.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you do not want to receive the benefits of targeted advertising, you may opt out of some network advertising programs that use your information by
        visiting the TRUSTe Preference Manager at http://preferences-mgr.truste.com/. Please note that even if you choose to remove your information (opt out), you
        will still see advertisements while you're browsing online. However the advertisements you see may be less relevant to you and your interests.
        Additionally, many network advertising programs allow you to view and manage the interest categories they have compiled from your online browsing
        activities. These interest categories help determine the types of targeted advertisements you may receive. The TRUSTe Preference Manager provides a tool
        that identifies its member companies that have cookies on your browser and provides a mechanism to opt out of receiving cookies from those companies.    <strong><em></em></strong>

    <p>
        The Platforms are not directed to children under 13. We do not knowingly collect, use or disclose personally identifiable information from anyone under 13
        years of age. If we determine upon collection that a user is under this age, we will not use or maintain his/her Personal Information without the
        parent/guardian's consent. If we become aware that we have unknowingly collected personally identifiable information from a child under the age of 13, we
        will make reasonable efforts to delete such information from our records.
    </p>

    <h3>8.	SECURITY OF YOUR INFORMATION.</h3><a name="security"></a>

    <p>
        We take information security seriously; however, no electronic data transmission or storage of information can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. Please note

        content, products, services or privacy policies or practices. These other sites may send their own cookies to your Device, they may independently collect
        data or solicit Personal Information and may or may not have their own published privacy policies. You should also independently assess the authenticity of
        any site which appears or claims that it is one of our Platforms (including those linked to through an email or social networking page).
    </p>
    <p>
        The Platforms may make available chat rooms, forums, message boards, and news groups. Remember that any information that you disclose in these areas
