      	<h3>Privacy and Cookie Policy</h3>      
        <p>IHS Markit is committed to protecting your privacy. &nbsp;This Privacy and Cookie Policy ("Policy") applies to the personal information we collect on this website and the personal information we handle about the individual representatives (which term may include, without limitation, employees, officers or contractors) of our subscribers. </p>
        <p>This Policy describes the type of information we gather and track, how the information is used, with whom the information is shared and how the information is protected.</p>
        <p>In general, you can visit IHS Markit on the internet without disclosing who you are or giving any personal information about yourself. &nbsp;There are times, however, when IHS Markit may need information from you to better serve you.</p>
        <p>Please note that some privacy rights and obligations may differ in certain locations based on local law, in which case IHS Markit will comply with the local legal requirements.</p>
        <h4>1. Collection of Personal Information</h4>
        <p>IHS Markit collects personal information that you voluntarily provide on this website, which may include your name, address, e-mail address, and other contact information. &nbsp;For example, IHS Markit collects personal information when you register to receive more information about certain IHS Markit services or products and or when you submit the information in order to receive support for IHS Markit services or products to which you subscribe. &nbsp;IHS Markit uses this information to communicate with you and to provide you with your requested information or support.</p>
        <p>IHS Markit collects information from its website users in several different manners. One of the most common methods is during an online form submission or registration process, where a website user is requesting a free trial or a courtesy newsletter, registering for an event, or responding to similar offers such as sample reports, white papers or more product information. Additionally, we may collect information that is sent to IHS Markit by your web browser, such as "cookies." Finally, IHS Markit may collect and aggregate data using third party code. However, data collected by these companies is used only by IHS Markit and is not shared with, nor is it accessible to, other companies except as stated herein.</p>
        <p>If you are a representative of one of our subscribers or customers, we may have received personal information about you (such as your name, work title and contact information). &nbsp;You also may provide us with your personal information directly in connection with your use of our offerings. &nbsp;This may include additional contact information, your date of birth, a copy of your passport (required by certain "know your customer" regulations), and payment information.</p>
        <p>If you do not wish to provide such personal information to us, you are not obligated to, but as a result you may not be able to use our website or services. Some of the personal information we request from you is optional. This means that you can elect not to provide it to us and you still will be able to use our website or services. In most cases, we identify required personal information to you by displaying an asterisk (*) next to the field where we request the required personal information. </p>
        <h4>2. Use of Personal Information</h4>
        <p>IHS Markit primarily uses the personal information it collects to: (a) provide you with the services and data to which you are entitled; (b) provide you with other information which you have requested; and (c) to analyze and improve our services. IHS Markit will not sell or rent personal information for direct marketing purposes.</p>
        <p>Where a website user is requesting a free trial or a courtesy newsletter, or registering for an event, IHS Markit may use the personal information it collects to provide you with details of other programs and services that may be of interest to you and share your contact with IHS subsidiaries and affiliates to provide to you details of other programs and services. </p>
        <p>You may instruct IHS Markit at any time not to use your personal information for any of the above purposes by sending an email to <a href="mailto:informationcompliance@IHSMarkit.com">informationcompliance@IHSMarkit.com</a>.</p>
        <p>When used in our website and/or in our e-mails, "tell-a-friend", or another similar sharing tool, allows you to send information about our products and offerings to another person. When you use these tools, we may ask you for the name and information of the other person. &nbsp;That information will be covered by this Policy. &nbsp;We will use it only to send the communication to the applicable friend and for no other purpose.</p>
        <h4>3. Security of Personal Information</h4>
        <p>IHS Markit uses reasonable administrative, technical, and physical measures: (a) to safeguard personal information against loss, theft, unauthorized use, disclosure, or modification; and (b) to ensure the integrity of the personal information.</p>
        <p>To help IHS Markit protect your privacy, you should maintain the confidentiality of the logon details you may have set up in connection with your participation in the website or service.</p>
        <p>From time to time IHS Markit may supplement information you give IHS Markit with information from other sources, such as information validating your address or other available information. &nbsp;This is to help IHS Markit maintain the accuracy of the information we collect and to help us provide a better service.</p>
        <h4>4. Storage Methods and Duration</h4>
        <p>IHS Markit may store your personal information in its databases. &nbsp;The information may be retained and used by IHS Markit for a reasonable period, reflecting IHS Markitâ€™s need to answer queries or resolve problems, provide new and improved services and any data retention requirements of the law.</p>
        <p>IHS Markit may retain information after you have ceased interacting with us. We retain this information when we have a business purpose to do so, such as user authentication or verification checks. Thereafter, we will either delete your personal information or de-identify it so that it is anonymous and not attributed to your identity.</p>
        <p>Your right to request that we delete your personal information is set forth in the "Accuracy of your Personal Information; Your Access and Correction Rights" section below.</p>
        <h4>5. Disclosure of Personal Information</h4>
        <p>IHS Markit may disclose your personal information to unaffiliated third parties if we believe in good faith that such disclosure is necessary: (a) to comply with the law or in response to a court order, government request, or other legal process; (b) to protect the interests, rights, safety, or property of IHS Markit or others; (c) to enforce any contract with you or our Subscriber who you represent, or any terms of service on this website; (d) to provide you with the services or products requested by you (including allowing a purchaser of an IHS Markit division, or IHS Markit as a whole, to continue to serve you), and to perform other activities related to such services and products, including billing and collection; (e) to provide you with information from IHS Markit; or (f) to operate IHS Markit's systems properly.</p>
        <h4>6. Cookies (and Equivalent Technology)</h4>
        <p>IHS Markit sometimes collects non-identifiable information from visits to the website to help provide better customer service. &nbsp;IHS Markit may use this information to analyse trends and statistics and to help provide better customer service.</p>
        <p>IHS Markit will collect such information through the use of various technologies, including "cookies". &nbsp;A cookie is an alphanumeric identifier that we transfer to your computerâ€™s hard drive through your web browser to enable our systems to recognise your browser. </p>
        <p>The cookie may then be stored on your computer as an anonymous tag that identifies your computer but not you. &nbsp;You can set your browser to notify you before you receive a cookie, giving you the chance to decide whether to accept it. &nbsp;You also can set your browser to turn off cookies. &nbsp;If you do so, some pages may not work properly and you do this at your own risk.</p>
        <p>The "help" menu on the menu bar of most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie and how to disable cookies altogether. &nbsp;Additionally, you can disable or delete similar data used by browser add-ons, such as Flash cookies, by changing the add-on's settings or visiting the website of its manufacturer.&nbsp; </p>

        <h4>7. Third-Party Ad Servers and Networks</h4>
        <p>We may use third-party advertising companies to serve advertisements when you visit our website. These companies may use information about your visits to this and other websites, and the region of the country or world where your IP address indicates you are located, in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. </p>
        <p>These advertisements may appear on this website and on other websites. These companies may employ cookies, clear Graphic Interchange Format (GIFs) and other tracking technologies to cause relevant ads to be displayed to you. </p>
        <p>We encourage you to read these businessesâ€™ privacy policies to learn about how they treat your information. &nbsp;For more information about third-party advertisers and how to prevent them from using your information, visit the Network Advertising Initiative (NAIâ€™s) consumer website:</p>

        <h4>8. Accuracy of your Personal Information; Your Access and Correction Rights</h4>
        <p>We encourage you to review, update and correct the personal information that we maintain about you, and you may request that we delete personal information about you that is inaccurate (or label it as such) by contacting us using the "Contact Us" information detailed in the "Contact Us" section below.

        <p>We may ask you to verify your identity and to provide other details before we are able to provide you with any information, correct any inaccuracies, or delete any information. We may charge you an administrative fee to process your request if doing so will require significant resources on our part, but we will inform you before we begin the work.</p>
        <p>Your right to review, update, correct and delete your personal information may be limited: (i) if your requests are abusive or unreasonably excessive, (ii) where the burden or expense of providing you with these rights would be disproportionate to the risks to your privacy, (iii) where the rights or safety of another person or persons would be encroached upon, or (iv) if the information or material you request relates to existing or anticipated legal proceedings between you and us, or providing access to you would prejudice negotiations between us or an investigation of possible unlawful activity.</p>
        <p>Your right to review, update, correct and delete your information is subject to our records retention policies and applicable law, including any statutory retention requirements.</p>
        <h4>9. Transfer of Personal Information </h4>

        <p>In limited circumstances, IHS Markit may disclose personal information to a third party who is providing a service to IHS Markit. IHS Markit will only disclose personal information if the third party has provided satisfactory assurances to IHS Markit of its ability to provide appropriate and sufficient data privacy and security safeguards to protect the personal information from unauthorized disclosure, use or loss. Where IHS Markit learns that a third party is using or disclosing personal information in a manner contrary to this Policy, IHS Markit will take reasonable steps to discontinue such use or disclosure.</p>
        <p>Disclosures to third parties will be only for the purposes described in this Policy, for a compatible purpose, or for a purpose authorized by the data subject.</p>
        <h4>10. Links to Third-Party Websites</h4>
        <p>IHS Markit may provide links to third-party websites. &nbsp;Since IHS Markit does not control third-party sites and is not responsible for any personal information you may provide while on such sites, IHS Markit advises you to read the privacy policies on those websites before providing any of your personal information on such sites.</p>
        <h4>11. Other IHS Markit Services</h4>
        <p>IHS Markit may provide you with access to IHS Markit services through links and/or dedicated frames (collectively, "Other IHS Markit Services").&nbsp; For example, you may have access to a Toolbar provided by our IHS Markit Hub service that allows you, amongst other things, to navigate data and content on both IHS Markit and third party websites.&nbsp; </p>
        <p>Your use of Other IHS Markit Services shall be governed by any applicable terms of use and privacy policies. We recommend you review those before providing any personal information.</p>
