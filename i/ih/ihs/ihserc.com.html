<p>Your right to privacy and to protect your personal information is important to IHS. We recognize that when you provide us with information about yourself, you trust us to act in a responsible manner.</p>
                                  <i></i>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>

      <p>The following discloses our information gathering and usage practices 
        for www.ihs.com and associated websites. This site contains links to other 
        Web sites, but IHS is not responsible for the privacy practices of other 
        Web sites or companies.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

      <p><b>General Principals.</b>&nbsp; IHS Inc. ("IHS" or "we") 
        respect our customers’ wishes with regard to the collection, use 
        and transfer of certain personal information. Personal information as 
        we use it here refers to certain data about an identified or identifiable 
        individual, such as set forth in the European Community Directive on Data 
        Protection (the "EU Directive"). Proper use of personal information 
        is of a high priority to our company, particularly as we are in the data 
        gathering business. We self-certify our policies to the U.S. Department 
        of Commerce Safe Harbor Program (see <a class="nav4" href="http://www.export.gov/safeharbor/" target="_blank">http://www.export.gov/safeharbor/</a>). 
        IHS is committed to protecting its users’ personal information in 
        accordance with the privacy principles set forth in the Safe Harbor Program, 
        as well as other applicable laws and regulations. This Privacy Policy 
        is additionally incorporated into and is a part of the Terms and Conditions 
        of Use of IHS online use and/or online access of products and services.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

      <p><b>Types of Data Collection.</b>&nbsp; IHS operates globally, with offices 
        and operations in over 100 countries. While our primary data centers are 
        in the United States, we will transfer certain information provided by 
        customers to the appropriate office, agent or consultant in order to deliver 
        the products and services requested by our clients. In addition to collecting 
        information via telephone calls, electronic mail and voicemail, IHS may 
        collect, process, use and transfer personally identifiable information 
        directly from its users when the user voluntarily enters information during 
        the registration process. Additionally, use of the various IHS websites 
        may also result in data being collected, processed and transferred. This 
        information may be received by IHS as part of the standard electronic 
        greeting between your computer, the network, and our servers and typically 
        consists of network routing information, equipment (browser) information, 
        date and time. IHS also collects website usage data using third-party 
        code from WebSideStory. Data collected by WebSideStory is used only by 
        IHS and is not shared with, nor is it accessible to, other companies except 
        as stated herein. At this time our server will also query your computer 
        to see if there are "cookies" previously set by IHS to facilitate 
        the log in process. Some IHS websites use cookies to collect information 
        about visitors’ use of its website and to enhance the type of website 
        procedures used by IHS. Cookies collected may include the following information: 
        a unique identifier, user preferences and profile information used to 
        personalize the content shown to the individual users. You may be able 
        to set your web browser to alert you when a cookie is being used, and 
        may use your browser to accept or reject the cookie; additionally, you 
        may also disable the cookie feature on your browser entirely.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p><b>Types of Data Collected and How We Use It.</b>&nbsp; In the paragraph above, we described how we collect certain information, including personal information. The types of personally identifiable information which IHS may collect are primarily used for business contact information. This information may include your e-mail address, internet domain, IP address, full name, title, company affiliation, address, and work phone numbers. IHS currently uses the information for the purposes of providing its users with information or products requested by the user, for providing information on extent of use, whether or not requested by user, to provide customized product and service information, and to allow the user to voluntarily participate in mailings or other events. Additionally, if users of our website are already our customers, or become our customers during the online registration process, we will use personally identifiable user information to provide the user with product service, updates, information and alerts. IHS may also disclose personal information, without notice, if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to: (i) comply with legal process served on IHS; or (ii) protect and defend IHS's property rights in and to its products, or the security or safety of its users and website.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p><b>Notice to Employees.</b>&nbsp; IHS may collect personal information from its employees. This information may be transferred between IHS and its affiliates. Personal information on employees of IHS and its affiliates will only be used in accordance with the IHS Human Resources policy and other appropriate and reasonable guidelines.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

      <p><b>Choices and Preferences.</b>&nbsp; IHS allows its customers to opt-out 
        of email marketing that may result from use of the site. The ability to 
        do so is offered through the registration process and by links in the 
        email marketing materials. Customers may also send an opt out message 
        to <a class="nav4" href="mailto:customerservice@ihsenergy.com">customerservice@ihsenergy.com</a> 
        or <a class="nav4" href="mailto:change_email@ihs.com">change_email@ihs.com</a>. 
        Customers may also update or change their registration profile, including 
        changing the email marketing preferences. There are a few limited exceptions 
        to this opt out ability, but notice is always provided in such communications. 
        The exceptions include: providing updates and patches to currently licensed 
        products, security related information, customer service information for 
        currently licensed products, product downloads, training class information, 
        contract or license related information for currently licensed products.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

      <p>IHS customers may also change or update their profile (entered by the 
        user during the registration process, or in some cases, by IHS from information 
        provided by its corporate customers if the individual user is an employee 
        of a corporate customer who participates in IHS Energy’s "Single 
        Sign On Process"). To change your profile information, please login 
        as usual and follow the prompts to "update my profile." If you 
        need help with this process, please contact <a class="nav4" href="mailto:customerservice@ihsenergy.com">customerservice@ihsenergy.com</a> 
        or <a class="nav4" href="mailto:change_email@ihs.com">change_email@ihs.com</a>.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

      <p><b>Security:</b>&nbsp; IHS takes very seriously the need to protect all 
        personal information from unauthorized access or disclosure. IHS does 
        not lend, lease or sell any personal information collected from its users. 
        Other steps to protect personal information include password protected 
        log-in, ability to audit system access, and robust security computer systems, 
        such as firewalls and screens in place on all of our servers and computer 
        systems. We believe that our security measures provide reasonable barriers 
        against disclosure, unauthorized access, alteration or destruction of 
        personal information in accordance with generally accepted industry standards. 
        Additionally, any IHS employee who has access to personal information 
        are bound by IHS confidentiality obligations.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p><b>Enforcement.</b>&nbsp; IHS has established internal procedures to monitor our compliance with the Safe Harbor Program and applicable privacy laws. Part of our compliance is performing an annual review of our privacy policy, including internal audits and reviews by third party computer and security consultants, as appropriate.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>Any user who feels that his or her personal information has been misused should direct any questions or complaints to <a class="nav4" href="mailto:customerservice@ihsenergy.com">customerservice@ihsenergy.com</a> or <a class="nav4" href="mailto:change_email@ihs.com">change_email@ihs.com</a>. IHS will then take reasonable steps to investigate such questions or complaints. If a user feels that IHS has not appropriately handled the complaint or question, they may then send a written description of their complaint to Legal Department, IHS Energy or IHS Engineering, who will contact the user to try and resolve his or her concerns. IHS will cooperate with the European Union Data Protection Authorities in the applicable European Union Member States and data protection authorities under any applicable privacy laws to resolve the issues.</p>
