                <p>
                    iHire, LLC (hereinafter referred to as “iHire”) has created this Privacy Policy
            to inform you of its collection, use and disclosure practices regarding personal
            information that it collects through iHire, LLC Web Sites. This Privacy Policy applies
            only to data gathered on any web site under iHire’s control (collectively, the "Sites"
            as is defined in the Terms and Conditions), and does not apply to any other information
            or web site. This Privacy Policy incorporates by reference the Terms and Conditions
            for the Sites, which apply to this privacy policy. Please review this Privacy Policy
            periodically as we may update it from time to time. Each time you visit the Sites
            or provide us with information, you are, by doing so, accepting the practices described
            in this Privacy Policy at that time. If we materially change our practices with
            regard to personal information collected under a prior privacy policy, we will endeavor
            to notify you and give you the opportunity to opt out of changes with regard to
            that previously collected information. You agree that by using the Sites you are
            expressly and affirmatively consenting to our use and disclosure of the information
            that you provide, and consenting to receive communications from us which include
            but are not necessarily limited to emails and facsimiles as described below.
                </p>
                <h3>Personal Information</h3>
                <p>
                    In order to operate the Sites in an efficient and effective manner and provide users
            with information on job postings and services that may be of interest to them, iHire
            may collect personal information, including contact information (such as an email
            address), from its users. In addition, this information allows us to provide users
            with private and secure areas to post and modify their original content on our Sites
            (e.g., jobs and resumes). We also automatically track certain information based
            upon your behavior on the Sites and use this information to do internal research
            on our users' demographics, interests, and behavior to better understand, protect
            and serve users in general. This information may include the URL that a User has
            just come from (whether this URL is on our Sites or not), the URL a User goes to
            next (whether this URL is on our Sites or not), a user's computer browser information,
            mouse clicks, mouse movements, scrolling activity, text that is typed and Users
            IP address. This information is collected via ClickTale web analytics services.
            ClickTale does not track your browsing habits across web sites that do not use ClickTale
            services. You can chose to disable the ClickTale services at <a href="http://www.clicktale.net/disable.html" target="_blank">http://www.clicktale.net/disable.html</a>. You agree that iHire
            may use your personal information to contact you and deliver information to you
            that, in some cases, is targeted to your interests (such as relevant job postings,
            services, advertisements, educational or other career development opportunities),
            or provide administrative notices or communications applicable to your use of the
            Sites. By accepting this Privacy Policy, you expressly agree to receive this information
            via email, facsimile or by any other mode of communication provided by you. If you
            do not wish to receive these communications, we encourage you to opt out of any
            further receipt by following the opt out provisions provided in each such communication.
            iHire may also aggregate certain non-personally identifiable information about its
            users (such as occupation, location, education and experience) and use such anonymous
            information to prepare reports that it provides to its Users.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We do not sell our Users' personally identifiable information to anyone for any
            reason if the User has indicated a desire for us to keep the information private.
            iHire reserves the right to retain Users’ personally identifiable information, resumes,
            cover letters and any other documents indefinitely.
                </p>
                <p>
                    All Users should be aware, however, that when they choose to display or distribute
            personal information (such as their email address, facsimile number or resume) via
            the Sites or any other distribution method, that information can be collected and
            used by others. This may result in unsolicited messages from third parties for which
            iHire is not responsible. Also, you may have arrived at the Sites by following a
            link from a iHire affiliate or other affiliate’s web site. If so, please be aware
            that iHire may share your information with that affiliate and the affiliate may
            use the information consistent with its privacy policy instead of this one.
                </p>
                <p>
                    iHire may also disclose specific user information when we determine that such disclosure
            is necessary to comply with the law, to cooperate with or seek assistance from law
            enforcement or to protect the interests or safety of iHire or other users of the
            Sites. In addition, personal information we have collected may be passed on to a
            third party in the event of a transfer of ownership or assets or a bankruptcy of
            iHire. Such disclosures may be made with or without your consent, and with or without
            notice.
                </p>
                <h3>Credit Card Security</h3>
                <p>
                    iHire employs encryption for secure credit card transactions.
                </p>
                <h3>About Cookies</h3>
                <p>
                    iHire uses cookies for the protection and convenience of our Users. Cookies enable
            us to serve secure pages to our Users without asking them to sign in repeatedly.
            iHire may store non-personally identifying information about you such as past jobs
            viewed and job searches conducted by your computer in a cookie that it places on
            your computer. We do this in order to present you with job recommendations based
            on your interests as expressed previously through your searches. Most Internet browsers
            enable you to erase cookies from your computer hard drive, block all cookies, or
            receive a warning before a cookie is stored. Please be aware; however, that some
            iHire features or services may not function properly without cookies. In addition,
            some of the employers that use our Sites may place cookies on your computer in the
            event that you click and go onto their website and leave the iHire Sites. Employers
            may use such cookies to distinguish your web browser uniquely. Often, Employers
            use such information to track the effectiveness of their job postings by measuring
            how many users who view their postings later became job applicants.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We may use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit the Sites.
            Such ads may provide links to third party sites. iHire does not endorse these third
            party sites and is not responsible for the content of linked third-party sites and
            does not make any representations regarding the content or accuracy of materials
            on such third-party web sites. If you decide to access linked third-party web sites,
            you do so at your own risk. These companies may use information about your visits
            to these and other web sites in order to provide advertisements about goods and
            services of interest to you. The third party advertising companies who deliver ads
            for iHire on the Sites may place or access cookies on your computer when you click
            on their site to distinguish your web browser and to keep track of information relating
            to serving ads on your web browser, such as the type of ads shown on the Sites.
            The third party advertising companies may use cookies to keep track of the web sites
            that your web browser visits across the advertising provider’s network of web sites
            with whom it works. These companies may combine this information with other information
            they have collected relating to your web browser’s activities across their network
            of web sites. These third party companies operate under their own privacy policies
            and iHire encourages you to be aware of the privacy policies of such companies before
            you choose to allow them to place a cookie on your web browser by clicking on their
            site. iHire does not have control over or access to any information contained in
            the cookies that are set on your computer by third party advertisers.
                </p>
                <h3>What You Should Know </h3>
                <p>
                    iHire cannot ensure that all of your private communications and other personal information
            will never be disclosed in ways not otherwise described in this Privacy Policy.
            Therefore, although we are committed to protecting your privacy, we do not promise,
            and you should not expect, that your personal information or private communications
            will always remain private. As a User of the Sites, you understand and agree that
            you assume all responsibility and risk for your use of the Sites, the Internet generally,
            and the documents and/or material you post or access and for your conduct on and
            off the Sites.
                </p>
                <h3>Your California Privacy Rights</h3>
                <p>
                    California law permits its residents to request and receive information about a
            business’ disclosure of certain categories of personal information to other companies
            for their use in direct marketing. If you are a California resident and a user of
            any of the Sites, you can request a copy of this information from iHire by sending

            name and email address in email requests, and your name and postal address in mail

                <h3>Other Privacy Features On the Sites</h3>
                <p>
                    You never need to provide personally identifiable data to search for jobs on our

            give you access to more information and prospects).

                    Posting your resume on the Sites puts you in front of Employers with open positions
            each day. When you post your resume, we automatically create a registration for
            you using the email address and password that you supply. When you return to the
            Sites in the future you will use that same email address and password to access
            and edit your existing resume. Posting your resume gives you the most visibility
            to the broadest Employer audience possible by making your resume searchable in our
            Candidate Database. Any registered Employer user who purchases access to the database
            can view your resume and contact details (to the extent you include them in your
            resume).
                </p>
                <p>
                    You may remove your resume from our searchable database at any time. However, employers,
            recruiters and others who have paid for access to that database, as well as parties
            who have otherwise gained access to the database may have retained a copy of your
            resume in their own files or databases. We cannot control the retention, use or
            privacy of resumes or profiles that have been downloaded by third parties. Accordingly,
            you should not put information you would not want made public in your resume.
