<h4>Privacy Policy</h4>
            <p>We at the Institute for HealthCare Improvement (IHI), believe that 
              you have the right to know how your personal information may be 
              used or disclosed. You take your privacy seriously, and we respect 
              your concerns. Accordingly, we have created this Privacy Statement 
              in order to describe how we collect information, what we do with 
              it, and what controls you have. Please read it carefully, and if 
              you have any questions or concerns, please send us a comment at 
              <a href="mailto:info@ihi.org">info@ihi.org</a>. Unless otherwise 
              indicated, this Privacy Statement applies only to information collected 
              via the IHI.org website. "Information" means information 
              about you that is personally identifiable such as your name, address, 
              email address, phone number, credit card information, areas of interest 
              data related to your improvement work, and other information about 
              you that is not otherwise publicly available. This policy does not 
              apply to the practices of companies that IHI does not own or control, 
              or to people that IHI does not employ or manage. </p>
            <p><b>Gathering of Information</b><br>
              We collect data from you ("Information") in different 
              ways and on many different parts of our website including: when 
              you register for IHI.org; when you download or use articles and 
              information; when you comment on content; when you use the search 
              function; when you share your improvement stories, tools and other 
              resources, or even when you are just perusing the site and reading 
              content. </p>
            <p><b>Use of Information</b><br>
              We may collect Information that you choose to share with us when 
              you register for the website. This Information is only collected 
              with your permission and may be updated or deleted by you at any 
              time. If you choose these options during your registration, we may 
              use your Information to send you a newsletter or email messages 
              with updates and notices concerning new content posted to the site 
              and/or products or services that we think might be of interest to 
              you. Completing the registration information allows us to better 
              understand you, your position, your organization type and interests. 
              If at any time you would like to stop getting this email information 
              you can do so by emailing <a href="mailto:info@ihi.org">info@ihi.org</a>.</p>
            <p>When visiting any website, your browser sends information to the 
              site's hosting server identifying the browser you are using, your 
              Internet Service Provider, the page you last visited, and the page 
              you are currently visiting. We log this Information. We may also 
              track and catalog the search terms that you enter in search forms. 
              We make use of a standard feature of browser software called a "cookie" 
              that helps us recognize you when you visit. We store your email 
              address in a cookie file and place the file on the hard drive of 
              your computer. Most browsers accept cookies. However, if you wish, 
              you can usually set your browser to refuse cookies. If you set your 
              browser to refuse cookies, you will need to log in to the site each 
              time you visit. </p>
            <p><b>Access to Information</b><br>
              IHI.org, the Institute for Healthcare Improvement and its employees 
              have access to your Information. We use all of this Information 
              to administer and improve the operations of IHI.org. Aggregate Information 
              or data on visitors to our site and how the site is being used, 
              including the pages users are viewing, will also be logged. Aggregate 
              data does not identify individuals but rather describes data as 
              a whole. We may also share aggregate Information with market analysts, 
              advertisers, business partners, sponsors, and any other third parties. 
            </p>
            <p>We may allow third party service providers and consultants access 
              to Information on an as-needed basis. We may also share Information 
              as required by law or to cooperate with legal authorities in a criminal 
              investigation. </p>
            <p><b>Third Parties/Links</b><br>
              IHI.org links to other sites. Please recognize that we cannot control 
              the use or security of your Information once it leaves our hands. 
              If you have any concerns regarding the security or privacy of our 
              affiliates, we encourage you to review their privacy policies or 
              even to contact them directly. IHI.org and the Institute for Healthcare 
              Improvement are not responsible for the privacy practices, data 
              collection, security or content of other websites. We treat any 
              Information we receive from third parties as carefully as the Information 
              you provide to us directly. </p>
            <p>Please remember that when you respond to a classified advertisement 
              by email you are sending information to a third party and not to 
              the Institute for Healthcare Improvement or IHI.org. We cannot control 
              the use or security of any Information that you send to a third 
              party, so please be careful. </p>
            <p><b> Extranet Functionality</b><br>
              IHI encourages robust information sharing over the extranet between 
              authorized users. If you use the extranet, please remember that 
              other authorized extranet users can view the information you share. 
              You should exercise caution when disclosing any sensitive information. 
              Never give out personal information such as your name, address, 
              phone number or social security number. Never give out information 
              about an organization, a patient or another person if you do not 
              have the express authority or permission to share that information 
              publicly.
            </p>
            <p><b>Security</b><br>
              We use industry-standard SSL (Secure Socket Layer) encryption technology, 
              a secure server, and other physical and procedural safeguards to 
              protect the security of your personal Information. Please understand, 
              however, that no security system is impenetrable. We cannot guarantee 
              the security of our databases, nor can we guarantee that the Information 
              you supply will not be intercepted while being transmitted to us 
              over the Internet. Please keep your password private. We will never 
              ask for it by phone or email, and neither should anyone else. </p>
            <p>You may wish to delete unknown email attachments before opening 
              them as they can contain destructive viruses. Remember that nothing 
              you write on the Web is completely private — including email. 
            </p>
            <p><b>Viewing and Updating Your Information</b><br>
              You may view and correct your Information by accessing the "My 
              IHI" link on the left hand of the website. Please note that 
              you must log in with your private user name and password to access 
              your Profile. </p>
            <p>By using IHI.org, you consent to the collection and use of your 
              Information as we have outlined in this Privacy Statement and our 
              Terms of Use. If you do not agree to our policy, you may not use 
              IHI.org. We may change our policies at any time and without prior 
              notice. If we decide to change this Privacy Statement, we will post 
              the changes to this page so that users may be aware of our actions. 
              Your continued use of IHI.org following a posting of changes to 
              this Privacy Statement will mean that you accept those changes. 
            </p>
