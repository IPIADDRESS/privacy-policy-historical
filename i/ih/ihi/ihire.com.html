                    information that it collects through iHire, LLC Web Sites. This Privacy Policy applies
                    only to data gathered on any web site under iHire's control (collectively, the "Sites"
                    as is defined in the Terms and Conditions), and does not apply to any other information
                    or web site. This Privacy Policy incorporates by reference the Terms and Conditions
                    for the Sites, which apply to this privacy policy. Please review this Privacy Policy
                    periodically as we may update it from time to time. Each time you visit the Sites
                    or provide us with information, you are, by doing so, accepting the practices described
                    in this Privacy Policy at that time. If we materially change our practices with

                </p>
                <p>
                    In order to operate the Sites in an efficient and effective manner and provide users
                    with information on job postings and services that may be of interest to them, iHire
                    may collect personal information, including contact information (such as an email
                    address), from its users. In addition, this information allows us to provide users
                    with private and secure areas to post and modify their original content on our Sites
                    (e.g., jobs and resumes). We also automatically track certain information based
                    upon your behavior on the Sites and use this information to do internal research
                    on our users' demographics, interests, and behavior to better understand, protect
                    and serve users in general. This information may include the URL that a User has
                    just come from (whether this URL is on our Sites or not), the URL a User goes to
                    next (whether this URL is on our Sites or not), a user's computer browser information,
                    mouse clicks, mouse movements, scrolling activity, text that is typed and Users
                    IP address. You agree that iHire
                    may use your personal information to contact you and deliver information to you
                    that, in some cases, is targeted to your interests (such as relevant job postings,
                    services, advertisements, educational or other career development opportunities),
                    or provide administrative notices or communications applicable to your use of the
                    Sites. By accepting this Privacy Policy, you expressly agree to receive this information
                    via email, facsimile or by any other mode of communication provided by you. If you
                    do not wish to receive these communications, we encourage you to opt out of any
                    further receipt by following the opt out provisions provided in each such communication.
                    iHire may also aggregate certain non-personally identifiable information about its
                    users (such as occupation, location, education and experience) and use such anonymous
                    information to prepare reports that it provides to its Users.
                </p>

                <p>
                    We do not sell our Users' personally identifiable information to anyone for any
                    reason if the User has indicated a desire for us to keep the information private.
                    iHire reserves the right to retain Users' personally identifiable information, resumes,
                    cover letters and any other documents indefinitely.
                </p>
                <p>
                    All Users should be aware, however, that when they choose to display or distribute
                    personal information (such as their email address, facsimile number or resume) via
                    the Sites or any other distribution method, that information can be collected and
                    used by others. This may result in unsolicited messages from third parties for which
                    iHire is not responsible. Also, you may have arrived at the Sites by following a
                    link from a iHire affiliate or other affiliate's web site. If so, please be aware
                    that iHire may share your information with that affiliate and the affiliate may
                    use the information consistent with its privacy policy instead of this one.
                </p>
                <p>
                    iHire may also disclose specific user information when we determine that such disclosure
                    is necessary to comply with the law, to cooperate with or seek assistance from law
                    enforcement or to protect the interests or safety of iHire or other users of the
                    Sites. In addition, personal information we have collected may be passed on to a
                    third party in the event of a transfer of ownership or assets or a bankruptcy of
                    iHire. Such disclosures may be made with or without your consent, and with or without
                    notice.
                </p>


                <h3>Credit Card Security</h3>

                <h3>About Cookies</h3>
                <p>
                    iHire uses cookies for the protection and convenience of our Users. Cookies enable
                    us to serve secure pages to our Users without asking them to sign in repeatedly.
                    iHire may store non-personally identifying information about you such as past jobs
                    viewed and job searches conducted by your computer in a cookie that it places on
                    your computer. We do this in order to present you with job recommendations based
                    on your interests as expressed previously through your searches. Most Internet browsers
                    enable you to erase cookies from your computer hard drive, block all cookies, or
                    receive a warning before a cookie is stored. Please be aware; however, that some
                    iHire features or services may not function properly without cookies. In addition,
                    some of the employers that use our Sites may place cookies on your computer in the
                    event that you click and go onto their website and leave the iHire Sites. Employers
                    may use such cookies to distinguish your web browser uniquely. Often, Employers
                    use such information to track the effectiveness of their job postings by measuring
                    how many users who view their postings later became job applicants.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We may use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit the Sites.
                    Such ads may provide links to third party sites. iHire does not endorse these third
                    party sites and is not responsible for the content of linked third-party sites and
                    does not make any representations regarding the content or accuracy of materials
                    on such third-party web sites. If you decide to access linked third-party web sites,
                    you do so at your own risk. These companies may use information about your visits
                    to these and other web sites in order to provide advertisements about goods and
                    services of interest to you. The third party advertising companies who deliver ads

                    California law permits its residents to request and receive information about a

                <h3>Some Important Tips To Use When Dealing With Prospective Employers</h3>

                <ul>
                    <li>Never give out your social security number to a prospective employer </li>
                    <li>
                        Never provide credit card or bank numbers or engage in a monetary transaction of
                        any sort
                    </li>
                    <li>Be cautious when dealing with contacts outside of your own country </li>
                    <li>
                        Do not provide any non-work related personal information (i.e. eye color, marital
                        status, etc.) over the phone or online
                    </li>
                </ul>


                <h3>Other Privacy Features On the Sites</h3>
                <p>
                    You never need to provide personally identifiable data to search for jobs on our
                    Sites. Logging into the Sites is always optional for you (although logging in does
                    give you access to more information and prospects).
                </p>


                <h3>Post a Resume</h3>
                <p>
                    Posting your resume on the Sites puts you in front of Employers with open positions
                    each day. When you post your resume, we automatically create a registration for
                    you using the email address and password that you supply. When you return to the
                    Sites in the future you will use that same email address and password to access
                    and edit your existing resume. Posting your resume gives you the most visibility
                    to the broadest Employer audience possible by making your resume searchable in our
                    Candidate Database. Any registered Employer user who purchases access to the database
                    can view your resume and contact details (to the extent you include them in your
                    resume).
                </p>
                <p>
                    You may remove your resume from our searchable database at any time. However, employers,
                    recruiters and others who have paid for access to that database, as well as parties
                    who have otherwise gained access to the database may have retained a copy of your
                    resume in their own files or databases. We cannot control the retention, use or
                    privacy of resumes or profiles that have been downloaded by third parties. Accordingly,
                    you should not put information you would not want made public in your resume.
