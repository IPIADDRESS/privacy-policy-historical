                <p>General Privacy Information</p>
			Last Updated: July 27, 2010<br>
			<br>
			Insiders-Edge.com strives to offer its visitors the many advantages of 
			Internet technology and to provide an interactive and personalized experience. 
			We may use Personally Identifiable Information (your name, e-mail address, 
			street address, telephone number) subject to the terms of this privacy policy. 
			We will never sell, barter, or rent your email address to any unauthorized third 
			party. Period."<br>
			<br>
			How we gather information from users<br>
			<br>
			How we collect and store information depends on the page you are visiting, the 
			activities in which you elect to participate and the services provided. For 
			example, you may be asked to provide information when you register for access to 
			certain portions of our site or request certain features, such as newsletters or 
			when you make a purchase. You may provide information when you participate in 
			sweepstakes and contests, message boards and chat rooms, and other interactive 
			areas of our site. Like most Web sites, Insiders-Edge.com also collects 
			information automatically and through the use of electronic tools that may be 
			transparent to our visitors. For example, we may log the name of your Internet 
			Service Provider or use cookie technology to recognize you and hold information 
			from your visit. Among other things, the cookie may store your user name and 
			password, sparing you from having to re-enter that information each time you 
			visit, or may control the number of times you encounter a particular 
			advertisement while visiting our site. As we adopt additional technology, we may 
			also gather information through other means. In certain cases, you can choose 
			not to provide us with information, for example by setting your browser to 
			refuse to accept cookies, but if you do you may be unable to access certain 
			portions of the site or may be asked to re-enter your user name and password, 
			and we may not be able to customize the sites features according to your 
			preferences.<br>
			<br>
			What we do with the information we collect<br>
			<br>
			Like other Web publishers, we collect information to enhance your visit and 
			deliver more individualized content and advertising. We respect your privacy and 
			do not share your information with anyone.<br>
			<br>
			Aggregated Information (information that does not personally identify you) may 
			be used in many ways. For example, we may combine information about your usage 
			patterns with similar information obtained from other users to help enhance our 
			site and services (e.g., to learn which pages are visited most or what features 
			are most attractive). Aggregated Information may occasionally be shared with our 
			advertisers and business partners. Again, this information does not include any 
			Personally Identifiable Information about you or allow anyone to identify you 
			individually.<br>
			<br>
			We may use Personally Identifiable Information collected on 
			Insiders-Edge.com 
			to communicate with you about your registration and customization preferences; 
			our Terms of Service and privacy policy; services and products offered by 
			Insiders-Edge.com and other topics we think you might find of interest. <br>
			<br>
			Personally Identifiable Information collected by Insiders-Edge.com may also 
			be used for other purposes, including but not limited to site administration, 
			troubleshooting, processing of e-commerce transactions, administration of 
			sweepstakes and contests, and other communications with you. Certain third 
			parties who provide technical support for the operation of our site (our Web 
			hosting service for example) may access such information. We will use your 
			information only as permitted by law. In addition, from time to time as we 
			continue to develop our business, we may sell, buy, merge or partner with other 
			companies or businesses. In such transactions, user information may be among the 
			transferred assets. We may also disclose your information in response to a court 
			order, at other times when we believe we are reasonably required to do so by 
			law, in connection with the collection of amounts you may owe to us, and/or to 
			law enforcement authorities whenever we deem it appropriate or necessary. Please 
			note we may not provide you with notice prior to disclosure in such cases.<br>
			<br>
			Affiliated sites, linked sites and advertisements<br>
			<br>
			Insiders-Edge.com expects its partners, advertisers and affiliates to respect 
			the privacy of our users. Be aware, however, that third parties, including our 
			partners, advertisers, affiliates and other content providers accessible through 
			our site, may have their own privacy and data collection policies and practices. 
			For example, during your visit to our site you may link to, or view as part of a 
			frame on a Insiders-Edge.com page, certain content that is actually created 
			or hosted by a third party. Also, through Insiders-Edge.com you may be 
			introduced to, or be able to access, information, Web sites, features, contests 
			or sweepstakes offered by other parties. Insiders-Edge.com is not responsible 
			for the actions or policies of such third parties. You should check the 
			applicable privacy policies of those third parties when providing information on 
			a feature or page operated by a third party.<br>
			<br>
			While on our site, our advertisers, promotional partners or other third parties 
			may use cookies or other technology to attempt to identify some of your 
			preferences or retrieve information about you. For example, some of our 
			advertising is served by third parties and may include cookies that enable the 
			advertiser to determine whether you have seen a particular advertisement before. 
			Other features available on our site may offer services operated by third 
			parties and may use cookies or other technology to gather information. 
			Insiders-Edge.com does not control the use of this technology by third 
			parties or the resulting information, and is not responsible for any actions or 
			policies of such third parties.<br>
			<br>
			You should also be aware that if you voluntarily disclose Personally 
			Identifiable Information on message boards or in chat areas, that information 
			can be viewed publicly and can be collected and used by third parties without 
			our knowledge and may result in unsolicited messages from other individuals or 
			third parties. Such activities are beyond the control of 
			Insiders-Edge.com 
			and this policy.<br>
			<br>
			Children<br>
			<br>
			Insiders-Edge.com does not knowingly collect or solicit Personally 
			Identifiable Information from or about children under 13 except as permitted by 
			law. If we discover we have received any information from a child under 13 in 
			violation of this policy, we will delete that information immediately. If you 
			believe Insiders-Edge.com has any information from or about anyone under 13, 
			please contact us at the address listed below.<br>
			<br>
			Contacting Us.<br>
			<br>
			If you have questions or concerns, we can be reached through our
			<a href="http://www.insiders-support.com/helpdesk">Helpdesk</a>.<br>
			<br>
			Changes to this Policy<br>
			<br>
			Insiders-Edge.com reserves the right to change this policy at any time. 
			Please check this page periodically for changes. Your continued use of our site 
			following the posting of changes to these terms will mean you accept those 
			changes. Information collected prior to the time any change is posted will be 
			used according to the rules and laws that applied at the time the information 
			was collected.<br>
			<br>
			Governing law<br>
			<br>
			This policy and the use of this Site are governed by New York law. If a 
			dispute arises under this Policy we agree to first try to resolve it with the 
			help of a mutually agreed-upon mediator in the following location: Suffolk
            County. Any costs and fees other than attorney fees associated with 
			the mediation will be shared equally by each of us.<br>
			<br>
			If it proves impossible to arrive at a mutually satisfactory solution through 
			mediation, we agree to submit the dispute to binding arbitration at the 
			following location: Suffolk County, under the rules of the American 
			Arbitration Association. Judgment upon the award rendered by the arbitration may 
			be entered in any court with jurisdiction to do so.<br>
			<br>
			Insiders-Edge.com is controlled, operated and administered entirely within 
			New York. This statement and the policies outlined herein are not intended to 
			and do not create any contractual or other legal rights in or on behalf of any 
			party.
