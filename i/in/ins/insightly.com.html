<h2>Information Related to Data Collected for our Clients</h2>
<p>Insightly collects information under the direction of its clients and has no direct relationship with the individuals whose personal data it processes. </p>
<p><strong>Choice</strong> – We collect information for our clients, if you are a customer of one of our Clients and would no longer like to be contacted by one of our Clients that use our service, please contact the client that you interact with directly.</p>

<h2>Cookies</h2>
<p>When visiting the Site or using the Service, we use session “cookies” – a piece of information stored on your computer – to allow the Site or Service to uniquely identify your browser while you are logged in and to enable Insightly to process your online transactions. Session cookies also help us confirm your identity and are required in order to use the Service. Insightly uses persistent cookies that only Insightly can read and use, to identify a user as a Insightly customer and make it easier for you to log in to the Service. Users who disable their web browsers’ ability to accept cookies will be able to browse our Site, but will not be able to access or take advantage of the Service. The use of cookies by our partners and service providers is not covered by our privacy policy. We do not have access or control over these cookies. Our partners and service providers may use session ID and persistent cookies to make it easier for you to navigate our site.</p>

<h2>Analytics / Log Files</h2>
<p>As is true of most web sites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. This information includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data. </p>
<p>We use this information, which does not identify individual users, to analyze trends, to administer the site, to track users’ movements around the site and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. We do not link this automatically-collected data to personal information. </p>
<h2>Information Sharing</h2>
<p>Except as described in this policy, Insightly will not give, sell, rent, or loan any personal information to any third party. We may disclose such information to respond to subpoenas, court orders, or legal process, or to establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims. We may also share such information if we believe it is necessary in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of our Terms of Service, or as otherwise required by law. Insightly may also provide non-personal, summary or group statistics about our customers, sales, traffic patterns, and related Site information to reputable third-party vendors, but these statistics will include no personal information. </p>
<h2>Children’s Personal Information</h2>

Insightly maintains reasonable security measures to protect your information from loss, destruction, misuse, unauthorized access or disclosure. When you enter sensitive information, such as a credit card number, on our order forms, we encrypt the transmission of that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). These technologies help ensure that your data is safe, secure, and only available to you and to those you provided authorized access. However, no data transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure due to the nature of the distributed network that is the Internet.</p>

In some cases, we may not be able to remove your personal information, in which case we will let you know if we are unable to do so and why.</p>
<h2>Social Media Widgets</h2>
<p>Our web site includes social media features, such as the Facebook Like button and widgets, such as the ShareThis button or interactive mini-programs that run on our site. These features may collect your IP address, which page you are visiting on our site, and may set a cookie to enable the feature to function properly.
