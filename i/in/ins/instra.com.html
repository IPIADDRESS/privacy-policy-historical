          <li>Our web site may contain links to third party web sites who may collect personal
            information about you. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of other
            businesses or the content of web sites that are linked to our web site. Domain Directors
            Pty Ltd encourages users to be aware when they leave the site and to read the privacy
            statements of each and every web site that collects personally identifiable information.
          </li>
        </ol>
      <h2 id="3">Security and storage</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>Domain Directors Pty Ltd places a great importance on the security of all information
            associated with our customers, clients and contractors. We have security measures
            in place to attempt to protect against the loss, misuse and alteration of personal
            information under our control. </li>
          <li>Personal information is de-identified or destroyed securely when no longer required
            by us. </li>
          <li>Domain Directors Pty Ltd retains the information you provide to us including your
            contact and credit card details to enable us to verify transactions and customer
            details and to retain adequate records for legal and accounting purposes. This information

            SSL locks all critical information passed from you to us, such as payment information,

            be intercepted. The transfer of information across any media may involve a certain
            degree of risk, and the internet is no exception. As a result, while we take all

            are solely responsible for keeping your passwords and/or account information secure
            and should take all reasonable steps to do so. </li>
        </ol>
        
        <h2 id="4">WHOIS Policy</h2>
        <p>
          The public WHOIS service is a standard feature of domain name systems around the world. 
          The purpose of the WHOIS service is to allow users to query a domain name to find out the identity and contact details of the registrant. 
          The WHOIS service is provided by the registry via a web-based tool and Port 43.  
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Collection of WHOIS Data
            <ol type="i">
              <li>
                Data about each domain name registration is collected from the registrant by the registrar, and submitted to the registry in accordance with the procedural requirements of the registry. 
                The WHOIS service displays a subset of the full registry data for each domain name (known as the "WHOIS data").
              </li>
              <li>
                Under the Registrar Agreement, and in accordance with Australian privacy legislation, registrars must inform registrants of the fact that some of their personal information will be disclosed on the WHOIS service.
                Under the domain name licence agreement, registrants grant to the registry the right to disclose information for the purposes of maintaining the WHOIS service.
              </li>
              <li>
                Due to the policy requirements in the .au domain, the WHOIS data that is collected by registrars at the time of registration is highly accurate and reliable.
                However, the integrity of the WHOIS database is undermined if the data is not kept up-to-date. 
              </li>
              <li>
                In order to maintain the integrity of the WHOIS database, registrants are required to notify their registrar of any changes to WHOIS data for their domain name(s) and the registrar must update the WHOIS database on receipt of new information from the registrant.
              </li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li>
            Disclosure of WHOIS Data
            <ol type="i">
              <li>
                The table in <a target="_blank" href="http://domaindirectors.com.au/policies/scheduleAtable.pdf">Schedule A</a> lists the data fields that will be disclosed on the WHOIS service (web-based and Port 43) for all domain names in the open 2LDs.
              </li>
              <li>
                In order to comply with Australian privacy legislation, the street address, telephone and facsimile numbers of registrants will not be disclosed.
              </li>
              <li>
                It is necessary for the WHOIS data to include a contact email address for the registrant, for the purpose of contacting the registrant in relation to their domain name.
                The registrant does not have to nominate their own personal email address, but they must nominate an email address at which they can be contacted.
              </li>
              <li>
                To address user concerns about privacy and spam, and in line with international best practice, auDA has implemented Image Verification Check (IVC) on the web-based WHOIS service. 
                The purpose of IVC is to prevent or hinder unauthorised access to WHOIS data by automated data mining programs or scripts.
                For consistency, auDA has removed all email addresses from Port 43 WHOIS responses; users of Port 43 WHOIS will be referred to the web-based WHOIS service to access email addresses via IVC.
              </li>
              <li>
                In the past, it was possible to use WHOIS to find out the creation and/or expiry date of a domain name. 
                This enabled some members of the domain name industry to send unsolicited renewal notices to registrants with whom they did not have a prior business relationship, causing significant levels of customer confusion. 
                As a result of these problems, auDA has determined that creation, renewal and expiry dates will not be disclosed on the WHOIS service. Registrants who wish to check the creation, renewal or expiry date of their own domain name can do so through their registrar or reseller.
              </li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li>
            Use of WHOIS Data
            <p>In the interests of protecting the privacy of registrants, the following activities are strictly prohibited:</p>
            <ol type="a">
              <li>use of WHOIS data to allow, enable or otherwise support the transmission of unsolicited communications to any person, by any means;</li>
              <li>use of WHOIS data to support an automated electronic query process; and</li>
              <li>bulk access to WHOIS data (ie. where a user is able to access WHOIS data other than by sending individual queries to the database).</li>
            </ol>
          </li>
        </ol>
        
        <h2 id="5">Access to and correction of personal information</h2>
