They also describe the choices available to you regarding our Use of Your Information and how you can access and update Your Information. Please read this Privacy Policy and the <a href="/about-us/terms-and-conditions">Terms of Use</a> carefully.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="StandardL1"><b><i>Information We Collect and Receive About You </i></b></p>
<p>We might receive or collect several types of information about you, such as the information described below.</p>

<li>When you participate in forums or provide user generated content or submissions.</li>
</ul>
<p><span>Information Third Parties Provide</span></p>
<p>We may collect information about you from sources other than you, such as from social media websites (i.e., Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter or others), blogs, other users and our business partners.</p>
<p><span>General Use and Preference Information</span></p>
<p>We may collect, receive and store information regarding your general use of our Services (such as details of how and when you used our Services, interactions with our Services, log in information, resources that you access, your Internet protocol address, your browser type, and your device type), as well as your preferences.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Device Information</span></p>
<p>When you use our Services through your computer, mobile phone or other device, we may collect information regarding and related to your device, such as hardware models and IDs, device type, operating system version, the request type, the content of your request and basic usage information about your use of our Services, such as date and time.&nbsp; In addition, we may collect information regarding application-level events and associate that with your account to provide customer service.&nbsp; We may also collect and store information locally on your device using mechanisms such as browser web storage and application data caches.<b></b></p>
<p><span>Location Information</span></p>
<p>If you enable the collection of location information on your device, then we may collect information about your actual location, such as your mobile device’s GPS coordinates.&nbsp; We may also use other technologies to determine your location (such as through the location of nearby Wi-Fi access points or cell towers), or obtain your location information from third parties.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Phone Numbers</span></p>
<p>We may collect your phone number in several ways.&nbsp; For example, we may collect your phone number: (i) if you submit your phone number to us through our Services; (ii) by capturing your phone number if you call us; or (iii) if a third party provides your phone number to us.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Cookies and Anonymous Identifiers</span></p>
<p>We and third parties use various technologies to collect and store information when you use our Services, including sending cookies, pixel tags or other anonymous identifiers to your device.&nbsp; “Cookies” are pieces of data stored on your computer, mobile phone or other device.&nbsp; A “pixel tag” is a type of technology placed within a website or email for the purpose of tracking activity, which is often used in combination with cookies.&nbsp; Other “anonymous identifiers” are random strings of characters used for the same purposes as cookies, such as with mobile devices where cookie technology is not available.&nbsp; These technologies help us know that you are logged on, provide you with features based on your preferences, understand when you are interacting with our Services, and compile other information regarding use of our Services.</p>
<p>The information collected through these technologies, standing alone, cannot be used to determine your identity.&nbsp; Such information may, however, be combined in a way that makes it become personally identifiable information (i.e., information that can identify you).&nbsp; If this happens, we will treat the combined information as personally identifiable information.</p>
<p>Please note that, in most cases, you can remove or block cookies (such as by using the settings in your browser), but doing so may affect your ability to use our Services.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The use of tracking technologies by our service providers, technology partners or other third party assets (such as social media) on the Services is not covered by our Privacy Policy.&nbsp; These third parties may use cookies, clear gifs, images, and scripts to help them better manage their content on our Services.&nbsp;&nbsp; We do not have access or control over these technologies.<b></b></p>

<p class="StandardL1"><b><i>How We Disclose Information </i></b></p>
<p><span>General Disclosure of Your Information</span></p>
<p>We may disclose Your Information:</p>
<ul>
<li>To any person who, in our reasonable judgment, is authorized to receive Your Information as your agent, including as a result of your business dealings with that person (for example, your attorney);</li>
