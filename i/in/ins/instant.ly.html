<h3>How do we share the information that we collect?</h3>
<p><strong>Personal Information.</strong> Personal information which we collect for a particular purpose will only be saved and used for that purpose, unless you have agreed to allow us to use it for some other purpose, as described in this Privacy Policy. For example, if you provide your personal information in connection with a request for customer support, we will use your personal information to contact you regarding such request. In sum, we use your personal information to provide you with our services, monitor and improve our services, enforce the Website’s polices and terms, prevent undesirable, abusive or illegal activities and to create new or improved services and products. We will not contact you with marketing solicitations or for promotional purposes, unless you have previously elected to opt-in to receive such communications. From time-to-time we may disclose your personal information to certain third party service providers and/or contractors of the Instantly. For example, we may provide your billing information to one of our payment processors, your name and email address to our email service provider to send you emails on our behalf or to our customer support provider to assist you with questions you may have through email and live chat software. However, Instantly uses commercially reasonable contractual and technical protections in an effort to ensure that your information will only be used by such service providers and/or contractors for the particular purpose for which it was disclosed. Generally, we will only disclose your personal information to third parties when (i) we have given you notice of such disclosure (e.g., this privacy policy), and (ii) we have obtained your express consent to disclose (e.g., when you opt-in to disclosure).</p>
<p><strong>Survey Data.</strong> As a creator of a survey, we treat your survey data as if it were your personal information. As such, we store survey data on your behalf but will not disclose survey data unless you have specifically authorized us to do so. In addition, we do not and will not sell survey data to third parties.</p>
<p>We encourage you to download and backup your survey data. However, once you have downloaded your survey data, it is your duty to protect your copy of your survey data. In addition, you should diligently protect your account information and refrain from disclosing such information to any third parties, as Instantly is not responsible for any survey data downloaded by an unauthorized user of your account.</p>
<p>As a respondent to a survey, please note that, as previously discussed herein, the survey creator is ultimately responsible for the privacy of your survey data. Consequently, you should consider the privacy risks involved before providing any personal information or data in a response to a survey that could be used to identify you.</p>
<p><strong>Non-Personal Information.</strong> We sometimes share non-personal information with third parties about our user base, but that information does not include any personal information. We may use non-personal information to learn what you like, tailor your experience accordingly, and to improve the Website and our other products.</p>
<p><strong>Law Enforcement.</strong> We may disclose your personal information or otherwise use such information to communicate with you if required or permitted to do so by law or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary to: (i) conform to legal requirements or comply with legal process or any governmental request; (ii) protect and defend the rights or property of Instantly or its affiliated companies, licensors or licensees; (iii) enforce the user agreements applicable to your use of the Website; or (iv) protect the personal safety or interests of Instantly’s employees, other users of the Website, or members of the public in urgent circumstances. We may also disclose any of your personal information to law enforcement or other appropriate third parties in connection with criminal investigations, investigation of fraud, infringement of intellectual property rights, or other suspected illegal activities, or as otherwise may be required by applicable law, or, as we deem necessary in our sole discretion, in order to protect the legitimate legal and business interests of Instantly.</p>
<p>In the event Instantly goes through a business transition, such as a merger, acquisition by another company, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, your personal information will likely be among the assets transferred. You will be notified via a prominent notice on our Web site for 30 days of any such change in ownership or control of your personal information.</p>

<p>The Website may contain third-party advertisements and links to other websites. These other sites and advertisements maintain their own policies regarding cookies and the collection and use of personal information. We assume no responsibility or liability for the actions of such third parties with respect to their collection or use of your information.

<h3>Security</h3>
<p>We offer secure web pages to collect certain kinds of user information and we store certain kinds of data in encrypted form. We follow reasonable technical and management practices to help protect the confidentiality, security and integrity of data stored on our system. While no computer system is completely secure, we believe the measures implemented by our Website reduce the likelihood of security problems to a level appropriate to the type of data involved. We employ physical, electronic and procedural safeguards in connection with the collection, storage and disclosure of any personal contact information. When you enter sensitive information (such as a credit card number or login credentials) on our pages or forms, we encrypt the transmission of that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). If you have any questions regarding which measures and techniques we use, feel free to contact us at the information below.</p>
