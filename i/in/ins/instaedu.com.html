                <p>
                We primarily use the information we collect when you use the Services in connection with your relationship with Chegg, your use of the Services, and for sending you information from us or on behalf of certain third parties. This includes linking you to other members of the Chegg community, and, in some cases, may allow you to engage in real-time video- or text-based chat with another community member. It also includes providing offers to you based on information you provide or we collect or your use of the Services. Please review the <a href="#information-collection" class="self-link">"INFORMATION COLLECTION"</a> and <a href="#how-we-use-your-information" class="self-link">"HOW WE USE YOUR INFORMATION"</a> sections of this Privacy Policy for a full description of the information we collect, including Personal Information, and how we use that information. Remember that if you create a Profile or participate in community forums and similar features on the Services, your information may be public. Note that we do not share your Personal Information with third parties for their marketing purposes without your consent; however, we may share your Personal Information under certain limited circumstances. For more details, please review the section below entitled <a href="#information-sharing" class="self-link">"Information Sharing."</a>
                </p>

                <p>
                Chegg works with network advertisers, ad agencies, analytics service providers and other vendors to serve third party advertisements on and through the Services, to provide us with information regarding traffic on the Services, including the pages viewed and the actions users take when visiting the Services; to serve our advertisements on other web sites, within mobile Apps, and elsewhere online; and to provide us with information regarding the use of the Services and the effectiveness of our advertisements. For example, if you click on a Chegg advertisement, our service provider(s) may be able to tell us the advertisement you clicked on and where you were viewing the advertisement. You may also see third party ads on the Services. The advertisements you see may be served by one or more third parties, who may use information about your activities on the Services, and other web sites and services, to provide you targeted advertising based upon your interests. Our ad network providers, the advertisers, ad agencies, analytics service providers and other vendors may set and access their own tracking devices (including <a href="#cookies-and-log" class="self-link">cookies</a> and <a href="#web-beacons" class="self-link">web beacons</a>) and they may otherwise collect or have access to information about you and your visits to and activity on the Services, as well as on other web sites or online services.  Some of these parties may collect Personal Information when you visit the Services or other websites and services. Please review <a href="#third-party-ad" class="self-link">"THIRD PARTY AD NETWORKS AND ANALYTICS PROVIDERS"</a> for additional information. Some of the companies who serve these targeted ads participate in a self-regulatory program that allows you to opt-out of having information about you used for this purpose, and you may access that opt-out by clicking <a href="http://preferences.truste.com/" target="_blank">here</a>. Please note this does not opt you out of being served advertising. You will continue to receive generic ads while using the Services and elsewhere online.

                <p>
                    The Services may collect "Personal Information" (which is information that can be used to identify or contact a specific individual, such as your name and email address), account information (such as a password or other information that helps us confirm that it is you accessing your account) and demographic or other information (such as your school, gender, age or birthdate and zip code and information about your interests and preferences). We will also collect payment information (typically, credit card account information) if you choose to purchase products or services through the Services. Some Services may allow you to use the Service to offer your own products or services for sale (e.g., registering as a tutor on our InstaEDU Service or maintaining an account for your restaurant on our Campus Special Service). If you use the Services for such purposes or in any other manner that may necessitate payment from Chegg to you, we may collect additional information from you, such as your Social Security Number or taxpayer identification number, as necessary to facilitate payment and to comply with related legal obligations.  Any information combined with Personal Information will be treated as Personal Information.

                <p>
                    You may have the opportunity to create a profile, which consists of information about you, which may include Personal Information, photographs, information about your academic and work history, your interests and activities, your use of the Services and other information ("Profile"). Some of the information in your Profile may be visible to third parties or to everyone, depending on the nature of the information and the privacy settings you choose when you sign in and go to your Account on the website or other Services where you created your Profile. Chegg may also make the information contained in your Profile accessible through means other than the Chegg website (such as through an app or an application programming interface (API)). Your Profile may also be indexed by and displayed by internet search providers when someone searches for your name. Chegg does not control how frequently third-party search engines update their indexes; consequently their information may be outdated and still available for a period of time even if you discontinue use of the service.
                </p>

                    <strong>
                        Note that in order to provide services and opportunities to you, educational organizations, scholarship providers and other third parties may be able to review certain information in your Profile for some of the Services, whether or not you have limited public access to that information. You may have the opportunity to control whether this information is shared, but some information may be shared automatically -- all as disclosed on the website or other Service where you created your Profile. Chegg does not share your contact information (email, full postal address or phone number) with those third parties unless you request or agree to that sharing.

                    Third parties may provide us with information about you. For example, if you are on a third party web site, and you opt-in to receive information from us, that third party will forward information about you to us so that we may contact you as requested.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Services may permit interactions between the Services and a third party web site or service, such as enabling you to "like" a product within our Services or "share" content to other web sites. If you choose to "like" or "share" content or to otherwise post information from or via the Services to a third party web site, feature or application, that information may be publicly displayed, and the third party web site may have access to information about you and your use of our Services. Similarly, if you post information on a third party platform that references Chegg or one of the Services, your post may be published on our Services in accordance with terms of that third party. These features may collect your IP address or other Device Identifier , which page you are visiting on our web site, and may set a cookie to enable the third party feature to function properly. Third party features and applications are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our Services. Your interactions with these features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing it.

                    You may also choose to participate in a third party application or feature through our Services (such as logging in through Facebook Connect or otherwise linking the Services with another web site or interactive service) or on a third party web site or service (such as one of our Facebook applications or a similar application or feature on a third party web site or service) through which you allow us to collect (or the third party to share) information about you, including personal information. Information about you, including your name and profile photo, may be shown to other users of the Services if you are logged in through the Services or through a third party web site or service. The third party may allow you to remove the application or feature, in which case we will no longer collect information about you through the application or feature, but we may retain the information previously collected. When you choose to participate, you may be opting to link your activity on our Services with that third party web site or service, which may then collect information about your visits to our Services and may publish that activity as you request to your profile or similar feature with that third party (such as if you choose to share a purchase you made on Chegg.com with your connections on the third party website).  In some instances, we may require that you participate in the Services through a third party application or feature and, if you choose not to authorize or use the required third party application or feature, you will not be able to use the applicable Service.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The information we collect is subject to this Privacy Policy. The information collected and stored by the third party remains subject to the third party's privacy practices, including whether the third party continues to share information with us, the types of information shared, and your choices with regard to what is visible to others on that third party web site and service. The third party may allow you to remove the application or feature, in which case we will no longer collect information about you through the application or feature, but we may retain the information previously collected.

                    The Services may offer referral features whereby users may use an email tool to invite friends to use the Services using a one-time email. Chegg stores this information for the purpose of verification, as well as tracking the success of our referral program.

                    If you purchase a gift certificate for another person, we will ask you for that person's name and email address, as well as for an optional personal message. We will automatically send your friend a one-time email including an invitation to visit the Services as well as their gift code. Chegg stores information such as the gift certificate recipient's name and email address for the sole purpose of verification. Chegg does not sell or disclose any of this information to any outside sources or parties and collects this information only to maintain records that a gift certificate was purchased and sent to a recipient.Coupons and vouchers are not gift certificates and must be used according to the terms of the voucher or coupon itself or the accompanying materials.

                </h3>
                <p>
                    Like other websites and online services, we and our analytics providers and other third party service providers may automatically collect certain "Usage Information" whenever you access and use the Services, including, without limitation, by viewing information about a course or school, renting a textbook, ordering food, asking or answering questions, viewing another user's Profile, sending a message, searching for a person or information, or by clicking on an advertisement.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Usage Information may include the browser and operating system you are using, the URL or advertisement that referred you to our Services (if applicable), the search terms you entered into a search engine that lead you to our Services (if applicable), all of the areas within our Services that you visit (including information about any ads you may view), and the time of day you used the Services, among other information. We may use Usage Information for a variety of purposes, including to tell you about people or events nearby, to provide special offers, to serve advertisements, to select appropriate content to display to you, and to enhance or otherwise improve the Services and our products.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In addition, we automatically collect your IP address or other unique identifier ("Device Identifier") for any computer, mobile phone or other device (any, a "Device") you may use to access the Services. A Device Identifier is a number that is automatically assigned to your Device used to access a Service, and our servers identify your Device by its Device Identifier. Some mobile service providers may also provide us or our third party service providers with information regarding the physical location of the Device used to access a Service. Usage Information is generally non-identifying, but if we associate it with you as a specific and identifiable person, we treat it as Personal Information.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Usage Information is collected via tracking technologies, including:

                <p id="cookies-and-log">
                    <strong>Cookies and Log Files:</strong> Chegg uses cookies and web log files to track usage of our Services. A cookie is a tiny data file which resides on your computer, and which allows Chegg to recognize you as a user when you return using the same computer and web browser. If your browser settings do not allow cookies, you will not be able to use our Services as fully as intended. Log files are the record of your visits to the Services and include Usage Information. Like the information you enter at registration or in your Profile, cookie and log file data is used to customize your experience when you use the Services. Third parties may also set cookies as you interact with the Service. The use of cookies by third parties is not covered by our Privacy Policy, as we do not have access or control over these cookies.
                </p>
                <p>
                    One type of cookie we use, known as a "persistent" cookie, is set once you've logged in to your account on the Services. If you do not log out of your account, then the next time you visit, the persistent cookie will allow us to recognize you as an existing user so you will not need to log in before using the Services. Of course, if you are using a public computer or sharing your private computer with others, you should log out of your account after each visit. If you log out of a Service, you will need to re-enter your password the next time you visit in order to log in to your account. You can remove persistent cookies by following directions provided in your Internet browser's "help" file. We also use a cookie which functions as a "session" cookie, meaning that it is used to identify a particular visit. Session cookies expire after a short time or when you close your web browser.

                    <strong>Web Beacons:</strong> We, as well as our affiliate program partners, service providers, and other third parties, may employ a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. web beacons/web bugs), that help us better manage content on our Services by informing us of what content is effective. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of web users. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user's computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence.

                <p>
                    Chegg takes commercially reasonable security measures to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. For example, when you enter sensitive information such as a credit card number and CCV2 number on our checkout forms, that information is encrypted using secure socket layer (SSL) technology, to help protect the communications between you and our payment partners.
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, as in any real-life scenario, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. If you have any questions about security on our Services, you can email us at <a href="mailto:legaldept@chegg.com">legaldept@chegg.com</a>.

                <h3 id="california-residents">California Residents - Your CA Privacy Rights</h3>
                <p>
                    Pursuant to California Civil Code Section 1798.83, residents of the State of California have the right to request from companies conducting business in California a list of all third parties to which the company has disclosed certain categories of personal information during the preceding year for the third parties' direct marketing purposes and the categories of personal information the company shares. Alternatively, the law provides that a company that has a privacy policy that provides consumers choice (opt-out or opt-in) regarding sharing personal information with third parties for those third parties' direct marketing purposes may instead provide information on how to exercise that choice. Chegg qualifies for the alternative option; it has a comprehensive privacy policy that sets forth that Chegg provides you choice prior to sharing your personal information with third parties for their direct marketing purposes. If you do not opt-in or if you choose to opt-out at the time Chegg offers that choice, Chegg does not share your information with that identified third party for its direct marketing purposes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you are a California resident and you have questions about our practices with respect to sharing information with third parties for their direct marketing purposes and your ability to exercise choice, please send your request to the following email address: <a href="mailto:legaldept@chegg.com">legaldept@chegg.com</a> or write to us at the following mailing address: 3990 Freedom Circle, Santa Clara, CA 95054. You must put the statement "Your California Privacy Rights" in the subject field of your e-mail or include it in your writing if you choose to write to us at the designated mailing address. You must include your name, street address, city, state, and zip code. We are not responsible for notices that are not labeled or sent properly, or do not have complete information.
