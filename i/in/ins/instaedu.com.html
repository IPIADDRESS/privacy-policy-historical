            <div class="subsection">
                <h2>Information Collection and Use</h2>
                <p>Our primary goals in collecting information are to
                    provide and improve our Site, services, features and content
                    (together, the "<strong>Services</strong>") and to enable users to enjoy and
                    easily navigate the Site.</p>

                <i>Personal Information.</i>
                <ul class="subsubsection">
                    <li>In the course of using the Site and Services (e.g., in connection with your registration as a User or Tutor), we will ask you for personal information. This refers to information about you that can be used to contact or identify you ("<strong>Personal Information</strong>"). Personal Information includes, but is not limited to, your name, credit card or other billing information and email address. We use your Personal Information mainly to provide the Services and administer your inquiries.</li>
                    <li>You can register to join the Service as a User or Tutor by logging into your account with certain third party social networking sites (“<strong>SNS</strong>”) (including, but not limited, to Facebook) via our Site. When you register by logging into an SNS via our Site, we will obtain the Personal Information you have provided to the SNS (such as your “real” name, profile picture, email address, list of SNS friends and other information you make available via the applicable SNS) from the account you have with such SNS and use that information to create your account; the information we obtain may depend on the privacy settings you have with the SNS. If you choose to register as a User to use the Services, you may also register to create an account directly via the Site without logging into an SNS. You can also log in to our Site using sign-in services such as Facebook Connect or an Open ID provider. These services will authenticate your identity and provide you the option to share certain personal information with us such as your name and email address to pre-populate our sign up form. Services like Facebook Connect give you the option to post information about your activities on this Site to your profile page to share with others within your network.</li>
                    <li>We also collect the other information that you provide as part of your use of the Site and Services (e.g., school, academic major and area of academic interest) ("<strong>Non-Identifying Information</strong>"). If you register to use the Services as a Tutor, we will also collect related information including, but not limited to, your academic year and a description of your tutoring services and interests.</li>
                    <li>If you register to use the Services as a Tutor, our third party service providers will collect certain information, such as your name and email address, from you to enable us to make payments to you in connection with your activities on the Site and Services.</li>
                    <li>We use your Personal Information (in some cases, in conjunction with your Non-Identifying Information) mainly to provide the Services, complete your transactions, and administer your inquiries.</li>
                    <li>Certain Non-Identifying Information would be considered a part of your Personal Information if it were combined with other identifiers in a way that enables you to be identified. But the same pieces of information are considered Non-Identifying Information when they are taken alone or combined only with other non-identifying information (for example, your viewing preferences). We may combine your Personal Information with Non-Identifying Information and aggregate it with information collected from other InstaEDU Visitors (defined below) to attempt to provide you with a better experience, to improve the quality and value of the Services and to analyze and understand how our Site and Services are used.</li>
                    <li>We also use your Personal Information to contact you with InstaEDU newsletters, marketing or promotional materials and other information that may be of interest to you. If you decide at any time that you no longer wish to receive such communications from us, please follow the unsubscribe instructions provided in any of the communications. (See "<strong>Changing or Deleting Information</strong>," below.)</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="subsection">
                <h2>Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies</h2>
                <p>Like many websites, we use “cookies” to collect information.  A cookie is a small data file that we transfer to your computer's hard disk for record-keeping purposes.  We use cookies for two purposes.  First, we utilize persistent cookies to save your login information for future logins to the Site.  Second, we utilize session ID cookies to enable certain features of the Site, to better understand how you interact with the Site and to monitor aggregate usage by InstaEDU Visitors and web traffic routing on the Site.  Unlike persistent cookies, session cookies are deleted from your computer when you log off from the Site and Services and then close your browser.  You can instruct your browser, by changing its options, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the websites you visit.  If you do not accept cookies, however, you may not be able to use all portions of the Site or all functionality of the Services.  </p>

                <p><i>Web Beacons / Gifs.</i> Our third party advertising partner employs a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs), that help us better manage content on our Site by informing us what content is effective. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on Web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. We may tie the information gathered by clear gifs to our customers’ personal information.</p>

                <p><i>Log Data.</i> When you visit the Site, whether as a registered user or a non-registered user just browsing (any of these, an "<strong>InstaEDU Visitor</strong>"), our servers automatically record information that your browser sends whenever you visit a website ("<strong>Log Data</strong>"). This Log Data may include information such as your computer's Internet Protocol ("<strong>IP</strong>") address, browser type or the webpage you were visiting before you came to our Site, pages of our Site that you visit, the time spent on those pages, information you search for on our Site, access times and dates, and other statistics. We use this information to monitor and analyze use of the Site and the Services and for the Site's technical administration, to increase our Site's functionality and user-friendliness, and to better tailor it to our visitors' needs. We also use this information to verify that visitors to the Site meet the criteria required to process their requests.</p>

                <p><i>3rd-Party Tracking.</i> The use of cookies by our service providers is not covered by our privacy policy. We do not have access or control over these cookies. Our service providers use session ID cookies to make it easier for us to serve relevant advertisements off of our site.</p>

                <h2>Phishing</h2>
                <p>Identity theft and the practice currently known as
                    "phishing" are of great concern to InstaEDU. Safeguarding
                    information to help protect you from identity theft is a top
                    priority. We do not and will not, at any time, request your
                    credit card information, login information, or national
                    identification numbers in a non-secure or unsolicited e-mail
                    or telephone communication. For more information about
                    phishing, visit the Federal Trade Commission's website.</p>

            <div class="subsection">
                <h2>Invite a Friend</h2>
                <p>If you choose to invite a friend to use the Site and
                    Services, we may collect the email address of such friend
                    for the purpose of sending a one-time email invitation to
                    use the Site and Services. We will not use the email address
                    for any other purposes. Your friend may request that we
                    delete his or her email address from our records by
                    contacting us at <a href="mailto:support@instaedu.com">support@instaedu.com</a>.</p>
                <p>If you choose to invite a friend following a Lesson on InstaEDU, information about your lesson, including but not limited to the tutor and subject of your lesson, may be shared with the friend(s) you choose to invite.</p>

InstaEDU may also use information related to responses you made in the past via the Services make available publicly via the Site estimated response rates and times related to your use of the Services. We make this information available so that Users and InstaEDU Visitors can find Tutors who meet their academic needs. We will ask you to choose if you have a U.S. tax ID (SSN) or not for the purpose of determining which payment method is applicable to you but we do not collect for your U.S. tax ID (SSN) via the site. You may edit your profile information at any time by accessing your profile via your account. In addition, if you chose to make any User Content available via the Services, we will share such User Content in accordance with the selections you make via the Services (including with Users, as applicable).
