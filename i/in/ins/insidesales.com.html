			  Frequently Asked Questions<br>
			  </b><br>
			  <b><a name="1"></a>1. What information do we collect from you?</b><br>
			  We collect information via the website that falls into one of two 
			  categories: personally identifiable information and aggregated information. 
			  Personally identifiable information is information that is actually 
			  used to identify you. We collect personally identifiable information 
			  whenever you voluntarily submit it to the website, including your 
			  name, e-mail, company, mailing address, title, area of expertise, 
			  telephone number, and credit card information, plus your preferences 
			  regarding Sales Team Automation products (collectively, "personally 
			  identifiable information").<br>
			  Aggregated information is information that is not directly tied 
			  to a specific user, such as the number of people who visit the website 
			  from various states. We collect and store statistics and other information 
			  about the online activities of our visitors on an aggregated (i.e., 
			  collective) basis. For example, we track the number of people who 
			  view each page, the order in which pages are viewed, and other information 
			  to learn which features are the most popular and to refine our design 
			  and marketing efforts. Aggregated information also includes information 
			  that indirectly (i.e., combined with information collected about 
			  you off the website) could be used to identify you, but in practice 
			  is not<br>

			  <br>
			  <b><a name="2"></a>2. Where do we collect information from you?</b><br>
			  Sales Team Automation gathers information in the following ways: 
			  </font> </p>
			<p><font size="1" face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, san-serif"><i>Software 
			  Downloads</i>: When you download any of our free software from our 
			  website, we may collect and use certain personally identifiable 
			  information (e.g., the software you selected, your planned use for 
			  the software) for use by Sales Team Automation.</font></p>
			<p><font size="1" face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, san-serif"><i>View 
			  a Video</i>: When you view a video, we may keep a record of what 
			  videos were viewed for use by Sales Team Automation.</font></p>
			<p><font size="1" face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, san-serif"><i>Purchases</i>: 
			  When you make a purchase, we keep track of what you bought, along 
			  with other personal and product information (such as payment, shipping, 
			  and warranty data).</font></p>
			<p><font size="1" face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, san-serif"><i>Newsletters 
			  &amp; Promotional E-mails</i>: From time to time, we may offer free 
			  electronic newsletters and promotional e-mails as a service to our 
			  registered users, based on a voluntary subscription. If you sign 
			  up, we will send you newsletters and e-mails periodically listing 
			  industry news, industry events, product information, and other promotions. 
			  You will only receive a newsletter if you have requested it during 
			  registration or directly from our signup form. To stop receiving 
			  our newsletter, send an e-mail to us at <a href="mailto:company@salesteamautomation.com">company@SalesTeamAutomation.com</a>.</font></p>
			<p><font size="1" face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, san-serif"><i>Webmaster 
			  Lists</i>: If you are a webmaster and send us an e-mail, we will 
			  collect your e-mail address.</font></p>
			<p><font size="1" face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, san-serif"><i>Chat 
			  Rooms and Bulletin Boards</i>: From time to time, we may make chat 
			  rooms and bulletin boards available to registered users. Please 
			  remember that postings to bulletin boards and chat rooms become 
			  public information; thus, you should exercise caution when deciding 
			  to disclose personally identifiable information within such forums, 
			  as it may be collected and used by third parties.</font></p>
			<p><font size="1" face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, san-serif"><i>Search 
			  Terms:</i> From time to time, we may offer the ability for you to 
			  search our website for information that interests you. We may save 
			  those search terms and display certain banner ads tied to your search 
			  term.</font></p>
			<p><font size="1" face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, san-serif"><i>Online 
			  Surveys and Polling</i>: If you participate in an online survey 
			  or interactive poll, we may ask you for your e-mail address and 
			  your preferences in order to track voting.</font></p>
			<p><font size="1" face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, san-serif"><i>EEE-Postcards</i>: 
			  From time to time, we may offer you the ability to send an e-postcard, 
			  or e-mail, to your friends containing content or links to our site 
			  or to content that you think your friends would find interesting. 
			  In order to do this, we must collect the user names and e-mail addresses 
			  of your friends.</font></p>
			<p><font size="1" face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, san-serif"><i>Contact 
			  Information &amp; Third-Party Data</i>: If you contact Sales Team 
			  Automation by e-mail or letter, we may keep a record of your personal 
			  correspondence. Thus, if you report a problem with our website, 
			  we may collect such information in a file specific to you. Moreover, 
			  if you contact us through our feedback area, we require your name 
			  and e-mail address in order to send you a reply. Additionally, if 
			  other users or third parties send us correspondence about your activities 
			  or postings on our site, we may keep the information in a file specific 
			  to you.</font></p>
			<p><font size="1" face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, san-serif"><i>Browsing</i>: 
			  An IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your 
			  computer whenever you are surfing the web, allowing web servers 
			  and ad servers to identify your computer. Sales Team Automation 
			  collects IP addresses for the purposes of system administration, 
			  to gather broad demographic information, to enable ads to be served 
			  on our site, to report aggregated information to our advertisers, 
			  for security purposes, and to monitor the level of activity on our 
			  site.</font></p>
			<p><font size="1" face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, san-serif"><i>Cookies</i>: 
			  Cookies are small data text files that are sent from a computer 
			  serving our web pages or ads to your computer during a browsing 
			  session. The cookies are typically stored on your computer's hard 
			  drive and are used by websites to simulate a continuous connection 
			  to that site. To learn more about our use of cookies, click here.</font></p>
			<p><font size="1" face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, san-serif"><i>Clear 
			  GIFs</i>: Clear GIFs, which are sometimes called "web bugs," 
			  are invisible graphic images embedded in one or more web pages on 
			  this site. Sales Team Automation (and in the future, its banner 
			  ad servers) use clear GIFs to get a better idea of the types of 
			  users who visit our site and their personal preferences. When you 
			  access a page with a clear GIF, a message is sent to our server, 
			  the server of one of our banner ad servers, or the server of a consultant 
			  who does data analysis for Sales Team Automation. The message identifies 
			  the IP address of the computer that fetched the clear GIF, the URL 
			  of the page where the clear GIF is located, the URL of the clear 
			  GIF, the date and time the clear GIF was received, the type of browser 
			  that fetched the clear GIF, and a previously set cookie value.</font></p>
			<p><font size="1" face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, san-serif"><i>Banner 
			  Advertisements</i>: In the future, we may include banner advertisements 
			  on our website. If you click upon a banner advertisement displayed 
			  on our website, you will leave our website (unless, of course, the 
			  banner is to another page of our website). In cases where clicking 
			  on a banner takes you to a third-party site, if you later disclose 
			  personally identifiable information on that site, the third party 
			  may be able to tie that information to the banner ads and pages 
			  you were viewing on our website.<br>
			  </font><font size="1" face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, san-serif"><a href="#faqs">back 
			  to FAQ</a><br>
			  <br>
			  <a name="3"></a>3. How do we use the personal information we collect 
			  from you?<br>
			  Operation of the Website and E-mail: The aggregated and personally 
			  identifiable information we collect from you is used to operate 
			  and enhance our website. We collect personally identifiable information 
			  in order to learn more about you so we can provide you with content, 
			  products, and advertising that you are more likely to find interesting. 
			  Sales Team Automation also uses registered user information to contact 
			  users when necessary and to send promotional e-mails. <br>
			  Tracking Website Pages Viewed: Demographic and profile data is also 
			  collected via our website. We monitor the actions of visitors to 
			  our website to determine what our users find interesting. Sales 
			  Team Automation does research on our users' and visitors' demographics, 
			  interests, and behavior based on the information provided to us 
			  during browsing, upon registration, during a promotion, from our 
			  server log files, or from surveys. We will use this data to tailor 
			  the visitor's experience on our website, to improve our marketing 
			  and promotional efforts, to analyze website usage patterns, to improve 
			  our content and product offerings, and to customize our website's 
			  content, layout, and services.</font><font size="1" face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, san-serif"><br>
			  Advertisements: From time to time, we may display advertisements. 
			  Aggregated information is used to sell and deliver advertising. 
			  We may disclose aggregated information about our website to third 
			  parties, including informing our advertisers whether their advertisement 
			  was effective. By knowing a little about you, we will be able to 
			  deliver more relevant advertisements and content to you in the form 
			  of targeted banners, industry event and news services, and e-mail 
			  promotions. For example, advertisers may give us an advertisement 
			  and tell us the type of audience they want to reach (e.g., computer 
			  programmers with expertise in Java™ applications). We could 
			  then take the advertisement and display it to users and visitors 
			  who meet those criteria. In this process, the advertiser will not 
			  have direct access to individual account information; only we have 
			  access to individuals' accounts. We may share this aggregated data 
			  with advertisers, but we will only develop summary reports (not 
			  about individuals) for our advertisers. <br>
			  </font><font size="1" face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, san-serif">Agents: 
			  We also may share your personally identifiable information with 
			  third parties for the purposes of providing services to our website 
			  or to Sales Team Automation itself.<br>
			  </font><font size="1" face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, san-serif">Merchants: 
			  Except as disclosed in this Policy, we will not share personally 
			  identifiable information about our users with other merchants and 
			  third parties without your permission.<br>
			  </font><font size="1" face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, san-serif">E-mailings: 
			  We will send registered users e-mail containing information we think 
			  they will find interesting, such as information about news, new 
			  products and services from our selected partners. It is our policy 
			  not to send messages to members who have asked us not to do so. 
			  By using our website, you expressly agree to receive this information. 
			  If you do not wish to receive these communications, you have the 
			  ability to opt out. Please see the "What are my choices regarding 
			  collection, use, and distribution of my information?" section 
			  below.<br>
			  </font><font size="1" face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, san-serif">Cookies: 
			  Our website and third-party ad servers use cookies for marketing 
			  purposes in order to make sure you do not see the same ads repeatedly 
			  and to track in the aggregate the pages on our site visited by our 
			  users. We also use a shopping cart cookie to keep track of items 
			  you selected until you check out or delete the items. To learn more 
			  about our use of cookies, click here. Clear GIFs: Our website and 
			  third-party ad servers use clear GIFs for marketing purposes in 
			  order to make sure you do not see the same ads repeatedly and to

			  as well as the types of users visiting those pages.<br>

			  and are asked for personally identifiable information, you are sharing 
			  that information with us alone, unless it is specifically stated 
			  otherwise or as discussed in this Policy. However, some website 
			  services are offered in conjunction with a partner company. In order 
			  to provide a co-branded service to you, it is necessary for us to 
			  share your personally identifiable information with our partner 
			  company. If you do not want your data to be shared, you can choose 
			  not to allow the transfer by not using our service.<br>
			  Promotions, Contests, and Sweepstakes: Promotions that run on the 
			  website may be sponsored by Sales Team Automation and another company. 
			  Some or all data collected during a promotion may be shared with 
			  the sponsor. If data will be shared, you will be notified prior 
			  to the time of data collection or transfer (for example, in the 
			  terms and conditions of a contest). You can decide not to participate 
			  in the promotion if you do not want your data to be shared. <br>
			  Links and Banner Ads to Third-Party Sites: Please be aware that 
			  sites on our website may contain links to other sites on the Internet 
			  that are owned and operated by third parties. The information practices 
			  of those websites linked to our website are not covered by this 
			  Policy. These other sites may send their own cookies to users, collect 
			  data, or solicit personal information. Additionally, other companies 
			  or ad servers that place advertising on our website may collect 
			  information about you through the use of cookies or clear GIFs when 
			  you view or click on their advertising. We cannot control this collection 
			  of information. You should contact advertisers directly if you have 
			  any questions about their use of the information they collect.<br>
			  Ad Servers: From time to time, we may use third-party advertising 
			  services to serve banner advertisements on our website. In order 
			  to ensure you do not see the same advertisement repeatedly, for 
			  any page on which we display banner ads, they may place a cookie 
			  on your computer's hard drive. Your computer will receive these 
			  cookies, which contain a unique but anonymous tracking number, unless 
			  you set your browser to refuse them. They will collect information 
			  from visitors to our site regarding the URLs from which they came; 
			  their IP addresses; domain types (e.g., .com); browser type; operating 
			  system; the country, state, and telephone area code where their 
			  servers are located; the products and pages of our site that visitors 
			  viewed during their visit; time and date particular ads were served; 
			  and banner ads clicked upon. To learn more about the information 
			  our ad server collects, click here link to no. 10<br>
			  Framing/Windows to Third-Party Sites: In addition to providing links 
			  to other websites, we sometimes window third-party sites for your 
			  convenience. If you click to learn more information, a window or 
			  frame containing the third party's site may appear. Any time you 
			  are in a window (unless the window is another part of the Sales 
			  Team Automation website), you should assume your personal information 
			  is being collected, used, and disclosed in accordance with the windowed 
			  site's policies.<br>
			  Chat Rooms and Bulletin Boards: Except as otherwise expressly discussed 
			  in this Policy, this document only addresses the use and disclosure 
			  of information we collect from you. If you participate in chat rooms 
			  or message boards, your user name will be displayed with your comment 
			  or posting. Information you provide while using services such as 
			  website chat rooms and bulletin boards is available for all to see; 
			  discretion should be used in disclosing personally identifiable 
			  information within such forums, as it may be collected by third 
			  parties. We encourage you to ask questions and to be very cautious 
			  before you disclose your personally identifiable information to 
			  others.<br>
			  Surveys and Polling: From time to time, we may use a third party 
			  to conduct surveys about our website or polls about a particular 
			  issue. If we do, we will either tell you in advance who that third 
			  party is, or obtain their promise that personally identifiable information 
			  will not be used or further shared with anyone outside of Sales 
			  Team Automation.<br>

			  <br>
			  <a name="5"></a>5. With whom do we share your information? <br>
			  Merchants: Other than as disclosed in this Policy or with your permission, 
			  we will not share your personally identifiable information with 
			  merchants. If you do give permission to share your information, 
			  you should know that once your personally identifiable information 
			  is shared with third parties, we cannot control how it is used or 
			  who else it may be shared with.<br>
			  Fulfillment: Some online activities necessarily lead to disclosure 
			  of your personally identifiable information to third parties, such 
			  as when you include your name and e-mail address in an e-mail to 
			  a third party or when you order merchandise in the shopping areas 
			  of our website for direct shipment to you. For example, in order 
			  to fulfill certain product orders, we must share your information 
			  with the product manufacturer, payment processor (e.g., credit card 
			  companies), and shippers.<br>
			  Data Analysis Agents: The information collected through the website 
			  may be provided to an outside company for the purpose of analysis. 
			  This analysis is to help us to improve our sites and services to 
			  you, and to notify you of special offers that may be of interest 
			  to you.<br>
			  Chat Profile, Chat Rooms, and Bulletin Boards: It is important to 
			  note that information you provide as part of your chat profile is 
			  not confidential and is accessible by the public. Similarly, any 
			  information you provide in chat rooms, message boards, or other 
			  public forums is not confidential. For such activities, a separate 
			  warning may not be provided. Your choice to disclose personally 
			  identifiable information in these cases is voluntary.<br>
			  Ad servers and Advertisers: Our ad servers will have permission 
			  to use their cookies' identification numbers to serve ads on our 
			  site and to collect aggregated information to create statistics 
			  about our customers, sales, traffic patterns, and related site information 
			  to third-party advertisers. However, these statistics will not include 
			  personally identifying information.<br>
			  Compliance with Service of Process or Law Enforcement: Although 
			  it is unlikely, we may be required by law enforcement or judicial 
			  authorities to provide personally identifiable information to the 
			  appropriate governmental authorities. If we receive such a request, 
			  without prior notice to you we will disclose personally identifiable 
			  information upon receipt of a court order subpoena, to investigate 
			  hacking attempts, or to cooperate with a law enforcement investigation. 
			  If we receive a subpoena as part of third-party civil litigation, 
			  we will attempt to provide you with electronic notice (i.e., via 
			  e-mail) fourteen (14) days prior to disclosure of personally identifiable 
			  information. Moreover, we may release account information without 
			  notice to you when we in good faith believe such release is reasonably 
			  necessary to enforce or apply our Terms of Service Agreement or 
			  to protect the rights, property, computer security, and safety of 
			  our website, our users, or others.<br>
			  Sale of the Company: You agree that we may assign, sell, license, 
			  or otherwise transfer to a third party your name, address, e-mail 
			  address, member name, and any other personally identifiable information 
			  collected by us via the website in connection with an assignment, 
			  sale, joint venture, or other transfer or disposition of a portion 
			  or all of the assets or stock of Sales Team Automation or its affiliated

			  <a name=""></a>7. How can I update, correct, or delete my personally 
			  identifiable information?<br>
			  Website Services: Sales Team Automation provides you with a limited 
			  ability to access and edit the personally identifiable information 
			  you have provided to us. Following registration you can review, 
			  change, or delete the information you have submitted. We encourage 
			  you to update your information promptly if it changes. To change, 
			  modify, or delete the information you previously provided, visit 
			  the registration page on our site or send an e-mail to <a href="mailto:company@salesteamautomation.com">company@SalesTeamAutomation.com</a>.<br>
			  <br>
			  Chat and Bulletin Board Postings: You cannot change or remove any 
			  public postings made on our bulletin boards.<br>
			  <br>
			  E-mailing and Newsletters: The website also gives users options 
			  for removing their information from our database so they will not 
			  receive future communications or receive our service any longer. 
			  Users can send an e-mail to <a href="mailto:company@salesteamautomation.com">company@SalesTeamAutomation.com</a>.<br>
			  <br>
			  Reviews/Correct/Update: We provide users the ability to reviewing 
			  and modify information previously provided by the creation of a 
			  new user profile and deletion (unsubscribe) of the incorrect profile. 
			  <br>
			  No Comprehensive Deletions: We will retain in our files information 
			  you have requested to remove if that information is necessary to 
			  resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems, or enforce our Terms of 
			  Service Agreement. Except as noted, upon request we will delete 
			  your information from our databases. However, due to the fact that 
			  we "back up" the data stored on our systems, such prior 
			  information is never completely removed from our databases. Therefore, 
			  you should not expect that all of your personally identifiable information 
			  will be completely removed from our backed-up databases in response 
			  to your requests.<br>

			  <br>
			  <a name="8"></a>8. What security precautions are in place to protect 
			  the loss, misuse, or alteration of my information? <br>
			  You can be assured that your personal and account information is 
			  reasonably secure on our website. We employ encryption technology 
			  in all parts of our website that require you to provide your financial 
			  or credit card information. The personally identifiable information 
			  we collect is stored in secure operating environments that are not 
			  available to the public. Credit card information is encrypted. All 
			  the information we collect and store is protected by our firewall. 
			  Also, any information we store at our business is kept physically 
			  secure, and only designated employees may obtain access to it. However, 
			  "perfect security" does not exist on the Internet.<br>
			  While we strive to protect your personally identifiable information, 
			  we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you 
			  transmit to us or from our online products or services, and you 
			  do so at your own risk. Once we receive your transmission, we make 
			  reasonable efforts to ensure its security on our systems.<br>
			  We cannot fully ensure that your private communications and other 
			  personally identifiable information will not be inadvertently disclosed 
			  to third parties. We may be forced to disclose information to the 
			  government or third parties under certain circumstances, or third 
			  parties may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private 
			  communications. If we need to investigate or resolve possible problems 
			  or inquiries, we can (and you authorize us to) disclose any information 
			  about you to private entities, law enforcement, or other government 
			  officials as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate.<br>

			  If you are under the age of 13, you do not have permission to use

			  identifiably information about users who are under the age of 13. 
			  If you are the parent or guardian of a minor under 13 years of age 
			  and believe they have disclosed personally identifiable information

			  <a name="10"></a>10. What are cookies and how do they collect, use, 
			  and distribute information? <br>
			  Cookies are pieces of information that a website transfers and stores 
			  to your computer's hard drive for record-keeping purposes. Cookies 
			  can make the web more useful by storing information about your preferences 
			  on a particular site, so that you do not have to reenter them each 
			  time you visit a site.<br>
			  We use cookies or IP addresses for a number of tasks, including 
			  helping us to tailor a website or a marketing message to better 
			  match your needs and interests and allowing us to better understand 
			  how visitors use our website. Sales Team Automation and its ad servers 
			  use cookies to assign your Internet browser a unique random number, 
			  a sort of anonymous user ID that is stored in a file on your computer. 
			  This unique identification number automatically identifies your 
			  browser - but not you - to our computers whenever you interact on 
			  our website. Our ad server collects your IP address, browser type, 
			  operating system, time and date a particular ad was served, and 
			  an advertisement tag used to call up an ad. We use a shopping cart 
			  cookie to indefinitely store and keep track of items you selected 
			  until you check out or delete the items.<br>
			  The use of cookies is an industry standard, and many major websites 
			  use them to provide useful features to their customers. Cookies 
			  in and of themselves do not personally identify users, although 
			  they do identify a user's computer. Most browsers are initially 
			  set to accept cookies. You are always free to instruct your web 
			  browser to decline our cookies if it has the capability to do so, 
			  but some parts of our website may not work properly if you do so. 
			  For more general information on cookies, see <a href="http://www.cookiecentral.com">http://www.cookiecentral.com</a>.<br>
			  In the future, we may place advertising on our website that originates 
			  from third-party advertisers and/or advertising agencies. Even though 
			  these advertisements will be displayed on our website, cookies may 
			  be assigned by the advertisers themselves. We do not control these 
			  cookies.<br>
