        Frequently Asked Questions<br>
        </b><br>
        <b><a name="1"></a>1. What information do we collect from you?</b><br>
        We collect information via the website that falls into one of two categories: 
        personally identifiable information and aggregated information. Personally 
        identifiable information is information that is actually used to identify 
        you. We collect personally identifiable information whenever you voluntarily 
        submit it to the website, including your name, e-mail, company, mailing 
        address, title, area of expertise, telephone number, and credit card information, 
        plus your preferences regarding InsideSales.com products (collectively, 
        "personally identifiable information").<br>
        Aggregated information is information that is not directly tied to a specific 
        user, such as the number of people who visit the website from various 
        states. We collect and store statistics and other information about the 
        online activities of our visitors on an aggregated (i.e., collective) 
        basis. For example, we track the number of people who view each page, 
        the order in which pages are viewed, and other information to learn which 
        features are the most popular and to refine our design and marketing efforts. 
        Aggregated information also includes information that indirectly (i.e., 
        combined with information collected about you off the website) could be 
        used to identify you, but in practice is not<br>

        <br>
        <b><a name="2"></a>2. Where do we collect information from you?</b><br>
        InsideSales.com gathers information in the following ways: </font> 
      </p>
      <p><font size="1" face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, san-serif"><i>Software 
        Downloads</i>: When you download any of our free software from our website, 
        we may collect and use certain personally identifiable information (e.g., 
        the software you selected, your planned use for the software) for use 
        by InsideSales.com.</font></p>
      <p><font size="1" face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, san-serif"><i>View a Video</i>: 
        When you view a video, we may keep a record of what videos were viewed 
        for use by InsideSales.com.</font></p>
      <p><font size="1" face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, san-serif"><i>Purchases</i>: 
        When you make a purchase, we keep track of what you bought, along with 
        other personal and product information (such as payment, shipping, and 
        warranty data).</font></p>
      <p><font size="1" face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, san-serif"><i>Newsletters 
        &amp; Promotional E-mails</i>: From time to time, we may offer free electronic 
        newsletters and promotional e-mails as a service to our registered users, 
        based on a voluntary subscription. If you sign up, we will send you newsletters 
        and e-mails periodically listing industry news, industry events, product 
        information, and other promotions. You will only receive a newsletter 
        if you have requested it during registration or directly from our signup 
        form. To stop receiving our newsletter, send an e-mail to us at <a href="mailto:company@InsideSales.com">company@InsideSales.com</a>.</font></p>
      <p><font size="1" face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, san-serif"><i>Webmaster 
        Lists</i>: If you are a webmaster and send us an e-mail, we will collect 
        your e-mail address.</font></p>
      <p><font size="1" face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, san-serif"><i>Chat Rooms 
        and Bulletin Boards</i>: From time to time, we may make chat rooms and 
        bulletin boards available to registered users. Please remember that postings 
        to bulletin boards and chat rooms become public information; thus, you 
        should exercise caution when deciding to disclose personally identifiable 
        information within such forums, as it may be collected and used by third 
        parties.</font></p>
      <p><font size="1" face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, san-serif"><i>Search Terms:</i> 
        From time to time, we may offer the ability for you to search our website 
        for information that interests you. We may save those search terms and 
        display certain banner ads tied to your search term.</font></p>
      <p><font size="1" face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, san-serif"><i>Online Surveys 
        and Polling</i>: If you participate in an online survey or interactive 
        poll, we may ask you for your e-mail address and your preferences in order 
        to track voting.</font></p>
      <p><font size="1" face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, san-serif"><i>EEE-Postcards</i>: 
        From time to time, we may offer you the ability to send an e-postcard, 
        or e-mail, to your friends containing content or links to our site or 
        to content that you think your friends would find interesting. In order 
        to do this, we must collect the user names and e-mail addresses of your 
        friends.</font></p>
      <p><font size="1" face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, san-serif"><i>Contact 
        Information &amp; Third-Party Data</i>: If you contact InsideSales.com 
        by e-mail or letter, we may keep a record of your personal correspondence. 
        Thus, if you report a problem with our website, we may collect such information 
        in a file specific to you. Moreover, if you contact us through our feedback 
        area, we require your name and e-mail address in order to send you a reply. 
        Additionally, if other users or third parties send us correspondence about 
        your activities or postings on our site, we may keep the information in 
        a file specific to you.</font></p>
      <p><font size="1" face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, san-serif"><i>Browsing</i>: 
        An IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer 
        whenever you are surfing the web, allowing web servers and ad servers 
        to identify your computer. InsideSales.com collects IP addresses 
        for the purposes of system administration, to gather broad demographic 
        information, to enable ads to be served on our site, to report aggregated 
        information to our advertisers, for security purposes, and to monitor 
        the level of activity on our site.</font></p>
      <p><font size="1" face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, san-serif"><i>Cookies</i>: 
        Cookies are small data text files that are sent from a computer serving 
        our web pages or ads to your computer during a browsing session. The cookies 
        are typically stored on your computer's hard drive and are used by websites 
        to simulate a continuous connection to that site. To learn more about 
        our use of cookies, click here.</font></p>
      <p><font size="1" face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, san-serif"><i>Clear GIFs</i>: 
        Clear GIFs, which are sometimes called "web bugs," are invisible 
        graphic images embedded in one or more web pages on this site. InsideSales.com, Inc. (and in the future, its banner ad servers) use clear GIFs to 
        get a better idea of the types of users who visit our site and their personal 
        preferences. When you access a page with a clear GIF, a message is sent 
        to our server, the server of one of our banner ad servers, or the server 
        of a consultant who does data analysis for InsideSales.com. The 
        message identifies the IP address of the computer that fetched the clear 
        GIF, the URL of the page where the clear GIF is located, the URL of the 
        clear GIF, the date and time the clear GIF was received, the type of browser 
        that fetched the clear GIF, and a previously set cookie value.</font></p>
      <p><font size="1" face="Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, san-serif"><i>Banner Advertisements</i>: 
        In the future, we may include banner advertisements on our website. If 
        you click upon a banner advertisement displayed on our website, you will 
        leave our website (unless, of course, the banner is to another page of 
        our website). In cases where clicking on a banner takes you to a third-party 
        site, if you later disclose personally identifiable information on that 
        site, the third party may be able to tie that information to the banner 
        ads and pages you were viewing on our website.<br>
        <a href="#faqs">back 
        to FAQ</a><br>
        <br>
        <a name="3"></a>3. How do we use the personal information we collect from 
        you?<br>
        Operation of the Website and E-mail: The aggregated and personally identifiable 
        information we collect from you is used to operate and enhance our website. 
        We collect personally identifiable information in order to learn more 
        about you so we can provide you with content, products, and advertising 
        that you are more likely to find interesting. InsideSales.com also 
        uses registered user information to contact users when necessary and to 
        send promotional e-mails. <br>
        Tracking Website Pages Viewed: Demographic and profile data is also collected 
        via our website. We monitor the actions of visitors to our website to 
        determine what our users find interesting. InsideSales.com does 
        research on our users' and visitors' demographics, interests, and behavior 
        based on the information provided to us during browsing, upon registration, 
        during a promotion, from our server log files, or from surveys. We will 
        use this data to tailor the visitor's experience on our website, to improve 
        our marketing and promotional efforts, to analyze website usage patterns, 
        to improve our content and product offerings, and to customize our website's 
        content, layout, and services.<br>
        Advertisements: From time to time, we may display advertisements. Aggregated 
        information is used to sell and deliver advertising. We may disclose aggregated 
        information about our website to third parties, including informing our 
        advertisers whether their advertisement was effective. By knowing a little 
        about you, we will be able to deliver more relevant advertisements and 
        content to you in the form of targeted banners, industry event and news 
        services, and e-mail promotions. For example, advertisers may give us 
        an advertisement and tell us the type of audience they want to reach (e.g., 
        computer programmers with expertise in Java™ applications). We could 
        then take the advertisement and display it to users and visitors who meet 
        those criteria. In this process, the advertiser will not have direct access 
        to individual account information; only we have access to individuals' 
        accounts. We may share this aggregated data with advertisers, but we will 
        only develop summary reports (not about individuals) for our advertisers.

        We also may share your personally identifiable information with third

        Except as disclosed in this Policy, we will not share personally identifiable

        We will send registered users e-mail containing information we think they 
        will find interesting, such as information about news, new products and 
        services from our selected partners. It is our policy not to send messages 
        to members who have asked us not to do so. By using our website, you expressly 
        agree to receive this information. If you do not wish to receive these 
        communications, you have the ability to opt out. Please see the "What

        Our website and third-party ad servers use cookies for marketing purposes 
        in order to make sure you do not see the same ads repeatedly and to track 
        in the aggregate the pages on our site visited by our users. We also use 
        a shopping cart cookie to keep track of items you selected until you check 
        out or delete the items. To learn more about our use of cookies, click

        <br>
        <a name="4"></a>4. Who is collecting information? <br>
        Co-branded Services: When you are on the InsideSales.com website 
        and are asked for personally identifiable information, you are sharing 
        that information with us alone, unless it is specifically stated otherwise 
        or as discussed in this Policy. However, some website services are offered 
        in conjunction with a partner company. In order to provide a co-branded 
        service to you, it is necessary for us to share your personally identifiable 
        information with our partner company. If you do not want your data to 
        be shared, you can choose not to allow the transfer by not using our service.<br>
        Promotions, Contests, and Sweepstakes: Promotions that run on the website 
        may be sponsored by InsideSales.com and another company. Some or 
        all data collected during a promotion may be shared with the sponsor. 
        If data will be shared, you will be notified prior to the time of data 
        collection or transfer (for example, in the terms and conditions of a 
        contest). You can decide not to participate in the promotion if you do 
        not want your data to be shared. <br>
        Links and Banner Ads to Third-Party Sites: Please be aware that sites 
        on our website may contain links to other sites on the Internet that are 
        owned and operated by third parties. The information practices of those 
        websites linked to our website are not covered by this Policy. These other 
        sites may send their own cookies to users, collect data, or solicit personal 
        information. Additionally, other companies or ad servers that place advertising 
        on our website may collect information about you through the use of cookies 
        or clear GIFs when you view or click on their advertising. We cannot control 
        this collection of information. You should contact advertisers directly 
        if you have any questions about their use of the information they collect.<br>
        Ad Servers: From time to time, we may use third-party advertising services 
        to serve banner advertisements on our website. In order to ensure you 
        do not see the same advertisement repeatedly, for any page on which we 
        display banner ads, they may place a cookie on your computer's hard drive. 
        Your computer will receive these cookies, which contain a unique but anonymous 
        tracking number, unless you set your browser to refuse them. They will 
        collect information from visitors to our site regarding the URLs from 
        which they came; their IP addresses; domain types (e.g., .com); browser 
        type; operating system; the country, state, and telephone area code where 
        their servers are located; the products and pages of our site that visitors 
        viewed during their visit; time and date particular ads were served; and 
        banner ads clicked upon. To learn more about the information our ad server 
        collects, click here link to no. 10<br>
        Framing/Windows to Third-Party Sites: In addition to providing links to 
        other websites, we sometimes window third-party sites for your convenience. 
        If you click to learn more information, a window or frame containing the 
        third party's site may appear. Any time you are in a window (unless the 
        window is another part of the InsideSales.com website), you should 
        assume your personal information is being collected, used, and disclosed 
        in accordance with the windowed site's policies.<br>
        Chat Rooms and Bulletin Boards: Except as otherwise expressly discussed 
        in this Policy, this document only addresses the use and disclosure of 
        information we collect from you. If you participate in chat rooms or message 
        boards, your user name will be displayed with your comment or posting. 
        Information you provide while using services such as website chat rooms 
        and bulletin boards is available for all to see; discretion should be 
        used in disclosing personally identifiable information within such forums, 
        as it may be collected by third parties. We encourage you to ask questions 
        and to be very cautious before you disclose your personally identifiable 
        information to others.<br>
        Surveys and Polling: From time to time, we may use a third party to conduct 
        surveys about our website or polls about a particular issue. If we do, 
        we will either tell you in advance who that third party is, or obtain 
        their promise that personally identifiable information will not be used 
        or further shared with anyone outside of InsideSales.com.<br>

        <a name="5"></a>5. With whom do we share your information? <br>
        Merchants: Other than as disclosed in this Policy or with your permission, 
        we will not share your personally identifiable information with merchants. 
        If you do give permission to share your information, you should know that 
        once your personally identifiable information is shared with third parties, 
        we cannot control how it is used or who else it may be shared with.<br>
        Fulfillment: Some online activities necessarily lead to disclosure of 
        your personally identifiable information to third parties, such as when 
        you include your name and e-mail address in an e-mail to a third party 
        or when you order merchandise in the shopping areas of our website for 
        direct shipment to you. For example, in order to fulfill certain product 
        orders, we must share your information with the product manufacturer, 
        payment processor (e.g., credit card companies), and shippers.<br>
        Data Analysis Agents: The information collected through the website may 
        be provided to an outside company for the purpose of analysis. This analysis 
        is to help us to improve our sites and services to you, and to notify 
        you of special offers that may be of interest to you.<br>
        Chat Profile, Chat Rooms, and Bulletin Boards: It is important to note 
        that information you provide as part of your chat profile is not confidential 
        and is accessible by the public. Similarly, any information you provide 
        in chat rooms, message boards, or other public forums is not confidential. 
        For such activities, a separate warning may not be provided. Your choice 
        to disclose personally identifiable information in these cases is voluntary.<br>
        Ad servers and Advertisers: Our ad servers will have permission to use 
        their cookies' identification numbers to serve ads on our site and to 
        collect aggregated information to create statistics about our customers, 
        sales, traffic patterns, and related site information to third-party advertisers. 
        However, these statistics will not include personally identifying information.<br>
        Compliance with Service of Process or Law Enforcement: Although it is 
        unlikely, we may be required by law enforcement or judicial authorities 
        to provide personally identifiable information to the appropriate governmental 
        authorities. If we receive such a request, without prior notice to you 
        we will disclose personally identifiable information upon receipt of a 
        court order subpoena, to investigate hacking attempts, or to cooperate 
        with a law enforcement investigation. If we receive a subpoena as part 
        of third-party civil litigation, we will attempt to provide you with electronic 
        notice (i.e., via e-mail) fourteen (14) days prior to disclosure of personally 
        identifiable information. Moreover, we may release account information 
        without notice to you when we in good faith believe such release is reasonably 
        necessary to enforce or apply our Terms of Service Agreement or to protect 
        the rights, property, computer security, and safety of our website, our 
        users, or others.<br>
        Sale of the Company: You agree that we may assign, sell, license, or otherwise 
        transfer to a third party your name, address, e-mail address, member name, 
        and any other personally identifiable information collected by us via 
        the website in connection with an assignment, sale, joint venture, or 
        other transfer or disposition of a portion or all of the assets or stock 
        of InsideSales.com or its affiliated entities.<br>

        <a name="7"></a>7. How can I update, correct, or delete my personally identifiable 
        information?<br>
        Website Services: InsideSales.com provides you with a limited ability 
        to access and edit the personally identifiable information you have provided 
        to us. Following registration you can review, change, or delete the information 
        you have submitted. We encourage you to update your information promptly 
        if it changes. To change, modify, or delete the information you previously 
        provided, visit the registration page on our site or send an e-mail to 
        <a href="mailto:company@InsideSales.com">company@InsideSales.com</a>.<br>
        <br>
        Chat and Bulletin Board Postings: You cannot change or remove any public 
        postings made on our bulletin boards.<br>
        <br>
        E-mailing and Newsletters: The website also gives users options for removing 
        their information from our database so they will not receive future communications 
        or receive our service any longer. Users can send an e-mail to <a href="mailto:company@InsideSales.com">company@InsideSales.com</a>.<br>
        <br>
        Reviews/Correct/Update: We provide users the ability to reviewing and 
        modify information previously provided by the creation of a new user profile 
        and deletion (unsubscribe) of the incorrect profile. <br>
        No Comprehensive Deletions: We will retain in our files information you 
        have requested to remove if that information is necessary to resolve disputes, 
        troubleshoot problems, or enforce our Terms of Service Agreement. Except 
        as noted, upon request we will delete your information from our databases. 
        However, due to the fact that we "back up" the data stored on 
        our systems, such prior information is never completely removed from our 
        databases. Therefore, you should not expect that all of your personally 
        identifiable information will be completely removed from our backed-up 
        databases in response to your requests.<br>

        <a name="8"></a>8. What security precautions are in place to protect the 
        loss, misuse, or alteration of my information? <br>
        You can be assured that your personal and account information is reasonably 
        secure on our website. We employ encryption technology in all parts of 
        our website that require you to provide your financial or credit card 
        information. The personally identifiable information we collect is stored 
        in secure operating environments that are not available to the public. 
        Credit card information is encrypted. All the information we collect and 
        store is protected by our firewall. Also, any information we store at 
        our business is kept physically secure, and only designated employees 
        may obtain access to it. However, "perfect security" does not 
        exist on the Internet.<br>
        While we strive to protect your personally identifiable information, we 
        cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit 
        to us or from our online products or services, and you do so at your own 
        risk. Once we receive your transmission, we make reasonable efforts to 
        ensure its security on our systems.<br>
        We cannot fully ensure that your private communications and other personally 
        identifiable information will not be inadvertently disclosed to third 
        parties. We may be forced to disclose information to the government or 
        third parties under certain circumstances, or third parties may unlawfully 
        intercept or access transmissions or private communications. If we need 
        to investigate or resolve possible problems or inquiries, we can (and 
        you authorize us to) disclose any information about you to private entities, 
        law enforcement, or other government officials as we, in our sole discretion, 
        believe necessary or appropriate.<br>

        distribute information? <br>
        Cookies are pieces of information that a website transfers and stores 
        to your computer's hard drive for record-keeping purposes. Cookies can 
        make the web more useful by storing information about your preferences 
        on a particular site, so that you do not have to reenter them each time 
        you visit a site.<br>
        We use cookies or IP addresses for a number of tasks, including helping 
        us to tailor a website or a marketing message to better match your needs 
        and interests and allowing us to better understand how visitors use our 
        website. InsideSales.com and its ad servers use cookies to assign 
        your Internet browser a unique random number, a sort of anonymous user 
        ID that is stored in a file on your computer. This unique identification 
        number automatically identifies your browser - but not you - to our computers 
        whenever you interact on our website. Our ad server collects your IP address, 
        browser type, operating system, time and date a particular ad was served, 
        and an advertisement tag used to call up an ad. We use a shopping cart 
        cookie to indefinitely store and keep track of items you selected until 
        you check out or delete the items.<br>
        The use of cookies is an industry standard, and many major websites use 
        them to provide useful features to their customers. Cookies in and of 
        themselves do not personally identify users, although they do identify 
        a user's computer. Most browsers are initially set to accept cookies. 
        You are always free to instruct your web browser to decline our cookies 
        if it has the capability to do so, but some parts of our website may not 
        work properly if you do so. For more general information on cookies, see

        In the future, we may place advertising on our website that originates 
        from third-party advertisers and/or advertising agencies. Even though 
        these advertisements will be displayed on our website, cookies may be 
        assigned by the advertisers themselves. We do not control these cookies.<br>

        Pursuant to 17 U.S.C. § 512 as amended by Title II of the Digital

        subscriber's account. InsideSales.com may also in its sole discretion 
        decide to terminate a subscriber's account privileges prior to that time 
        if it has good faith belief that infringement has in fact occurred. In 
        addition, pursuant to 17 U.S.C. § 512(c), InsideSales.com has

        following information:<br>
        1. an electronic or physical signature of the person authorized to act 
        on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed; 
        <br>
        2. a description of the allegedly infringing work or material; <br>
        3. a description of where the allegedly infringing material is located
