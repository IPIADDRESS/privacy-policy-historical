                        <strong> Other Information We May Collect</strong><br><br>
                        "Other Information" is any information that does not directly reveal your specific identity or does not directly relate to an individual.  If we are required to treat Other Information as Personal Information under applicable law, then we may use it only for the purposes for which we use and disclose Personal Information as detailed in this Privacy Policy.<br><br>
                        Other Information may, for example, be:<br><br>
                        <ul>
                        <li>Browser and device information</li><br><br>

                        <li>Information collected through cookies, pixel tags, and other technologies</li><br><br>

                        </ul>
                              <strong>How We May Collect Other Information</strong><br><br>
                              We and our third party service providers may collect Other Information in a variety of ways, including:<br><br>
                              <ul>
                                <li><strong>Through your browser or device</strong>:  Certain information is collected by most browsers or automatically through your device, such as your Media Access Control (MAC) address, computer type (Windows or Macintosh), screen resolution, operating system name and version, device manufacturer and model, language, Internet browser type and version, and the name and version of the Services (such as the App) you are using.  We use this information to ensure that the Services function properly. </li><br><br>
                                <li><strong>Through your use of the App</strong>:  When you download and use the App, we and our service providers may track and collect App usage data, such as the date and time the App on your device accesses our servers, and what information and files have been downloaded to the App based on your device number.  </li><br><br>
                                <li><strong>Using cookies</strong>:  Cookies are pieces of information stored directly on the computer that you are using.  Cookies allow us to collect information such as browser type, time spent on the Services, pages visited, language preferences, and other anonymous traffic data.  We and our service providers use the information for security purposes, to facilitate navigation, to display information more effectively, to personalize your experience while using the Services, and to recognize your computer in order to assist your use of the Services.  We also gather statistical information about use of the Services in order to continually improve their design and functionality, understand how they are used, and assist us with resolving questions regarding them.  Cookies further allow us to select which of our advertisements or offers are most likely to appeal to you and display them while you are on the Services.  We may also use cookies or other technologies to track responses to our online advertisements and to understand what site or advertisement brought you to our site.  At this time, we do not respond to browser do-not-track signals.  </li><br><br>
                                If you do not want information collected through the use of cookies, there is a simple procedure in most browsers that allows you to automatically decline cookies or be given the choice of declining or accepting the transfer to your computer of a particular cookie (or cookies) from a particular site.  You may also wish to refer to <a href="http://www.allaboutcookies.org/manage-cookies/index.html"> http://www.allaboutcookies.org/manage-cookies/index.html</a>.  If, however, you do not accept cookies, you may experience some inconvenience in your use of the Services.  For example, we may not be able to recognize your computer, and you may need to log in every time you visit.
                                <li><strong>Using pixel tags and other similar technologies</strong>:  Pixel tags (also known as web beacons and clear GIFs) may be used in connection with some Services to, among other things, track the actions of users of the Services (including email recipients), measure the success of our marketing campaigns, and compile statistics about usage of the Services and response rates. </li><br><br>
                                <li><strong>Analytics</strong>:  We use Google Analytics, which uses cookies and similar technologies to collect and analyze information about use of the Services and report on activities and trends.&nbsp; This service may also collect information regarding the use of other websites, apps and online resources.&nbsp; You can learn about Google's practices by going to <a href="https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/"> www.google.com/policies/privacy/âpartners/</a>, and opt out of them by downloading the Google Analytics opt-out browser add-on, available at <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout"> https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout </a>. </li><br><br>
                                <li><strong>Using Adobe Flash technology (including Flash Local Shared Objects ("Flash LSOs")) and other similar technologies</strong>:  We may use Flash LSOs and other technologies to, among other things, collect and store information about your use of the Services.  If you do not want Flash LSOs stored on your computer, you can adjust the settings of your Flash player to block Flash LSO storage using the tools contained in the Website Storage Settings Panel.  You can also control Flash LSOs by going to the Global Storage Settings Panel and following the instructions (which may include instructions that explain, for example, how to delete existing Flash LSOs (referred to as "information" on the Macromedia site), how to prevent Flash LSOs from being placed on your computer without your being asked, and (for Flash Player 8 and later) how to block Flash LSOs that are not being delivered by the operator of the page you are on at the time).  Please note that setting the Flash Player to restrict or limit acceptance of Flash LSOs may reduce or impede the functionality of some Flash applications, including those used in connection with the Services. </li><br><br>
                                <li><strong>IP Address</strong>:  Your IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to the computer that you are using by your Internet Service Provider.  An IP address may be identified and logged automatically in our server log files whenever a user accesses the Services, along with the time of the visit and the page(s) that were visited.  Collecting IP addresses is standard practice and is done automatically by many websites, applications and other services.  We use IP addresses for purposes such as calculating usage levels, diagnosing server problems, and administering the Services.  We may also derive your approximate location from your IP address. </li><br><br>
                                <li><strong>Physical Location</strong>:  We may collect the physical location of your device by, for example, using satellite, cell phone tower, or WiFi signals.  We may use your device's physical location to provide you with personalized location-based services and content.  We may also share your device's physical location with our marketing partners, to enable them to provide you with geo-targeted advertising.    You may be permitted to allow or deny such uses and/or sharing of your device's location, such as through your device settings.  If you do, we and/or our marketing partners may not be able to provide you with the applicable personalized services and content. </li><br><br>
                                <li><strong>From you</strong>:  Information such as your preferred means of communication and special travel requests (for example, in connection with a disability or dietary restriction) is collected when you voluntarily provide it. </li><br><br>
                                <li><strong>By aggregating information</strong>:  Aggregated Personal Information does not personally identify you or any other user of the Services (for example, we may aggregate Personal Information to calculate the percentage of our users who have a particular telephone area code).</li><br><br>
                                <li></li><br><br>
                              </ul>
                              <strong>How We May Use and Disclose Other Information</strong><br><br>
                              We may use and disclose Other Information for any purpose (except where we are required to do otherwise under applicable law), if it doesn't qualify as Personal Information under applicable law.  In some instances, we may combine Other Information with Personal Information (such as combining your name with your location).  If we do, we will treat the combined information as Personal Information as long as it is combined.
