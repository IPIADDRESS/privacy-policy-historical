				<h3>Privacy Policy</h3>
				<div class="padtop10">
					<div class="block_text"><div>
	Insomniac Games, Inc., is committed to maximizing your experience on its website within a trusted environment. This privacy policy explains how we collect, protect, use and share information gathered about you online. We hope this disclosure will help increase your confidence in the Insomniac Games website and enhance your experience. Please note that this privacy policy applies only to information submitted and collected online at our website. It does not apply to information that you may submit to us offline, or to websites maintained by other companies or organizations to which we may link.<br>
	<br>
	<u><i>What types of information does Insomniac Games collect and how will it be used? </i></u><br>
	Insomniac Games only collects information on a voluntary basis. The personal information we collect is used exclusively for communication and marketing research purposes. The majority of content on our site is offered without our collecting any personally identifiable information from you. There are a few activities on our site where the collection of personally identifiable information is necessary. Those activities include things like signing up for an email newsletter or other online information service we may offer, entering a contest, answering a survey, or contacting us. Visitors who wish to subscribe to the Insomniac Games community will be asked to provide some personal information such as an email address. For example, the submitted email address would then be used to send you, via email, our news updates and to otherwise keep you informed as to what's going on at Insomniac Games. Surveys are conducted strictly for internal profiling purposes and only keep track of anonymous demographic data (e.g., your age, games played, consoles owned). Our website contains links through which an online visitor can email us. We collect personal information contained in the email for the purpose of responding to a visitor's questions and/or comments. From time to time, we may post on our website job openings at Insomniac Games and provide an email address to which interested applicants can submit their resume. Although we can assure you that any personal information contained in a resume will be used solely for its intended purpose (i.e., to evaluate the applicant.s qualifications), such information is not subject to this privacy policy.<br>

These entities will not use your personally identifiable information for any other purpose, and have agreed to maintain the confidentiality, security, and integrity of the personal information they obtain from us.<br>
	<br>
	It is our policy not to share, sell or rent your personal information to any company not directly related to the manufacture or publishing of Insomniac Games products.
