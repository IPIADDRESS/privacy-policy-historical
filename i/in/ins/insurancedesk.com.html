		This Privacy Policy describes how we collect, use and share information
		when you use our Services.  The terms “we,” “us,” or “our”
		mean InsuranceDesk.com and affiliates.
		The term “Services,” means, collectively, various websites,
		applications, widgets, email notifications and other mediums, or
		portions of such mediums, through which you have accessed this
		Privacy Policy.  By accessing or using our Services, you consent to
		the collection, transfer, manipulation, storage, disclosure and other
		uses of Your Information (collectively, “Use of Your Information”)
		as described in this Privacy Policy.
	</p>
	<p>
		For purposes of
		this Privacy Policy, “Your Information” means information about
		you, which may be of a confidential nature and may include personally
		identifying information, medical and health history information,
		and/or financial information.

	<p>
		This Privacy Policy applies to our Use of Your Information as a result of
		you using our Services, and does not apply to the following:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			Information collected through mediums other than our Services;
		</li>

			official rules and privacy policy for each individual sweepstakes
			for our specific policies regarding information sharing and
			disclosure pursuant to sweepstakes entry); or
		</li>
		<li>
			Information collected by any person or entity other than us, even if related to
			our Services (such as a third-party website, application, widget or
			lead form).
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		In addition to this Privacy Policy, our Services are also governed by
		our <a href="/terms">Terms of Use</a>
		and any other documents referred to in this Privacy Policy and our <a href="/terms">Terms of Use</a>.
		These documents describe information that we collect from you or
		that you provide on or to the Services and how Your Information may

		to you regarding our Use of Your Information and how you can access
		and update Your Information. Please read this Privacy Policy and the
		the <a href="/terms">Terms of Use</a> carefully.
	</p>
	<h2 class="lk-textBold"><i>Information We Collect and Receive About You</i></h2>
	<p>
		We might receive or collect several types of information about you, such as
		the information described below.
	</p>
	<h3 class="lk-textUnderline">Information You Provide</h3>
	<p>The following are situations in which you may provide Your Information to us:</p>
	<ul>

			When you fill out forms or fields through our Services;
		</li>
		<li>
			When you sign up for any newsletters or other materials through our Services;

			contests, events, or promotions; and

			When you participate in forums or provide user generated content or submissions.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<h3 class="lk-textUnderline">Information Third Parties Provide</h3>
	<p>
		We may collect information about you from sources other than you, such as
		from social media websites (i.e., Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter or
		others), blogs, other users and our business partners.
	</p><p>
	</p><h3 class="lk-textUnderline">General Use and Preference Information</h3>
	<p>
		We may collect, receive and store information regarding your general use
		of our Services (such as details of how and when you used our
		Services, interactions with our Services, log in information,
		resources that you access, your Internet protocol address, your
		browser type, and your device type), as well as your preferences.
	</p>
	<h3 class="lk-textUnderline">Device Information</h3>
	<p>
		When you use our Services through your computer, mobile phone or other device, we
		may collect information regarding and related to your device, such as
		hardware models and IDs, device type, operating system version, the
		request type, the content of your request and basic usage information
		about your use of our Services, such as date and time.  In addition,
		we may collect information regarding application-level events and
		associate that with your account to provide customer service.  We may
		also collect and store information locally on your device using
		mechanisms such as browser web storage and application data caches.
	</p>
	<h3 class="lk-textUnderline">Location Information</h3>
	<p>
		If you enable the collection of location information on your device, then we
		may collect information about your actual location, such as your
		mobile device’s GPS coordinates.  We may also use other
		technologies to determine your location (such as through the location
		of nearby Wi-Fi access points or cell towers), or obtain your
		location information from third parties.
	</p>
	<h3 class="lk-textUnderline">Location Information</h3>
	<p>
		We may collect your phone number in several ways.  For example, we may
		collect your phone number: (i) if you submit your phone number to us
		through our Services; (ii) by capturing your phone number if you call
		us; or (iii) if a third party provides your phone number to us.
	</p>
	<h3 class="lk-textUnderline">Cookies and Anonymous Identifiers</h3>
	<p>
		We, and third parties use various technologies to collect and store
		information when you use our Services, including sending cookies,
		pixel tags or other anonymous identifiers to your device.  “Cookies”
		are pieces of data stored on your computer, mobile phone or other
		device.  A “pixel tag” is a type of technology placed within a
		website or email for the purpose of tracking activity, which is often
		used in combination with cookies.  Other “anonymous identifiers”
		are random strings of characters used for the same purposes as
		cookies, such as with mobile devices where cookie technology is not
		available.  These technologies help us know that you are logged on,
		provide you with features based on your preferences, understand when
		you are interacting with our Services, and compile other information
		regarding use of our Services.
	</p>
	<p>
		The information collected through these technologies, standing alone,
		cannot be used to determine your identity.  Such information may,
		however, be combined in a way that makes it become personally
		identifiable information (i.e., information that can identify you).
		If this happens, we will treat the combined information as personally
		identifiable information.
	</p>
	<p>
		Please note that, in most cases, you can remove or block cookies (such as by
		using the settings in your browser), but doing so may affect your
		ability to use our Services.
	</p>
	<p>
		The use of tracking technologies by our service providers, technology partners
		or other third party assets (such as social media) on the Services is
		not covered by our Privacy Policy.  These third parties may use
		cookies, clear gifs, images, and scripts to help them better manage
		their content on our Services.   We do not have access or control
		over these technologies.
	</p>
	<h2 class="lk-textBold"><i>How We Use Information</i></h2>

		We may make Use of Your Information for various lawful business purposes.  Among
		others, these purposes may include using Your Information to:

			complete transactions requested by you, verify information you
			provide to us and provide you with administrative notices.

			as your agent, including as a result of your business dealings with

		<li>
			To our third-party vendors so that they may provide support for our internal and
			business operations, including for the handling of data processing,
			data verification, data storage, surveys, research, internal
			marketing, delivery of promotional, marketing and transaction
			materials, and our Services’ maintenance and security. These
			companies are authorized to Use Your Information only as necessary
			to provide these services to us and are contractually obligated to
			keep Your Information confidential;
		</li>
		<li>
			To third parties such as insurance providers when you use our Services to request a quote,
			services, or information from one or more of those third parties
			(“Requested Service Providers”), such as by clicking “get your
			quotes” or other similar buttons at the end of a form;
		</li>
		<li>
			To third parties when you engage in certain activities through our Services that are
			sponsored by them, such as purchasing products or services offered
			by a third party, electing to receive information or communications
			from a third party, or electing to participate in contests,
			sweepstakes, games or other programs sponsored, in whole or in part,
			by a third party.  When we disclose Your Information to these third

			not be restricted by this Privacy Policy with respect to its use and

		</li>
	</ul>
	<h3 class="lk-textUnderline">
		Requests for Quotes and Services from Requested Service Providers
	</h3>
	<p>
		As noted above, we may share Your Information with Requested Service
		Providers when you use our Services to request a quote, services or
		information from one or more third parties (a “Request”). <b>IF
		YOU SUBMIT A REQUEST, REQUESTED SERVICE PROVIDERS MAY CONTACT YOU
		DIRECTLY WITH QUOTES VIA MAIL, TELEPHONE, FAX, AND EMAIL.  YOU MAY
		RECEIVE TELEMARKETING CALLS AS A CONSEQUENCE OF SUBMITTING A REQUEST
		THROUGH OUR SERVICES, EVEN IF YOU ARE ON THE NATIONAL DO NOT CALL
		REGISTRY OR ANY OTHER DO NOT CALL REGISTRY.</b>
	</p>
	<p>
		If you are matched with Requested Service Providers, you expressly
		consent to the Requested Service Providers conducting any research
		necessary to provide you with quotes for your Request.  Requested
		Service Providers may need to share Your Information to conduct such
		research.  As an example, if you request insurance quotes, consumer
		reports may be ordered in connection with your insurance application.
		Such reports may provide information that may assist in determining
		eligibility for insurance and the price you may be charged for
		insurance.
		Consumer reports may also be used for updates, renewal or extensions of this
		insurance.  In addition, insurance companies may use third parties in
		connection with the development of a “insurance score” for you. <b>If
		you do not want Requested Service Providers to conduct necessary
		research to provide you with a quote for your Request, then you
		should not submit a Request</b>
	</p>
	<p>
		<b>Please note that if you submit a Request through our Services and we share
		Your Information as described above in connection with your Request,
		you will not have the opportunity to opt out of the disclosure of
		Your Information in connection with that Request.</b>
	</p>
	<h3 class="lk-textUnderline">Aggregation and De-Personalization</h3>
	<p>
		We may take Your Information and de-indentify it either by combining it with information about
		other individuals (aggregating Your Information with information
		about other individuals), or by removing characteristics (such as
		your name) that make the information personally identifiable to you
		(de-identifying Your Information). We reserve
		the right to share, loan, rent, sell, or otherwise disclose such
		information to third parties at any time, for any lawful purpose,
		without notice or compensation to you.
	</p>
	<h3 class="lk-textUnderline">Aggregation and De-Personalization</h3>
	<p>
		If you are submitting information to us pursuant to a sweepstakes entry,
		we reserve the right to share, loan, rent, sell or otherwise disclose
		the information that you submit with third parties at any time, for
		any lawful purpose without notice or compensation to you.
		Participation in these sweepstakes is completely voluntary and you
		therefore have a choice whether or not to disclose Your Information.
		Please refer to the official rules and privacy policy for each
		individual sweepstakes for our specific policies regarding
		information sharing and disclosure pursuant to that sweepstakes
		entry.
	</p>
	<h3 class="lk-textUnderline">Circumvention of Security Measures</h3>
	<p>
		We cannot ensure that Your Information will only be disclosed as described in this
		Privacy Policy. No method of transmission or method of electronic
		storage, is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.
		Additionally, by way of example (without limiting the foregoing), we
		may be forced to disclose Your Information to the government or third
		parties under certain circumstances, or third parties may unlawfully
		intercept or access transmissions or private communications.
		Therefore, notwithstanding anything to the contrary within this
		Privacy Policy, our Terms of Use or any other applicable agreement or
		policy, <u>you use our Services at your own risk</u>
		and we do not promise or guarantee, and you should not expect, that
		Your Information will always remain private.  In the event that an
		unauthorized third party compromises our security measures, we will
		not be responsible for any damages directly or indirectly caused by
		an unauthorized third party’s ability to view, use or disseminate
		Your information.
	</p>
	<h3 class="lk-textUnderline" id="business-transfers">Business Transfers</h3>
	<p>
		We specifically and expressly reserve the right to disclose, lease, sell, assign or
		transfer Your Information collected through our Services, and any of
		our databases, together with any personally identifiable information
		contained in such databases, to third parties in connection with a
		Business Transfer.  A “Business Transfer” means a share or asset
		sale, acquisition, merger, consolidation, reorganization, spin-off,
		bankruptcy or other corporate change involving us and/or our
		affiliates, even if the Business Transfer is only being contemplated
		and regardless of whether the Business Transfer relates to a part or
		a whole of our business.  Nothing in this Privacy Policy is intended
		to interfere with our ability to transfer all or part of our
		business, equity, and/or assets (including our Services) to an
		affiliate or independent third party at any time, for any lawful
		purpose, without compensation to you.
	</p>

	<h2 class="lk-textBold"><i>Children’s Information</i></h2>
	<p>
		You must be at least 13
		years of age to register with or use certain portions of the
		Services.  The Services are not intended for children under 13 years
		of age.  No one under 13 years of age may provide any personal
		information to or on the Services.  We do not knowingly collect
		personal information from children under 13.  If you believe that we
		may have any information from or about a child, please contact us at <b>info@InsuranceDesk.com</b>.
	</p>
	<h2 class="lk-textBold"><i>Network Advertising</i></h2>
	<p>
		From time to time, we may
		participate in or use advertising networks, such as third-party
		advertising servers, advertising agencies, technology vendors and
		research firms.  We may use these third-party advertising networks
		for marketing, advertising and promotional purposes, as well as to
		serve advertisements to you.  Advertising networks often gather data
		about consumers who view advertisements to make inferences about a
		consumer’s interests and preferences, which enables their computers
		to deliver advertisements directly targeted to the consumer’s
		specific interests.  This practice is often referred to as “online
		behavioral advertising.”  For example, a third-party advertising
		network might collect the type of Internet browser you use, the type
		of computer operating system you use, the domain name of a website
		you visit, whether or not you visit specific pages of a website, the
		location of your Internet service provider’s presence, the date and
		time of a visit to a website and other interactions between you and a
		website.  Please see the “Online Behavioral Advertising”
		subsection of <a href="#online-behavioral-advertising">Choices About How We Use and Disclose
		Your Information</a>
		below to read about how you can prevent certain third-party
		advertising networks from collecting information about you.
	</p>
	<h2 class="lk-textBold"><i>User Generated Content</i></h2>
	<p>
		We offer publicly accessible blogs and other interactive media through our Services.
		To request removal of Your Information from our blog or community
		forum, contact us at <b>info@InsuranceDesk.com</b>.
		In some cases, we may not be able to remove Your Information, in
		which case we will let you know if we are unable to do so and why.
	</p>
	<p>
		Some comment areas are managed by a third party application that may require you
		to register to post a comment.  We do not have access or control of
		the information posted to the blog.  You will need to contact or
		login into the third party application if you want the personal
		information that was posted to the comments section removed.  To
		learn how the third party application uses your information, please
		review their privacy policy.
	</p>
	<p>
		You are responsible for any content, including personal information, that you
		contribute to be published or displayed (“posted”) on our
		Services, or that you transmit to other users of our Services
		(collectively, “User Generated Content”).  Your User Generated
		Content is posted on and transmitted to other users of our Services
		at your own risk.  We cannot control the actions of other users of
		our Services with whom you may choose to share your User Generated
		Content.  We are not responsible for circumvention of any privacy
		settings or security measures of our Services.  As a result, we
		cannot and do not guarantee that your User Generated Content will not
		be viewed by unauthorized persons.  You understand and acknowledge
		that, even after removal, copies of your User Generated Content may
		remain viewable in cached and archived pages, or might have been
		copied or stored by other Service users.  Proper access and use of
		information provided through our Services, including User Generated
		Content, is governed by our <a href="/terms">Terms of Use</a>.
	</p>
	<h2 class="lk-textBold"><i>Social Media Widgets</i></h2>
	<p>
		Our Services may include social media features, such as the Facebook Like
		button or interactive mini-programs that run on our Services. These
		features may collect your IP address, which page you are visiting,
		and&nbsp;may set a cookie to enable the feature to function properly.
		Your interactions with these features are governed by the privacy
		policy of the third party providing it
	</p>
	<h2 class="lk-textBold"><i>Choices About How We Use and Disclose Your Information</i></h2>
	<p>
		We strive to provide you with choices regarding the personal information you
		provide to us.  Below are some mechanisms that provide you with
		control over certain information:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			<i>Cookies.</i> If you do not wish us to collect cookies, you may set your browser
			to refuse cookies, or to alert you when cookies are being sent.  If
			you do so, please note that some parts of our Services may then be

			<i>Email Offers from Us.</i>
			If you do not wish to receive email offers or newsletters from us,
			you can opt out of receiving email information from us (other than

		</li>
	</ul>
	<h2 class="lk-textBold"><i>Information You Disclose to Third Parties</i></h2>
	<p>
		You may be presented with an opportunity to receive information and/or marketing
		offers from third parties in connection with our Services.  All
		information you disclose to such third parties will be subject to the
		privacy policy and practices of such third parties.  We are not
		responsible for the privacy policies and practices of such third
		parties and, therefore, you should review the privacy policies and
		practices of such third parties prior to disclosing information to
		them.  If you later decide that you no longer want to receive
		communications from a third party, you will need to contact that
		third party directly.
	</p>

	<p>
		Our services, as well as the email messages sent with respect to our Services, may
		contain links or access to websites operated by third parties that
		are beyond our control.  For example, if you click to apply for a
