    </span--> </div> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Scope</strong></p> <p>This  Privacy Policy and the TRUSTe program addresses our use and disclosure of information  we collect from Respondents to our surveys and/or contests. Respondents are  users who respond to surveys and/or participate in sweepstakes that may be  offered to you.</p> <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Privacy Overview  Respondents</span></strong></p> <p>InsightExpress  (http://www.InsightExpress.com) believes in and respects your privacy and the  sanctity of information that may be provided. Further, as members of the ARF  and CASRO, the North America associations of market research professionals, and  the Mobile Marketing Association, the global association of the mobile  marketing industry, we believe the use of information should be outlined for  you as we have done so below. Additionally, InsightExpress is in compliance  with HIPPA and COPPA privacy guidelines. InsightExpress is committed to  respecting your privacy.</p> <p>The  information we collect is typically used in aggregate form to help companies  understand marketplace needs as well as to create and deliver better products  and services. We do not sell or rent any personally identifiable information.</p> <p><strong>Personal Information about Respondents</strong></p> <p>In  the course of responding to our surveys or sweepstakes, you may have the  opportunity to voluntarily submit personally identifiable information (e.g.,  e-mail address or mobile phone number). InsightExpress maintains this  information in a database, and may use this information to invite you to  participate in future surveys, subject to agreement with the authoring and the  respondent-providing client and your explicit opt-in to receive e-mail or  mobile communications. Your decision to participate in future surveys is  completely at your discretion. That is, you have no obligation to complete this  or any future survey. By participating in a survey you understand and consent  to this policy.</p> <p><strong>Notice to  Children and Young People</strong></p> <p>InsightExpress  does not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from anyone  under the age of 13. </p> <p><strong>Notice regarding  health related topics/surveys </strong></p> <p>Because  facts about a person's demographic, health, health interest, and health care  are private and sensitive, we know that you may have concerns about sharing  information with us. When you enter health information  on our survey forms, we encrypt the transmission of that information using  secure socket layer technology (SSL). This Privacy statement is designed to  answer your important questions about privacy.</p> <p><strong>Sweepstakes</strong></p> <p>Periodically  we request information (typically e-mail address, mobile phone number or your  mailing address if needed to mail a prize to you) from users to participate in sweepstakes.  Sweepstakes participation is completely voluntary and users may choose whether  or not to disclose this information. Your e-mail, mobile phone number or  mailing address may be shared with the survey sponsor to notify winner(s) and  award prizes. Users' personally identifiable information is not shared with  third parties unless we give users notice and choice. Although we may use an  intermediary to conduct sweepstakes, they may not employ users' personally  identifiable information for any secondary purpose. </p> <p><strong>Use of Cookies</strong></p> <p>To  invite you to participate in surveys that may be of great interest to you and  to enable you to use our service, we use "cookies" and, in some  cases, local shared objects ("Flash Cookies"). "Cookies"  are small pieces of information that are stored by your browser on your  computer, and are commonly used by most Web sites to provide you with an  enhanced experience. Flash cookies are different from  browser cookies because of the amount of, type of, and how data is  stored.&nbsp; Our cookies do not contain any personally identifying  information, but they enable us to understand the surveys you may have taken.  Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually change your  browser to inform you or prevent the use of cookies. If you do not accept  cookies, you may not be able, depending upon the individual survey, to complete  more than the first set of questions in a survey. Cookie  management tools provided by your browser will not remove Flash cookies.&nbsp;  To learn how to manage privacy and storage settings for Flash cookies <a href="http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager.html#117118"><strong>click here</strong></a>.<strong> </strong></p> <p>If  you would like to opt-out from receiving future web intercept survey  invitations from InsightExpress, please click below:</p> <p><a href="http://ad.insightexpressai.com/adserver/optout.aspx?redir=http://www.opinion-central.com/optedout.asp"><strong>http://ad.insightexpressai.com/adserver/optout.aspx?redir=http://www.opinion-central.com/optedout.asp</strong></a> </p> <p>When  you opt out, we will place an opt-out cookie on your computer that will block us  from sending you further surveys or sweepstakes invitations.

This includes Internet protocol  (IP) addresses, browser type, Internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit  pages, platform type, date/time stamp, and number of clicks in order to  administer the site, track aggregate movement, analyze trends, and gather broad  demographic information for aggregate use. This information is not linked to  personally identifiable information. </p> <p><strong>Disclosure of  Information</strong></p> <p>When  a Respondent supplies their personally identifiable information, such as an  email address, during the course of completing a survey or sweepstakes it may  be shared with a third party company who has been hired by us to provide  services to help us with our business activities such as product fulfillment  and sweepstakes management. These  companies are authorized to use your personal information only as necessary to  provide these services to us. Participation in these surveys or sweepstakes  is completely voluntary and you therefore have a choice whether or not to  disclose this information.</p> <p><strong>Confidentiality</strong></p> <p>We  are sensitive to the privacy and security of your personal information. However,  we cannot guarantee absolute security as such information may be transmitted  using the Internet, other public telecommunication networks, servers, hardware  or software ("systems") that are not owned, operated, or controlled  by us. </p> <p><strong>Legal Disclaimer</strong></p> <p>Though  we make every effort to preserve user privacy, we may need to disclose personal  information when required by law wherein we have a good-faith belief that such  action is necessary to comply with a judicial proceeding, a court order, or  legal process served to us. </p> <p><strong>Communications</strong><br>
Below  are the instances when users may receive e-mail communications from our site. </p> <ul> <li>Survey  Invitations</li> </ul> <p>If  a user wishes to participate in future surveys, we may request an e-mail  address.

Users will have a  choice as to whether or not we use their information in this different manner.  However, if users have opted out of all communication with the site, or  deleted/ deactivated their account, then they will not be contacted, nor will  their personal information be used in this new manner. In addition, if we make  any material changes in our privacy practices that do not affect user  information already stored in our database, we will post a prominent notice on  our Web site notifying users of the change.
