    <td class="normal"><p><u>Upon Registration</u>: Members may be asked to provide certain personal information when signing up for our Products and Services including name, address, telephone number, billing information, (such as credit card number) and the type of personal computer being used to access Services. Personal information collected from Members during the registration process is used to manage each Member’s account (e.g., for billing purposes.)
