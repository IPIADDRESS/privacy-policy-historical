			<p>
				We may collect information about your computer, including where available your IP

				browsing actions and patterns, and does not identify any individual.</p>
			<h5>
				Cookies</h5>
			<p>
				Our website uses cookies to distinguish you from other users of our website. This
				helps us to provide you with a good experience when you browse our website and also
				allows us to improve our site.</p>
			<p>
				A cookie is a small file of letters and numbers that we store on your browser or
				the hard drive of your computer if you agree. Cookies contain information that is
				transferred to your computer's hard drive.</p>
			<p>
				We use the following cookies:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<p>
						Strictly necessary cookies. These are cookies that are required for the operation
						of our website. They include, for example, cookies that enable you to log into secure
						areas of our website, use a shopping cart or make use of e-billing services.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						Analytical/performance cookies. They allow us to recognise and count the number
						of visitors and to see how visitors move around our website when they are using
						it. This helps us to improve the way our website works, for example, by ensuring
						that users are finding what they are looking for easily.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						Functionality cookies. These are used to recognise you when you return to our website.
						This enables us to personalise our content for you, greet you by name and remember
						your preferences (for example, your choice of language or region).</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						Targeting cookies. These cookies record your visit to our website, the pages you
						have visited and the links you have followed. We will use this information to make
						our website and the advertising displayed on it more relevant to your interests.
						We may also share this information with third parties for this purpose.</p>
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				If you submit your details to us or if you continue to use our site, you agree to
				our use of cookies.</p>
			<p>
				Cookies are widely used in order to make websites work, or work more efficiently,
				as well as to provide information to the owners of the site.</p>
			<p>
				Examples of purposes for which a cookie may be used:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<p>
						Estimate our audience size or usage pattern.</p>

				<li>
					<p>
						Store information about your preferences, and so allow us to customise our site
						and to provide you with offers that are targeted at your individual interests.</p>

						Speed up your searches.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						Recognise you when you return to our site.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						Allow you to use our site in a way that makes your browsing experience more convenient,
						for example, by allowing you to store items in an electronic shopping basket between
						visits. If you register with us or complete our online forms, we will use cookies
						to remember your details during your current visit, and any future visits provided
						the cookie was not deleted in the interim.</p>

			<h5>
				Where we store your personal data</h5>
			<p>
				The data that we collect from you may be transferred to, and stored at, a destination
				outside the European Economic Area ("EEA"). It may also be processed by staff operating
				outside the EEA who work for us or for one of our suppliers. Such staff maybe engaged
				in, among other things, the fulfilment of your order, the processing of your payment
				details and the provision of support services. By submitting your personal data,
				you agree to this transfer, storing or processing. We will take all steps reasonably
				necessary to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance with this
				privacy and cookie policy.</p>
			<p>
				All information you provide to us is stored on our secure servers. Any payment transactions
				will be encrypted using SSL technology. Where we have given you (or where you have
				chosen) a password which enables you to access certain parts of our site, you are
				responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to share a password
				with anyone.</p>
			<p>
				Due to the nature of the internet, the transmission of information via the internet
				is not completely secure. Although we will do our best to protect your personal
				data, we cannot guarantee the security of your data transmitted to our site; any
				transmission is at your own risk. Once we have received your information, we will
				use strict procedures and security features to try to prevent unauthorised access.</p>
			<h5>
				Uses made of the information</h5>
			<p>
				We use information held about you in the following ways:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<p>
						To ensure that content from our site is presented in the most effective manner for
						you and for your computer.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						To provide you with information, products or services that you request from us or
						which we feel may interest you, where you have consented to be contacted for such
						purposes.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						To carry out our obligations arising from any contracts entered into between you
						and us.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						To allow you to participate in interactive features of our service, when you choose
						to do so.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						To notify you about changes to our service.</p>
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				We may also use your data, or permit selected third parties and our partners to
				use your data, to provide you with information about goods and services which may
				be of interest to you and we or they may contact you about these by post or telephone.
				Our partners will be landlords or operators with properties in the same area as
				you are seeking premises â€“ they may contact you about properties in the same area
				as your enquiry for a period until you tell us or them that you are no longer looking.
				The selected third parties who may contact you will be providers of goods and services
				related to acquiring business premises, for example (but not limited to) fit-out
				companies, commercial property agents and IT equipment suppliers.</p>
			<p>
				If you are an existing customer, we will only contact you by electronic means (e-mail
				or SMS) with information about goods and services similar to those which were the
				subject of your enquiry.
			</p>
			<p>
				If you are a new customer, and where we permit selected third parties and our partners
				to use your data, we (or they) will contact you by electronic means only if you
				have consented to this.
			</p>
			<p>
				If you do not want us to use your data in this way, please tick the relevant box
				situated on the form on which we collect your data (the registration form).</p>
			<h5>
				Disclosure of your information</h5>
			<p>
				We may disclose your personal information to any member of our group, which means
				our subsidiaries, our ultimate holding company and its subsidiaries, as defined
				in section 1159 of the UK Companies Act 2006.</p>
			<p>
				We may disclose your personal information to third parties:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<p>
						In the event that we sell or buy any business or assets, in which case we may disclose
						your personal data to the prospective seller or buyer of such business or assets.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						If Instant Offices Limited or substantially all of its assets are acquired by a
						third party, in which case personal data held by it about its customers will be
						one of the transferred assets.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						If we are under a duty to disclose or share your personal data in order to comply
						with any legal obligation, or in order to enforce or apply our <a href="terms-of-website-use.aspx">
							terms of use</a> and other agreements; or to protect the rights, property, or
						safety of Instant Offices Limited, our customers, or others. This includes exchanging
						information with other companies and organisations for the purposes of fraud protection
						and credit risk reduction.</p>
				</li>
			</ul>
