    PRIVACY POLICY
</p>
<p>
    We value your membership, we enforce your security.
</p>
<p>
    Last Modified: 4 May 2013

<p>
    INTRODUCTION
</p>
<p>
    INSTACOMEDY Inc. (“INSTACOMEDY”) takes the private nature of your personal information very seriously.
</p>
<p>
    This privacy policy, which we adapted from a policy originally provided by Automattic (WordPress.com), describes how we treat the information we collect
    when you visit and use our websites. Please read this notice very carefully.
</p>
<p>
    WEBSITE VISITORS
</p>
<p>
    Like most website operators, INSTACOMEDY collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make
    available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. INSTACOMEDY’s purpose in
    collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how INSTACOMEDY’s visitors use its website. From time to time, INSTACOMEDY may
    release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g. by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.
</p>
<p>
    <br>
    INSTACOMEDY also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. INSTACOMEDY does not use such information
    to identify its visitors, and does not disclose such information, other than under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying
    information, as described below.
</p>
<p>
    GATHERING OF PERSONALLY-IDENTIFYING INFORMATION
</p>
<p>
    Certain visitors to INSTACOMEDY’s websites choose to interact with INSTACOMEDY in ways that require INSTACOMEDY to gather personally-identifying
    information. The amount and type of information that INSTACOMEDY gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up
    for INSTACOMEDY.com to provide a username and email address. In each case, INSTACOMEDY collects such information only insofar as is necessary or
    appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor’s interaction with INSTACOMEDY. INSTACOMEDY does not disclose personally-identifying information other
    than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from
    engaging in certain website-related activities.
</p>
<p>
    AGGREGATED STATISTICS
</p>
<p>
    INSTACOMEDY may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites. For instance, INSTACOMEDY may monitor the most popular collections on
    INSTACOMEDY.com. INSTACOMEDY may display this information publicly or provide it to others. However, INSTACOMEDY does not disclose personally-identifying
    information other than as described below.
</p>
<p>
    PROTECTION OF CERTAIN PERSONALLY-IDENTIFYING INFORMATION
</p>
<p>
    INSTACOMEDY discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated
    organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on INSTACOMEDY’s behalf or to provide services available at INSTACOMEDY’s
    websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside
    of your home country; by using INSTACOMEDY’s websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. In addition, in some cases we may choose to
    buy or sell assets. In these types of transactions, user information is typically one of the business assets that is transferred. Moreover, if INSTACOMEDY
    or substantially all of its assets were acquired, or in the unlikely event that INSTACOMEDY goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information
    would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquiror of
    INSTACOMEDY may continue to use your personal and non-personal information only as set forth in this policy. Otherwise, INSTACOMEDY will not rent or sell
    potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone.
</p>
<p>
    <br>
    Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, INSTACOMEDY discloses potentially personally-identifying and
    personally-identifying information only when required to do so by law, or when INSTACOMEDY believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary
    to protect the property or rights of INSTACOMEDY, third parties or the public at large. If you are a registered user of a INSTACOMEDY website and have
    supplied your email address, INSTACOMEDY may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to
    date with what’s going on with INSTACOMEDY and its products. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback
    mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. INSTACOMEDY takes
    all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and
    personally-identifying information.
</p>
<p>
    <br>
    You should also be aware that if you submit information to “chat rooms,” “forums” or “message boards” such information becomes public information, meaning
    that you lose any privacy rights you might have with regards to that information. Such disclosures may also increase your chances of receiving unwanted
    communications.
</p>
<p>
    COOKIES
</p>
<p>
    A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor’s computer, and that the visitor’s browser provides to the website each time the
    visitor returns. INSTACOMEDY uses cookies to help INSTACOMEDY identify and track visitors, their usage of INSTACOMEDY’s websites, and their website access
    preferences. INSTACOMEDY visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using
    INSTACOMEDY’s websites, with the drawback that certain features of INSTACOMEDY’s websites may not function properly without the aid of cookies.
</p>
<p>
    ADS
</p>
<p>
    Ads appearing on any INSTACOMEDY websites may be delivered to users by advertising partners, who may set cookies. These cookies allow the ad server to
    recognize your computer each time they send you an online advertisement to compile information about you or others who use your computer. This information
    allows ad networks to, among other things, deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you. This privacy policy covers
    the use of cookies by INSTACOMEDY and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.
</p>
<p>
    LINKS TO THIRD PARTY SITES
</p>
<p>
    This privacy policy only applies to information collected by INSTACOMEDY. This privacy policy does not apply to the practices of companies that INSTACOMEDY
    does not own or control, or employees that INSTACOMEDY does not manage. A INSTACOMEDY website may contain links to third party websites. Any information
    you provide to, or that is collected by, third-party sites may be subject to the privacy policies of those sites, if any. We encourage you to read such
    privacy policies of any third-party sites you visit. It is the sole responsibility of such third parties to adhere to any applicable restrictions on the
    disclosure of your personally-identifying information, and INSTACOMEDY and its affiliates shall not be liable for wrongful use or disclosure of your
    personally-identifying information by any third party.
</p>
<p>
    SECURITY
</p>
<p>
    All non-personally-identifying information, potentially personally-identifying and personally identifying-information described above is stored on
    restricted database servers.

</p>
<p>
    CHOICE/OPT-OUT
</p>
<p>
    If we ever send you information by email concerning new products, services or information that you did not expressly request, we will provide you with an
    email address by which you may request no further notices.

</p>
<p>
    ADRESS BOOK DATA
</p>
<p>
    Any external address book data (email contacts, etc.) that a user voluntarily gives INSTACOMEDY access to will only be used for the described feature
    (looking up friends, etc.), and will not be stored or repurposed.
</p>
<p>
    PRIVACY POLICY CHANGES
</p>
<p>
    Although most changes are likely to be minor, INSTACOMEDY may change its privacy policy from time to time, and in INSTACOMEDY’s sole discretion.
    INSTACOMEDY encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to its privacy policy. Your continued use of this site after any change in
    this privacy policy will constitute your acceptance of such change.
