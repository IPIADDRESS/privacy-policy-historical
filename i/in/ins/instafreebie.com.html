		<p>We may also share the information we have collected when a User agrees to receive information from third parties. A User may be presented with an opportunity to receive information and/or marketing offers from one or more third parties. We are not responsible for the privacy policies and practices of third parties and, therefore, a User should review the privacy policies and practices of third parties prior to agreeing to share their personal information. If the User later decides that they no longer want to receive communication from a third party, they will need to contact that third party directly. Nothing herein restricts the sharing of aggregated or anonymized information, which may be shared with third parties without User consent.
		</p>

		<p>Our Site, instaFreebie content sharing platform, and Services contain links to, and allow you to share content on, third party websites and services.

This privacy policy applies only as provided in the scope section above. Other websites and services follow different rules regarding the use or disclosure of the personal information. We encourage you to read the privacy policies or statements of the other websites you visit.
