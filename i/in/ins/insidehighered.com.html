<li class="menu-3200 menu-path-taxonomy-term-790 even "><a href="/taxonomy/term/790" title="Wick Sloane, an end user of higher education, began his first piece for IHE, &amp;quot;Somehow I missed the meeting where the nation decided to exit public higher education. I was, after all, chief financial officer of a public university.&amp;quot; He has gone on to prod and poke and propose ways that the nation, with colleges and universities that proclaim themselves &amp;quot;the best higher education system in the world,&amp;quot; can provide just that education to the millions of students who still cannot afford an education. His first column was adapted from a speech he gave at a higher education conference at the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, where he was a visiting fellow for higher education finance. In education, Wick has been a trustee of an independent school, an elected member of a public school system, and chief financial officer of a Research I public university. Finding that the debates on access were lacking good data on the needs of low-income students, Wick has embedded himself at Bunker Hill Community College in Boston, where he teaches expository writing and does other odd jobs. With the support of the Center for College Accountability and Productivity, he published a paper, &amp;quot;The Undebated Billions,&amp;quot; about federal tax subsidies to higher education, and Common Sense, modeled after the Thomas Paine pamphlet, arguing that the four-year bachelor&amp;#39;s degree is obsolete. Six of his pieces for IHE were part of a fellowship to investigate community college financing that Wick won from the Hechinger Institute at Teachers College, Columbia University. He contribute columns to &amp;quot;What the Press Should Ask,&amp;quot; for Nieman Watchdog, published by the Nieman Foundation at Harvard University. Wick holds degrees from the nation&amp;#39;s most highly selective institutions of higher education, Williams College and Yale University. Therefore, by the standards of the academy itself, he must be right.

	Kerry Ann Rockquemore is an author and speaker in the field of faculty development and leadership. She spent the early years of her professional career climbing the academic ladder while writing about interracial families. She is author of Beyond Black: Biracial Identity in America (2001, 2007), Raising Biracial Children (2005), and over two dozen articles and book chapters on multiracial youth. Kerry Ann&amp;rsquo;s research has been featured in numerous media outlets such as the New York Times and ABC&amp;rsquo;s 20/20. After Kerry Ann became a tenured professor (at the University of Illinois at Chicago), her focus shifted towards improving conditions for pre-tenure faculty by creating supportive communities for professional development, writing productivity, and work/life balance. Her award-winning work with under-represented faculty led to the publication of her most recent book The Black Academic&amp;#39;s Guide to Winning Tenure Without Losing Your Soul (2008). Kerry Ann now provides workshops for new faculty members at colleges across the United States, leads a popular online discussion forum for under-represented faculty, and works with a select group of new faculty each semester in her Faculty Success Program. She can be contacted via e-mail at KerryAnn@newfacultysuccess.com
