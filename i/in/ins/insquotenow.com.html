</p>

<p>Whether it’s auto, home, life, health, or other insurance, ReMark International B.V.("<a href="/">InsQuoteNow.com</a>") helps you find coverage.</p>

<p><a href="/">INSQUOTENOW.COM</a>  provides consumers with a free, simple, and effective way to shop for insurance. As a leading online marketplace for insurance, <a href="/">INSQUOTENOW.COM</a>  works with a combination of local agents, regional and national carriers (we refer to all of these as "Agents") to ensure that you are provided with a wide variety of responses to your request for a quote.</p>

<p>Helping you save money is important but so is your privacy. This policy outlines our commitment to protecting your information.</p>

<h3>Your Privacy is Important to Us</h3>

<p>At <a href="/">INSQUOTENOW.COM</a>, your privacy is our chief concern. We understand that you entrust us with your private information to help us match you with an insurance Agent who can meet your needs. In exchange for your trust, you expect and deserve our commitment to treat your information with respect. Rest assured that we protect your privacy. Under no circumstances will <a href="/">INSQUOTENOW.COM</a>  sell or share any personal information about you to or with any person or organization except: as authorized by you, to participating Agents or other parties involved in your transaction, or as may be required by law or court order. The Privacy Policy below describes the standards we adhere to in handling information about you and your insurance quote request.</p>

<a name="1"></a><h3>1. Who We Are and What We Do</h3>

<p><a href="/">INSQUOTENOW.COM</a>  is a leading online marketplace connecting consumers with insurance Agents to compete for their business across a variety of insurance policy types. <a href="/">INSQUOTENOW.COM</a>  is not an insurance agency and does not provide quotes directly to consumers. Rather, <a href="/">INSQUOTENOW.COM</a>  is a free matching service that instantly connects you with our nationwide network of quality insurance Agents</p>

<p>After you submit your quote request via our web site, <a href="/">INSQUOTENOW.COM</a>  immediately matches you to local and national Agents who can meet your insurance needs. We create this connection by emailing you the list of matching Agents and their contact information as well as passing your information to the Agents. Your matching Agents will use the information you provided in your quote request to run your quote and contact you with the details. Sometimes, <a href="/">INSQUOTENOW.COM</a>  does not have a matching Agent based on your location and insurance needs. In this event, your information may be passed to one of our partner companies to ensure that you receive as many competitive quotes as possible.</p>

<p><a href="/">INSQUOTENOW.COM</a>  does not charge a fee to use our service. <a href="/">INSQUOTENOW.COM</a>  is paid a fee by the insurance Agents who purchase leads through our service.</p>

<a name="2"></a><h3>2. Information Collected</h3>

Any contact from partner companies is not covered under this policy, nor are any further communications you may have with Agents from those partner companies.
  </li><li> Companies that perform information processing on our behalf – <a href="/">INSQUOTENOW.COM</a>  partners with companies who manage our email systems and conduct surveys on our behalf. Your personal information is shared with these companies on a limited basis so that we can create and target our marketing campaigns.
  </li><li> Law Enforcement – <a href="/">INSQUOTENOW.COM</a>  will share your personal information in response to law enforcement officers, government personnel, court order or subpoena. This information will only be shared in order to comply with a legal obligation.
</li></ul>

<a name="4"></a><h3>4. Communications You Can Expect</h3>

This email will include a link to your list of matching Agents and helpful information to aid you in making your insurance choices. Note that the Agents contained in your matching list will be those responding to you with your customized quote(s).</p>

<p>In the event that a match cannot be made, you will receive an email informing you that no Agents meet your quote request requirements. This email will be sent within a matter of hours after you complete a quote request.</p>

<p>After submitting a quote request through <a href="/">INSQUOTENOW.COM</a>, your quote request is matched with qualified, licensed Agents. These Agents may contact you via the information that you provided in your quote request.</p>

You should thoroughly read the Privacy Policy of the Agent you select in order to make sure that you are comfortable with their policy.</p>
