				<p>This Privacy Policy explains the practices employed by IPC Media in 
collecting and using your information and the ways in which you can 
influence these. This Privacy Policy relates to websites operated from 
time to time by IPC Media.</p>

<p>IPC Media will collect various types of information about you through
 your use of our websites to process your requests and orders, to 
provide a more personalised web-surfing and shopping experience and to 
help us improve the services we offer. In doing this we may also collect
 anonymous information about you through the use of cookies. IPC Media 
will be the Data Controller of any personal data we collect about you.</p>

<h3>What information do we collect about you?</h3>

<p>Through IPC Media websites you can, amongst other things, order 
products and services, enter competitions, subscribe to our 
publications, vote in polls, play games, complete surveys and place 
postings on forums.</p>

<p>In order to process your requests and orders and other activities, it
 may be necessary to collect personally identifiable information about 
you. The type of personally identifiable information that may be 
collected includes, but is not limited to: your name, address, e-mail 
address, telephone number, credit/debit card information. You may also 
be asked to provide additional (non-mandatory) pieces of information for
 our research purposes or choose to provide information by making a 
posting on a forum.</p>

<p>In addition, we may collect anonymous information about you and your 
website usage through the use of cookies. Such information will not be 
personally identifiable to you.
If you choose, you may opt out of allowing our cookies to collect 
information about you.
For further information please go to the section on cookies below.</p>

<p>Some IPC Media websites offer services that require you to set up an 
account prior to receiving such services. To create a secure account you
 may use your email address and a password or, if the IPC Media website 
offers a Facebook single-sign-on service, you will be able to register 
for and log in to your IPC Media website account using your Facebook 
account. </p>

<p>If you choose to use the Facebook single-sign-on service we will gain
 access, upon your explicit consent, to your basic Facebook profile 
information, such as your name, profile picture and list of friends and 
any other information notified to you by Facebook prior to you 
completing the single-sign-on authorisation process. </p>

<h3>How will we use the information about you?</h3>

<p>We will use the personal information you provide to us to process 
your orders and requests. We may also use this information to 
communicate with you directly, for example to notify you in the event 
you have won a competition or to contact you in relation to an account 
you hold with us. </p>

<p>We will use the anonymous information we collect about you to analyse
 web usage and compile aggregate statistics about our users. We will use
 this non-personally identifiable information, for advertising and

please ensure that you opt-in or opt-out of receiving such information 
as appropriate. If you have consented to receiving such material you may

<h3>What will we disclose to third parties?</h3>

<p>If you consent we may sell, rent or trade your personal information 
to third parties for their marketing purposes. Such third parties will 
be carefully selected and registered with the Information Commissioner.</p>

<p>We may also pass your personal information to third parties to enable
 them to process a request, order or service; or to supply you with a 
prize in the event you win a competition or in order to obtain 
professional advice.</p>

<p>We may provide anonymous, non-personally identifiable aggregate 
information to advertisers and our business partners, including 
information relating to sales and web-usage, to enable us to sell 
advertising and monitor the efficacy of our business partnerships. We 
may also pass such statistical information onto reputable third parties 
for onward sale.</p>

<p>It is possible that IPC Media could merge or be acquired by another 
business. If this happens we may share the information that relates to 
you. You will be sent notice of such an event.</p>

<p>IPC Media reserves the right to disclose personally identifiable 
information in order to comply with the law, applicable regulations and 
government requests. We also reserve the right to use such information 
in order to protect our operating systems and integrity as well as other
 users.</p>

<p>Any third parties employed by us to process your data on our behalf 
are subject to contractual obligations to protect the security of your 
data in accordance with the terms of this Privacy Policy.</p>

 personal data, we cannot guarantee the security of your data

<h3>What is a cookie?</h3>

<p> A cookie is a small text file that we, and in certain circumstances 
third parties, place on your browser when you visit our websites or open
 some of our emails. <br>
Cookies, amongst other things, allow IPC Media to recognise you each 
time you re-visit one of our websites and provide you with a more 
personalised user experience. 
There are in existence a variety of different cookies which are designed

<h3>How do we and third parties use cookies? </h3>

<p>You should be aware that information on you may be collected through 
the use of cookies when you use IPC Media websites and/or selected third
 party sites. It is essential that we use some cookies in order to 
provide you with the services you have requested from us. Some cookies, 
however, whilst useful, are not essential, and when using IPC Media 
websites you agree to the use of these non-essential cookies unless you 
specifically set your browser to reject them. Please see 'How to manage 
or refuse cookies' below for further details. </p>

<p>When you initially enter one of our sites we may place an anonymous 
cookie on your browser to enable us to recognise you the next time you 
visit the website. We may also place a further cookie on your browser 
when you register for one of our services, this will enable us to 
remember you next time you come to sign in, eliminating the need for you
 to re-enter your login details and customising your future uses of our 
sites. </p>

<p>Cookies may also be used to track your use of IPC Media websites to 
better develop them, for example, determining which parts of the 
websites are more popular and determining content accordingly. </p>

behavioural advertising and monitor the advertising on our sites to, 
amongst other things, ensure that you are not subjected to intrusive 
advertising. </p>

<p>Small pieces of code called pixel tags, web beacons or GIF files, are
 used in conjunction with cookies to help us manage and monitor our 
online advertising and wider business arrangements with third parties. 
These files will allow us to aggregate anonymous information relating to
 advertising and website usage. The type of information collected 
includes, but is not limited to, information relating to advertising 
responses, page views, promotion views and purchases made. Such pixel 
tags may be used to recognise third party cookies (cookies generated by 
third parties) and inform us and/or third parties of which advertisement
 or link brought you to our website, allowing us to monitor the efficacy
 of our business relationships with third parties. Please see the 
section below entitled 'Use of different cookies' for more detail on the
 various cookies in use by IPC Media and how they work.</p>

 ways described above it is possible to change your browser settings. It
 is also possible to delete existing cookies from your browser. However 
blocking all cookies will affect your web experience and may result in 
some parts of IPC Media websites not functioning properly. Some cookies 
are designed to help save you time, for example, by remembering your 
contact details when you are making an order for the second time â€" 
this means that you will not have to complete the contact section again 
unless your details have changed. The procedure for modifying your 
privacy preferences is different for each internet browser and we 
recommend you visit the following websites for further information on 
altering your cookie settings:</p>
