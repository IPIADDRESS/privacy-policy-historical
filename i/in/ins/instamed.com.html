				<h3>Privacy Statement</h3>
				<p><b>General Information</b><br>
					InstaMed respects the privacy of its customers, business partners and employees and recognizes the requirement to protect all Personal Information that is in the possession of the company. Personal Information also applies to Protected Health Information, as defined by HIPAA*. InstaMed has therefore established this Privacy Statement so that individuals and organizations may understand what information is collected and how that information is used. This Privacy Statement applies to InstaMed and all of its affiliated companies. 
				</p>
				<p><b>What Personal Information does InstaMed collect?</b><br>
					InstaMed may collect certain Personal Information from customers, business partners, and employees in the course of conducting its business operations, as well as personal information from candidates for employment reasons.
					<br><br>
					InstaMed does not collect Personal Information when individuals visit company web sites unless the individual chooses to provide such Personal Information. InstaMed currently does not collect and/or log Internet Protocol addresses, Internet domain names, the web browser and operating system used to access the InstaMed web site, the files visited, the time spent in each file, and the time and date of each visit, except for security purposes. InstaMed does not use cookies on its web sites to track or monitor user activity.
				</p>
				<p><b>How does InstaMed limit access to the Personal Information it stores and processes?</b><br>
					InstaMed has developed and implemented policies and procedures that restrict the access and use of Personal Information based on the specific roles and duties of each member of its organization.
				</p>
				<p><b>How does InstaMed use Personal Information collected?</b><br>
					InstaMed makes reasonable efforts to use, disclose, and request only the minimum amount of Personal Information needed in order to conduct its operations. InstaMed has developed and implemented policies and procedures that reasonably limit the use and disclosure of Personal Information to the minimum necessary.
					<br><br>
					Except as provided in this Statement, InstaMed does not use Personal Information for a purpose other than the stated purpose for which such information is collected. Personal Information given to InstaMed may be transferred across state and country borders for data consolidation, storage and simplified information management. 
				</p>
				<p><b>With whom does InstaMed share Personal Information collected?</b><br>
					InstaMed will not share Personal Information with any other third parties without written authorization of the individual or entity, unless required by, or in connection with, law enforcement action, subpoena or other litigation, applicable law or the specific business transaction intended by the individual when providing the Personal Information. InstaMed will not sell, trade or lease Personal Information to other individuals and/or organizations.
				  </p>
				<p><b>InstaMed's Commitment to the Security of Personal Information</b><br>
					InstaMed is committed to taking reasonable efforts to secure Personal Information provided to the company. To protect the privacy of any Personal Information provided, InstaMed employs industry-standard controls including physical access controls, Internet firewalls, intrusion detection, and network monitoring. In addition, access to sensitive data as defined in this Statement is limited to those individuals and agents having a need to know. 
				</p>
				<p><b>Verification</b><br>
					InstaMed will engage in periodic self-assessment to verify that it continues to be in compliance with this 
					Privacy Statement.
				</p>
				<p><b>Contact Information</b><br>
					If there are any questions regarding the Privacy Statement or someone believes that the privacy of their Personal Information has not been respected, a complaint may be submitted in writing to the attention of:
					<br><br>
					<b>Privacy Officer<br>
						InstaMed <br>
						1528 Walnut Street<br>
						19th Floor<br>
						Philadelphia, PA 19102<br><br></b>
					Once the complaint has been received by the Privacy Officer, an immediate investigation will be launched and appropriate actions will be taken to rectify the situation.  InstaMed will not at any time retaliate against the individual or organization that filed the complaint.
					<br><br>
					Individuals and organizations also have the right to file complaints directly with the Secretary of the Department of Health &amp; Human Services if they believe their privacy rights have been violated.

					InstaMed will review and update this Statement periodically.
