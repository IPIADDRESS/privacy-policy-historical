This information could include for example your first and last name, mailing address, country of residence, e-mail address, telephone or facsimile number, work address and other information.

In order to use any products or services from such third parties you may be required to provide personal information to such third parties. In such event, any personal information you provide to these third parties will be subject to the privacy policy posted on their web site.</p><p class="rteindent1"><u>Cookies, web beacons and similar tracking devices </u></p><p class="rteindent1">Inspiration may use cookies, web beacons or other devices to track your use of the Site, the Services or the Materials (e.g. types of Services or Materials used, number of uses or downloads, number of users of the Site, the Services or the Materials) and our web servers will automatically log the IP/Internet address of your computer. This information is collected in aggregate form, without identifying any use individually. Inspiration may use this aggregated information to for improving and enhancing the Site, the Services and Materials and for statistical analysis. It is not Inspiration’s practice to use this information for any other purposes or to identify any user personally, however, where you have expressly provided consent for the Site, the Services or the Materials to “remember” the unique identifier that you select when you register your account, that unique identifier will be stored on a cookie on your computer and that unique identifier will be linked to your Registration Information. For your information and understanding, a cookie is a small amount of data that is transferred to your browser by a web server and can only be read by the server that gave it to you. It serves as your ID card and enables the web server that gave it to you to record your passwords and preferences. A web beacon is a small gif image that is embedded in an HTML page or email used to track when the page or email has been viewed. Similar devices can be embedded in the Services or Materials to send data to a web server when a set of user-initiated events occur, as when a user clicks on one or more buttons to initiate an action, direction or response on the Site.</p><p class="rteindent1">Most browsers default to allow or accept cookies, and most products and services that include similar devices also default to activate or allow the collection of data. You can set your browser to notify you when you receive a cookie, giving you the option to decide whether or not to accept it (however, some web pages, including those that may be contained in web sites linked to this Site, may require an authorization and may not grant you the option of choosing not to accept cookies or similar devices and will likely not allow you to access those pages or any related products or services).</p><p class="rteindent1">You are also advised that some products and services, including some of the Products, Content and Services on this Site may allow document authors to restrict access to documents, track access to or use of those documents, or involve transmission of data over the Internet to verify authenticity of authors, recipients and documents. Where this type of tracking is not obvious to you, the software and/or services license or terms of use, pop-ups or notifying e-mail will inform you of these features and of any options available to you to disable the features.</p><p class="rteindent1">When Inspiration collects your personal information, it does so to support, record, facilitate and enhance your use of the Site, Products, Content and Services.

These personnel and contractors are bound under strict confidentiality agreements with Inspiration prohibiting disclosure or use of your Registration Information other than for its intended purposes as contemplated by this Privacy Policy.
