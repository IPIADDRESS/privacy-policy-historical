<li>CHANGES IN PRIVACY POLICY </li>
<p></p></strong>

<p>	<strong>
</strong></p><li><strong>PERSONAL INFORMATION</strong></li><strong>
<p></p></strong><p></p>
<p class="rteindent1">Inspiration is committed to respecting your  legal rights with respect to your personal information.  Except in particular circumstances described in this Privacy Policy, or where required by law, regulation, litigation, national security or law enforcement, Inspiration will not provide your name to other companies or organizations without  your consent.</p>
<p class="rteindent1">Inspiration is not responsible for the content or privacy practices of any non-Inspiration web sites to which this Site, Products, Content or Services may link.   You are strongly advised to review the privacy policy(ies) of any of these sites before using them. </p>
<p class="rteindent1">Inspiration also adheres to European Union Safe harbor principles as set forth by the United States Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information covered by the Privacy Policy from the European Union. </p>
<p>	<strong>
</strong></p><li><strong>COLLECTION OF PERSONAL INFORMATION </strong></li><strong>
<p></p></strong><p></p>
<p class="rteindent1">As you access and use the Site, Products, Content and Products, Inspiration may from time to time ask you to provide certain information and data about yourself by filling out and submitting a form or a field on the Site.  This information could include for example your first and last name, mailing address, country of residence, e-mail address, telephone or facsimile number, work address and other information.  Of course, it is optional for you to provide such information, however, in some instances Inspiration may require certain mandatory information about you in order for you to gain access to or use the Site, Products, Content and Services. If you do not provide mandatory data and information with respect to that particular access to or use of the Site, Products, Content and Services, you will not be able to access or use the Site, the Products, Content and Services.</p>
<p class="rteindent1">In order to facilitate our evaluation of your use of the Site, Products, Content and Services, Inspiration will also from time to time collect information about your computer which may include among other information, its operating system, CPU speed, Internet Protocol (IP) address, referring or exit web pages and browser type.  Inspiration will use this information to measure your use of the Site, Products, Content and Services to support, evaluate, enhance and supplement your user experience with any or all of them.  We do not match or link this information with any other information held by Inspiration without your prior consent. </p>
<p class="rteindent1">In addition, Inspiration may choose to supplement the personal information you provide to us with information about you available from other third party sources.  Where permitted by law, we may, for example, supplement your Registration Information with address information provided by the U.S. Post Office to maintain and improve performance of our data base, authenticate users and/or prevent abuse of the Site, Products, Content and Services.  We may also supplement the information you submit to us with demographic or other information (e.g. age and/or interests) stored in third party databases to better focus and enhance and marketing or other communications we send to you about the Site, Products, Content and Services that we feel may be of interest to you. </p>
<p class="rteindent1">In some instances, Inspiration may choose to link from the Site to various third party vendors and service providers who may have products or services that our Site users might find useful, such as those that can be used with or are compatible with the Services and Materials accessible from or enabled by the Site.  In order to use any products or services from such third parties you may be required to provide personal information to such third parties.  In such event, any personal information you provide to these third parties will be subject to the privacy policy posted on their web site. </p>
<p class="rteindent1"><u>Cookies, web beacons and similar tracking devices </u></p>
<p class="rteindent1">Inspiration may use cookies, web beacons or other devices to track your use of the Site, the Services or the Materials (e.g. types of Services or Materials used, number of uses or downloads, number of users of the Site, the Services or the Materials) and our web servers will automatically log the IP/Internet address of your computer. This information is collected in aggregate form, without identifying any use individually.   Inspiration may use this aggregated information to for improving and enhancing the Site, the Services and Materials and for statistical analysis.  It is not Inspiration’s practice to use this information for any other purposes or to identify any user personally, however, where you have expressly provided consent for the Site, the Services or the Materials to “remember” the unique identifier that you select when you register your account, that unique identifier will be stored on a cookie on your computer and that unique identifier will be linked to your Registration Information.   For your information and understanding, a cookie is a small amount of data that is transferred to your browser by a web server and can only be read by the server that gave it to you.  It serves as your ID card and enables the web server that gave it to you to record your passwords and preferences.  A web beacon is a small gif image that is embedded in an HTML page or email used to track when the page or email has been viewed.   Similar devices can be embedded in the Services or Materials to send data to a web server when a set of user-initiated events occur, as when a user clicks on one or more buttons to initiate an action, direction  or response on the Site. </p>
<p class="rteindent1">Most browsers default to allow or accept cookies, and most products and services that include similar devices also default to activate or allow the collection of data.  You can set your browser to notify you when you receive a cookie, giving you the option to decide whether or not to accept it (however, some web pages, including those that may be contained in web sites linked to this Site, may require an authorization and may not grant you the option of choosing not to accept cookies or similar devices and will likely not allow you to access those pages or any related products or services). </p>
<p class="rteindent1">You are also advised that some products and services, including some of the Products, Content and Services on this Site may allow document authors to restrict access to documents, track access to or use of those documents, or involve transmission of data over the Internet to verify authenticity of authors, recipients and documents. Where this type of tracking is not obvious to you, the software and/or services license or terms of use, pop-ups or notifying e-mail will inform you of these features and of any options available to you to disable the features. </p>
<p>    <strong>
</strong></p><li><strong>USE OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION </strong></li><strong>
<p></p></strong><p></p>
<p class="rteindent1">When Inspiration collects your personal information, it does so to support, record, facilitate and enhance your use of the Site, Products, Content and Services.

<p>	<strong>
</strong></p><li><strong>PROTECTION OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION </strong></li><strong>
<p></p></strong><p></p>
<p class="rteindent1">Inspiration classifies any personal information that you submit and provide in connection with your use of the Site, Products, Content and Services as “User Information.” Your User Information is protected in the following ways: </p>
</ol>
<ol>
<li style="list-style:lower-alpha;" class="rteindent2">User Information, when and if it is collected and stored, resides on secure servers that only selected Inspiration personnel and contractors have access to via password.

<li style="list-style:lower-alpha;" class="rteindent2">When users order Products from the Site, Inspiration encrypts User Information as it is transferred to Inspiration’s secure servers thereby taking reasonable measures to prevent unauthorized parties for viewing, disclosing or using such information. </li>
<p class="rteindent1">Any personal information that you submit or provide that does not constitute User Information, but which Inspiration may collect or store also resides on Inspiration’s secure servers and is accessible only by selected Inspiration personnel and contractors whose access is restricted via password.  These personnel and contractors are bound under strict confidentiality agreements with Inspiration prohibiting disclosure or use of your Registration Information other than for its intended purposes as contemplated by this Privacy Policy.  This information is not accessible to you online and so you will not be required to select a password in order to view or modify it. </p>
</ol>
<ol start="6">
	<strong>
<li>TRANSFERS OF INFORMATION TO SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS </li>
<p></p></strong>
