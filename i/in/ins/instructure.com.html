  <h1>Instructure Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p>Instructure, Inc. (<strong>“Instructure”</strong>) is committed to protecting your privacy. We have prepared this Privacy Policy to describe to you our practices regarding the Personal Data (as defined below) we collect from users of our websites, located at <a href="http://www.instructure.com" target="_blank">http://www.instructure.com</a> and <a href="http://canvas.instructure.com" target="_blank">http://canvas.instructure.com</a> (<strong>“Site”</strong>) and/or the services or functionality made available or enabled via the Site by Instructure, to facilitate the sharing of information and collaboration between students, teachers and administrators (<strong>“Services”</strong>). This Privacy Policy applies to anyone using the Services.</p>

  <ol>
    <li><strong>User Consent.</strong> By submitting Personal Data through our Site or Services, you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy and you expressly consent to the processing of your Personal Data in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</li>
    
    <li><strong>A Note About Children.</strong> If you are under the age of 18, you may only use this service and disclose Personal Data with your parent or guardian’s verifiable consent. We do not intentionally gather Personal Data about visitors who are under the age of 13, except to the extent we provide services to those visitors on behalf of schools. More specifically, a school (or a teacher, on behalf of a school) may contract with us to offer our service solely for the benefit of its students and for the school’s system. It is up to the schools for which we act as a service provider to obtain the parents’ verifiable consent for the collection and use of their children’s Personal Data. Instructure requires schools, districts, and teachers to obtain verifiable parental consent from students’ parents before collecting and children’s Personal Data. If you are a student, do not send any of your Personal Data to us, other than what we require from you when initially registering for any Services. In the event that we learn we have collected children’s Personal Data, beyond what we request during the initial registration for the Services, we will delete that information as quickly as possible. If you believe that a student has provided us children’s Personal Data beyond what is required when initially registering for the Services, or that a student’s school, district, or teacher has not obtained verifiable parental consent, please contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@instructure.com">privacy@instructure.com</a>.</li>
    
    <li><strong>A Note to Users Outside of the United States.</strong> Your Personal Data may be processed in the country in which it was collected and in other countries, including the United States, where laws regarding processing of Personal Data may be less stringent than the laws in your country.</li>
    
    <li>
      <strong>Types of Data We Collect.</strong> Instructure collects Personal Data and Anonymous Data from you when you visit our Site, when you send us information or communications, and/or when you use our Services. <strong>“Personal Data”</strong> means data that allows someone to identify or contact you, including, for example, your name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, as well as any other non-public information about you that is associated with or linked to any of the foregoing data. <strong>“Anonymous Data”</strong> means data that is not associated with or linked to your Personal Data; Anonymous Data does not permit the identification of individual persons. We collect Personal Data and Anonymous Data, as described below.

      <ol>
        <li><strong>Data You Provide to Us.</strong> We collect Personal Data from you, such as first and last name, gender, e-mail and mailing addresses, professional title, company name, and password when you create an account to log in to our network. When you order Services on our Site, we will collect all information necessary to complete the transaction, which may include your name, credit card information, billing information and shipping information. We also may retain information on your behalf, such as files and messages that you store using your account. If you provide us feedback or contact us via e-mail, we will collect your name and e-mail address, as well as any other content included in the e-mail, in order to send you a reply, and any information that you submit to us, such as a resume. When you participate in one of our surveys, we may collect additional profile information. When you post messages on the message boards of our Site, the information contained in your posting will be stored on our servers and other users will be able to see it. We also collect other types of Personal Data that you provide to us voluntarily, such as operating system and version and other requested information if you contact us via e-mail regarding support for the Services. We may also collect Personal Data, such as demographic information, from you via the Services or at other points in our Site that state that Personal Data is being collected.</li>
        
        <li><strong>Data Collected via Technology.</strong> To make our Site and Services more useful to you, our servers (which may be hosted by a third party service provider) collect information from you, including browser type, operating system, Internet Protocol (IP) address (a number that is automatically assigned to your computer when you use the Internet, which may vary from session to session), domain name, and/or a date/time stamp for your visit. We also use Cookies (as defined below) and navigational data like Uniform Resource Locators (URL) to gather information regarding the date and time of your visit and the solutions and information for which you searched and which you viewed. Like most Internet services, we automatically gather this data and store it in log files each time you visit our Site or access your account on our network. “Cookies” are small pieces of information that a website sends to your computer’s hard drive while you are viewing a web site. We may use both session Cookies (which expire once you close your web browser) and persistent Cookies (which stay on your computer until you delete them) to provide you with a more personal and interactive experience on our Site. Persistent Cookies can be removed by following Internet browser help file directions. If you choose to disable Cookies, some areas of our Site may not work properly.</li>
        
        <li><strong>Data That We Collect from You About Others.</strong> If you decide to create an account for and invite a third party to join our network, we will collect your and the third party’s names and e-mail addresses in order to send an e-mail and follow up with the third party. You or the third party may contact us at privacy@instructure.com to request the removal of this information from our database.</li>
        
        <li><strong>Outside of the U.S.</strong> For Users using the Instructure Services from the European Economic Area or other non-U.S. territories, please note that any data you enter will be transferred outside the European Economic Area or such other non-U.S. territory for use by Instructure and its affiliates for any of the purposes described herein.
