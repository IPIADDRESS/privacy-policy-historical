      <p><a rel="nofollow" href="#table_of_contents">Return to Top</a></p>
      

      <p>The following are the types of information we may collect: </p>
      <p id="web_site_usage"><strong>Web Site Usage Information &amp; Device Identifiers</strong></p>
      <p>
        We may receive and store certain types of web site usage information whenever you visit or interact with the Web Site. For example, we may collect the page served, the time, the source of the request, the type of browser making the request, the preceding page view and other similar information. We may also collect your IP address or some other unique identifier for the particular device you use to access the Internet, as applicable (collectively referred to herein as a "Device Identifier"). A Device Identifier is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer, your cell phone, or other device used to access the Internet, and our computers identify your device by its Device Identifier. We may associate your Device Identifier with the personal information you provide.  When analyzed, web site usage information helps us determine how visitors arrive at the Web Site, what type of content is most popular, what type of content you may find most relevant, and what type of visitors are interested in particular kinds of content and advertising. 
      </p>
      <p id="info_provide"><strong>Information You Provide Us</strong></p>
      <p>
      We may ask you to provide us with two types of information: (1) personal information, which is information that could reasonably be used to identify you personally, such as your name, e-mail address and physical address; and (2) demographic information, such as gender, zip code, or similar information. We may collect this information at various places and forms on the Web Site, including registration forms for newsletters and other e-mail communications, when you communicate or otherwise interact with us, when you submit information to us (whether or not the information is intended to be posted on the Web Site), or when you enter or participate in contests, sweepstakes, surveys or voting or when you purchase a product or service through the Web Site.  Providing us with information about yourself is your choice, and you can always choose not to provide certain information, but then you may not be able to take advantage of some of the Web Site's features.
      </p>
      
      <p id="info_other"><strong>Information from Other Sources</strong></p>

      <p>
        We may receive information about you from other sources; for example, we may obtain geographic or  demographic information, or information regarding your possible interests, from third parties. We may use this information for a variety of purposes, including to enhance our ability to serve you and to tailor content and ads we serve to you. We may combine the information we receive from those other sources with information we collect through the Web Site. In those cases, we will apply this Privacy Policy to any personal information received, unless otherwise specifically disclosed by us at the time you provide your personal information. 
      </p>
      
      <p id="send_to_a_friend"><strong>Send To A Friend</strong></p>
      
      <p>If you send a friend a communication from the Web Site, the information you provide (names, e-mail addresses, phone numbers, etc.) is used on a one-time basis to facilitate the communication and is not used for any other marketing purpose, unless we obtain additional consent.</p>

      <p id="cookies"><strong>Cookies</strong></p>
      
      <p>The Web Site uses standard technology called "cookies," which are small data files that are transferred to your computer (or other Internet-accessing device) when you visit the Web Site and allow your browser to accept cookies. Cookies automatically identify your web browser to the Web Site whenever you visit the Web Site, and may make navigating and using the Web Site easier for you.  Also, by tracking how and when you use the Web Site, cookies help us determine which areas are popular and which are not.  Many improvements and updates to the Web Site are based on data obtained from cookies. Additionally, accepting cookies may allow you to, among other things, personalize your experience on the Web Site.  Cookies may also allow the Web Site to present to you advertising that may be of interest to you as well as limit how often you see certain ads that may detract from your user experience on our Web Site.  If you do not want to allow information to be collected through the use of cookies, you can generally opt out of providing this information by setting your browser to reject cookies. However, please be aware that some areas of the Web Site may not provide you with an acceptable user experience if you have disabled the use of cookies.</p>
      
      <p id="web_beacons"><strong>Web Beacons</strong></p>
      
      <p>The Web Site and any communications sent by the Web Site may contain electronic images (generally, single-pixel ".gif" images) called "web beacons."

        <li>determining whether or not messages were opened, links were clicked or notifications/offers were acted upon.</li>
      </ul>
      
      
      <p id="how_we_use"><strong>HOW WE USE THE INFORMATION COLLECTED</strong></p>

      <p>The information you provide to us may be used to:</p>
      
      <ul>
      	<li>Send you newsletters, e-mails and/or other communications for which you have registered;</li>
        <li>Contact you about the Web Site, including, without limitation, in our discretion to notify you of changes to this Privacy Policy, the Web Site’s <a rel="nofollow" href="/terms.aspx">Terms of Use</a>, or other policies that affect your use of the Web Site;</li>
        <li>Confirm or fulfill an order you have made;</li>
        <li>Provide special offers or promotional materials to you on behalf of us or third parties;</li>
        <li>Contact you with regard to a sweepstakes, contest or promotion in which you have participated;</li>
        <li>Authorize a purchase or complete a transaction that you have requested, i.e., to deliver the products or other services that you ordered, and, if necessary, to invoice you;</li>

        <li>Generate story ideas for Inside Edition; and</li>
        <li>For other purposes disclosed when you provide your information.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>Moreover, if you submit to Company and/or the Web Sites comments, photographs, videos, music, text or other content, it maybe published online or offline (including on-air, on a CD or DVD, through wireless distribution, and transmission of soft copies, or any other media or format currently existing or hereafter developed), and we may publish your name, voice, likeness and other personal information in connection with publishing the content or a portion of the content, and we may use the content and any excerpt from the content in connection with advertising, marketing, publicity and promotional activities.  Please also see "Information You Submit" in our <a rel="nofollow" href="/terms.aspx">Terms of Use</a>, which governs any content you submit through the Web Sites. </p>
      
      <p>Please note that information submitted to the Web Site via the "contact us" or "Submit Your Story" feature or other similar mechanisms will not necessarily receive a response.

      <p><a rel="nofollow" href="#table_of_contents">Return to Top</a></p>
      
      
      <p>The Web Site may use third party network advertisers to serve advertisements on the Web Site and may use a traffic measurement service to analyze traffic on the Web Site.  Network advertisers are third parties that display advertisements based on your visits to the Web Site and other web sites you have visited. Third-party ad serving enables us to target advertisements to you for products and services in which you might be interested. Although advertisers and other companies do not have access to cookies set by the Web Site, the Web Site's third party ad network providers, the advertisers, the sponsors, and/or traffic measurement services may themselves set and access their own cookies on your computer if you choose to have cookies enabled in your browser or they may otherwise have access to non-personal information. These third party cookies, are set to, among other things, help deliver advertisements to you that you might be interested in, to prevent you from seeing the same advertisements too many times and to conduct research regarding the usefulness of certain advertisements to you. Note that any images (or any other parts of a web page) served by third parties in association with third party cookies may serve as web beacons, which enable third parties to carry out the previously described activities. Third party cookies and web beacons are governed by each third party’s specific privacy policy, not this one. While we may use a variety of companies to serve advertisements on the Web Site, you may wish to visit <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp" target=" _blank">http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp</a>, which provides information regarding the "opt-out" procedures of certain third party ad servers we may use.</p>
