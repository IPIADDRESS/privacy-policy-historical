    <h1>Privacy Statement</h1>
    <div id="boxedcontent">
      <p>
      <strong>EFFECTIVE DATE:</strong>
      The most recent version of this Privacy Policy, as revised, is effective
      as of October 28, 2004
      </p>
      <p>
      This Privacy Policy applies to certain web sites which are owned and/or
      operated by or on behalf of CBS Broadcasting Inc., UPN, VTSG (Viacom
      Television Stations Group), King World Productions, Inc. and/or other
      affiliated entities controlled by, or under common control with, such
      parties (each such web site being individually referred to herein as
      the "Web Site"). If you have arrived at this Privacy Policy by "clicking"
      on an authorized link from a Web Site, then this Privacy Policy applies
      to such Web Site, and the individual entity which owns and/or operates
      the particular Web Site from which you "clicked" to this Privacy Policy
      via an authorized link shall be referred to herein as "Sponsor," "we" or
      "us." Sponsor respects the privacy of its users, and this Privacy Policy
      explains what information we collect on our Web Site and how we use such
      information. Please read this Privacy Policy carefully. In addition,
      please review the Terms of Use posted at the Web Site, which governs your
      use of the Web Site. Your use of our Web Site indicates to us that you
      have read and accepted our privacy practices, as outlined in this Privacy
      Policy and our Terms of Use.
      </p>

      <p>
      <strong>Applicability</strong><br>
      Please note that this Privacy Policy only applies to Web Sites owned
      and/or operated by or for Sponsor, and upon which Sponsor has placed a
      "link" which, when "clicked", transfers you to this Privacy Policy. It
      is not applicable to the individual web sites owned, sponsored or operated
      by or for any independent television or radio stations affiliated with
      Sponsor. While on our Web Site, you may encounter links to these or
      other web sites or online material. If you "click" on a link to such a
      third party, the "click" takes you off our Web Site and to a third party's
      web site, which is beyond Sponsor's control. These other web sites may
      set their own cookies, collect data, and/or have their own privacy
      policies. This Privacy Policy only covers information collected at the
      Web Site, and does not cover any information collected by any other web
      site or offline by Sponsor (unless otherwise specifically stated or
      disclosed by Sponsor), its corporate affiliates, broadcast affiliates,
      licensees or any other company, and we encourage you to review the
      privacy policy of any other web site you visit.
      </p>
      <p>
      In addition, please note that this Privacy Policy does not apply to any
      information you may disclose publicly in any chat rooms, message boards,
      or similar web pages. You should keep in mind that whenever you publicly
      disclose information about yourself online – for example, via message
      boards or chat rooms – that information could be collected and used by
      people that you do not know. In addition, certain message boards and
      similar user forums may display IP addresses (as defined below) along
      with the message poster's name and message. Sponsor bears no
      responsibility for any action or policies of any third parties who
      collect any information users may disclose on the message boards, chat
      areas or other user forums, if any, on the Web Site.
      </p>

      <p>
      <strong>Information Sponsor Collects</strong><br>
      Personally Identifiable Information: Personally identifiable information
      is information that could reasonably be used to identify you personally
      (such as your name, address, birth date or e-mail address), which we refer
      to in this Privacy Policy as "PII." Generally, you may browse our Web
      Site without providing us with PII. However, there may be times when we
      ask you to provide us with certain PII, such as when you choose to
      register with our Web Site and/or for newsletters or choose to participate
      in an online contest, sweepstakes, survey or voting procedure. We may
      also ask you to provide us with demographic information or information
      regarding your interests, hobbies or similar information. Sponsor
      reserves the right, at any time, to add features to our Web Site that
      require you to register or otherwise provide PII, including credit card
      information, or to require registration to access our Web Site. You can
      choose not to provide certain information, but then you may not be able
      to take advantage of or participate in some of the Web Site's features.
      We may combine the information we collect with information available from
      other sources, including information received from promotional partners
      or other third parties. We may provide you the opportunity to e-mail a
      friend an article, electronic greeting card or other special feature from
      our Web Site. The e-mail addresses you supply us for those activities
      will be used to send the requested e-mail and will not be used to send
      you or your friend any other e-mail communications.
      </p>
      <p>
      The Web Site does not knowingly collect PII from children under thirteen
      (13) years of age: This is not a web site directed to children under the
      age of 13, and Sponsor does not knowingly collect any information from
      children under 13 years of age at the Web Site. If you are under 13 years
      of age, do not send any information about yourself to Sponsor. If Sponsor
      discovers that a child under the age of 13 has provided the Web Site with
      PII , Sponsor will delete that child's PII from its system.
      </p>
      <p>
      <strong>Anonymous Information:</strong> When you visit the Web Site, our
      web servers automatically collect web site usage information. Web site
      usage information is anonymous information that describes how our visitors
      use and navigate our Web Site, and it includes the number and frequency of
      visitors to each web page and the length of their stays. We collect the
      anonymous information automatically sent to us by your web browser, such
      as browser type, referrer data that identifies the web page visited prior
      and subsequent to visiting our Web Site, and IP address. We also may
      determine what technology is available through your browser in order to
      serve you the most appropriate version of a web page. For example, we may
      determine that you have installed a version of Flash, and we will then
      send you the appropriate Flash version of the web page rather than an
      HTML page.
      </p><p>
      </p><p>
      <strong>IP Addresses:</strong> An IP address is a number that is assigned
      to your computer or network when you are on the Internet. When visitors
      request pages from our Web Site, our servers log the visitor's IP address.
      We may collect IP addresses for a variety of internal purposes, such as
      system administration, to report aggregate information to our business
      partners or to audit the number of visits to different pages on our Web
      Site. Please note that some services within our Web Site, such as certain
      message boards, may display IP addresses along with the message poster's
      name and message.
      </p>
      <strong>Cookies:</strong> Cookies are information files that our Web Site
      may place on your computer to provide extended functionality and to
      personalize your experience at our Web Site. We may use cookies for a
      number of purposes. For example, we may use cookies to track usage
      patterns on the Web Site and we may use cookies when we conduct polls
      and sweepstakes to limit multiple responses and registrations. Or, we
      may use cookies to record registration and personalization information,
      enabling you to save your user name and password. We do not store any PII
      in cookies, but we may link the cookie to any information we collect. You
      can, of course, disable cookies on your computer by indicating this in
      the preferences or options menus in your browser. However, it is
      possible that some parts of the Web Site will not operate correctly if
      you disable cookies. You should consult with your browser's
      provider/manufacturer if you have any questions regarding disabling
      cookies.
      <p></p>

      <p>
      <strong><u>Sponsor's Use and Disclosure of Collected Information</u></strong>
      </p>

      <p>
      <strong>Sponsor:</strong> Sponsor may use your PII to provide the
      information or content you have requested, to contact you or to fulfill
      prizes in connection with a contest or sweepstakes, to contact you about
      Sponsor programs, products, features or services, or for other purposes
      disclosed at the time of collection. We may also use your PII to contact
      you regarding your use of our Web Site or changes to our Privacy Policy,
      Terms of Use or other policy or terms that affect you and your use of our
      Web Site. If you e-mail someone else an article, electronic greeting card
      or other special feature from our Web Site, we will use the information
      you provide about someone else to send that person the requested e-mail.
      Sponsor may use information collected about our users to improve the
      content and navigation of our Web Site, or for other internal purposes.
      </p>
      <p>
      <strong>Third parties providing services on our behalf:</strong> Sponsor
      may employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on its
      behalf. Examples may include hosting the Web Site, sending communications
      on our behalf, hosting message boards or other user forums, analyzing
      data, providing marketing assistance, creating, hosting and/or running
      contests/sweepstakes/games and providing customer service. These third
      parties may have access to our users' PII in order to provide these
      services to us or on our behalf, but they are not permitted to use it for
      other purposes.
      </p>
      <p>
      <strong>Other Third Parties:</strong> Sponsor may disclose anonymous,
      aggregated user statistics to third parties for a variety of purposes.
      For example, we may disclose how many individuals visited certain areas
      of our Web Site, or how many men or women receive our newsletter. Sponsor
      does not rent, sell or otherwise disclose your PII to third parties
      unless disclosed to you at the time such information is collected or
      unless you otherwise give consent, other than in the following limited
      circumstances:
      </p>
      <p>
      <u>Legal action.</u> Sponsor may disclose information about its users,
      including PII , when legally required to do so, at the request of
      governmental authorities conducting an investigation, to verify or
      enforce compliance with the policies governing our Web Site and applicable
      laws, or to protect against misuse or unauthorized use of our Web Site.
      Sponsor may also disclose user information whenever we believe disclosure
      is necessary to limit our legal liability, to protect or defend our rights
      or property or protect the safety, rights or property of our users.
      </p>
      <p>
      <u>Corporate change.</u> Sponsor may sell, transfer or otherwise disclose
      user information, including PII , to a successor entity in connection with
      a corporate merger, consolidation, the sale of substantially all assets,
      or other fundamental corporate change respecting the Web Site.
      </p>

      <p>
      <strong><u>Security</u></strong><br>
      Sponsor takes steps to secure the data you submit to us, including
      limiting the number of people who have physical access to our user data.
      Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed
      to be 100% secure. Therefore, Sponsor cannot ensure or warrant the
      security of any information you transmit to Sponsor and you do so at your
      own risk.
      </p>

      <p>
      <strong><u>Consent to Transfer</u></strong><br>
      The Web Site is operated in the United States. If you are located in the
      European Union or elsewhere outside of the United States, please be aware
      that any information you provide to us will be transferred to the United
      States. By using our Web Site, participating in any of our services
      and/or providing us with your information, you consent to this transfer.
      </p>

      <p>
      <strong><u>Acceptance / Changes to Privacy Policy</u></strong><br>
      By using the Web Site, you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy.
      Sponsor reserves the right to modify, alter or otherwise update this
      Privacy Policy at any time in its sole discretion. We will post any
      changes here, so be sure to check back from time to time. However, we
      will only use the PII you provide to the Web Site in a manner consistent
      with this Privacy Policy, unless you give us your consent.
      </p>

      <p>
      <strong><u>Contact Us</u></strong><br>
      If you have any questions, comments or concerns about our Privacy Policy,
      please contact us at the address provided on the Web Site from which you
