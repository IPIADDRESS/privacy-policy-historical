                as revised, is effective as of October 28, 2004 <br>
                <br>
                This Privacy Policy applies to certain web sites which are owned 
                and/or operated by or on behalf of CBS Broadcasting Inc., UPN, 
                VTSG (Viacom Television Stations Group), King World Productions, 
                Inc. and/or other affiliated entities controlled by, or under 
                common control with, such parties (each such web site being individually 
                referred to herein as the “Web Site”). If you have 
                arrived at this Privacy Policy by “clicking” on an 
                authorized link from a Web Site, then this Privacy Policy applies 
                to such Web Site, and the individual entity which owns and/or 
                operates the particular Web Site from which you “clicked” 
                to this Privacy Policy via an authorized link shall be referred 
                to herein as “Sponsor,” "we" or "us." 
                Sponsor respects the privacy of its users, and this Privacy Policy 
                explains what information we collect on our Web Site and how we 
                use such information. Please read this Privacy Policy carefully. 
                In addition, please review the Terms of Use posted at the Web 
                Site, which governs your use of the Web Site. Your use of our 
                Web Site indicates to us that you have read and accepted our privacy 
                practices, as outlined in this Privacy Policy and our Terms of 
                Use. <br>
                <br>
                <strong><u>Applicability</u></strong><br>
                Please note that this Privacy Policy only applies to Web Sites 
                owned and/or operated by or for Sponsor, and upon which Sponsor 
                has placed a “link” which, when “clicked”, 
                transfers you to this Privacy Policy. It is not applicable to 
                the individual web sites owned, sponsored or operated by or for 
                any independent television or radio stations affiliated with Sponsor. 
                While on our Web Site, you may encounter links to these or other 
                web sites or online material. If you "click" on a link 
                to such a third party, the "click" takes you off our 
                Web Site and to a third party’s web site, which is beyond 
                Sponsor’s control. These other web sites may set their own 
                cookies, collect data, and/or have their own privacy policies. 
                This Privacy Policy only covers information collected at the Web 
                Site, and does not cover any information collected by any other 
                web site or offline by Sponsor (unless otherwise specifically 
                stated or disclosed by Sponsor), its corporate affiliates, broadcast 
                affiliates, licensees or any other company, and we encourage you 
                to review the privacy policy of any other web site you visit.<br>
                In addition, please note that this Privacy Policy does not apply 
                to any information you may disclose publicly in any chat rooms, 
                message boards, or similar web pages. You should keep in mind 
                that whenever you publicly disclose information about yourself 
                online – for example, via message boards or chat rooms – 
                that information could be collected and used by people that you 
                do not know. In addition, certain message boards and similar user 
                forums may display IP addresses (as defined below) along with 
                the message poster’s name and message. Sponsor bears no 
                responsibility for any action or policies of any third parties 
                who collect any information users may disclose on the message 
                boards, chat areas or other user forums, if any, on the Web Site.

                <br>
                <u><strong>Information Sponsor Collects</strong></u><br>
                <strong>Personally Identifiable Information: </strong>Personally 
                identifiable information is information that could reasonably 
                be used to identify you personally (such as your name, address, 
                birth date or e-mail address), which we refer to in this Privacy 
                Policy as "PII." Generally, you may browse our Web Site 
                without providing us with PII. However, there may be times when 
                we ask you to provide us with certain PII, such as when you choose 
                to register with our Web Site and/or for newsletters or choose 
                to participate in an online contest, sweepstakes, survey or voting 
                procedure. We may also ask you to provide us with demographic 
                information or information regarding your interests, hobbies or 
                similar information. Sponsor reserves the right, at any time, 
                to add features to our Web Site that require you to register or 
                otherwise provide PII, including credit card information, or to 
                require registration to access our Web Site. You can choose not 
                to provide certain information, but then you may not be able to 
                take advantage of or participate in some of the Web Site’s 
                features. We may combine the information we collect with information 
                available from other sources, including information received from 
                promotional partners or other third parties. We may provide you 
                the opportunity to e-mail a friend an article, electronic greeting 
                card or other special feature from our Web Site. The e-mail addresses 
                you supply us for those activities will be used to send the requested 
                e-mail and will not be used to send you or your friend any other 
                e-mail communications.<br>
                <br>
                <strong>The Web Site does not knowingly collect PII from children 
                under thirteen (13) years of age:</strong> This is not a web site 
                directed to children under the age of 13, and Sponsor does not 
                knowingly collect any information from children under 13 years 
                of age at the Web Site. If you are under 13 years of age, do not 
                send any information about yourself to Sponsor. If Sponsor discovers 
                that a child under the age of 13 has provided the Web Site with 
                PII, Sponsor will delete that child’s PII from its system. 
                <br>
                <br>
                <strong>Anonymous Information:</strong> When you visit the Web 
                Site, our web servers automatically collect web site usage information. 
                Web site usage information is anonymous information that describes 
                how our visitors use and navigate our Web Site, and it includes 
                the number and frequency of visitors to each web page and the 
                length of their stays. We collect the anonymous information automatically 
                sent to us by your web browser, such as browser type, referrer 
                data that identifies the web page visited prior and subsequent 
                to visiting our Web Site, and IP address. We also may determine 
                what technology is available through your browser in order to 
                serve you the most appropriate version of a web page. For example, 
                we may determine that you have installed a version of Flash, and 
                we will then send you the appropriate Flash version of the web 
                page rather than an HTML page. <br>
                <br>
                <strong>IP Addresses</strong>: An IP address is a number that 
                is assigned to your computer or network when you are on the Internet. 
                When visitors request pages from our Web Site, our servers log 
                the visitor’s IP address. We may collect IP addresses for 
                a variety of internal purposes, such as system administration, 
                to report aggregate information to our business partners or to 
                audit the number of visits to different pages on our Web Site. 
                Please note that some services within our Web Site, such as certain 
                message boards, may display IP addresses along with the message 
                poster’s name and message.<br>
                <br>
                <strong>Cookies:</strong> Cookies are information files that our 
                Web Site may place on your computer to provide extended functionality

                <strong>Third parties providing services on our behalf: </strong>Sponsor

                hosting and/or running contests/sweepstakes/games and providing 
                customer service. These third parties may have access to our users’ 
                PII in order to provide these services to us or on our behalf, 
                but they are not permitted to use it for other purposes.<br>
                <br>
                <strong>Other Third Parties:</strong> Sponsor may disclose anonymous, 
                aggregated user statistics to third parties for a variety of purposes.

                Sponsor does not rent, sell or otherwise disclose your PII to 
                third parties unless disclosed to you at the time such information 
                is collected or unless you otherwise give consent, other than 
                in the following limited circumstances: </font></p>
              <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><u>Legal action.</u> 
                Sponsor may disclose information about its users, including PII, 
                when legally required to do so, at the request of governmental 
                authorities conducting an investigation, to verify or enforce 
                compliance with the policies governing our Web Site and applicable 
                laws, or to protect against misuse or unauthorized use of our 
                Web Site. Sponsor may also disclose user information whenever 
                we believe disclosure is necessary to limit our legal liability, 
                to protect or defend our rights or property or protect the safety, 
                rights or property of our users. </font></p>

                all assets, or other fundamental corporate change respecting the 
                Web Site.</font></p>
              <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><u>Security</u></strong><br>
                Sponsor takes steps to secure the data you submit to us, including 
                limiting the number of people who have physical access to our 
                user data. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet 
                can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. Therefore, Sponsor cannot 
                ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit 
                to Sponsor and you do so at your own risk. <br>
