							        <p>Instem  plc and its group companies are committed to protecting your privacy.&nbsp; This policy, together with the terms and  conditions of use and our statement on cookies, set out the basis on which any  personal data which we collect from you, through our website, will be used by  us.</p>
                                    <p>Please  read this privacy policy carefully.&nbsp; By  using this website, you agree to the way in which your personal information  will be used as set out in this policy.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Information we may collect from you</strong></li>
                                    </ul>
                                    
                                    <p>When  you use our website, we collect and process personal information about  you.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
                                    <p>This  includes information which you may provide to us when you complete one of the  forms on our website.&nbsp; For example, you  may do this to make an enquiry with us or to request further information from  us about one of our products or services.&nbsp;  This might include a request for a quote or a virtual demonstration. </p>
                                    <p>From  time to time, we also advertise vacancies on our website and you may apply for  a position with us which may involve sending personal information about  yourself through our website or by contacting us by email for example, if you  send in a copy of your CV.&nbsp; Similarly, we  invite interest from students who may be looking for an internship or work  experience and again, this may involve providing personal information to  us.&nbsp; </p>
                                    <p>More  generally, we may also hold information if you contact us in other ways for  example, to raise an enquiry via email or perhaps over the phone.&nbsp; </p>
                                    <p>The  information which we may hold about you will usually include your name and job  title and contact details including your address, telephone number and email  address.&nbsp; If you are applying for a  position or work experience with us, then we may also hold information about  your experience and work history. We might also collect information from you  about any disabilities that you may have in order for us to make reasonable  adjustments if necessary for example, if you attend an interview with us.</p>
                                    <p>We may  also hold information about interest which you have shown in any of our  products and services and may also keep a record of correspondence which you  have sent to us, including a record of any complaints.</p>
                                    <p>We may  collect information about your computer, including if available, your IP  address, operating system and browser type for system administration  purposes.&nbsp; We may also collect information  about visits to our website including for example, traffic data, location data  and other communications data. </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>How we use your information</strong></li>
                                    </ul>
                                    
                                    <p>Your personal data will be held on our records and used for the  proper administration of our business, including by way of example, to deal  with and process your enquiries and to provide you with any further information  which you may have requested.&nbsp; </p>
                                    <p>From time to time we may also contact you about our products and  services and which we feel may be of interest to you.&nbsp; If at any time you wish to stop receiving any  such information from us then you can write to us at <a href="mailto:info@instem.com">info@instem.com</a>.&nbsp; Similarly,  when we send out our email marketing communications, you can click on the  “unsubscribe” link which is included at the bottom of our email communications.  &nbsp;</p>
                                    <p>Where you have sent information to us as part of an application  for a vacancy or to enquire about work experience, we will use the personal  information which you provide to assess your application.&nbsp; We may also retain that information for  future reference.</p>
                                    <p>We are an international business and have offices in Europe and in  other parts of the world including North America and the Far East.&nbsp; This means that in some cases, the  information which we collect from you may be transferred to and stored at a  destination which is outside the European Economic Area.&nbsp; Examples of situations in which we might  transfer your details overseas to our other offices, include if you are  applying for a position in one of our overseas offices or if your enquiry is  best dealt with by one of those offices. </p>
                                    <p>We do take data security seriously and we will take steps as  reasonably necessary to ensure that your data is treated securely and in  accordance with this policy.&nbsp;&nbsp; Please  note however that the transmission of information via the internet can never be  guaranteed as entirely secure.&nbsp; Therefore,  whilst we will do our best to protect your personal data, we can’t guarantee  the security of your data transmitted to our site and therefore any  transmission of data is at your own risk.</p>
                                    <p>We may disclose your personal data where we are under a legal  obligation to do so, for example, as explained in our Terms of Use or for our  proper business purposes for example, if we were to buy or sell any business  (if relevant).&nbsp; We may also disclose your  personal information to any member of our group of companies which means one or  more of Instem plc’s subsidiaries.&nbsp; From  time to time we might appoint external third parties to help us with our  business functions for example, external consultants and sub-contractors.&nbsp; We therefore may make your data available to  those entities if reasonable to do so in order to deal with your enquiry or  otherwise as part of our usual business practices. </p>
                                    <p><strong>By providing your personal  data to us, you agree to the transfer, use and storage of your data as set out  in this policy.&nbsp; </strong></p>
                                    <p>If at  any time you need to give information to us about another person, for example,  a work colleague, then you should ensure that that person has given their  consent to providing relevant details to us and you should bring this policy to  their attention. &nbsp;</p>
