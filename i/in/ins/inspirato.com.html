<h3 id="information-we-collect">The Information We Collect</h3>

<p>We collect both personal and non-personal information from
you.</p>

<p>For the purpose of this policy, when we use the term "personal
information" we mean information that is collected in conjunction
with your name.&nbsp; For individuals that register on our site
this may include your email address, telephone number, home
address, and zip code.&nbsp; For individuals that decide to become
members of our service this may also include credit card
information, your birthday, and information about your traveling
companions.&nbsp; When we use the term "non-personal information"
we mean information that is not collected in conjunction with your
name.&nbsp;</p>

<h3 id="how-we-collect">How We Collect Information</h3>

<p class="Bullets">We may collect information from you in the
following ways:</p>

<p>- <span style="text-decoration: underline;">By Asking</span>. We
may collect some information from you by asking that you provide it
to us.&nbsp; For instance, when you register on our website,
purchase a membership, request a copy of the InspiratoÂ® Magazine,
book travel online, make or redeem purchases on our sites, we may
ask you for your email address or require you to provide us with
certain information, such as your name, home address, and credit
card information.</p>

<p>- <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Cookies</span>.&nbsp; Many
sites use "cookies," which are small text files that reside on your
computer to identify you as a unique user.&nbsp; We may use cookies
on our website to allow us to, among other things, measure activity
and to personalize your experience.&nbsp; For instance, cookies may
enable us to remember your viewing preferences without requiring
you to re-type a user name and password.&nbsp; Cookies may also
allow us to track your status or progress when requesting products,
services, or information.&nbsp; If you choose, you can set your
browser to reject cookies or you can manually delete individual or
all of the cookies on your computer by following your browser's
help file directions.&nbsp; However, if your browser is set to
reject cookies or you manually delete cookies, you may have some
trouble accessing and using some of the pages and features that are
currently on our website, or that we may put on our website in the
future.</p>

<p>- <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Web
Beacons</span>.&nbsp; A web beacon is an electronic file on a Web
page that allows us to count and recognize users who have visited
that page.&nbsp; Among other things, a web beacon can be used in
HTML-formatted email to determine responses to our communications
and measure their effectiveness - for instance, if you get an email
from us and click on a link in that email to go to our
website.&nbsp; You can generally avoid web beacons in email by
turning off HTML display and displaying only the text portion of
your email.</p>

<p>- <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Internet Protocol
(IP) Address</span>.&nbsp; As you enter our Websites, we capture
and retain the IP address of the device you are using, such as a
personal computer or a mobile device.</p>

<p>- <span style="text-decoration: underline;">"Geo-location
technologies"</span> refers to technologies that permit us to
determine your location.&nbsp; We may ask you to manually provide
precise location information on our website, or to enable your
mobile device to send us your location information.&nbsp; We may
also automatically use information from your web server or computer
to determine general location information, such as the city in
which you live.</p>

<p>- <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Blogs, Online
Postings, and Testimonials</span>.&nbsp; We may decide to allow
users to share comments, postings, testimonials, or other
information.&nbsp; If you choose to submit such information to us,
the information that you submit may be available generally to the
public.&nbsp; Information you provide in these areas may be read,
collected, and used by others who access them.&nbsp;</p>

<h3 id="how-we-use-information">How We Use Information</h3>

<p>Our primary purpose in collecting information about you is to
provide you with products, services, and information that we think
may be of interest to you.&nbsp; For example, we use your
information to:</p>

<p>- Complete or process transactions for you<br>
 - Fulfill booking requests<br>
 - Plan vacations<br>
 - Confirm itineraries<br>
 - Recognize you when you return to our website<br>
 - Tell you about updates to your accounts, products, and
services<br>
 - Answer questions and respond to your requests<br>
 - Make our website easier to use</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>We may use your personal information to advertise and market our
products and services (and those of our Partners) to you, for
example to present targeted advertisements on our website and other
third-party websites, in email marketing, and in direct mail
marketing.&nbsp; We also use your personal information to analyze
the effectiveness of our advertisements, and to determine whether
you would be interested in new products or services we may
offer.</p>

<h3 id="how-we-share-information">How We Share Information</h3>

<p>We may share information about you with third parties in certain
circumstances including in the following situations:</p>

<p>- <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Sharing Your
Information with Service Providers</span>.&nbsp; We may share
information with companies or individuals that provide us with
services.&nbsp; These services may include, among other things,
helping us to provide services that you request, such as planning,
booking, and providing concierges and activity vendors.&nbsp;
Service Providers also help us to create or maintain our databases,
research and analyze the people who request products, services or
information from us, to prepare and distribute communications, or
to respond to inquiries.&nbsp;</p>

<p>- <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Sharing Your
Information With Partner Companies</span>.&nbsp; We may provide
your information to carefully selected outside companies when we
believe their products or services may interest you.&nbsp;</p>

<p>- <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Law Enforcement and
Legal Process</span>.&nbsp; We may report to law enforcement
agencies any activities that we reasonably believe to be unlawful,
or that we reasonably believe may aid a law enforcement
investigation into unlawful activity.&nbsp; In addition, we reserve
the right to release your information to law enforcement agencies
if we determine, in our sole judgment, that either you have
violated our policies, or the release of your information may
protect the rights, property, or safety of InspiratoÂ®, or another
person.</p>

<p>- <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Sharing Your
Information as Permitted by Law</span>.&nbsp; We may share your
information with others as required by, or permitted by, law.&nbsp;
This may include sharing your information with governmental
entities, or third parties in response to subpoenas, court orders,
other legal process, or as we believe is necessary to exercise our
legal rights, to defend against legal claims that have been brought
against us, or to defend against possible legal claims that we
determine in our sole discretion might be brought against us.</p>

<p>- <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Business
Transition</span>.&nbsp; In the event that we, or any portion of
our assets, are acquired or we undergo another transition in our
business, your information may be transferred to the acquiring
company or other entity surviving such a transition.</p>

<p>- <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Advertisers</span>.&nbsp; If
you decide to communicate with a company that advertises with us,
for example by clicking a link that we provide for that advertiser,
we may share personal information with the advertiser, including
personal information that might permit the advertiser to contact
you.&nbsp;</p>

<p>- <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Behavioral
Advertisers</span>.&nbsp; We may participate in behavioral-based
advertising.&nbsp; This means that a third party may use
technology, such as a cookie on your browser or a web beacon, to
identify you on our website so that they can provide advertising
about products and services tailored to your interest.&nbsp; That
advertising may appear either on our website, or on other
websites.&nbsp; If you would like to opt-out of behavioral
advertising based on your use of this website, you can do so by
visiting the <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/" target="_blank">Network
Advertising Initiative</a></span> and the <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.daa.sg/" target="_blank">Digital Advertising Alliance</a></span>.</p>

<h3 id="how-we-secure-information">How We Secure Personal
Information</h3>

<p>We take reasonable and appropriate measures to help keep
information secure, and to help prevent it from becoming disclosed
to individuals who are not described in this policy.&nbsp; While we
follow reasonable procedures to try to protect the information in
our possession, no security system is perfect and we cannot
promise, and you should not expect, that your information will
remain secure in all circumstances.</p>

<h3 id="the-way-we-share">Limiting The Way We Share Your Personal
Information</h3>

<p>If you are a new member, we will typically begin sharing your
information within 30 days of the date you register on our website
or join our club.&nbsp; When you are no longer our member, we will
continue to share your information as described in this notice,
unless you contact us and/or unsubscribe from our or our Partners'
services.</p>

<p>You can contact us at (303) 586-7771 (our menu will prompt you
through your choice) any time to limit our sharing of your personal
information.&nbsp; It may take up to 30 days to remove you from
certain databases and lists.&nbsp; We will still share your
information and communicate with you in connection with servicing
your account, fulfilling your requests, or administering any
promotion or program in which you have elected to
participate.&nbsp; Materials we send you will still include some
offers or promotions of our products and services.</p>

<p>If you decide that you do not want to receive commercial emails
from us, you can "opt-out" from receiving such emails by clicking
on the "unsubscribe" link provided at the bottom of every
commercial email.&nbsp; Please note that if you choose to opt-out,
we will still send you email relating to specific products or
services that you purchase, or email that we believe is pertinent
to any communication that you have sent to us, or relationship that
you may have with us.&nbsp; If you decide at a later time that you
would like to receive commercial emails from us, you can re-add
yourself to our communication list.</p>

<h3 id="how-we-communicate">How We Communicate With You</h3>

<p>If you have any questions or concerns regarding our privacy
policy you may reach us by email at <a href="mailto:privacy@inspirato.com">privacy@inspirato.com</a> or by
telephone at (303) 586-7771.</p>

<p>If we need, or are required, to contact you concerning any event
that involves your information we may do so by email, telephone, or
mail.</p>

<h3 id="california-privacy">Your California Privacy Rights</h3>

parties or corporate affiliates for those third parties or
corporate affiliates' direct marketing purposes.&nbsp; That notice

account that you hold jointly with someone else, your privacy
choices will apply to everyone on your account.&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Other
