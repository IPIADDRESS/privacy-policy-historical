<hr>
<p>PRIVACY STATEMENT AND Q &amp; A</p><p><b>1.	Introduction</b></p><p>           Insurance.com has created this Privacy Statement and Q &amp; A in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to privacy. The following discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices for this website (insurance.com).  The statement also discloses how your information is used by other companies we do business with. </p><p><b>2.	What organizations have access to my nonpublic personally identifiable information? </b></p>
<ol type="a">
<li><b>    Insurance.com</b><br>On the Insurance.com website, we have a variety of 
        areas where you can input information: for storage, to calculate 
        insurance premiums or quotes, to register with Insurance.com and to 
        process insurance purchase requests. We also gather information about 
        your internet address to help understand site usage. In addition, we 
        receive information collected by the insurance agencies or insurance 
        companies that respond to your on-line requests, including application 
        information and information about the insurance policies you purchase. 
        Insurance.com and its technology or marketing service providers may have 
        access to this information, and Insurance.com shares this information. 
        
</li><li><b>Quoting Providers</b><br>
In most cases, the quoting process is anonymous; 
        that is, you do not have to identify yourself or provide information by 
        which you could be identified in order to obtain quote information. (See 
        2.e., regarding quotes obtained through Comparison Market Insurance 
        Agency.) Should you wish to gain quotes for a particular line of 
        insurance, information will be collected (for example car model, 
        coverage amount, etc.) that is shared by Insurance.com with a 
        third-party quoting provider in order to match your information to a 
        list of quotes. Each quoting provider has agreed with us that this 
        information will be used by them only in connection with services you 
        request. 
        
</li><li><b>Insurance Agencies and Insurance Carriers - - In General</b><br>
Should you 
        decide to apply for a particular insurance policy after obtaining a 
        quote through one of our quoting providers, you will be asked to provide 
        additional information needed to complete an insurance application. With 
        your authorization, this information will be forwarded either (1) to an 
        independent insurance agency which has been appointed by the insurance 
        carrier you select and which has agreed to use the information only for 
        the purposes of completing your transaction with the carrier, or (2) 
        directly to the carrier that you have chosen or its affiliated insurance 
        agency. Carriers use personally identifiable information (such as name 
        and address) in combination with other information you provide about 
        your insurance needs to provide an insurance premium estimate. However, 
        the criteria for ratings may vary between participating insurance 
        companies, with each carrier placing a different emphasis on particular 
        items of information you provide. Where permitted by law, your 
        personally identifiable information may be used to verify information 
        that you have provided, to request a credit report or review your claims 
        history from a third party. As your application proceeds, Insurance.com 
        may be updated of your progress. PLEASE NOTE: The insurance carriers are 
        required by law to have their own privacy policies, which likely differ 
        from those of Insurance.com. You may wish to obtain and review the 
        carriers' policies. 
        
</li><li><b>Health and Life Insurance</b><br>
If you are interested in health or life insurance, please see the <a href="javascript:contentWin('http://www.insure.com/privacy_statement.html',760,400);">Quotesmith.com, Inc. Privacy Policy</a>.

If you are interested in dental insurance, please see the <a href="javascript:contentWin('http://www.dentalinsurance.com/cms-500/privacy-insurancedotcom.html',550,400);">Kelsey National Corporation Privacy Policy</a>.

        
</li><li><b>Auto Insurance - - ComparisonMarket Insurance Agency (ComparisonMarket)</b><br>
We work with ComparisonMarket Insurance Agency to provide you with auto insurance quotes and other services in all states except for Massachusetts and New Jersey. In states where ComparisonMarket Insurance Agency is available, ComparisonMarket Insurance Agency requests certain personal information during the quote process in an effort to provide more accurate quote information. Residents of those states are encouraged to see the <a href="javascript:contentWin('http://www.comparisonmarket.com/insurancecom/privacy.asp',517,350);">ComparisonMarket Privacy Policy</a>. 
        
</li><li><b>Travel Insurance</b><br>
If you are interested in travel insurance, please see the <a href="javascript:contentWin('http://www.worldtravelcenter.com/eng/cobrands/inscom/privacy.cfm',625,400);">Travel Insurance Privacy Policy</a> of Insurance.com and Insuractive, Inc. 
        
</li><li><b>Links to Third Party Insurance Sites</b>
<br>In some states, or for some 
        lines of coverage (e.g., homeowners or renters coverage and pet health 
        coverage), we may provide direct links to insurance company or insurance 
        agency sites, usually because we cannot obtain comparative quote 
        information. If you provide information on a carrier web site or 
        purchase insurance from a carrier as a result of visiting Insurance.com, 
        the carrier may share that information with Insurance.com, but 
        Insurance.com will not share it with any unaffiliated third parties. 
        Insurance.com is not responsible for the privacy practices of these 
        third party insurance companies or the content of their web sites. We 
        recommend that you read the privacy statements on the sites of each 
        insurance company or third party agent with which you interact. 
        
</li><li><b>Other Third Party Links</b><br>
You also have the opportunity to purchase books through links with unaffiliated on-line sellers. If you visit those sellers' sites, information (such as type of book, number of sales, etc.), but no personal information, will be shared with Insurance.com. Insurance.com is not responsible for the privacy practices on these third party sites.  We recommend that you read the privacy statements on these sites. </li></ol>
<p><b>3.	How is my nonpublic personally identifiable information used?</b></p>
<ol type="a"><li><b>Providing Services You Request</b><br>
Information that you provide during the quoting process is used to fulfill your requests for insurance quotes or applications.  Information you provide during the registration or application process is: <br>
<ul style="LIST-STYLE-TYPE: circle">
<li>used to facilitate your requests for insurance 
          quotes or applications; 
          
</li><li>used to distribute newsletters, optional user 
          experience surveys or other marketing and promotional materials, 
          unless you opt not to receive this information; and 
          
</li><li>stored by our service providers or within the Insurance.com site in order to enable you to re-access the information at your convenience.</li>
</ul>
</li><li><b>Site Usage - - Cookies</b><br>
Insurance.com also gathers anonymous information and aggregate demographic information, which does not personally identify you.  We use this information to better understand our site usage patterns, and we may share this information with third parties for marketing or technology purposes.  Generally this information is collected through "traffic data" and the use of "Cookies," "Internet Protocol" addresses or other numeric codes or tags used to identify a computer. Again, any disclosure of anonymous information and/or aggregate demographic information will not reveal any personally identifiable information about specific users.<br><br>
A 'cookie' is a message 
        given to a Web browser by a Web server. The browser stores the message 
        in a small text file on the same drive that the browser is installed on. 
        The message is then sent back to the server each time the browser 
        requests a page from the server. It will not be used to help track 
        user's aggregate data from sites other than our own. The only 
        cookie-based data that we track is activity on our own site concerning 
        demographics and site usage analysis. The user needs to have cookies 
        enabled in order to use restricted features of the site. 
        
</li><li><b>Quoting</b><br>
Except as noted in the next paragraph, we offer you the ability to request quotes anonymously. There is no requirement to register or login prior to requesting a quote. As noted above, we share this information with third party quote providers in order to obtain the quote information you request.  The information given during the quoting process is not utilized by Insurance.com for any other purposes and it is not possible for Insurance.com or others to identify you personally based on the inputs you give.<br>
We work with 
        Comparison Market to provide auto insurance quotes and other services 
        for residents of all states except for Alaska, Hawaii, Massachusetts, 
        Michigan, New Jersey, New York, South Dakota, and Texas. Residents of 
        those states serviced by Comparison Market will be asked for certain 
        personal information, including a credit report authorization. This 
        additional information is requested in an effort to provide you with 
        more accurate quote information. 
        
</li><li><b>No Other Disclosure to Unaffiliated Third Parties</b><br>
Unless you 
        expressly give us permission to do so, or unless required by law, we do 
        not willfully disclose your personally identifiable information to 
        unaffiliated third parties, other than the above-described parties with 
        which we contract to make certain services available through our web 
        site and which have agreed that they will keep your information 
        confidential. However, we may share aggregated statistical information 
        about the use of our web site with quoting aggregators, participating 
        insurance companies or other companies we do business with; in this 
        case, your personally identifiable information is not disclosed.</li>
                                                                                            
</ol>
<p><b>4.	What choices are available to me regarding the collection, use and distribution of my nonpublic personally identifiable information? </b></p>
<p>All information provided in connection with the use of My Insurance.com is optional.
During the registration process you are given the option to opt-in to an email distribution list that will provide you with information concerning promotions and updates to the Insurance.com site.

You will be asked for your name, contact details and other information only if you decide to proceed with coverage from a company that has offered an online quote.<br><br>
We work with Comparison Market to provide auto insurance quotes and other services for residents of all states except Alaska, Hawaii, Massachusetts, Michigan, New Jersey, New York, South Dakota, and Texas.

With respect to third party sites to which you may link through Insurance.com, any choices regarding the handling of your personal information will be described on such parties' web sites. You should refer to the privacy statements for those sites for more information. </p>
<p>During the health application process you will automatically opt-in to an email distribution list that will provide you with information concerning promotions and updates concerning the Insurance.com site.  Upon receipt of an email communication you will have the option to opt-out of receiving any further communications.</p>
<p><b>5.	What security measures are in place to protect my nonpublic personally identifiable information? </b></p>
<p>This site uses strong security measures to protect the personal data you provide. Your personal data is stored on a system not directly connected to the Internet. We use a variety of security systems and control measures to restrict access to your data. We use authentication methods to confirm the identity of trusted parties. We support encryption technologies to protect the transmission of your data when you are supplying it, or if we are passing it to other companies we do business with. </p>
