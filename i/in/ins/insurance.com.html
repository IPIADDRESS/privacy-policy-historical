							PRIVACY STATEMENT AND Q &amp; A
							<br>
							<br>
							Insurance.com has created this Privacy Statement and Q &amp; A in order to 
							demonstrate our firm commitment to privacy. The following discloses our 
							information gathering and dissemination practices for this website 
							(insurance.com). The statement also discloses how your information is used by 
							other companies we do business with.

							<b>Q: <a name="personalInfo"></a>What organizations have access to my nonpublic 
								personally identifiable information? </b>
							<br>
							<br>
							<b>A</b>: The following organizations have access to your nonpublic personally 
							identifiable information:
							<ol>
								<li><b>Insurance.com</b><br>
								<div>On the Insurance.com website, we have a variety of areas where you can input 
									information: for storage, to calculate insurance premiums or quotes, and to 
									process insurance purchase requests. We also gather information about your 
									Internet address to help understand site usage. In addition, we receive 
									information collected by the insurance agencies or insurance companies that 
									respond to your online requests, including application information and 
									information about the insurance policies you purchase. Insurance.com and its 
									technology or marketing service providers may have access to this information, 
									and Insurance.com shares this information.</div>
							    </li>
							<li>
								<b>Quoting Providers</b><br>
								<div>For most products, the quoting process is anonymous; that is, you do not have 
									to identify yourself or provide information by which you could be identified in 
									order to obtain quote information. Auto insurance quotes require some personal 
									information in order to provide accurate rates. Auto insurance rates are based 
									on you – who you are, where you live, your driving record, etc. in addition to 
									vehicle information (See 7, regarding quotes obtained through ComparisonMarket 
									Insurance Agency.) Should you wish to gain quotes for a particular line of 
									insurance, information will be collected (for example car model, coverage 
									amount, etc.) that is shared by Insurance.com with a third-party insurance 
									quoting provider in order to match your information to a list of quotes. Each 
									quoting provider has agreed with us that this information will be used by them 
									only in connection with services <b>you specifically request</b>.
								</div>
							</li>
							<li>
								<b>Insurance Agencies and Insurance Carriers – In General</b><br>
								<div>Should you decide to apply for a particular insurance policy after obtaining a 
									quote through one of our quoting providers, you will be asked to provide 
									additional information needed to complete an insurance application. With your 
									authorization, this information will be forwarded either (1) to an independent 
									insurance agency which has been appointed by the insurance carrier you select 
									and which has agreed to use the information only for the purposes of completing 
									your transaction with the carrier, or (2) directly to the carrier that you have 
									chosen or its affiliated insurance agency. Carriers use personally identifiable 
									information (such as name and address) in combination with other information 
									you provide about your insurance needs to provide an insurance premium 
									estimate. However, the criteria for ratings may vary between participating 
									insurance companies, with each carrier placing a different emphasis on 
									particular items of information you provide. Where permitted by law, your 
									personally identifiable information may be used to verify information that you 
									have provided, to request a credit report or review your claims history from a 
									third party. As your application proceeds, Insurance.com may be updated of your 
									progress. PLEASE NOTE: The insurance carriers are required by law to have their 
									own privacy policies, which likely differ from those of Insurance.com. You may 
									wish to obtain and review the carriers' policies.

								 <b>Auto Insurance – ComparisonMarket Insurance Agency (ComparisonMarket)</b><br>
								<div>ComparisonMarket Insurance Agency provides auto insurance quotes and other 
									services in all states except for Alaska, Hawaii and Massachusetts. In 
									situations where ComparisonMarket Insurance Agency is available, 
									ComparisonMarket Insurance Agency requests certain required personal 
									information during the quote process in an effort to provide more accurate

								<b>Links to Third Party Insurance Sites </b>
								<br>
								<div>In some states, or for some lines of coverage (e.g., homeowners or renters 
									coverage; pet health coverage; auto coverage in MA, HI, AK), we may provide 
									direct links to insurance company or insurance agency sites, usually because we 
									cannot obtain comparative quote information. If you provide information on a 
									carrier website or purchase insurance from a carrier as a result of visiting 
									Insurance.com, the carrier may share that information with Insurance.com, but 
									Insurance.com will not share it with any unaffiliated third parties. 
									Insurance.com is not responsible for the privacy practices of these third party 
									insurance companies or the content of their websites. We recommend that you 
									read the privacy statements on the sites of each insurance company or third 
									party agent with which you interact.

							</ol>
							<br>
							<br>
							<b>Q: <a name="publicInfo"></a>How is my nonpublic personally identifiable 
								information used?</b>
							<br>
							<br>
							<div>
								<b>A</b>: Your nonpublic personally identifiable information is used in the following 
								ways:
								<ol style="list-style-position:outside;  ">
								    <li>
								    <b>Providing Services You Request</b><br>
									   Information that you provide during the quoting process is used to fulfill 
										your requests for insurance quotes or applications. Information you provide 
										during the registration or application process is:
										
										<ol style="list-style-type:lower-alpha">
											<li> used to facilitate your requests for insurance quotes or applications;
											</li>
											<li>used to distribute newsletters, optional user experience surveys or other 
											marketing and promotional materials to you, unless you
											<a id="ctl00_ContentPlaceHolder1_optOut1">opt not to receive this information</a>
											; and
											</li>
											<li>
											stored by our service providers or within the Insurance.com site in order to 
											enable you to re-access the information at your convenience.
											</li>
											
										</ol>
									</li>
								
									<li><b>Site Usage – Cookies</b><br>
									<div>
										Insurance.com also gathers <b>anonymous</b> information and aggregate 
										demographic information (such as age, zip code, etc.), which does <b>not</b> personally 
										identify you. We use this information to better understand our site usage 
										patterns, and we may share this information with third parties for marketing or 
										technology purposes. Generally this information is collected through "traffic 
										data" and the use of "Cookies," "Internet Protocol" addresses or other numeric 
										codes or tags used to identify a computer. Again, any disclosure of anonymous 
										information and/or aggregate demographic information will not reveal any 
										personally identifiable information about specific users.
										<br>
										<br>
										A 'cookie' is a message given to a web browser by a web server. The browser 
										stores the message in a small text file on the same drive that the browser is 
										installed on. The message is then sent back to the server each time the browser 
										requests a page from the server. It will not be used to help track user's 
										aggregate data from sites other than our own. The only cookie-based data that 
										we track is activity on our own site concerning demographics and site usage 
										analysis. The user needs to have cookies enabled in order to use restricted 
										features of the site, including the auto quoting process.
									</div>
								</li>
								
									<li> <b>Quoting</b><br>
									<div>
										There is no requirement to register or login prior to requesting a quote. As 
										noted above, we share this information with third party quote providers in 
										order to obtain the quote information you request. ComparisonMarket Insurance 
										Agency provides auto insurance quotes and other services for residents of all 
										states except for Alaska, Hawaii and Massachusetts. Residents of those states 
										serviced by ComparisonMarket will be asked for certain personal information, 
										including a credit report authorization. This additional information is 
										requested in an effort to provide you with more accurate quote information.
									</div>
								</li>
								<li>
									<b>No Other Disclosure to Unaffiliated Third Parties</b><br>
									<div>
										Unless you expressly give us permission to do so, or unless required by law, we 
										do not willfully disclose your personally identifiable information to 
										unaffiliated third parties, other than the above-described parties with which 
										we contract to make certain services available through our website and which 
										have agreed that they will keep your information confidential. However, we may 
										share aggregated statistical information about the use of our website with 
										quoting aggregators, participating insurance companies or other companies we do 
										business with; in this case, your personally identifiable information is not 
										disclosed.

							<b>A:</b> You may decide to&nbsp;<a id="ctl00_ContentPlaceHolder1_optOutLink">opt-out</a>&nbsp;of

							<br>
							<br>
							Except as noted in the next paragraph, during the quoting process on

							<br>
							<br>

							<br>
							<br>
							<b>Q: <a name="inaccuracies"></a>How can I correct any inaccuracies in my nonpublic

							verifying and editing the information prior to submission.
							<br>
							<br>
							<b>Q: <a name="privStatChanges"></a>How will I know if this privacy statement
