<p>Updated as of April 20, 2011</p>
<p><strong>Company Practices Regarding Your Privacy</strong></p>
<p>Welcome to Insurance.com, a website owned by QuinStreet, Inc. We at QuinStreet, Inc. and our affiliated companies worldwide are committed to respecting your online privacy and recognize your need for appropriate protection and management of any information you share with us by using our web sites.</p>
<p>QuinStreet has established the following Online Privacy Policy so that you can understand the care with which we intend to treat your information. This policy describes the privacy practices of this website regarding information we collect and information you voluntarily disclose while taking advantage of the insurance-quoting services on this website, which we provide through our wholly owned subsidiary, QuinStreet Insurance Agency, Inc. (fka Car Insurance.com, Inc.). This policy does not apply to the practices of companies that QuinStreet does not own or control, or to people that QuinStreet does not employ.</p>
<p><strong>Your California Privacy Rights</strong></p>
<p>California has passed legislation requiring certain specific disclosures be made available to California residents who use the Internet and provide information that may be used for marketing purposes. That legislation requires any business that discloses a customer’s personal information (as defined by the act) to any third party for direct marketing purposes to provide the customer a method for obtaining the names, addresses and certain other specified details of anyone who might have received that personal information.</p>
<p>If you are a California resident you may request this information from QuinStreet or any of its affiliates by writing to us via email at info@quinstreet.com or you may send us correspondence at the following address: QuinStreet, Attn: Privacy, 950 Tower Lane, 6th Floor, Foster City, CA 94404. QuinStreet is not obligated to respond to more than one such request from a customer per calendar year.</p>
<p><strong>Information Collected by QuinStreet</strong></p>
<p><strong>Non-Personally Identifiable Consumer Information</strong></p>
<p>QuinStreet collects various types of information from you to better meet your needs and to provide you with a more relevant user experience. Some of this information is collected automatically through cookies (a small text file placed on your computer which can identify your operating system and session ID) or other Internet tracking technologies. The type of information your browser or Internet session may automatically provide us with can include the browser you are using, your Internet domain, the operating system on your computer, your IP address and the URL you saw just before coming to the QuinStreet site, the pages of the site you visited and the URL of the page you visited upon leaving the site. If you take advantage of our insurance-quoting services, we may also use web beacons, which allow our partners to place a cookie on an end user’s computer when they visit one of our partner sites so that when the end user visits our sites, that cookie data is tracked by our partner and our partner can identify that the end user achieved a certain milestone (a commonly used concept also referred to as “pixel tracking”).</p>
<p>QuinStreet may also contract with reputable third-party advertising companies to serve ads on our behalf. These companies may also use cookies or other measures to collect your non-personally identifiable information. We have no access to or control over these cookies, and this policy does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.</p>
<p><strong>Personally Identifiable Consumer Information</strong></p>
<p>In addition, at some of the QuinStreet web sites, we collect information that you may choose to provide to us when requesting additional information from us or from one or more of our clients. Examples of personally identifiable data that you may provide to us include name, address, and email address. If you provide personally identifiable data to us, you may later elect to have your information deleted from our files, or kept from being used for purposes other than for the service requested, by following the opt-out procedures set forth below.</p>
<p>Where you provide your personal information to us to receive an auto insurance quote, this information may include phone number, social security number, marital status, date of birth, gender, occupation, education level, driver’s license number, prior insurance coverage, vehicle identification number (VIN), make, model and number of vehicles on your household.</p>
<p><strong>How Collected Information is Used</strong></p>
<p>The non-personally identifiable information that QuinStreet collects is used for marketing and sales efforts to better target advertisements and other content in an effort to create a more personally relevant experience. The information is also used to predict responses to advertisements, and to help determine which ads perform best and which content is most appropriate for different individuals. If you take advantage of our insurance-quoting services, we may also provide non-personally identifiable information about your use of our websites to quoting aggregators, participating insurance carriers and our business partners.</p>
<p>If you elect to provide QuinStreet with personally identifiable information, we may utilize such information for marketing purposes, and this use may result in follow-up communications from QuinStreet and from our clients. By submitting such information to us, you understand and agree that such submission constitutes making an “inquiry” to us and our affiliated entities, who may contact you via telephone for a limited period even if the telephone number you submitted appears on any state and/of federal Do Not Call list because your inquiry serves as an exception to state and/or federal Do Not Call laws.&nbsp; In addition, that information may be combined with information collected from other sources to assist with targeting ads to your preferences and behaviors, and for other QuinStreet sales and marketing efforts.</p>
<p>If you provide your personal information to us to receive an auto insurance quote, we may utilize such information for the following purposes:</p>

In such situations, we will provide you with an opportunity to opt-out of such sharing. Please be aware that QuinStreet is very careful in selecting companies with whom it does business.</p>

In      addition, if your personal information and email address has been provided      to third parties, we will not be able to make changes to it.

<p>In some states, or for certain lines of coverage (including, but not limited to, homeowners or renters coverage, certain health coverage, life coverage, auto coverage) we may provide direct links to insurance company or agency web sites if we cannot obtain comparative quote information. If you purchase insurance from these third party carriers as a result of visiting our sites the carrier may share your personal information with us regarding the policy which is purchased and related information but we will not share the information with unaffiliated third parties. Please Note: when you purchase third party products and/or services from third party web sites, you become their customer and are subject to their privacy policies.

We encourage you to review these companies' privacy policies and only do business with those who adhere to personal information practices with which you are comfortable.</p>
<p><strong>Do Not Share Disclosure</strong></p>
<p>We do not sell, rent or trade your personal information or email address that you provide in requesting an auto insurance quote with third parties for their promotional purposes.
