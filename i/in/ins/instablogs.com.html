		<h1>About Instablogs Community</h1>


Instablogs Community is an online community of writers,
bloggers, reporters and online Journalists. The Instablogs Network, launched as
blog network, has evolved into a social network of people interested in
reading, writing, reporting and discussing news. In addition to news discussion
and participation, Instablogs members can view profiles, communicate, and make
friends with other Instablogs members. To enrich our members' experience, we
display personal information our users up to some extent to other members and
visitors, which allow our users to identify each other and expand their network
of friends. In addition, we allow members to edit/update their personal
information of their own and also set permissions/preferences how other members
access their profiles.<br><br>



<b>We at Instablogs,
