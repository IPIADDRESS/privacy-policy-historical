Moreover, in case if a member is being evaluated for a higher rank or appointment in they party, this information may also be used to check background of the person before he/she is officially appointed. (ii) Contact Information: The party officials need to contact members of their locality and region on various issues, which include regular party meetings, fund-raising events, demonstrations, and so on. Such contacts could be done via phone numbers, mobile phone numbers, and mostly emails. Moreover, we try to keep members updated with new advancements in the party and the contact information is used for informative purpose too. (iii) Address/Location Information: The mandatory information we need is Country, Province/State, and City/District. This informaiton helps us to analyze data demographically and allows the regional officials to keep in touch with members in the region they are responsible for.

Following sub-sections would clarify WHAT type of information we collect, WHY we collect that data, and to WHOM it is disclosed.<br><br><strong> (i) Personal Information:</strong><br><br> Personal infromation such as First Name, Last Name, and Gender are collected to identify members. We have women wing in the party and women officials need to reach out to female members on our website, and thus we need to sort out data based on gender. Other personal information such as Date-of-Birth and NIC (National Identity Card) number are optional, and will be helpful to party, for example, to analyze how many members are elligible for vote based on their age and whether they have NIC numbers. Moreover, in case if a member is being evaluated for a higher rank or appointment in they party, this information may also be used to check background of the person before he/she is officially appointed.<br><br><strong> (ii) Contact Information:</strong><br><br> The party officials need to contact members of their locality and region on various issues, which include regular party meetings, fund-raising events, demonstrations, and so on. Such contacts could be done via phone numbers, mobile phone numbers, and mostly emails. Moreover, we try to keep members updated with new advancements in the party and the contact information is used for informative purpose too.<br><br><strong> (iii) Address/Location Information:</strong><br><br> The mandatory information we need is Country, Province/State, and City/District. This informaiton helps us to analyze data demographically and allows the regional officials to keep in touch with members in the region they are responsible for. Other address information such as unit, street and postal code are optional and could be used, for example, to send News Letters or Thank You letters to members, or by local officials to organize regular meetings in the areas where majority of members live. Electoral information such as UC and Tehsil is used by local officials to better organize members and keep in touch with them to successfully conduct the party election campaign in the area.<br><br><strong> (iv) Career/Education Information:</strong><br><br> We want members to volunteer in various areas to contribute for a better Pakistan. We arrange various welfare events and projects such as medical camps, helping people in disaster-struck areas and projects like Sasta Tandoor.
