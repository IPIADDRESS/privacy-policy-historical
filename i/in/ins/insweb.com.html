                <p style="margin:0;">(Last updated: November 21, 2011)</p><p>We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting it  through our compliance with this privacy policy (this “Privacy Policy”).&nbsp; For purposes of this Privacy Policy, each of  the terms “we,” “us,” or “our” means Bankrate, Inc., a Delaware corporation,  and the term this “Site,” means, collectively, this website and portions of  other Web pages and Web content through which you have accessed this Privacy  Policy.<br>

                  <br>
                  <u>Personally Identifiable Information</u> <br>
                  In this Privacy Policy, personally identifiable  information means information that identifies a particular individual, such as  an individual’s name, postal address, e-mail address, and phone number.&nbsp; Personally identifiable information does not  include screen names or user names that you may provide to us or through this  Site. The following are certain  situations in which we may collect personally identifiable information from  you:
</p><ul><li>When you fill out forms or fields on this Site;</li>
                  <li>When you communicate with us or request information about us, this Site  and our services, whether via email or other means;</li>

                  <li>When you participate in forums or provide user generated content or  submissions.</li></ul>

                  It is also possible that we may collect personally identifiable  information about you from sources other than you, such as forums, instant  messaging services, blogs, other users of our products and services and our  business partners.<br>
                  If  you use any functionality on this Site allowing you to send content to a  friend, then please be aware that: (a) we may display your email address to your  friend; and (b) we may use information you provide about your friend to facilitate  the communication and as otherwise set forth in this Privacy Policy.<br>
                  <br>
  <u>Non-Personally Identifiable Information</u> <br>
                  We may collect demographic information about you such as gender, zip  code, and birth date, and information regarding your preferences and  usage.&nbsp; This type of information is not,  by itself, personally identifiable information.&nbsp;  However, if we link such information with personally identifiable  information in a manner that identifies a particular individual, then we will  treat all such information as personally identifiable information for purposes  of this Privacy Policy.&nbsp; <br>
        We may collect non-personally identifiable  information about you through a variety of technical methods, including the  following:&nbsp; <p></p>
                <ul>
                  <li><em>Collection of Usage Details and  IP Address.</em>&nbsp; As you  navigate through this Site, we may collect details of your visits to this Site,  including, but not limited to, traffic data, location data, logs, the resources  that you access, and information about your computer and internet connection,  including your IP address, operating system and browser type.&nbsp; We may use this information for system  administration and to report aggregate information to our advertisers and  business partners.<strong></strong></li>
                  <li>Collection  with Cookies.&nbsp; "Cookies" are pieces of information that a  website sends to your computer while you are viewing a website. We may set and access cookies on your computer to track and store  preferential information about you.&nbsp; You  consent to our placement of cookies on your computer.&nbsp; Please note that most Internet browsers will  allow you to stop cookies from being stored on your computer and to delete  cookies stored on your computer.&nbsp; If you  choose to do so, however, your use of certain aspects of this Site may be  restricted.&nbsp; </li>
                  <li>Collection  with Web beacons.<strong>&nbsp; </strong>“Web  beacons” are electronic images, tags or scripts that allow a website to access  cookies and help track general usage patterns of visitors to a website.&nbsp; Web beacons can recognize certain types of  information, such as cookies, time and date of a page view, and a description  of the page where the Web beacon is placed.&nbsp;  We may use Web beacons to compile information regarding use of this  Site.<strong> </strong></li>
                </ul>
                <p>The information collected through these technical methods,  standing alone, cannot be used to determine your identity.&nbsp; Such information may, however, be combined in  a way that makes it become personally identifiable information.&nbsp; If this happens, we will treat the combined  information as personally identifiable information.</p>
                <p><strong><em>How We Use Your Information</em></strong><br>
                  <br>

                <strong><em>Disclosure  of Personally Identifiable Information </em></strong>
                <p><u>Typical Disclosure </u> <br>
                  <br>
                  We may disclose personally identifiable  information:<br></p><ul>
                  <li>To any person who, in our reasonable judgment, is authorized to receive  your personally identifiable information as your agent, including as a result  of your business dealings with that person (for example, your attorney);</li>
                  <li>To our third party vendors so that they may provide support for our  internal and business operations, including for the handling of data  processing, data storage, surveys, research, internal marketing, delivery of  promotional and transaction materials, and this Site’s maintenance and  security;</li>
                  <li>To third parties when you (i) engage in certain activities on this Site  that are sponsored by them, such as purchasing products or services offered by  a third party, electing to receive information or communications from a third  party, or electing to participate in contests, sweepstakes, games or other  programs sponsored in whole or in part by a third party, and/or (ii) respond to  promotional materials from us and you authorize a third party to use your  personally identifiable information to, for example, send you additional  promotional materials, provide you a product or service, or enter you into a  sweepstakes.&nbsp; When we disclose your  personally identifiable information to these third parties, your personally  identifiable information will become permanently subject to the information use  and sharing practices of the third party, and the third party will not be  restricted by this Privacy Policy with respect to its use and further sharing  of your personally identifiable information;</li>
                  <li>As required by law or ordered by a court, regulatory, or administrative  agency;</li>
                  <li>As we deem necessary, in our sole discretion, if we believe that you are  violating any applicable law, rule or regulation, or are otherwise interfering  with another’s rights or property, including, without limitation, our rights or  property;</li>
                 <li> If requested by authorities in the event of any act of terrorism or  instance of local, regional or national emergency;</li>
                  <li>To enforce our <a href="http://www.insweb.com/terms_of_use.html"> Terms of Use </a>, this  Privacy Policy, and any other applicable agreements and policies;</li>
                  <li>To enforce or protect our rights;</li>
                  <li>In connection with a Business Transfer, as defined below (see <em><a href="#business_transfers">Business Transfers</a></em> below);  and <br>
                  </li><li>To our affiliated companies (i.e., companies under common control or  management with us).</li>&nbsp; </ul>
                  <br>
  <u>Aggregation and De-Personalization</u> <br>
                  We may take your personally identifiable information and make it  non-personally identifiable, either by combining it with information about  other individuals (aggregating your information with information about other individuals),  or by removing characteristics (such as your name) that make the information  personally identifiable to you (de-personalizing your information).&nbsp; We may use and/or disclose to third parties  such aggregate or de-personalized information in any manner and without notice  or compensation to you.<br>
                  <br>
  <u>Requests  for Quotes and Services from Requested Service Providers</u><br>
                  Certain portions of this  Site may allow you to request a quote, services or information from one or more  third parties, such as insurance providers (“Requested Service  Providers”).&nbsp; If you provide your  personally identifiable information on the Site and request a quote, services  or information from Requested Service Providers (e.g., by clicking  "Submit" or “get your quotes”) (a "Request"), we may share,  loan, rent or sell your personally identifiable information to our affiliates, Requested  Service Providers that we match with your Request, your current provider, or to  other third parties that may match you with a Requested Service Provider.&nbsp; In addition, the Requested Service Providers  and such third may further disclose, share and use any personally identifiable  information provided by you in connection with your Request.&nbsp; If you make a Request, you expressly consent  to such disclosure and use of your personally identifiable information.&nbsp; <strong>If you do not want your personally  identifiable information shared as described above, then you should not submit  a Request.&nbsp; </strong> <br>
  <strong>IF  YOU SUBMIT A REQUEST, REQUESTED SERVICE PROVIDERS MAY CONTACT YOU DIRECTLY WITH  QUOTES VIA TELEPHONE, FAX, AND EMAIL.&nbsp;  YOU MAY RECEIVE TELEMARKETING CALLS AS A CONSEQUENCE OF SUBMITTING A  REQUEST ON THIS SITE, EVEN IF YOU ARE ON THE NATIONAL DO NOT CALL REGISTRY OR  ANY OTHER DO NOT CALL REGISTRY.&nbsp; </strong><br>
        If you are matched with Requested Service  Providers, you expressly consent to the Requested Service Providers conducting  any research necessary to provide you with quotes for your Request.&nbsp; Requested Service Providers may need to share  your personally identifiable information to conduct such research.&nbsp; As an example, if you request insurance  quotes, consumer reports may be ordered in connection with your insurance  application.&nbsp; Such reports may provide  information that may assist in determining eligibility for insurance and the  price you may be charged for insurance.&nbsp; Consumer reports may also be  used for updates, renewal or extensions of this insurance.&nbsp; In addition, insurance companies may use  third parties in connection with the development of a “insurance score” for  you.&nbsp; <strong>If you do not want  Requested Service Providers to conduct necessary research to provide you with a  quote for your Request, then you should not submit a Request</strong>.&nbsp; <p></p>
                <p><strong>Please  note that if you submit a Request on this Site and we share your information as  described above in connection with your Request, you will not have the  opportunity to opt out of the disclosure of your information in connection with  that Request.</strong></p>
<p><u>Sweepstakes</u> <br>
                  If  you are submitting information to us pursuant to a sweepstakes entry, we  reserve the right to share, loan, rent and/or sell the information that you  submit with and to our affiliates and other third parties.&nbsp; Please refer to the official  rules and privacy policy for each individual sweepstakes for our specific  policies regarding information sharing and disclosure pursuant to that sweepstakes  entry. <br>
          <br>
<u>Circumvention of Security Measures</u> <br>
                  In addition, although we use reasonable security measures to protect the  personally identifiable information we collect through this Site, we cannot  ensure that your personally identifiable information will only be disclosed as  described in this Privacy Policy.&nbsp; By way  of example (without limiting the foregoing), we may be forced to disclose  personally identifiable information to the government or third parties under  certain circumstances or third parties may unlawfully intercept or access  transmissions or private communications.&nbsp;  Therefore, notwithstanding anything to the contrary within this Privacy  Policy, the Terms or any other applicable agreement or policy, <u>you use this  Site at your own risk</u> and we do not promise or guarantee, and you should  not expect, that your personally identifiable information will always remain  private.&nbsp; In the unlikely event that an  unauthorized third party compromises our security measures, we will not be  responsible for any damages directly or indirectly caused by an unauthorized  third party’s ability to view, use or disseminate such information.<br>
          <br>
  <u><a style="text-decoration:none; color:#000; " name="business_transfers">Business Transfers</a></u> <br>
                  We specifically and expressly reserve the right to disclose, lease,  sell, assign or transfer your personally identifiable information collected  through this Site, and any of its databases, together with any personally  identifiable information contained in such data bases, to third parties in  connection with a Business Transfer.&nbsp; A  “Business Transfer” means a sale, acquisition, merger, consolidation,  reorganization, bankruptcy or other corporate change involving us and/or our  affiliates, even if the Business Transfer is only being contemplated and  regardless of whether the Business Transfer relates to a part or a whole of our  business.&nbsp; Nothing in this Privacy Policy  is intended to interfere with our ability to transfer all or part of our  business, equity, and/or assets (including this Site) to an affiliate or  independent third party at any time, for any purpose, without any limitation,  without notice, any without any compensation to you, whatsoever.</p>
                <strong><em>Network  Advertising</em></strong>
                  <br>
                  <br>
        From time to time, we may  participate in or use advertising networks, such as third party advertising  servers, advertising agencies, technology vendors and research firms.&nbsp; We may use these third-party advertising networks  for marketing, advertising and promotional purposes, as well as to serve  advertisements to you.&nbsp; Advertising  networks often gather data about consumers who view advertisements to make  inferences about a consumer’s interests and preferences, which enables their  computers to deliver advertisements directly targeted to the consumer’s  specific interests.&nbsp; This practice is  often referred to as “online behavioral advertising.”&nbsp; For example, a third-party advertising network  might collect the type of Internet browser you use, the type of computer  operating system you use, the domain name of a website you visit, whether or  not you visit specific pages of this Site and other websites, the location of  your Internet service provider’s presence, the date and time of a visit to a  website and other interactions between you and website.&nbsp; Please see the “Online Behavioral  Advertising” subsection of <u><a href="#choices">Choices About How We Use  and Collect Your Information</a></u> below to read about how you can prevent  certain third-party advertising networks from collecting information about you.

        <p>You are responsible for any content, including personal information,  that you contribute to be published or displayed (“posted”) on this Site, or  that you transmit to other users of this Site (collectively, “User Generated  Content”).&nbsp; Your User Generated Content  is posted on and transmitted to other users of this Site at your own risk.&nbsp; We cannot control the actions of other users  of this Site with whom you may choose to share your User Generated  Content.&nbsp; We can also not responsible for  circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures contained on this  Site.&nbsp; As a result, we cannot and do not  guarantee that your User Generated Content will not be viewed by unauthorized  persons.&nbsp; You understand and acknowledge  that, even after removal, copies of your User Generated Content may remain  viewable in cached and archived pages, or might have been copied or stored by  other Site users.&nbsp; Proper access and use  of information provided on this Site, including User Generated Content, is  governed by our <u><a href="http://www.insweb.com/terms_of_use.html"> Terms of Use </a></u>.</p>

                <p>We strive to provide you with choices regarding the personal information  you provide to us.&nbsp; Below are some  mechanisms that provide you with control over certain information:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li><em>Cookies</em>.&nbsp; If you do not wish us to collect cookies, you  may set your browser to refuse cookies, or to alert you when cookies are being  sent.&nbsp; If you do so, please note that  some parts of this Site may then be inaccessible or may not function properly.</li>
                  <li><em>Email Offers  from Us.</em>&nbsp; If you do not wish to receive email offers or  newsletters from us, you can opt-out of receiving email information from us  (other than emails related to the completion of your registration, correction  of user data, change of password and other similar communications essential to  your transactions on this Site) by using the unsubscribe process at the bottom  of the email.</li>

                  <li><em>Online  Behavioral Advertising</em>.&nbsp; Certain third-party advertising networks that  deliver behavioral advertising are members of the Network Advertising  Initiative (“NAI”).&nbsp; You can prevent NAI  member companies from collecting preference data about you by clicking <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp">here</a> and  following the NAI’s directions.&nbsp; <em>Note that if you opt out through the NAI,  you will still receive advertising.&nbsp; In  addition, if you opt out through the NAI and later delete your cookies, use a  different browser or buy a new computer, you will need to renew your opt-out  choice.</em></li>
