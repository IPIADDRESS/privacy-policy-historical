<h2>Privacy policy</h2>

<br>
Last updated May 6th, 2008.
<br><br>

We value your privacy and are committed to protecting it. We collect personal 
information solely for providing GPS tracking services to 
users. We will not disclose any information about you to third parties, 
except as required by law. Below are details on what information we 
collect, how we use it, and how we protect it.

<h3>Information that we collect</h3>

<ul>

<li><u>Email addresses.</u> We ask for your email address when you 
register. We do not send spam, and we do not sell or rent
email addresses to others. From time to time, we may contact
you with important news and announcements about our service. 

</li><li><u>Passwords.</u> Your password is irreversibly scrambled
(using MD5 hashing) before it is stored in our database.

</li><li><u>GPS location data.</u> If you install GPS tracking
software, your phone will periodically send location data to
InstaMapper, including latitude and longitude, speed, and current
date and time. The phone does not
transmit your phone number, contact lists, or any other personal
information.
As with other personal information, we treat your location data
with strict confidentiality.
<br><br>

</li><li style="margin-bottom: 5px">
<u>IP addresses and other information provided by your browser.</u>
Our web servers record the IP address, requested URL, 
referral URL, and timestamp for every request that they receive.
Web logs are used for analyzing trends, investigating abuse, and for
troubleshooting problems. We do not share our web logs with
third parties.
</li></ul>

<h3>Security</h3>
Your data is stored on secure servers located in the United States. 
We use 256-bit SSL encryption to protect sensitive information
(such as your username and password) whenever you access our
website. We also use firewall software to
minimize the possibility of unauthorized access to your data.
Unfortunately, no security measures can be 100% effective.
We will do our best to protect your data,
but we cannot guarantee nondisclosure of personal information
due to factors beyond our control (e.g. breakins to our site,
keyloggers installed on public computers, etc). If you
suspect that your account has been compromised, please contact
us as soon as possible.

<h3>Cookies</h3>

At InstaMapper, we use cookies solely for session management 
(remembering who you are once you log in) and for storing preferences. 
Cookies are small text files that are temporarily stored by your web 
browser. Most of our cookies expire as soon as you log out or close the 
browser window. We recommend that you enable cookie support in your 
browser as many features of our website will not work otherwise.

<h3>Children</h3>
InstaMapper service is intended for adults only.
We will not knowingly collect personal information from children under 
the age of 13.

<h3>Updates to this policy</h3>
We reserve the right to update this policy from time to time. If we
deem the change to be material, we will post a notice on our homepage
and/or send an email to our users. 

<h3>Feedback</h3>
If you have a question, concern, or comment about our privacy policy,
please contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@instamapper.com">privacy@instamapper.com</a>.
