</h1>
<hr>
<div class="cont">
	<p>

		“we,” “us,” “our”), we know that our users care about how your personal
		information is used and shared. We take your privacy seriously. Please
		read the following to learn more about our Privacy Policy.
	</p>
	<p>
		By visiting or using the Services in any manner, you acknowledge that
		you accept the practices and policies outlined in this Privacy Policy,
		and you hereby consent that we will collect, use, process and share your
		information as described herein.
	</p>
	<p>
		Any capitalized terms used herein without definition shall have the meaning
		given to them in the End User License Agreement: www.instube.com/terms.
	</p>
	<h3>
		I. PRIVACY PRINCIPLES
	</h3>
	<p>
		This Privacy Policy reflects the following three principles that we strive
		to uphold in providing you with the services on our Services:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			We will only collect information that helps us to improve our Services;
		</li>
		<li>
			You may provide and we only collect information that can identify you
			personally(“Personal Information”) in order to provide the Services;
		</li>
		<li>
			Our privacy practices will be transparent to you.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
	</p>
	<h3>
		II. WHAT DOES THIS PRIVACY POLICY COVER?
	</h3>
	<p>
		This Privacy Policy covers our treatment of information that we gather
		when you are accessing or using our Services. This policy does not apply
		to the practices of companies that we do not own or control (including,
		without limitation, the third party content providers from whom you may
		receive content through the Services), or to individuals that we do not
		employ or manage.
	</p>
	<p>
		Company does not knowingly collect or solicit Personal Information from
		anyone under the age of 13 or knowingly allow such persons to register.
		If you are under 13, please do not attempt to register for the Website
		or send any information about yourself to us, including your name, address,
		telephone number, or email address. No one under age 13 may provide any
		personal information to Company or on the Website. In the event that we
		learn that we have collected personal information from a child under age
		13 without verification of parental consent, we will delete that information
		as quickly as possible. If you believe that we might have any information
		from or about a child under 13, please contact us at
		<a href="mailto:support@instube.com" rel="nofollow">
			support@instube.com

	</p>
	<h3>
		III. WHAT INFORMATION DOES INSTUBE COLLECT?
	</h3>
	<p>
		The information we collect can be generally placed in two categories:
		1) data on how the user uses our Services; 2) aggregate data on content
		the user engages with. We may use this information to personalize and improve
		our services, to fulfill your requests for certain products and services,
		and to analyze how you use the Services. We may provide this information
		to our partners, so that they, too, can provide you with an optimal experience,
		but we never disclose information to a partner in a manner that would identify
		you personally. Here are a few examples of data we collect when you use
		our Services:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			Whenever you interact with our website, we automatically receive and record
			information on our server logs from your browser including your IP address,
			“cookie” information, and the page you requested. “Cookies” are identifiers
			we transfer to your computer or mobile device that allow us to recognize
			your computer or device and tell us how and when the Services are visited
			and by how many people. You may be able to change the preferences on your
			browser or device to prevent or limit your computer or device’s acceptance
			of cookies, but this may prevent you from taking advantage of some of our
			features. We may use Google Analytics to gather non-Personal Information.
			In such cases, you may have the option to disable certain features as described
			below.
		</li>
		<li>
			Google Analytics is a web analytics service provided by Google, Inc. ("Google").
			Google Analytics uses cookies to help the website analyze how individuals
			use the Website and Apps. The non-Personal Information generated by the
			cookie about your use of the site will be transmitted to and stored by
			Google on servers in the United States of America (“USA”). Google will
			use this information for the purpose of evaluating your use of the site,
			compiling reports on site activity for our purpose, evaluation and providing
			other services relating to the site activity and Internet usage. Google
			will not associate your IP address with any other data held by Google.
			You may disable cookies within your browser, however please note that if
			you do this you may not be able to use the full functionality of the site.
			By using this site, you consent to the processing of data about you by
			Google in the manner and for the purposes set out above. For certain browsers,
			you can also prevent Google from collecting information (including your
			IP address) via cookies and processing this information by downloading
			this browser plugin and installing it: http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout.
		</li>
		<li>
			Whenever you interact with InsTube, we automatically receive and record
			information on our server logs, for example:
			<ol>
				<li>
					Services usage data. For example, this may include information regarding
					the version of our software you are using, the location from where you
					downloaded our software, how often you launch our software, which features
					you use, and the number of videos you have downloaded. We use this to improve
					our promotion and help more users discover Company.
				</li>
				<li>
					Data on the quality of our Services. For example, this may include information
					regarding crashes and your connection between your phone and your computer.
					This data allows us to make our software more stable and faster.
				</li>
				<li>
					Data on user downloads. For example, this may include information regarding
					which videos you download and your average download speed. This allows
					us to choose our content partners, and alerts us if downloads become slow
					or unreliable.
				</li>
				<li>
					Aggregate statistics on content. For example, this may include the number
					of contacts you have on your phone, how many contacts you have marked as
					favorites, and the number of apps, songs, videos, or other content you
					have on your phone. This information is only collected as aggregate data,
					without reference to your or your contacts’ identities.
				</li>
				<li>
					Hardware and software identification. For example, this may include the
					type of mobile phone you are using, the version of Android operating system,
					the size of your device’s screen and internal storage. We support over
					500 different Android devices and this helps us reach decisions as to how
					to prioritize support for different kinds of hardware and software.
				</li>
			</ol>
		</li>
		<li>
			A few particular features to note:
			<ol>
				<li>
					If you're using our software and it crashes, the crash report sent to
					our server may contain some information about the operating system that
					you use.
				</li>
				<li>
					If you download content via our desktop software, we store a copy to your
					computer so that the next time you connect your phone you don't have to
					download it again.
				</li>
				<li>
					If you provide us with your name and email address, we will use this information
					for the purpose of contacting you regarding our services and products.
					You may opt out of such communications at any time by unsubscribing through
					our website or contacting us through one of the methods listed at the end
					of this policy.
				</li>
			</ol>
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		The data we collect is sent to the Company servers in the USA in aggregate
		form and added to our system for analysis. Our Services do NOT collect
		the following information:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			Your phone number
		</li>
		<li>
			Your friends' phone numbers
		</li>
		<li>
			Your cat's phone number
		</li>
		<li>
			Any of the content of your text messages, either sent or received
		</li>
		<li>
			Your music, photos, or videos
		</li>
		<li>
			The content you download via Company
		</li>
	</ul>

		make. This Privacy Policy is intended to help you understand our general
		practices. This policy is not a promise that your information will never
		be disclosed except as described above. For example, third parties may
		unlawfully intercept or access information transmitted to or contained
