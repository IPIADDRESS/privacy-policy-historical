<h1>Privacy policy</h1>
<div class="leftcolumn2">
<p>Welcome to Inspire, an online community website ("Site") and thank you for reviewing this Privacy Statement. This Site is operated by ClinicaHealth, Inc. ("ClinicaHealth") and is designed to connect persons (such as those with certain health conditions, caregivers, and professionals) who are interested in sharing and receiving information regarding various health conditions (the "Service").</p>
<p>ClinicaHealth, the operator of this Site and the administrator of the Service, understands that users of this Service may provide personal information relating to health conditions, demographics, and contact information. This Statement informs you of our practices with respect to the online collection, use, and disclosure of personal information by means of this Service. We reserve the right to change, modify, add, or remove provisions of this Privacy Statement, and any changes to this Privacy Statement will be posted here. Please refer back to this Privacy Statement regularly because your use of this Site signifies that you agree to be bound by this Privacy Statement, as might be amended from time to time.</p>
<p><strong>What Information About You Do We Collect?</strong></p>
<p>You may view some content on this Site without providing any personal information. For example, you may review blogs and discussions written by registered users of the site. However, you must register in order to post a profile, submit items for discussion, write a blog, write comments about discussion entries and blog entries, post a message, or communicate with others via this Service. At the registration page, you are asked to provide certain personal information, including a functioning e-mail address at which we may contact you, your ZIP Code, your gender, and your date of birth. Upon registering, you become a Member.</p>
<p>You are also given an option to provide additional personal information, for example, to create an extended online profile. In addition, it is possible for you to provide personal information about yourself when you post content on the Service or communicate with other registered Members.</p>
<p>We also collect "clickstream" data as you use different features of our Site so we can monitor the performance of the Site and Service and learn how different aspects of the Site and Service are used. It is possible to combine this information with the personal information that you provide to us.</p>
<p><strong>What We Do With Your Personal Information</strong></p>
<p>We use personal information that you provide to us in several ways. First, we use it to confirm your Membership, to understand better who is visiting our Site and using our Service, and to enable us to present content, including advertising, which might suit your interests.</p>
<p>Second, we may use the personal information you give us to send you information about ClinicaHealth and the Service, as well as material on behalf of some of our third parties with whom we have a business relationship. By third parties, we mean, for example, entities such as health associations and advertisers that link to our Site or that make use of our Service. The information we send you may, on occasion, contain advertising or requests either from us or from a third party on whose behalf we would send the information. For example, we may contact you to see whether you are interested in being considered for an upcoming clinical trial that is being sponsored by a pharmaceutical company.</p>
<p>Third, when you confirm your registration, your profile becomes visible to users of the Service and your profile may be found by users of the Service using the Service's search features. You can control how your profile and the data it contains are shared using the privacy settings available to you in the account section of the Site.</p>
<p>Fourth, we may share personal information with entities that are not part of the ClinicaHealth family on an aggregate or other basis that does not disclose your identity or contain individually identifiable personal information.</p>
<p>Fifth, ClinicaHealth may disclose personal information to appropriate persons in circumstances where we have a good faith belief that a user is likely to cause bodily harm to him or herself or others.</p>
<p>Sixth, ClinicaHealth may share your email address and profile information with the organizations (for example, non-profit organizations) that sponsor Inspire groups that you join.</p>
<p>Otherwise, we do not share, sell, or otherwise disclose personal information that is individually identifiable (including your e-mail address or your personal information) to any other company that we do not control without your prior consent, except as required by law (see Legal Process, below). For example, we do not rent our Member list to other companies. We may, however, provide other companies with aggregated data about our Members that does not contain contact or other individually identifiable personal information. Thus, for example, we may inform a health association of the number of Members we have on this Service, or the number of Members registered for our Service in a particular geographical region.</p>
<p>Finally, it is possible that by posting a message on the Service or communicating with other Members, you will disclose your own personal information.</p>
<p><strong>Your Choices</strong></p>
<p>You are not required to provide any personal information in order to view information that appears on this Site. However, in order to post content or see profiles of Members or communicate with Members, you must register. When you register, you must provide the personal information designated as "required" on the registration page. After you have registered, you will have the opportunity to provide additional personal information and to create an extended personal profile, including the posting of a photograph. Whether you provide this additional personal information is entirely your option, although it may affect your full enjoyment of the Service.</p>
<p>We do not disclose individually identifiable information about you to third parties without your prior consent. For example, we might contact you to advise you that a pharmaceutical company is planning a clinical trial and to see if you would be interested in learning more information. If you consent, we would arrange for the company to contact you; however, if you did not consent, we would not provide information about you to that company.</p>
<p>If you do not wish us to use or disclose personal information that you provide through this Site as disclosed in this Privacy Statement, you should deactivate your membership by notifying <a href="mailto:team@inspire.com">team@inspire.com</a> and including "DEACTIVATE" in the subject line.</p>
<p><strong>Public Forums</strong></p>
<p>This Site may make available chat rooms, blogs, and message boards. Please remember that any personal or other information that you disclose in these areas becomes public information and you should exercise caution when deciding to disclose your personal information.</p>
<p><strong>Access</strong></p>
<p>You may access and change personal information on your profile at any time by accessing your password-protected registered user information.</p>
<p><strong>Security</strong></p>
<p>ClinicaHealth employs commercially reasonable security measures consistent with standard industry practice, to safeguard personal and other information collected through this Site. We believe these commercially reasonable practices provide adequate security to protect against the loss, misuse, or alteration of the information we collect on our Site. We also have established internal policies and procedures to limit access to Members' personal information to only those employees who need the information to perform a specific job.</p>
<p><strong>Children's Personal Information</strong></p>
<p>Consistent with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act:</p>
<ul>
<li>This Service does not collect, use, or disclose personal information (including online contact information) of children under the age of 13.</li>
<li>In the event that a child under the age of 13 attempts to register on our site, we will not accept the registration and will attempt to notify a parent of the child to obtain the requisite consent.</li>
<li>In the event that a child under the age of 13 posts personal information in a public forum such as a message board, we will attempt to delete that information once we become aware of it.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cookies</strong></p>
<p>We use a standard technology called a "cookie" to collect information about how you use the site and to help us administer the site. Some cookies reside on your computer persistently and help our website to recognize your computer's browser as a previous visitor. We also use "session cookies" which expire when you close your browser and do not retain any information about you after they expire. This information allows us to customize delivery of information. For example, our site may use cookies to save and remember registration information or preferences that you may have set while browsing the site, to ensure you don't see the same ad content repeatedly, and to deliver content specific to your interests. We use cookies only to gather information as indicated in this policy.</p>
<p><strong>IP Address and Log Files</strong></p>
<p>We may use your IP address to administer the Service, to help identify problems with our server, to analyze trends, to track your webpage movements, to help identify you, and to gather broad demographic information for aggregate use.</p>
<p><strong>Banner Advertising</strong></p>
<p>We may allow another company to serve advertisements on our Site. That company may set "cookies" on your computer. We will not share any individually identifiable personal information that you provide to us with such advertising company, and it will not have access to your personal profile. However, it is possible that such advertising company may, through your use of this Site and other Websites, develop its own separate profile of you. Any information collected or stored by the ad-service or the cookies is subject to the terms and policies of that company.</p>
<p><strong>Sale or Merger</strong></p>
<p>If ClinicaHealth is sold to or merges with another company not owned by ClinicaHealth, you should expect that some or all of the personal information collected from this Site may be transferred to the buyer/surviving company. If so, ClinicaHealth will seek to obligate the acquiring company to use any personal information transferred by this Site in a manner consistent with this Privacy Statement, but cannot guarantee that it will be able to impose that requirement, or that the acquiring company will comply.</p>
<p>If you do not wish the personal information you provide to be subject to this possibility, you should deactivate your membership by notifying <a href="mailto:team@inspire.com">team@inspire.com</a> and including "DEACTIVATE" in the subject line.</p>
<p><strong>Legal Process</strong></p>
<p>You should be aware that ClinicaHealth may be required to disclose your personal information to the government or other entities in connection with a legal process, such as in response to a valid subpoena, court order in judicial or regulatory proceedings, or pursuant to a valid law enforcement investigative demand.</p>
<p><strong>Contacting the Service</strong></p>
<p>If you have any questions about this Privacy Statement, the practices of this Site, or your dealings with this Site, you can contact <a href="mailto:team@inspire.com">team@inspire.com</a>.</p>
<p><strong>The DSA token in our compact P3P privacy policy means this:</strong></p>
<p>The P3P codes and so-called P3P privacy policies we publish have no meaning and carry no obligation or liability whatsoever. They are fictitious. Our use of P3P is completely unrelated to any privacy or data policies that we may be bound to, and we reject all aspects of the P3P protocol. You must refer to our official privacy policy (this document) for our actual privacy practices. We use P3P codes only to ensure proper functioning of our Web site.</p>
<p><strong>Effective Date</strong></p>
<p>This Privacy Statement is effective as of May 4, 2012.</p>
