<p>&nbsp;</p>

In such case, You may be required to provide us with additional information in order to allow such inquiry.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Data Security</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We place great emphasis on the security and integrity of your information and the data stored in our systems.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>InstallMac is provided under the best commercially reasonable data security practices, in order to prevent unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration or deletion of any and all information stored in our systems.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You acknowledge, however, that no such effort can completely guarantee the security of the stored data, that breaches of security are still a possibility both regarding our systems and that a data security breach resulting in unauthorized access to your information can occur in third party system (for example, ISP’s and hosting services providers).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

Such Breach Notification will be given in a reasonable time after we learn of said breach, unless we deem, at our sole discretion, that such Notification might hinder and prevent ongoing efforts to detect the source of the breach.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For the avoidance of doubt, a Breach Notification does NOT constitute an admission by us that the breach occurred as a result of malpractice, failure, bad faith or negligence on our behalf or that the breach even occurred in our systems.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
