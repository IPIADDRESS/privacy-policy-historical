			<strong>What information are you collecting and how are you collecting it?</strong></p>
		<p>
			Every computer connected to the Internet is given a domain name and a set of numbers that serve as that computer’s “Internet Protocol” IP address. When a visitor requests a page from any Web site within the InboxInnerCircleSystem.com Network, our Web servers automatically recognize that visitor’s domain name and IP address. The domain name and IP address reveal nothing personal about you other than the IP address from which you have accessed our site. We use this information to examine our traffic in aggregate, and to investigate misuse of the InboxInnerCircleSystem.com Network, its users, or to cooperate with law enforcement. We do not collect and evaluate this information for specific individuals. Our Web servers do not record e-mail addresses of the visitors.</p>

			<strong>Data Security</strong></p>
		<p>
			
InboxInnerCircleSystem.com is committed to doing its best to maintain the security of information collected on our site. 
While no data transmission over the Internet is 100% secure from intrusion, we have used and will continue to use commercially reasonable efforts to put in place the appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect.&nbsp; When you place orders for purchased products or access your payment information, we use industry standard SSL (Secure Socket Layer) encryption technology to protect the storage and transfer of your data from unauthorized parties.

All sensitive information and/or systems that house that information (i.e., computers or filing cabinet) have physically restricted access in our offices. Employees are granted access on a need-to-know basis pursuant to specific job function requirements (for example, a billing clerk or a customer service representative). Furthermore, ALL employees are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy practices through periodic training sessions in an effort to keep security awareness levels high.</p>

			<strong>Information About Children</strong>
</p>
		<p>
			We are committed to protecting the privacy and rights of children online.

It currently is InboxInnerCircleSystem.com ’s policy not to collect personal information on any person under 13. To learn more about COPPA, consult the Federal Trade Commission’s COPPA Web Site <a href="http://www.ftc.gov/">www.ftc.gov</a>or you may call 202/FTC-HELP.
