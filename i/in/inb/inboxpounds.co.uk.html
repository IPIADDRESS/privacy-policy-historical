			<h3>COOKIES AND THIRD PARTY TRACKING TECHNOLOGY</h3>

				<li>
					<h4>About Cookies and Third Party Technology.</h4>  
					<p>
						A "cookie" is a small data file that may be saved to and stored on your computer when you visit a website or open an email.  Cookies 
						are widely used in order to make websites work, or work more efficiently, as well as to provide information to the owners of the site.  
						Cookies permit a website to "remember" whether your computer has visited the website before and helps the website create a more personalised 
						experience for you and records activities taken by you, such as offers completed.
					</p>  
					<p>
						For a full list of all cookies used on the Website, please follow this link to cookie information 
						<a href="http://www.inboxpounds.co.uk/pages/cookie_info" target="_blank">http://www.inboxpounds.co.uk/pages/cookie_info</a>.
					</p>
					<p>
						In addition to cookie technology, InboxPounds<sup>®</sup> and our Advertisers use additional third party technology and tracking tools to record offers 
						and activities completed by you, friends referred by you, and to communicate information about you, such as anonymised demographic 
						information (e.g., age, gender), in order to target offers and advertisements to specific groups as requested by Advertisers. Cookies 
						and other tracking technology are collectively referred to as <strong>"Cookies and Recording Tools"</strong>.
					</p>
					<p>
						Your computer permits you to change the settings on your web browser to not accept and/or disable Cookies and Recording Tools. However,
						if you do not accept Cookies and Recording Tools used by InboxPounds<sup>®</sup> and our Advertisers, you may not be able to use certain functions 
						on the Website or on certain links to external websites. More importantly, if you do not accept Cookies and Recording Tools you will 
						not receive credit for Offers or other actions completed by you because we and our Advertisers are unable to track and record your activity. 
						If you do not want to accept Cookies and Recording Tools, you must stop using this Website.

					<h4>Referral and Affiliate Tracking</h4>
					<p>
						InboxPounds<sup>®</sup> uses cookies in order to track new Member registrations. This ensures Members are properly credited for referring other 
						Members, as well as to track earnings for our Advertisers. 
					</p>
				</li>
				
				<li>
					<h4>Member Recognition</h4>
					<p>
						After a Member has logged into the InboxPounds<sup>®</sup> Member's Section, cookies are used to remember their membername and Password so they do 
						not need to be entered during every visit to our Website.  Members can logout of the Member's Section if they do not wish to have this 
						information saved.

				<li>
					<h4>Security and Servers</h4>  
					<p>
						InboxPounds<sup>®</sup> takes reasonable precautions to protect Member Data from loss, misuse and unauthorised access, disclosure, alteration and 
						destruction.  We use a number of physical security mechanisms (such as locks), electronic security mechanisms (such as authentication, 
						firewalls, passwords, encryption methods) and procedural security mechanisms (such as back up practices and rules regarding handling 
						and use of information) designed to protect the security and integrity of Member Data.  
					</p>  
					<p>
						The data we collect from you will be processed and stored on servers securely held by VISI, a Tier 3 Data Centre facility at their
