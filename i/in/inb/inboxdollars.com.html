<p><font face="Arial" size="3"><b><u>Information Collected:</u></b></font></p>
<br><font face="Arial" size="2">Some of the Information collected by InboxDollars is only used for internal use. This includes your name, address, email address, and Internet Address (IP Address). This information will be used solely by InboxDollars to contact you about updates to our program, keep your member information current, and to provide payment to you. Demographical information about you, including birth date, gender, marital status, and interests are collected to send you paid advertisements corresponding to your information. This information will never be given to paying advertisers, since InboxDollars handles all E-Mailing itself. The only time your personal information is physically given to advertisers is when you select any co-registration boxes (ads for separate sites) on our signup form. Your name, email address, street address, city, state, and zip code will be given to these advertisers, so they can contact you about the service you have opted in for.</font>
<p><font face="Arial" size="3"><b><u>Means of Collection:</u></b></font></p>
<br><font face="Arial" size="2">At this time, the only way to become a member of InboxDollars is by filling out our signup form.

<p><font face="Arial" size="3"><b><u>Use of Information:</u></b></font></p>
<br><font face="Arial" size="2">The information you provide us serves two purposes. One of these purposes is for InboxDollars to contact you regarding updates to our program and other essential contacts between the company and its members. The other purpose is to match you with paying advertisers using the demographic information you provide upon signup.</font>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3"><b><u>Posting of Personal Information:</u></b></font></p>
<br><font face="Arial" size="2">InboxDollars reserves the right to post Member Information on two portions of our site. One of these named portions will be dedicated to listing the top ten referers to our program. Information that will be posted will include First and Last Initials, Member ID, and Signup Date. The other portion of our site where Member Information will be posted is on our Cheaters Section.<p>We have a <b>ZERO</b> Tolerance against cheating! Any member deemed to be cheating our program, depending on the seriousness of the fraud involved, automatically forfeits their coverage under our Privacy Policy. We hereby claim the right to post any and all information provided by any Member that has attempted to fraud our company. We believe this will make members seriously consider their actions before attempting to cheat.</p></font><p><font face="Arial" size="2">NOTE: This action is reserved for serious offenses only. We will not post every cheating offense on this page, just the ones we deem to be malicous.</font>


</p><p><font face="Arial" size="3"><b><u>Cookies:</u></b></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3"><b><u>Subject to Change:</u></b></font></p>
<br><font face="Arial" size="2">This Privacy Policy may change from time to time, as our company grows and our plans change. We reserve the right to modify this Policy at any time without notification to our Members; however, if any major updates take place, we will post this information with a pertinent link on our site.</font>
