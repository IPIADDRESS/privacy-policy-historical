		<h2>CO-REGISTRATION</h2>
		<ol style="list-style:decimal;">
			<li>
				<h3>Definition</h3>
				<p>
					InboxDollars® signup pages may contain co-registration
						checkboxes, where Users can choose to “co-register” for other Web Sites during
						their registration with InboxDollars® by checking the checkbox next to the co-registration
						Offer. Users are not required to select any co-registration boxes to join InboxDollars®;
						however, they may be required to do so in order to qualify for Signup Bonus(es) and/or
						other promotions.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h3>Information Sharing</h3>
				<p>
					When a User co-registers for an Offer by checking
						the co-registration checkbox, any information they provide to InboxDollars® may be shared
						with the Advertiser associated with the co-registration Offer. InboxDollars® cannot control
						what Advertisers subsequently do with that information.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h3>Privacy on Other Sites</h3>

		<h2>COOKIES AND THIRD PARTY TRACKING TECHNOLOGY</h2>
		<ol style="list-style:decimal;">
			<li>
				<h3>About Cookies and Third Party Technology.</h3>  
				<p>A “cookie” is a small data file that may be saved to and stored on your computer when you visit a website or open an email.  Cookies permit a website to “remember” whether your computer has visited the website before and helps the website create a more personalized experience for you and records activities taken by you, such as offers completed.</p>  
				<p>In addition to cookie technology, InboxDollars® and our Advertisers use additional third party technology and tracking tools to record offers and activities completed by you, friends referred by you, and to communicate information about you, such as demographic information (e.g., age, gender), in order to target offers and advertisements to specific groups as requested by Advertisers.  Cookies and other tracking technology is collectively referred to as “Cookies and Recording Tools.”</p>
				<p>Your computer permits you to change the settings on your web browser to not accept and/or disable Cookies and Recording Tools.  However, if you do not accept Cookies and Recording Tools used by InboxDollars® and our Advertisers, you may not be able to use certain functions on certain websites.  More importantly, if you do not accept Cookies and Recording Tools you will not receive credit for offers or other actions completed by you because we and our Advertisers are unable to track and record your activity.  If you do not want to accept Cookies and Recording Tools, you must stop using this website.</p>  
			</li>
			<li>
				<h3>Referral and Affiliate Tracking</h3>
				<p>
					InboxDollars® uses cookies in order to track new
						User registrations. This ensures Users are properly credited for referring other Users,
						as well as to track earnings for our Affiliates.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>

					time, are integrated and incorporated by reference into this Privacy Policy and are part of the EULA.</p>
					 
					<p>You understand and agree that software will be installed on your computer that will enable the toolbar to function.  
					As part of that functioning, the toolbar will, automatically, collect, track, and transmit to InboxDollars® and 
					FreeCause information regarding your search history.</p>  
					<p>The toolbar may also collect and transmit some basic information to InboxDollars®, such as your IP address, a search 
					request, and data generated through cookies.</p>

					above, as well as to provide the intended functionalities of the toolbar, such as notifying you of opportunities with 
					various Affiliate companies.</p> 
					<p>InboxDollars®  may use non-personally identifiable information in way it deems appropriate.  We may also combine 
					non-personally identifiable information with identifiable data.  We may share and use this information for all purposes

			</li>
