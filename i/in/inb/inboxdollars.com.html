						their registration with InboxDollars® by checking the checkbox next to the co-registration
						Offer. Users are not required to select any co-registration boxes to join InboxDollars®;

		<h2>COOKIES AND THIRD PARTY TRACKING TECHNOLOGY</h2>
		<ol style="list-style:decimal;">
			<li>
				<h3>About Cookies and Third Party Technology.</h3>  
				<p>A “cookie” is a small data file that may be saved to and stored on your computer when you visit a website or open an email.  Cookies permit a website to “remember” whether your computer has visited the website before and helps the website create a more personalized experience for you and records activities taken by you, such as offers completed.</p>  
				<p>In addition to cookie technology, InboxDollars® and our Advertisers use additional third party technology and tracking tools to record offers and activities completed by you, friends referred by you, and to communicate information about you, such as demographic information (e.g., age, gender), in order to target offers and advertisements to specific groups as requested by Advertisers.  Cookies and other tracking technology is collectively referred to as “Cookies and Recording Tools.”</p>
				<p>Your computer permits you to change the settings on your web browser to not accept and/or disable Cookies and Recording Tools.  However, if you do not accept Cookies and Recording Tools used by InboxDollars® and our Advertisers, you may not be able to use certain functions on certain websites.  More importantly, if you do not accept Cookies and Recording Tools you will not receive credit for offers or other actions completed by you because we and our Advertisers are unable to track and record your activity.  If you do not want to accept Cookies and Recording Tools, you must stop using this website.</p>  
			</li>
			<li>
				<h3>Referral and Affiliate Tracking</h3>
				<p>
					InboxDollars® uses cookies in order to track new
						User registrations. This ensures Users are properly credited for referring other Users,
						as well as to track earnings for our Affiliates.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h3>User Recognition</h3>
				<p>
					After a User has logged into the InboxDollars®
						Member’s Section, cookies are used to remember their Username and Password so they
						do not need to be entered during every visit to our Web Site. Users can logout of the
						Member’s Section if they do not wish to have this information saved.
