		<p>The  privacy of our website users is important to us and we take care to safeguard  it. This policy explains how we use such personal information as we may hold  about you.</p>
		<p><strong>Important information</strong></p>
		<img src="../../cleardot.gif" width="15" height="155" border="0" alt="" align="left"><p><strong>Queries </strong><br>
		  If  you have privacy questions which are not answered by this Website Privacy  Policy or any other concerns about how we use your personal information, please  write to us or contact Customer Services on 0845 603 8888.</p>
		<p><strong>Changes</strong><br>
  Our  Website Privacy Policy is regularly reviewed to make sure that we continue to  serve your privacy interests.&nbsp; We reserve  the right to modify or otherwise update this privacy policy and these changes  will be posted on our website.&nbsp; We  encourage you to visit this page from time to time to ensure that you are aware  of any changes we may have made.</p>
		<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong>Where we obtain your information from</strong></p>
		<img src="../../cleardot.gif" width="15" height="530" border="0" alt="" align="left"><p><strong>Information  volunteered by you</strong><br>
		  The  information we collect via this website may include any personal details you  type in and submit (such as your name, address, email address, etc.) and the  contents of any correspondence you send to us.&nbsp; </p>
		<p>If  you apply for any of our products or services, we may also obtain information  about you from third parties which you agree we may contact, such as credit  reference agencies.</p>
		<p><strong>IP  addresses</strong><br>
  The  information we collect via this website may also include your IP address (this  is your computer’s individual identification number that is assigned to your  computer when connected to the Internet) which is automatically logged by our  web-server here in the UK.&nbsp; Unless we suspect fraud, we do not use your  IP address to identify you personally.</p>
		<p><strong>Cookies  &amp; spotlight tags</strong><br>
  This  website also collects data which allows us to recognise you, your preferences  and how you use this website.&nbsp; </p>
		<ul>
		  <li>This information is collected by using  temporary ‘session cookies’.&nbsp; These are small strings of data stored in your  device’s temporary memory when you navigate around the website but which are  erased when you close your Web browser.&nbsp;</li>
		  </ul>
		<ul>
		  <li>This information is also collected by  using spotlight tags (also known as ‘boom  tags’, ‘clear GIFs’, ‘pixel tags’, ‘web beacons’ and ‘web bugs’).&nbsp; These are small strings of code that are  placed in the pages of our website which allow our advertising agents to store  ‘persistent cookies’ in your Web  browser’s cookie file when you access our website.&nbsp; Unlike session cookies, these persistent  cookies are not erased when you close your Web browser.</li>
		  </ul>
		<p>Our session cookies and our advertising  agents’ persistent cookies do not store your email address or other such personal  information.</p>
		<p><strong>How we use your information and who  we share it with</strong></p>
		<img src="../../cleardot.gif" width="15" height="1460" border="0" alt="" align="left"><p><strong>Processing applications and providing  services to you</strong><br>
		  Information  you provide to us when applying for and when using our products and services  will be used and shared by us in the manner and for the purposes described at  the time of your application.&nbsp; </p>
		<ul>
		  <li>For example, we may share some of the  information we hold about you with credit reference agencies, fraud prevention  agencies and the people who print our account statements.&nbsp; Information we share with credit reference  agencies and fraud prevention agencies may also be used by third parties for  various other purposes.</li>
		  </ul>
		<ul>
		  <li>Further details of how your personal  information is used are available on request or can be found on the product  information pages of this website.</li>
		  </ul>
		<p>We  also use the ‘session’ cookies employed in this website to enable you to move  back and forth within a secure banking session and to save you re-entering  information.</p>
		<p><strong>Keeping  you informed</strong><br>
  You  do not have to give us any personal information in order to use many of the  pages of this website.&nbsp; However, any  information which you choose to give us via this website may be added to our  marketing database and may be used by us for marketing our services and our  events.&nbsp; </p>
		<p>It  is possible that our marketing materials may contain input from other companies  or organisations with whom we are dealing, but we DO NOT sell or give your  details to any other companies who may try to sell you their products or  services. </p>
		<p><strong>Targeting  our advertising</strong><br>
  Our advertising agents’ persistent  cookies used in combination with the spotlight tags employed in this website  may be used to target our Internet advertisements which appear on other  websites. &nbsp;This allows us to improve the  effectiveness of our advertising.</p>
		<p><strong>Statistical  analysis</strong><br>
  The  IP addresses logged by our web-server and our advertising agents’ persistent  cookies used in combination with the spotlight tags employed in this website may  be used by us:-</p>
		<ul>
		  <li>to perform technical diagnosis of our  website’s performance on a statistical basis;</li>
		  </ul>
		<ul>
		  <li>to analyse traffic data (so as to  gauge interest in our website and to improve our understanding of our website’s  visitors’ behaviour and their response to our promotional campaigns); and</li>
		  </ul>
		<ul>
		  <li>to identify transactions that appear  abnormal (in order to identify the source of fraudulent actions.)</li>
		  </ul>
		<p><strong>Law  enforcement &amp; crime prevention</strong><br>
  We  reserve the right to cooperate with law enforcement officials in the  investigation of alleged unlawful activities of our website users or relating  to our website users.&nbsp; We will have no  legal liability for such disclosures.&nbsp; </p>
		<p>If  you provide false or inaccurate information and fraud is identified, details may  be passed to fraud prevention agencies to prevent fraud and money laundering.</p>
		<p><strong>Transfer outside the European  Economic Area</strong><br>
  To  provide you with the services you ask for, ING  Direct and our services providers may share your information with organisations  outside the European Economic Area (which currently includes the European  Union, Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway).&nbsp; We will not do this unless we are satisfied  that your information will be processed as securely as if ING Direct were processing it.</p>
		<p><strong>Other sharing of information</strong><br>
		  We may share personal information  about you with:-</p>
		<ul>
		  <li>our agents, service providers and  data processors who provide a service to us and you; and</li>
		  </ul>
		<ul>
		  <li>any person or business (and their  advisers) who might take over our rights or responsibilities under our  agreement with you to allow them to prepare for taking these over (after that,  we may also allow that person or business to use and share your information on  the same basis as us.)</li>
		  </ul>
		<p>We  will not pass your information to anyone outside ING  Direct N.V. other than for the purposes described above, unless:</p>
		<ul>
		  <li>we have your permission;</li>
		  </ul>
		<ul>
		  <li>we have to do so or are allowed to do  so by law;</li>
		  </ul>
		<ul>
		  <li>we have a duty to the public to  reveal the information; or</li>
		  </ul>
		<ul>
		  <li>our interests mean we must give the  information - for example, to prevent fraud (we will not use this as a reason  for giving information about you to anyone else for marketing purposes).</li>
		  </ul>
		<p><strong>Other  websites</strong><br>
  This  privacy policy is only intended to cover personal data collected via this  website.&nbsp; While we carefully select the  websites to which we link, we are not responsible for the privacy practices or  the content of these websites.</p>
