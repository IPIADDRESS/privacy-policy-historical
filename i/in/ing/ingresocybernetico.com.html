								</p><p><strong>Our  Commitment to Privacy</strong><br>
  Our  Privacy Policy has been developed as an extension of our commitment to combine  quality products and services with integrity in dealing with users. The Policy  is designed to assist you in the understanding of how we collect, use and protect  the personal information provided to us.&nbsp; </p>
<p><br>
  <strong>What  Information Do We Collect?</strong><br>
  When you  visit our site, we collect two types of information: personal information you  actively choose to disclose (“Active Information”) and Use information  collected, in a way not visible to you, on an aggregate anonymous basis as you  and other users browse our site (“Passive Information”).</p>
<p><br>
  <strong>1.Personally  Identifiable Information</strong><br>
  This  refers to information that lets us know specifically about you i.e. profile  information.</p>
<p><br>
  <strong>A.  Registration</strong><br>
  When  you register to become an authorized reseller of our products or services, we  will collect Personally Identifiable Information (such as name, address, email  address, and telephone number). This Personally Identifiable Information is  securely stored and may be accessed on our website. You are assigned an  identification number and select your own password – both are needed to enter  the Site and to access your Contact Information.&nbsp; Please safeguard your password in a secure  location as we are not responsible for breaches into the system when access is  willingly provided. </p>
<p><br>
  <strong>B.  Ordering</strong><br>
  When you  place an order for products or services, we collect Personally Identifiable  Information (such as name, contact and billing information, credit card, and  other transactional information). We use this information to deliver your  order, process payment, and to communicate the status of your order.</p>
<p><br>
  <strong>C.  Credit Card Storage</strong><br>
  Credit  card information collected at registration or for product orders is used only  to process payment for the transaction and, generally, is not retained on our  Site. However, you may voluntarily elect to securely store up to three personal  credit cards to be used for product orders. <br>
  Your  credit card information may be retained by our payment processors</p>
<p><br>
  <strong>D.  Surveys and Promotions</strong><br>
  Occasionally,  you may voluntarily provide Personally Identifiable Information to complete  surveys and questionnaires or to participate in user polls. We use this  information to improve our products and services and to ensure that we’re  providing accurate disclosures. We may also use your Personally Identifiable  Information to provide you newsletters and other marketing information that  coincide with your preferences. You may customize your marketing preferences,  or let us know if you do not wish to receive any promotional materials, by  adjusting your Subscriptions &amp; Email options on the Site.</p>
<p><br>
  <strong>2.  Aggregate Information</strong><br>
  This  refers to information that does not, by itself, identify you as a specific  individual. Such information would include the Uniform Resource Locator (“URL”)  of the website that referred you to our Site, your Internet Protocol (“IP”)  address (a number automatically assigned to your computer whenever you surf the  web), your operating system and browser type, and any search terms that you  enter on our Site. Our web server aggregates this information in order to  monitor the level of activity on our Site, evaluate its effectiveness, and  improve the content or our Site in order to make your visit an easy and  enjoyable experience.<br>
  We may  collect, compile, store, publish, promote, report, or otherwise disclose or use  any Aggregate Information, provided that such information does not personally  identify you. We do not correlate any Personally Identifiable Information with  the Aggregate Information that we collect on our Site. If we do correlate any  Aggregate Information to you, it will be protected like any other Personally  Identifiable Information under this Privacy Statement.</p>
<p><br>
  <strong>Active  Information You Choose to Provide</strong><br>
  In order  to gain use of the site (become a “user”), we require you to disclose the  following information: Name, Address and Phone Number<strong></strong><br>
  We use  secure socket layer (SSL) encryption to protect the transmission of the  information you submit to us when you use our secure online forms. The  information you provide to us is stored securely.</p>
<p><br>
  <strong>Passive  Information Collected </strong><br>
  <strong>What  is a Cookie?</strong><br>
  Cookies  are a feature of web browser software that allows web servers to recognize the  computer used to access a site. They are small pieces of data stored by a  user’s browser to simplify subsequent interactions with the site. This makes it  easier for a user to move from site to site and to complete transactions over  the Internet. Cookies should make your online experience easier and more  personalized.<br>
  Our site  utilizes cookies to collect information about how our site is used. Passive  Information gathered may include the date and time of visits, the site pages  viewed, time spent at our site, the sites visited just before and just after visiting  our site. If you do not wish to transmit “cookie” information about yourself,  you may turn off the cookie function in your web browser.&nbsp; <br>
  You  unconditionally accept that by turning off the cookie function in your browser  that you may adversely affect the functionality of the site and your ability to  market, enroll members and accurately earn commissions.<br>
  Our site’s  servers also automatically identify you computer by its Internet Protocol  address, which is a unique string of numbers that are assigned to your computer  by your Internet Service Provider. The IP address may be used to address  problems with our server or to gather broad demographic information about our  users. We passively collect your IP Address.</p>
<p><br>
  <strong>How  Do We Use the Information Collected?</strong><br>
  Broadly  speaking, persons we employ directly, or as contractors or agents at our  direction, use Active Information for purposes of administering our business  activities, providing customer support and making available other products or  services we think might be of interest to our users. We may use the Active  Information or Passive Information you provide to contact you about various changes  to our site, new services, features or products we offer. If at any time you do  not wish to receive such information, you may “opt-out” of doing so by adjusting  your email settings in the back office of the website. <br>
  We use  Passive Information to gather information about our users and to enhance our  site to make it easier, faster and friendlier for users. Additionally, cookies  help us better understand the usage pattern of the people that visit our site,  which helps us improve our services. Passive Information may result in your  viewing of particular advertising based on your user habits.</p>
<p><br>
  <strong>Your  Information In Relation to Others We Link To</strong> <br>
  You might be  able to access other websites through our site via hyperlinks. When you do so,  you are subjecting yourself to their privacy policies and data collection.&nbsp; Please read theprivacy policies of those  sites to ensure you agree with the terms before using such sites. </p>
<p><br>
  <strong>Sharing  Information with Advertisers or Other Third Parties</strong> <br>
  We may  disclose anonymous information about user habits to advertisers on our site.  The parties who perform services for us (credit card processors, merchant bank,  Internet Service Provider) may also have access to your information in  performing such services. Should we buy or sell assets of our company, another  company may need to review our company’s assets, which might include your  information, to make business decisions as to whether to acquire such assets.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Sharing  Information with the Government or As Otherwise Required by Law</strong><br>
  We may be  required by subpoena, law or government agency to disclose both Active and  Passive Information you have provided to us.</p>
<p><br>
  <strong>How  Do We Secure Active Information and Passive Information?</strong><br>
  We secure  your personal information submitted by you by using reasonable efforts to  prevent unauthorized access or disclosure, or accidental loss of Active and  Passive Information. Individual postings on this site and other communications  to our office via email or standard mail may not be secure unless we advise you  that security measures are in place prior to your submission of information.  Therefore, if you choose to communicate with us through these means, you are  assuming the risk of doing so and we respectfully request that you do not send  or post sensitive information through these means.</p>
<p><br>
  <strong>Accessing  and Correcting Your Information</strong><br>
  We take  reasonable measures to ensure that any Personally Identifiable Information we  collect on our Site is accurate, current, complete, and reliable for its  intended use. If you wish to update or otherwise correct Personally  Identifiable Information provided to us, you may edit your information online.</p>
<p><br>
  <strong>Protecting  Your Information</strong> <br>
  We  acknowledge your trust and are committed to take reasonable steps to protect  Personally Identifiable Information provided from loss, misuse, and  unauthorized access. We employ physical, electronic, and managerial processes  to safeguard and secure your information.<br>
  It is you  responsibility to safeguard the password you use to access our Site and to  promptly advise us if you ever suspect that your password has been compromised.  We strongly encourage you to change your password regularly to prevent  unauthorized access. Because your identification number and password are  specific to you, you acknowledge sole responsibility for any and all use of our  Site conducted with your identification number and password.</p>
<p><br>
  <strong>Links  to Other Websites</strong><br>
  Links to  third-party websites may be provided solely for your information and convenience  or to provide additional shopping for various other goods and services through  our Merchant and Services Partners. If you use these links, you will leave our  Site. This Privacy Statement does not cover the information practices of those  websites nor do we control their content or privacy policies. We suggest that  you carefully review the privacy policies of each site you visit.</p>
<p><br>
  <strong>Children’s  Privacy Protection</strong><br>
  We take  special care to protect the privacy needs of children and encourage parents to  be an active participant in their child’s online activities. Our Site does not  target and is not intended for children under the age of 18, and we will not  knowingly collect Personally Identifiable Information from them. If we discover  personal data from a child through our site, we will eliminate that data.</p>
<p><br>
  <strong>Changes  to This Statement</strong><br>
  Any  updates or changes to the terms of this Privacy Statement will be posted on our  Site and the date of the newest version posted below. Please check back  frequently, especially before you submit any Personally Identifiable  Information at our Site, to see if this Privacy Statement has changed. By using  our Site, you acknowledge acceptance of this Privacy Statement in effect at the  time of use.<br>
  YOUR  USE OF OUR SITE MEANS THAT YOU ACCEPT THE PRACTICES SET FORTH IN THIS POLICY.  YOUR CONTINUED USE INDICATES YOUR AGREEMENT TO THE CHANGES.</p>
