<h2>6. Safeguarding your personally identifiable information</h2>
<p>6.1 We will only collect personally identifiable information to the extent we believe it reasonably necessary to serve our legitimate business purposes, and will protect it using the same level of safeguards we use to ensure the security, integrity and privacy of our own equivalent proprietary information. In addition, we will take reasonable steps to ensure that third parties to whom we transfer any personally identifiable information in accordance with this policy will agree to provide sufficient protection.

The Website makes available to you the ability to change your password at any time. It is your responsibility to protect your password and use a long and secure password. As we have no size or character limit on your password, we suggest using a long (12 or more characters) and randomly generated password. We highly encourage the use of a password manager, such as LastPass or 1Password, to generate and manage a highly secure and randomly generated password for use with the Website.</p>
