          <p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 7pt; FONT-FAMILY: Verdana">Registration:<br>
            In order to become an InXpo attendee, you must first create an account 
            on this web site. To create an account you are required to provide 
            the following contact information: name, email address, country, ZIP/postal 
            code), a brief summary of your professional background (current occupation 
            &amp; networking objectives), and choose a password.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
          <p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 7pt; FONT-FAMILY: Verdana">Profile Information:<br>
            Once an attendee, you may provide additional information in the Profile 
            section describing your skills, professional experiences, and networking 
            objectives. Providing additional information beyond what is required 
            at registration is entirely optional, but enables you to better identify 
            yourself and find new opportunities in the InXpo system. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
          <p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 7pt; FONT-FAMILY: Verdana">Cookies &amp;

          <p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 7pt; FONT-FAMILY: Verdana">Like most web 
            sites, InXpo uses cookies and web log files to track site usage. A 
            cookie is a tiny data file which resides on your computer which allows 
            InXpo to recognize you as a user when you return to our site using 
            the same computer and web browser. Unfortunately, if your browser 
            settings do not allow cookies, you will not be able to use our website. 
            Like the information you enter at registration or in your Profile, 
            cookie and log file data is used to customize your experience on the 
            web site.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
          <p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 7pt; FONT-FAMILY: Verdana">One type of cookie, 
            known as a “persistent” cookie, is set once you’ve 
            logged in to your InXpo account. The next time you visit the InXpo 
            web site, the persistent cookie will allow us to recognize you as 
            an existing user so you will not need to log in before using the service. 
            Additionally, if you log out of the InXpo site you will need to re-enter 
            your password the next time you visit in order to log in to your account. 
            Another type of cookie, called a “session” cookie, is 
            used to identify a particular visit to the InXpo site. Session cookies 
            expire after a short time or when you close your web browser.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
          <p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 7pt; FONT-FAMILY: Verdana">Due to the communications 
            standards on the Internet, when you visit the InXpo web site we automatically 
            receive the URL of the site from which you came and the site to which 
            you are going when you leave InXpo. We also receive the Internet protocol 
            (IP) address of your computer (or the proxy server you use to access 
            the World Wide Web), your computer operating system and type of web 
            browser you are using, as well as the name of your ISP. This information 
            is used to analyze overall trends to help us improve the InXpo service, 
            but is not linked to personally identifiable information in any way.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
          <p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 7pt; FONT-FAMILY: Verdana">Children:<br>
            Children are not eligible to use our service and we ask that minors 
            (under the age of 18) do not submit any personal information to us 
            or use the service.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
          <p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 7pt; FONT-FAMILY: Verdana">Information Use<br>
            InXpo is an online service dedicated to helping all types of professionals 
            more effectively connect with one another. The information you choose 
            to provide on this site is used to help you describe yourself to other 
            users. In addition, InXpo collects certain types of information in 
            order to operate and improve our service to you and other users. InXpo, 
            LLC is the sole owner of the information collected on this site.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
          <p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 7pt; FONT-FAMILY: Verdana">Communications:<br>
            InXpo will communicate with you through email and notices posted on 
            this website. These include a series of welcome e-mails which help 
            inform new users about various features of the service. Please be 
            aware that you will always receive certain emails from InXpo related 
            to the proper functioning of your account, such as email notices when 
            another user sends you an opportunity. InXpo may send you promotional 
            information unless you have opted out of receiving such information. 
            If you wish to opt-out of receiving promotional emails, please send 
            a request to info@InXpo.com.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
          <p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 7pt; FONT-FAMILY: Verdana">Customized Content:<br>
            Information you provide at registration or in your Profile section 
            is also used to customize your experience on the web site. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
          <p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 7pt; FONT-FAMILY: Verdana">Information Sharing<o:p></o:p></span></p>
          <p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 7pt; FONT-FAMILY: Verdana">Sharing Information 
            With Third Parties:<br>
            InXpo takes the privacy of our users very seriously. We will never 
            sell, rent, or otherwise provide your personally identifiable information 
            to any third parties for marketing purposes. Exhibitors, sponsors, 
            and the person or company that invited you are not considered third 
            parties. We will only share your information with third parties to 
            carry out your instructions and to provide specific services. For 
            instance, we use a credit card processing company to bill users for 
            subscription fees. These third parties do not retain, share, or store 
            any personally identifiable information except to provide these services 
            and are bound by strict confidentiality agreements which limit their 
            use of such information.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
          <p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 7pt; FONT-FAMILY: Verdana">Partnering with 
            Other Organizations to Offer Combined Services:<br>
            InXpo partners with other online services to give you the combined 
            results of both services. Whenever we offer such combined services, 
            it will be clear who the partner is and it will be your choice to 
            make use of the combined services or not. In these cases, none of 
            your personally identifiable information will be passed from InXpo 
            to the partner. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
          <p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 7pt; FONT-FAMILY: Verdana">Communications 
            Between Users:<br>
            Many emails and contacts you initiate through InXpo, an invitation 
            sent to a non-user for instance, will list your email address and 
            name in the header of the message. Your contact information will only 
            be shared with another user if both of you have indicated that you 
            would like to establish contact with each other.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
          <p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 7pt; FONT-FAMILY: Verdana">Legal Disclaimer:<br>
            It is possible that we may need to disclose personal information when 
            required by law. We will disclose such information wherein we have 
            a good-faith belief that it is necessary to comply with a court order, 
            ongoing judicial proceeding, or other legal process served on our 
            company or to exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
