We use this information to improve the user experience. This may include, but is not limited to: your activities and clicks on our website, maps accessed, comments, tags, notifications, and shares. This information may also include your interactions with other users on our site. &nbsp; We may also collect information by using cookies, web beacons, and related technologies in order to analyze and understand how the website is used and to improve your visits to the website. For example, we may use cookies and related technologies to: (i) customize account pages for you, (ii) track user visits and account features, (iii) determine what features and pages are most frequently requested or visited, and (iv) save your password so you do not have to provide it each time you visit the website. &nbsp; "Cookies" are small text files that a website sends to a user's hard drive through the browser for data storage.

We recommend that you leave cookies "turned on" so that we can offer you a better overall experience on this website. &nbsp; We use third-party companies to provide Internet data hosting and to help us measure and determine how visitors use our website and to evaluate the effectiveness of our website and promotions so that we can improve and optimize our website and the products and services we offer.
