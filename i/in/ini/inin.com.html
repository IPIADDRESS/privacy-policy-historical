<p align="justify">Dear Internet website visitor (“you”):</p>
<p align="justify">Thank you for your interest in Interactive Intelligence, Inc. (“Interactive
  Intelligence”). This Privacy Policy describes Interactive Intelligence’s
  privacy policy with regard to our Internet website located at <a href="/">http://www.inin.com</a>  or any successor Internet website thereto (the “Site”). By visiting
  the Site, you are accepting the practices described in this Privacy Policy.
  THIS
  PRIVACY
  POLICY MAY CHANGE FROM TIME TO TIME, SO PLEASE CHECK BACK PERIODICALLY.</p>
<p align="justify">Interactive Intelligence treats your visit to our Site as we would treat any
  other interaction with our valued customers and prospective customers: as a
  private matter between you and Interactive Intelligence. We want you to know
  up front how we deal with any personally identifiable information you see fit
  to provide to us during our interactions with you. Therefore, this Privacy
  Policy will answer the following questions. </p>
<div align="justify">
  <ol>
    <li>
      <a href="#1">What personally identifiable information is collected from
            you and how will it be used?</a></li>

<hr align="JUSTIFY">
<p align="justify">  <strong><a name="1"></a>What personally identifiable information is collected from you and how will
    it be used?</strong><br>
  <br>
  In general, you can visit our Site without telling us who you are or revealing
  any personally identifiable information about yourself. In fact, we encourage
  anonymous surfing so that you can find out more about who we are and how our
  products can help streamline business communications and other processes. However,
  there are times when we may need and request personally identifiable information
from you so that we can better serve you.</p>
<p align="justify">Interactive Intelligence will only collect personally identifiable information
  (such as your name, address, telephone number, or e-mail address, employer
  name, employer address or products and operating systems you use) when it is
  voluntarily submitted to us at the Site. We will use this information to comply
  with your request for information or as otherwise disclosed to you at the location
  on the Site at which you submit your information. For example, if you request
  technical support assistance, we need to know who you are, what product you
  are using and in what computer system environment you are using the product
  in order to respond to your request as efficiently and effectively as possible.
  If you are interested in signing up for one of our Webinars, the personally
  identifiable information you provide to us will enable us to tailor the Webinar
  more closely to your specific needs. Also, when you request a product download
  from the Site, we want to be able to follow up with you to address any questions
  you might have about using our products. In addition, from time to time, we
  may refer to your personally identifiable information to better understand
  your needs and how we can improve our products and services. We may use that
  information to contact you. <br>
    <br>
    We will not sell or otherwise transfer the personally identifiable information
    you provide via the Site to any third party unless (1) otherwise disclosed
    to you when you submit your information; (2) in connection with the sale
    of all or substantially all of the assets of a business division of Interactive
    Intelligence, a line of Interactive Intelligence’s business or Interactive
    Intelligence’s entire business or merger with another company; (3)
    to provide needed information to our resellers, partners and contractors
    who may provide products and/or services to you; (4) as necessary for processing
    your credit card transactions or on-line support transactions; or (5) for
    compliance with possible legal or governmental disclosure requirements..
    We do not rent, sell or otherwise share information that we gather about
    our website visitors with outside parties. The bottom line is that all the
    information that you provide to us via the Site will remain with Interactive
    Intelligence and/or its resellers, contractors and alliance partners.</p>
<p align="justify">We provide links to third party Internet sites strictly as a service to you,
  and linking with third party Internet sites does not take you off of the Site.
  Again, your personally identifiable information is not shared with these third
  parties. However, Interactive Intelligence is not responsible for the privacy
  practices of third party Internet sites. If you leave the Site you should be
  sure to read the privacy policy of each Internet site that you visit.</p>
<p align="justify">The Site uses information in aggregate form to track the total number of visitors
  to our Site, the number of visitors to each page of our Site, and the domain
  names of our visitors' Internet service providers. No personally identifiable
  information is revealed to us in this process. </p>
<p align="justify"><strong><a name="2"></a>What information may be gathered from children?</strong></p>
<p align="justify">The Site is not intended or designed to attract children under the age of
  13. Interactive Intelligence does not collect personally identifiable data
  from any person it knows to be under the age of 13.</p>
<p align="justify"><strong><a name="3"></a>What cookies are and how they are used?</strong></p>
<p align="justify">Some pages within the Site may use a technology called "cookies".
  A cookie is a token that a server gives to your browser when you access an
  Internet website. Cookies are capable of storing many types of data. Cookies
  help provide additional functionality to the site or to help us analyze site
  usage more accurately. In all cases in which cookies are used, the cookie will
  not collect personally identifiable information except with your explicit permission.</p>
<p align="justify"><strong><a name="4"></a>Who should you contact if you have any questions concerning this Privacy Policy?</strong></p>
<p align="justify">If you would like further information, or to provide feedback about what you
  like about our Site, this Privacy Policy or how our site could be more useful
  to you, please contact us at: <a href="mailto:webmaster@inin.com">webmaster@inin.com</a>,
