<p><strong>What information does Indi collect from you?</strong>  In order to better provide you with the services offered on the Indi site, Indi collects two types of information about its visitors:  Personally Identifiable Information and Non-Personally Identifiable Information. Our primary goal in collecting information from you is to provide you with a smooth, efficient, and customized experience while using our site.   <strong>Personally Identifiable Information</strong>  This refers to information that lets us know the specifics of who you are. Personal information is requested in many ways, for example, when you register and set up an account, post on the Indi site, register for a product or service, enter challenges or sweepstakes, apply for a credit card, fill out surveys, and send us feedback. For example, this information might include your name, billing address, shipping address, Face Book ID, telephone number, e-mail address, credit card or other payment information, and product details. With this information, Indi can better provide you with personalized services. For some third party services, we may collect your personal information on behalf of these service providers and share it with them.  <strong>Non-Personally Identifiable Information</strong>  This refers to information that does not by itself identify a specific individual. We gather certain information about you based upon where you visit on, and how you use, our site in several ways. This information is compiled and analyzed on both a personal and an aggregated basis. For example, this information may include gender, geographic location, genres, categories and channels you interact with, the Web site's Uniform Resource Locator ("URL") that you just came from, which URL you next go to, what browser you are using, cookies, device information, your Internet Protocol ("IP") address and NPII third party information passed to us from your third party registration on Indi (e.g., from Face Book login). A URL is the global address of documents and other resources on the World Wide Web. An IP address is an identifier for a computer or device on a Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol ("TCP/IP") network, such as the World Wide Web. Networks like the Web use the TCP/IP protocol to route information based on the IP address of the destination. In other words, an IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you are surfing the web, allowing web servers to locate and identify your computer. Computers require IP addresses in order for users to communicate on the Internet, browse and shop. On an aggregated basis, we collect anonymous data related to the pages, posts, communications, products, downloads and other content that is sampled, clicked on, streamed, searched for, transferred from and downloaded. When content on Indi is shared into social media, that content may be tagged and tracked in social media for primary purposes of Buzz determination, and the social media site may pass back certain information such as likes, shares, comments and other interactions that such content receives within the social media network.  Except as otherwise limited in this Policy, we may disclose, share, sell, trade, or rent Non-Personally Identifiable Information to others without your consent.  
</p>

Indi stores the email addresses that you provide so that the respondents may be added to the friend's list of the member sending the invitations, and also to send reminders of the initial invitation you send. Indi does not sell or rent these email addresses or use them to send any other communication besides invitations, and invitation reminders. <strong>Channel Owners on Indi</strong> All Non-Personally Identifiable Information associated with your visits and use on their channels is shared with channel owners on Indi, and Personally Identifiable Information may be transferred to a channel owner based on your agreement to share such information when uploading to a forum or challenge on the channel owners channel.

If customers do not pay us for products/services ordered, we may submit their account information to a third party collection agency. We may also share your Personally Identifiable Information with third parties who provide services to us, to our customers and to our web site visitors. Those third parties include authorized contractors, temporary employees and consultants and other companies working with us such as Buy Services (collectively, "agents"). Where we believe it to be appropriate (in our sole discretion), we will ask our agents not to disclose or use your personal information for purposes other than to provide services to you or Indi. <strong>Data Analysis Agents</strong> The information collected by or for Indi may be provided to an outside company for the purpose of analysis. That analysis is to help us to improve our site and product selection, and to notify you of special offers that may be of interest to you. That data analysis agent may not share any Personally Identifiable Information with others, or use it for any other purpose than to help Indi. <strong>Ad &amp; Content Servers, Advertisers, Image Servers and Website Analysis Agents</strong> These third parties use their cookies' identification numbers and internal web site tracking features to serve ads on our site and to collect aggregated information to create statistics about our customers and visitors, traffic patterns, and related site information.

You may modify any of your personal information in your account online at any time, provided that any such modifications are fully accurate. We encourage you to promptly update your information if it changes. You may ask to have the information on your account deleted or removed; however, because we keep track of past use of the site, transactions, postings, submissions, challenges, conversions and redemptions, you cannot delete information associated with such actions. Also, as a security measure we "back up" the data stored on our systems, and such prior information cannot be completely removed from our databases.

<p><strong>Indi and third-party use of "cookies" and "action tags."</strong> Indi Cookies: When you use our site we will store cookies on your computer in order to facilitate and customize your use of our site. A cookie is a small data text file, which a Web site stores on your computer's hard drive (if your Web browser permits) that can later be retrieved to identify you to Indi. Our cookies store randomly assigned user identification numbers, the country where you are located, and your name and profile image location to welcome you back to our site. The cookies make your use of the site easier, make the site run more smoothly and help us to maintain a secure site. Ad Server and Content Server Cookies: We may use an outside ad serving company or content server to display banner advertisements and other information on our site or to serve promotional emails. As part of their service, they place a separate cookie on your computer. Except for the company that serves our promotional emails, Indi does not provide third-party ad servers with any of your Personally Identifiable Information. Indi and its third party ad servers do collect and use Non-Personally Identifiable Information about you, such as your IP address, browser type, the URLs from which you came, referring site's domain types (e.g., .com), operating system, the country, the server your computer is logged onto, where the servers that your computer is logged onto is located, the pages of our site and products that visitors viewed during their visit, where an ad was placed on a specific web site page, the time and date particular ads were served, the area code and zip code associated with your server and whether you responded to a particular ad, and a receipt identifier. If you would like to know more about the information gathering practices of the company that sends our emails, please click <a href="http://sendgrid.com/privacy.html">here</a>. Our third-party ad servers will occasionally use outside agents, whose computers will serve ads on our site in the same manner and under the same conditions as above. In addition, other ad serving companies or advertisers may place banner ads on our site in the same manner as above, but we do not disclose to them any Personally Identifiable Information. Image Server Cookies: As part of the ad-serving process, a third party may serve graphics upon our site. In order to customize their service, they may also place a cookie upon your computer. While Indi does not control their use of that cookie, no Personally Identifiable or individual customers' product information is collected. Website Analysis Agent Cookies: We may use a third party to analyze what our visitors find to be most interesting on our site. To do that, they will place a cookie on your computer with a randomly assigned unique number in order to track the pages you view on our site, along with other Non-Personally Identifiable Information.  Action Tags, Web Beacons and other Data Collection Methods: An action tag or a web-beacon (also known as a clear gif or a pixel tag) is a method used to track responses or actions by customers who view certain advertisements or other information on our site. Action tags are 1x1 pixel images embedded in a website page that are used to transparently collect information. Our ad server, content servers and website analysis agents may use action tags to count the number of times that visitors click on a particular banner ad or visit the pages of our site and to provide information about what products are viewed or purchased. Without collecting any personally identifiable information, they use that data to tell us (and other advertisers) which ads are the most effective on particular sites. Our ad server, content server and website analysis agents may use an action tag on our basket page, checkout page, and other pages, to keep anonymous track of the number of times that clicking on a banner ad or views other information on our siteresults in a purchase. They also collect the amount of the purchase, order confirmation number, stock keeping unit number, quantity and identity of product or service purchased. E-mail Distributor's Use of Action Tags: Our third-party e-mail distributor may also use action tags. They may, for example, keep track of when a promotional e-mail is opened and provide Indi with ongoing aggregated reports of how many customers have responded. We share with them web site usage information about visitors to our web site who have received a promotional e-mail or other targeted promotional campaign. They use the information for the purpose of targeting future campaigns and upgrading visitor information used in reporting statistics. For this purpose, we and our third-party e-mail distributor note some of the pages you visit on our web site through the use of action tags. For more information about our third-party e-mail distributor's use of action tags and other data collection methods, please click <a href="http://sendgrid.com/privacy.html">here</a>.
