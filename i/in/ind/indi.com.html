<p><b>1.	What information does Indi collect from you?</b></p>
<p>In order to better provide you with the services offered on the Indi 
site, Indi collects two types of information about its visitors: 
Personally Identifiable Information and Non-Personally Identifiable 
Information. Our primary goal in collecting information from you is to 
provide you with a smooth, efficient, and customized experience while 
using our site. </p>
<p><b>Personally Identifiable Information</b></p>
<p>This refers to information that lets us know the specifics of who you
 are. Personal information is requested in many ways, for example, when 
you register and set up an account, post on the Indi site, register for a
 product or service, enter challenges or sweepstakes, apply for a credit
 card, fill out surveys, and send us feedback. For example, this 
information might include your name, billing address, shipping address, 
telephone number, e-mail address, credit card or other payment 
information, and product details. With this information, Indi can better
 provide you with personalized services. For some third party services, 
we may collect your personal information on behalf of these service 
providers and share it with them.</p>
<p><b>Non-Personally Identifiable Information</b></p>
<p>This refers to information that does not by itself identify a 
specific individual. We gather certain information about you based upon 
where you visit on, and how you use, our site in several ways. This 
information is compiled and analyzed on both a personal and an 
aggregated basis. For example, this information may include the Web 
site's Uniform Resource Locator ("URL") that you just came from, which 
URL you next go to, what browser you are using, and your Internet 
Protocol ("IP") address. A URL is the global address of documents and 
other resources on the World Wide Web. An IP address is an identifier 
for a computer or device on a Transmission Control Protocol/Internet 
Protocol ("TCP/IP") network, such as the World Wide Web. Networks like 
the Web use the TCP/IP protocol to route information based on the IP 
address of the destination. In other words, an IP address is a number 
that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you are surfing
 the web, allowing web servers to locate and identify your computer. 
Computers require IP addresses in order for users to communicate on the 
Internet, browse and shop. On an aggregated basis, we collect anonymous 
data related to the pages, posts, communications, products, downloads 
and other content that is sampled, clicked on, streamed, searched for, 
transferred from and downloaded.   Except as otherwise limited in this 
Policy, we may disclose, sell, trade, or rent Non-Personally 
Identifiable Information to others without your consent.</p>
<a name="2"></a>
<p><b>2.	Where do we collect information from you and how do we use it?</b></p>
<p>Our primary goal in collecting personal information is to provide 
Indi's visitors with a superior customized online experience. We use the
 customer contact information in many ways, including without limitation
 to communicate with customers, to inform them of their challenge 
status, to send promotional information, and to enhance the operation of
 our site and administer our systems.</p> 
<p>Demographic data also may be collected at our site from third party 
advertising servers, content servers, or web site analysis agents who 
provide us with the zip code and area code associated with a visitor's 
server, along with pages viewed on our site. We review the actions of 
the Indi visitors on to determine customers' preferences. Indi also does
 research on our visitors' demographics, postings, interests, and pages 
viewed based on the information provided to us during content uploading,
 challenges, posting comments and reviews, a promotion, from our server 
log files, from our web site analysis agents, or from challenges, 
drawings, postings or surveys. We will use this data to tailor the 
visitor's experience at our site, to improve our marketing and 
promotional efforts, to statistically analyze site use, to improve our 
product and services offerings, and to customize our site's content, 
layout, and services. We receive reports from third party ad servers, 
content servers, or web site analysis agents that tells us how many ads 
were presented and clicked upon or what content was served or viewed.</p> 
<p>We may also share your personally identifiable information with third
 parties who provide services to us, our customers and web site 
visitors. Those third parties include authorized contractors, temporary 
employees and consultants and other companies working with us 
(collectively, "agents"). Where we believe it to be appropriate (in our 
sole discretion), we will ask our agents not to disclose or use your 
personal information for purposes other than to provide services to you 
or Indi.</p> 
<p>We gather information in the following ways:</p>
<p><b>Use of the Site and Services Generally</b></p>
<p>We collect IP addresses for the purposes of system administration, to
 gather broad demographic information, to enable ads to be served on our
 site, to report Non-Personally Identifiable Information to our 
advertisers, and to monitor the level of activity on our site. We 
collect information from visitors to our site regarding the URLs they 
came from, domain types (e.g., .com or .org), their IP addresses, the 
date and time of their visit or various use, the number of visits and 
various uses, the number of visits per browsing session, the server 
type, the operating system and browser type used to come to the site, 
the country, state and telephone area code where their servers are 
located, the pages and page titles of our site that visitors viewed 
during their visit, whether the visitor's computer is enabled for Java 
or cookies, browser language, applications and plug-ins, and any search 
terms entered on our site.  We also track customers' traffic patterns 
throughout their online session, including which pages, information and 
advertisements a customer views while using the site, content posting,

<p><b>9.	Indi and third-party use of "cookies" and "action tags."</b></p>
<p>Indi Cookies: When you use our site we will store cookies on your 
computer in order to facilitate and customize your use of our site. A 
cookie is a small data text file, which a Web site stores on your 
computer's hard drive (if your Web browser permits) that can later be 
retrieved to identify you to Indi. Our cookies store randomly assigned 
user identification numbers, the country where you are located, and your
 name and profile image location to welcome you back to our site. The cookies make your use 
of the site easier, make the site run more smoothly and help us to 
maintain a secure site.</p> 
<p>Ad Server and Content Server Cookies: We may use an outside ad 
serving company or content server to display banner advertisements and 
other information on our site or to serve promotional emails. As part of
 their service, they place a separate cookie on your computer. Except 
for the company that serves our promotional emails, Indi does not 
provide third-party ad servers with any of your Personally Identifiable 
Information. Indi and its third party ad servers do collect and use 
Non-Personally Identifiable Information about you, such as your IP 
address, browser type, the URLs from which you came, referring site's 
domain types (e.g., .com), operating system, the country, the server 
your computer is logged onto, where the servers that your computer is 
logged onto is located, the pages of our site and products that visitors
 viewed during their visit, where an ad was placed on a specific web 
site page, the time and date particular ads were served, the area code 
and zip code associated with your server and whether you responded to a 
particular ad, and a receipt identifier. If you would like to know more 
about the information gathering practices of the company that sends our 
emails, please click <a href="http://sendgrid.com/privacy.html" target="_blank">here</a>.</p> 
<p>Our third-party ad servers will occasionally use outside agents, 
whose computers will serve ads on our site in the same manner and under 
the same conditions as above. In addition, other ad serving companies or
 advertisers may place banner ads on our site in the same manner as 
above, but we do not disclose to them any Personally Identifiable 
Information.</p> 
<p>Image Server Cookies: As part of the ad-serving process, a third 
party may serve graphics upon our site. In order to customize their 
service, they may also place a cookie upon your computer. While Indi 
does not control their use of that cookie, no Personally Identifiable or
 individual customers' product information is collected.</p> 
<p>Website Analysis Agent Cookies: We may use a third party to analyze 
what our visitors find to be most interesting on our site. To do that, 
they will place a cookie on your computer with a randomly assigned 
unique number in order to track the pages you view on our site, along 
with other Non-Personally Identifiable Information. </p>
<p>Action Tags, Web Beacons and other Data Collection Methods: An action
 tag or a web-beacon (also known as a clear gif or a pixel tag) is a 
method used to track responses or actions by customers who view certain 
advertisements or other information on our site. Action tags are 1x1 
pixel images embedded in a website page that are used to transparently 
collect information. Our ad server, content servers and website analysis
 agents may use action tags to count the number of times that visitors 
click on a particular banner ad or visit the pages of our site and to 
provide information about what products are viewed or purchased. Without
 collecting any personally identifiable information, they use that data 
to tell us (and other advertisers) which ads are the most effective on 
particular sites. Our ad server, content server and website analysis 
agents may use an action tag on our basket page, checkout page, and 
other pages, to keep anonymous track of the number of times that 
clicking on a banner ad or views other information on our siteresults in
 a purchase. They also collect the amount of the purchase, order 
confirmation number, stock keeping unit number, quantity and identity of
 product or service purchased.</p> 
<p>E-mail Distributor's Use of Action Tags: Our third-party e-mail 
distributor may also use action tags. They may, for example, keep track 
of when a promotional e-mail is opened and provide Indi with ongoing 
aggregated reports of how many customers have responded. We share with 
them web site usage information about visitors to our web site who have 
received a promotional e-mail or other targeted promotional campaign. 
They use the information for the purpose of targeting future campaigns 
and upgrading visitor information used in reporting statistics. For this
 purpose, we and our third-party e-mail distributor note some of the 
pages you visit on our web site through the use of action tags. For more
 information about our third-party e-mail distributor's use of action 
tags and other data collection methods, please click <a href="http://sendgrid.com/privacy.html" target="_blank">here</a>. </p>
