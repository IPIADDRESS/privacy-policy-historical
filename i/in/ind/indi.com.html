<p><strong>What information does Indi collect from you?</strong>  In order to better provide you with the services offered on the Indi site, Indi collects two types of information about its visitors:  Personally Identifiable Information and Non-Personally Identifiable Information. Our primary goal in collecting information from you is to provide you with a smooth, efficient, and customized experience while using our site.   <strong>Personally Identifiable Information</strong>  This refers to information that lets us know the specifics of who you are. Personal information is requested in many ways, for example, when you register and set up an account, post on the Indi site, register for a product or service, enter challenges or sweepstakes, apply for a credit card, fill out surveys, and send us feedback. For example, this information might include your name, billing address, shipping address, Face Book ID, telephone number, e-mail address, credit card or other payment information, and product details. With this information, Indi can better provide you with personalized services. For some third party services, we may collect your personal information on behalf of these service providers and share it with them.  <strong>Non-Personally Identifiable Information</strong>  This refers to information that does not by itself identify a specific individual. We gather certain information about you based upon where you visit on, and how you use, our site in several ways. This information is compiled and analyzed on both a personal and an aggregated basis. For example, this information may include gender, geographic location, genres, categories and channels you interact with, the Web site's Uniform Resource Locator ("URL") that you just came from, which URL you next go to, what browser you are using, cookies, device information, your Internet Protocol ("IP") address and NPII third party information passed to us from your third party registration on Indi (e.g., from Face Book login). A URL is the global address of documents and other resources on the World Wide Web. An IP address is an identifier for a computer or device on a Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol ("TCP/IP") network, such as the World Wide Web. Networks like the Web use the TCP/IP protocol to route information based on the IP address of the destination. In other words, an IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you are surfing the web, allowing web servers to locate and identify your computer. Computers require IP addresses in order for users to communicate on the Internet, browse and shop. On an aggregated basis, we collect anonymous data related to the pages, posts, communications, products, downloads and other content that is sampled, clicked on, streamed, searched for, transferred from and downloaded. When content on Indi is shared into social media, that content may be tagged and tracked in social media for primary purposes of Buzz determination, and the social media site may pass back certain information such as likes, shares, comments and other interactions that such content receives within the social media network.  Except as otherwise limited in this Policy, we may disclose, share, sell, trade, or rent Non-Personally Identifiable Information to others without your consent.

<p><strong>Where do we collect information from you and how do we use it?</strong>  Our primary goal in collecting personal information is to provide Indi's visitors with a superior customized online experience. We use the customer contact information in many ways, including without limitation to communicate with customers, to inform them of their challenge status, to send promotional information, and to enhance the operation of our site and administer our systems. Demographic data also may be collected at our site from third party log-in services, advertising servers, content servers, or web site analysis agents who provide us with the zip code and area code associated with a visitor's server, along with pages viewed on our site. We review the actions of the Indi visitors on to determine customers' preferences. Indi also does research on our visitors' demographics, postings, interests, and pages viewed based on the information provided to us during content uploading, challenges, posting comments and reviews, a promotion, from our server log files, from our web site analysis agents, or from challenges, drawings, postings or surveys. We will use this data to tailor the visitor's experience at our site, to improve our marketing and promotional efforts, to statistically analyze site use, to improve our product and services offerings, and to customize our site's content, layout, and services. We receive reports from third party ad servers, content servers, or web site analysis agents that tells us how many ads were presented and clicked upon or what content was served or viewed. We may also share your personally identifiable information with third parties who provide services to us, our customers and web site visitors. Those third parties include authorized contractors, temporary employees and consultants and other companies working with us (collectively, "agents"). Where we believe it to be appropriate (in our sole discretion), we will ask our agents not to disclose or use your personal information for purposes other than to provide services to you or Indi. We gather information in the following ways:  <strong>Use of the Site and Services Generally</strong>  We collect IP addresses, cookies and device and usage for the purposes of system administration, and gather broad demographic information, to enable ads to be served on our site and generally to report Non-Personally Identifiable Information to our advertisers and channel owners on Indi whose channel you have visited, and to monitor the level of activity on our site.

We also track customers' traffic patterns throughout their online session, including which pages, information and advertisements a customer views while using the site, content posting, communications and all other use of the Indi site. We also use your IP address to diagnose problems with our servers, software, to administer our site and to gather demographic information. We may share aggregated statistics about pages viewed on our site, sales and other shopping information with third parties.  <strong>Uploading Content</strong>  We track all aspects of the updload process to provide us with information to monitor and improve our uploading process. This information includes the file name, attributes and contents of the uploaded file. We also request additional information to pinpoint the date, time and your upload location and the location, place of business, etc. for where your video was filmed.  <strong>Action Tags/Web Beacons</strong>  We may use and allow others to use action tags or web beacons in the operation of our site; to find out what action tags and web beacons are and how they are used, click here. When content on Indi is shared into social media, that content may be tagged and tracked in social media for the primary purposes of Buzz determination, and the social media site may pass back certain information such as likes, shares, comments and other interactions that such content receives within the social media network. All of the foregoing Non-Personally Identifiable Information is shared with channel owners on Indi with respect to your visits on their channels, and Personally Identifiable Information may be transferred to a channel owner based on your agreement to share such information when uploading to a forum or challenge on the channel owners channel.</p>

The type of information we collect includes things such as pages, information and advertisements viewed as well as what items are placed in a shopping basket or purchased, the order number, the amount of a purchase, the product number and the quantity purchased. By supplementing our records, this information helps us learn things like what kinds of customers our site attracts, which of our products most interest our customers, and what kinds of offers our customers like to see. Although the marketing companies log the information coming from our site on our behalf, we control how that data may and may not be used. For more information, please see the section "Use of Cookies and Action Tags" below. <strong>Financing Services</strong> We may use a third party bank to provide a credit card and financing to customers who desire it. The bank collects personally identifiable information to provide their financing services.  <strong>General Provision of Services and Site Operations</strong> We contract with third-party service providers to operate many of our website functions. We may provide such third-party service providers with your other personal information as needed to operate many of our website functions. <strong>Marketing Partners, Co-Branded Services, Framing/Windows on Third-Party Sites</strong> We may run promotions for other service providers or merchants where you may visit the such service provider's or merchants' sites. In some of those promotions, a window or frame containing the merchant's site may appear. Any time you are in a window, you should assume that your personal information is being collected, used and disclosed in accordance with that service provider's or merchant's policies. This Privacy Policy does not apply to information that you supply to those service providers and merchants. Any information that you share with them will be used and disclosed in accordance with that service provider's or merchant's privacy policy.

The information practices of those websites linking from or to our site are not covered by this Policy.

Additionally, other companies or ad servers, which place advertising on our site may collect information about you through the use of cookies when you view or click on their advertising. We cannot control this collection of information. You should contact advertisers directly if you have any questions about their use of the information that they collect.

<p><strong>Indi and third-party use of "cookies" and "action tags."</strong> Indi Cookies: When you use our site we will store cookies on your computer in order to facilitate and customize your use of our site. A cookie is a small data text file, which a Web site stores on your computer's hard drive (if your Web browser permits) that can later be retrieved to identify you to Indi. Our cookies store randomly assigned user identification numbers, the country where you are located, and your name and profile image location to welcome you back to our site. The cookies make your use of the site easier, make the site run more smoothly and help us to maintain a secure site. Ad Server and Content Server Cookies: We may use an outside ad serving company or content server to display banner advertisements and other information on our site or to serve promotional emails. As part of their service, they place a separate cookie on your computer. Except for the company that serves our promotional emails, Indi does not provide third-party ad servers with any of your Personally Identifiable Information. Indi and its third party ad servers do collect and use Non-Personally Identifiable Information about you, such as your IP address, browser type, the URLs from which you came, referring site's domain types (e.g., .com), operating system, the country, the server your computer is logged onto, where the servers that your computer is logged onto is located, the pages of our site and products that visitors viewed during their visit, where an ad was placed on a specific web site page, the time and date particular ads were served, the area code and zip code associated with your server and whether you responded to a particular ad, and a receipt identifier. If you would like to know more about the information gathering practices of the company that sends our emails, please click <a href="http://sendgrid.com/privacy.html">here</a>. Our third-party ad servers will occasionally use outside agents, whose computers will serve ads on our site in the same manner and under the same conditions as above. In addition, other ad serving companies or advertisers may place banner ads on our site in the same manner as above, but we do not disclose to them any Personally Identifiable Information. Image Server Cookies: As part of the ad-serving process, a third party may serve graphics upon our site. In order to customize their service, they may also place a cookie upon your computer. While Indi does not control their use of that cookie, no Personally Identifiable or individual customers' product information is collected. Website Analysis Agent Cookies: We may use a third party to analyze what our visitors find to be most interesting on our site. To do that, they will place a cookie on your computer with a randomly assigned unique number in order to track the pages you view on our site, along with other Non-Personally Identifiable Information.  Action Tags, Web Beacons and other Data Collection Methods: An action tag or a web-beacon (also known as a clear gif or a pixel tag) is a method used to track responses or actions by customers who view certain advertisements or other information on our site. Action tags are 1x1 pixel images embedded in a website page that are used to transparently collect information. Our ad server, content servers and website analysis agents may use action tags to count the number of times that visitors click on a particular banner ad or visit the pages of our site and to provide information about what products are viewed or purchased. Without collecting any personally identifiable information, they use that data to tell us (and other advertisers) which ads are the most effective on particular sites. Our ad server, content server and website analysis agents may use an action tag on our basket page, checkout page, and other pages, to keep anonymous track of the number of times that clicking on a banner ad or views other information on our siteresults in a purchase. They also collect the amount of the purchase, order confirmation number, stock keeping unit number, quantity and identity of product or service purchased. E-mail Distributor's Use of Action Tags: Our third-party e-mail distributor may also use action tags. They may, for example, keep track of when a promotional e-mail is opened and provide Indi with ongoing aggregated reports of how many customers have responded. We share with them web site usage information about visitors to our web site who have received a promotional e-mail or other targeted promotional campaign. They use the information for the purpose of targeting future campaigns and upgrading visitor information used in reporting statistics. For this purpose, we and our third-party e-mail distributor note some of the pages you visit on our web site through the use of action tags. For more information about our third-party e-mail distributor's use of action tags and other data collection methods, please click <a href="http://sendgrid.com/privacy.html">here</a>.
