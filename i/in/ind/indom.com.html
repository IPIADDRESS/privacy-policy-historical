<p>At CSC<sup>®</sup> (or "we", "us", "our"), we value your relationship and respect your trust. As a result, we have chosen to comply with the EU-U.S. and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Frameworks, regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal data transferred from the European Union countries and Switzerland to the U.S. CSC has certified that it adheres to the Privacy Shield Principles of Notice, Choice, and Accountability for Onward Transfer, Security, Data Integrity, and Purpose Limitation, Access, and Recourse, Enforcement, and Liability. If there is any conflict between the policies in this Privacy Policy and the Privacy Shield Principles, the Privacy Shield Principles shall govern.

<p>To view CSC's Privacy Shield Framework Compliance Statement for Data Privacy, please click here: <a href="#shield">https://www.cscglobal.com/service/csc/privacy</a>.</p>

<p>CSC is subject to the investigatory and enforcement authority of the United States Federal Trade Commission.</p>

<p><strong>About this Privacy Policy</strong></p>

<p>We are committed to protecting and respecting your privacy and handling your information in an open and transparent manner. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle and protect your personal data, how we gather this data, and how we manage this data to serve you. We may change this Privacy Policy from time to time as the need arises to accurately reflect how we gather and manage your personal data.</p>

<p>All changes to this Privacy Policy will be effective upon posting to this website without any other notice to you. Use of the website following such changes constitutes your acceptance of the revised Privacy Policy then in effect. We encourage you to frequently visit this Privacy Policy for modifications. This Privacy Policy is effective as of December 1, 2014 and was last updated on January 7, 2019.</p>

<p>In this Privacy Policy the term "Data Protection Legislation" means the EU General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679; together with all other applicable legislation relating to privacy or data protection.</p>

<p><strong>1. What is Personal data?</strong></p>

<p>"Personal data," where used in this Privacy Policy, shall mean any information or set of information that identifies an individual, or could be used by or on behalf of CSC to identify an individual, and shall include any data about an identified or identifiable individual that are within the scope of Data Protection Legislation and recorded in any form. Personal data does not include information which is encrypted or anonymized.</p>

<p>We may refer to your personal data as your information and may sometimes collectively refer to handling, collecting, protecting and storing your personal data as "processing" such personal data.</p>

<p><strong>2. Scope of this Privacy Policy</strong></p>

<p>This Privacy Policy applies to personal data submitted to, or collected by us through this website and CSC's various service applications. It does not apply when CSC act on behalf of its clients as processors.</p>

<p><strong>3. What information we collect, and why</strong></p>

<p>The information we collect from you may include the following: your name, gender, date of birth, home, and work contact details such as business title, email address, IP address, telephone number, country in which you reside, payment information, purchase history, and your reviews and opinions about our products and services. </p>

<p>Some CSC services may require additional information which we will inform you of when we request such information.</p>

<p><strong>4. How we collect your information </strong></p>

<p>4.1 Information provided by you</p>
<p>If you use this website or its various applications, you may be required to provide the following information as part of registration: first name, last name, company name, title, address, city, state, zip, telephone, email address, preferred method of contact (email, phone, postal), account number, service and product interest information, and intended use of services or products. In addition, you may choose to provide additional information relating to yourself or your companies to take advantage of different services available on this website.</p>

<p>We generally do not require you to provide sensitive personal data, such as that which reveals race, ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, trade union membership, or information that concerns health or sex life.</p>

<p>4.2. Log files</p>

<p>We also periodically gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. This information includes browser type, internet service provider, referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and click-stream data.</p>

<p>4.3. Information we collect about you</p>

<p>Like most websites, we use "cookies" to help us make our site – and the way you use it – better. Cookies mean that a website will remember you. They're small text files that sites transfer to your computer (or phone/tablet). They improve website use and speed – for example by automatically filling your name and address in text fields. There are more details in the section on our cookies policy below.</p>

<p>In addition, with regard to each of your visits to our site we will automatically collect certain information (e.g. your IP address) used to connect your computer to the internet.</p>

<p>4.4. Children's information</p>

<p>We do not knowingly collect information from children under the age of 18 and we do not target our websites to children under 18, and we determine that an individual under the age of 18 has submitted information to this site, we delete that information.</p>

<p><strong>5. How we use your information</strong></p>

<p>We may use the personal data we collect:</p>
<ul>
	<li>to provide you with information, goods, or services which you have requested;</li>
	<li>to contact you in connection with support-related activities;</li>
	<li>to contact you in the event that we have announcements regarding this website or the applications within this website;</li>
	<li>to fulfill any other purpose for which you provided it;</li>
	<li>for billing and collection purposes;</li>
	<li>to analyze the use of our websites;</li>
	<li>in any other way we may describe when you provide the data; and/ or</li>
	<li>for any other purpose with your consent</li>
</ul>

<p>We do not conduct automated decision making including profiling</p>

<p>We may also use your personal data to contact you about our own goods and services that may be of interest to you. If you do not want us to use your information in this way, or any of the ways described above, please (i) contact us at the address below, (ii) check the relevant box or ensure the relevant box is checked on the form on which we collect your personal data for this purpose, or (iii) follow the unsubscribe instructions in the email or other communication you have received.</p>

<p>5.1. Log files</p>

<p>Log files give us a general picture of who is visiting our website and which pages are viewed most often. Log files are collected mainly for research purposes to see what pages, services and information are of greatest interest to current and potential clients.</p>

<p><strong>6. Legal grounds for using your personal information</strong></p>

<p>The law permits us to process your personal data in the way that it does because the processing is:</p>
<ul>
	<li>necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests that we pursue, which are to run and administer our business, to discharge our legal obligations to store and disclose information where necessary and to evaluate, develop and improve our services and market new and improved services; and/or</li>
	<li>necessary for the performance of our contract [to provide you with products you have purchased or services you have ordered]; and/or</li>
	<li>necessary in order to comply with a legal obligation to which we are subject. </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>7. Disclosure and transfer of your information</strong></p>

<p>In some instances, we may be asked to disclose certain personal data pursuant to a court order, subpoena, search warrant, or law enforcement request. We may also disclose your information in order to enforce our terms of use or to protect the rights, property, or the personal safety of (in each case) us, our staff, customers, and others.
