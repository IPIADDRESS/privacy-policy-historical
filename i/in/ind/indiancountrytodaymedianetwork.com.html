<p><em>Personally Identifiable Information </em></p>
<p><strong><em> </em></strong></p>
<p>You can visit and browse Indian Country Today Media Network.com without revealing personally identifiable information about yourself.&nbsp; You may also choose to disclose personally identifiable information about yourself.&nbsp; Personally identifiable information is information that relates to and can be identified with a unique individual person – including his or her name, address, telephone number, and e-mail address.&nbsp; We collect personally identifiable information about you from Indian Country Today Media Network.com as follows:</p>
<p><em>Registration </em>– When you register on Indian Country Today Media Network.com, our registration form requires or requests certain personally identifiable information, which includes, without limitation, your name, email address, postal address, telephone number, a unique individual user identifier and password, gender, current city, hometown, family, interests, tribe, etc.&nbsp; If you are under age 13, please do not attempt to register for Indian Country Today Media Network.com or provide any personal information about yourself to us. If we learn that we have collected personal information from a child under age 13, we will delete that information as quickly as possible.</p>
<p><em> </em></p>
<p><em>Newsletters</em> – If you want to receive our newsletter, you will be asked to provide certain information so that we can fulfill your request.&nbsp; We may ask you for certain personally identifiable information which includes, without limitation, your name, email address, postal address, telephone number, and areas of interest.<strong> </strong></p>
<p><em>Transactional Information – </em>We may retain the details of transactions or payments you make on Indian Country Today Media Network.com.</p>
<p><em> </em></p>
<p><em>Content</em> – One of the reasons to use Indian Country Today Media Network.com is to access its social network and share content with others. Examples include when you upload a photo, video, share a link, or send someone a message. If you do not want us to store metadata associated with content you share on Indian Country Today Media Network.com (such as photos), please remove the metadata before uploading the content.</p>
<p><em>Site activity information</em> –<em> </em>We keep track of some of the actions you take on Indian Country Today Media Network.com, such as adding connections (including joining a group or adding a friend) and creating a photo album. In some cases you are also taking an action when you provide information or content to us. For example, if you share a video, in addition to storing the actual content you uploaded, we might log the fact that you shared it.<em> </em></p>
<p><em> </em></p>
<p><em>Information Collected Automatically</em></p>
<p><em> </em></p>
<p>When you visit Indian Country Today Media Network.com, like when you visit most other websites, certain anonymous information about your visit is automatically logged, including<strong> </strong>the server name, browser type and IP address through which you access the internet, the date and time you access our site, the pages you access while at Indian Country Today Media Network.com, and the Internet address of the website, if any, from which you linked directly to Indian Country Today Media Network.com, which we sometimes aggregate with similar information from other customers to help improve or promote our service.</p>
<p><strong>“Cookies”</strong></p>
<p>A cookie is a small piece of data stored on the user’s computer tied to information about the user.&nbsp; We use session ID cookies and persistent cookies. A session ID cookie terminates when you close your browser.&nbsp; A persistent cookie is stored for an extended period of time.</p>
<p>Cookies allow us to recognize your computer while you are on Indian Country Today Media Network.com and when you return to Indian Country Today Media Network.com and help customize your online experience and make it more convenient for you.&nbsp; Cookies are also useful in tracking transaction histories and preserving information between sessions.&nbsp; The information collected from cookies may also be used to improve the functionality of Indian Country Today Media Network.com.</p>
<p>Most web browser applications (such as Microsoft Internet Explorer and Firefox) have features that can notify you when you receive a cookie or prevent cookies from being sent. If you disable cookies, you may not be able to use certain personalized functions of this website.</p>
<p><strong>Clear GIFs (Web Beacons/Web Bugs)</strong></p>
<p>We employ a software technology called clear GIFs (sometimes called web beacons or web bugs), to learn what content users find effective.&nbsp; Clear GIFs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of users. We may tie information collected through the use of Clear GIFs to users’ personally identifiable information.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p>Clear GIFs can “work with” existing cookies on a computer if they are both from the same web site.&nbsp; For example, clear GIFs enable us to match the Clear GIF identifier with a cookie ID number to show the past online behavior for a particular computer.</p>
<p>In addition, we use clear GIFs in our HTML-based emails to let us know which emails have been opened by the recipients.&nbsp; This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns.</p>
