    Online: Privacy Policy</strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">India Today Group Online is committed to protecting the
    privacy of Internet users. This statement discloses the privacy practices for India Today
    Group Online, located at <a href="http://www.india-today.com">www.india-today.com</a></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Questions regarding this statement should be directed to
    India Today Group Online at <a href="mailto:privacy@india-today.com?subject=Privacy Policy">privacy@india-today.com</a>
    or by contacting India Today Group Online, G-59 Marina Arcade, Middle Circle, Connaught
    Place, New Delhi 110 001 or by calling our main number at (91) 11-373-6392.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">The information gathered by India Today Group Online falls
    into two categories: (1) information voluntarily supplied by visitors to our website
    through optional registration and (2) tracking information gathered as visitors navigate
    through our site.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">To make use of certain features on our website, visitors
    must provide certain information as part of the registration process. (We may ask, for
    example, for your name, email address, sex, age, and PIN code, and we might request
    information on your occupation, interests, and the like.) The information you supply will
    help us to make India Today Group Online a better website by allowing us to tailor our
    site to your interests and make it more useful to you. Supplying such information is
    entirely voluntary. In some instances, which involve, for example, subscriptions, you may
    need to provide all the information before the subscription can reach you. We can't
    deliver your magazines or notify you that you've been lucky enough to win a prize in a
    promotional contest if we don't know how to contact you. Of course, even if you want to
    remain completely anonymous, you are still free to take advantage of the wealth of content
    available on our site without providing any personal information.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">To help make our site more responsive to the needs of our
    visitors, we invoke a standard feature of browser software, called a "cookie",
    to assign each visitor a unique, random number (a sort of user ID) that resides on your
    computer. The cookie does not personally identify the visitor as an individual; rather,
    cookies merely identify the computer that a visitor uses to access our site. Unless you
    voluntarily identify yourself (through registration, for example), we will have no way of
    knowing who you are, even if we assign a cookie to your computer. The only personal
    information a cookie can contain is information you supply (an example of this is when you
    ask for our Personalised Horoscope). A cookie cannot read data off your hard drive. Our
    advertisers may also assign their own cookies to your browser (if you click on their ads),
    a process that we do not control.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">We use cookies to help us tailor our site to meet your
    needs, and to deliver a better service that is keyed to the interests of our visitors. We
    use cookies to determine what features our visitors prefer and which are less popular. We
    can build a better site if we know which pages our users are visiting and how often. And
    we use cookies to avoid showing you the same ad, repeatedly, during a single visit.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">If you do not want the benefit of cookies, there is a
    simple process to manually delete your cookies. Please consult your web browser's Help
    documentation for more information on this process.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Our web servers automatically collect limited information
    about your computer's connection to the Internet, including your IP address, when you
    visit our site. (Your IP address is a number that lets computers attached to the Internet
    know where to send you data -- such as the web pages you view.) Your IP address does not
    identify you personally. We use this information to deliver our web pages to you upon
    request, to tailor our site to the interests of our users, to measure traffic within our
    site and let advertisers know the geographic locations from where our visitors come.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">India Today Group Online includes links to other websites
    whose privacy policies we do not control. Once you leave our servers (you can tell where
    you are by checking the URL in the location bar on your browser), use of any information
    you provide is governed by the privacy policy of the operator of the site you are
    visiting. That policy may differ from ours. If you can't find the privacy policy of any of
    these sites via a link from the site's homepage, you should contact the site directly for
    more information.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">When we present information to our advertisers -- to help
    them understand our audience and confirm the value of advertising on our website -- it is
    usually in the form of aggregated statistics on traffic to various pages within our site.
    If you do register with India Today Group Online, we may, from time to time, contact you
    about content and features that we believe may be of interest to you.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">All information gathered on India Today Group Online is
    securely stored within the India Today Group Online-controlled database. The database is
    stored on servers secured behind a firewall; access to the servers is password-protected
    and is strictly limited. However, as effective as our security measures are, no security
    system is impenetrable. We cannot guarantee the security of our database, nor can we
    guarantee that information you supply will not be intercepted while being transmitted to
    us over the Internet. And, of course, any information you include in a posting to the
    discussion areas is available to anyone with Internet access.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" size="3">A note to end on: The Web is an evolving medium. If we need
    to change our privacy policy at some point in the future, we'll post the changes before
    they take effect. Of course, our use of any information we gather will always be
    consistent with the policy under which the information was collected, regardless of what
    the new policy may be.</font></p>
