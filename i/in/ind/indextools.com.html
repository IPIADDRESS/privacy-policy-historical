              <b>Privacy Principles</b><br>

              Because your privacy is important to us, IndexTools.com Statistics

              IndexTools.com does not collect personal information such as name, 

              age, phone number and mailing address from visitors to our customer's 

              web sites. <br>

              <br>

              <b>Principle 2 - No Combination of Browsing and Web Traffic Information 

              with Personal Information</b><br>

              Since IndexTools.com does not collect any personal information, 

              we do not combine traffic analysis information with personal information 

              such as name, age, phone number and mailing address. <br>

              <br>

              <b>Principle 3 - No Aggregation of Individual Visitor Traffic Patterns 

              across Multiple Sites</b><br>

              IndexTools.com does not collect individual profile information for 

              visitors across multiple sites and does not aggregate information 

              from any other sources about browsing patterns of individual visitors 

              across multiple sites. <br>

              <br>

              <b>Principle 4 - Use of Anonymous IP Address</b><br>

              IP addresses are recorded by every site on the internet. IndexTools.com 

              collects this information as well, but does so exclusively for the 

              following uses: (1) anonymous statistical purposes; or (2) administration 

              of our web site and servers, and to improve our services. <br>

              <br>

              <b>Principle 5 - Anonymous Use of Cookies</b><br>

              It is IndexTools.com Statistics's policy to use cookies only for 

              more accurate anonymous traffic analysis. The cookie information 

              does NOT include personal data such as name, age, phone number, 

              e-mail address or mailing address. In addition, IndexTools.com does 

              NOT link cookies to personal data such as name, age, phone number, 

              e-mail address and mailing address. Most browsers are initially 

              set up to accept cookies. If you would prefer, you can set your 

              browser to reject cookies. <br>

              <br>

              <b>Principle 6 - No Individual Profiling</b><br>

              IndexTools.com Statistics does not create individual profiles for 

              visitors. Unlike other tracking services we do not have a database 

              of individual profiles for each visitor. IndexTools.com Statistics 

              collects data in aggregate form and data is not recorded or stored 

              for individual visitors. <br>

              <br>

              <b>Principle 7 - Limited Use of Cookies</b><br>

              IndexTools.com Statistics uses cookies to track such as the time/date 

              of the visit, the time/date of last visit, the page viewed, the 

              referrer, transaction information for eCommerce pages, and other 

              data. The cookies never include personal information such as name, 

              mailing address and phone number. We do not collect such information 

              and visitors that we track can not provide us with personal information 

              through normal movement across a web site. As we do not build a 

              database of individual visitors, the data that we do collect is 

              never stored in any individual user profile; the data collected 

              serves only to update aggregate counts allowing our customers to 

              monitor traffic on their site. Visitors can also reject cookies.
