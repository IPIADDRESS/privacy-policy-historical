													<img src="siteimages/selector.gif" alt="">
                  									<div class="textHigh">General Information</div>
													IndexTools.com is firmly committed to the privacy of customers and visitors to its web sites. We are equally committed to the privacy of the data we collect for sites using our eService, and the visitors who frequent those sites. The following discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices for www.IndexTools.com. Other IndexTools.com sites may have different policies.

                  									<div class="textHigh">Privacy Statement for Visitors to Sites Tracked by IndexTools.com Statistics</div>
                  									<b>Privacy Principles</b>
                  									<br><br>
                  									Because your privacy is important to us, IndexTools.com Statistics conducts its business under the following principles:
                  									<br><br>
                  									Principle 1 - No Collection of Personal Information
													<br><br>
													IndexTools.com does not collect personal information such as name, age, phone number and mailing address from visitors to our customer's web sites.
													<br><br>
                  									Principle 2 - No Combination of Browsing and Web Traffic Information with Personal Information
													<br><br>
													Since IndexTools.com does not collect any personal information, we do not combine traffic analysis information with personal information such as name, age, phone number and mailing address.
													<br><br>
                  									Principle 3 - No Aggregation of Individual Visitor Traffic Patterns across Multiple Sites
													<br><br>
													IndexTools.com does not collect individual profile information for visitors across multiple sites and does not aggregate information from any other sources about browsing patterns of individual visitors across multiple sites.
													<br><br>
                  									Principle 4 - Use of Anonymous IP Address
													<br><br>
													IP addresses are recorded by every site on the internet. IndexTools.com collects this information as well, but does so exclusively for the following uses: (1) anonymous statistical purposes; or (2) administration of our web site and servers, and to improve our services.
													<br><br>
                  									Principle 5 - Anonymous Use of Cookies
													<br><br>
													It is IndexTools.com Statistics's policy to use cookies only for more accurate anonymous traffic analysis. The cookie information does NOT include personal data such as name, age, phone number, e-mail address or mailing address. In addition, IndexTools.com does NOT link cookies to personal data such as name, age, phone number, e-mail address and mailing address. Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies. If you would prefer, you can set your browser to reject cookies.
													<br><br>
                  									Principle 6 - No Individual Profiling
													<br><br>
													IndexTools.com Statistics does not create individual profiles for visitors. Unlike other tracking services we do not have a database of individual profiles for each visitor. IndexTools.com Statistics collects data in aggregate form and data is not recorded or stored for individual visitors.
													<br><br>
                  									Principle 7 - Limited Use of Cookies
													<br><br>
													IndexTools.com Statistics uses cookies to track such as the time/date of the visit, the time/date of last visit, the page viewed, the referrer, transaction information for eCommerce pages, and other data. The cookies never include personal information such as name, mailing address and phone number. We do not collect such information and visitors that we track can not provide us with personal information through normal movement across a web site. As we do not build a database of individual visitors, the data that we do collect is never stored in any individual user profile; the data collected serves only to update aggregate counts allowing our customers to monitor traffic on their site. Visitors can also reject cookies.
													<br><br>
													Privacy Statement for Customers Using IndexTools.com Statistics to Track their Web Sites
