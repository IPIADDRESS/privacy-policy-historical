However, some Indiaon2wheels services may not function  properly if you disable cookies.</p>
    <p>3.6 <strong>Other Disclosures/Use</strong>.

These other websites may send  their own cookies to visitors, collect data or solicit personal information. Indiaon2wheels  strongly recommends that you review and understand the privacy policies of the  websites you visit, whether you visit those websites directly or through a link  from a page on this Website.</p>
    <p>5. <strong>Forums</strong>. Whenever you give out personal information online,  including via forums, message boards or chat groups, that information can be  collected and used by others. While Indiaon2wheels strives to protect its  visitors' personal information and privacy as outlined in this Privacy Policy, Indiaon2wheels  cannot guarantee the security of any information you disclose online and you do  so at your own risk. See, the Terms of Use for more information.</p>
