<h4>First-party cookies</h4>
    
<p>The following is a summary of the first-party services or systems on our website which use cookies:</p>

<h4>Third-party cookies</h4>
    
<p>One of the principal third-party systems involved in our site which uses a cookie is Google Analytics.  This cookie is essential for compiling reports on the performance of our website to help us improve the service we provide for our users. It collects information in an anonymous form, including the number of visitors to our website, where visitors have come from and the pages they have visited. More information on the use of cookies for Google Analytics can be found at <a href="https://developers.google.com/analytics/resources/concepts/gaConceptsCookies" target="_blank">Cookies &amp; Google Analytics</a> and <a href="http://www.google.com/analytics/learn/privacy.html" target="_blank">Safeguarding your Google Analytics data</a>.</p>
    
<p>We also embed some elements from trusted third parties into our website pages, allowing us to provide you with features integrated with <a href="https://twitter.com/" target="_blank">Twitter</a>, <a href="http://www.facebook.com/" target="_blank">Facebook</a> and <a href="http://www.blogger.com/" target="_blank">Blogger</a>.</p>

<p>In many cases these cookies are used to generate identical information to Google Analytics, and indeed they often use Google Analytics.  Opting out of Google Analytics will therefore also opt you out of these cookies.
