        One of the pioneers in Indian Astrology Software, Astro-Vision has developed innovative astrology software products and services to bring it closer to the common man. In 1984 we introduced the concept of computerised astrology &amp; computer based astrology predictions. Since then, Astro-Vision has been developing the best astrology software such as LifeSign (horoscope calculations and predictions with Parihara based on Indian astrology - kundli software), SoulMate (Marriage compatibility software based on Indian astrology), Numerology (personality reports for finding compatible names as per Numerology), StarClock (Muhurta and Panchangam software, including horoscope calculations) and GemFinder (Gem recommendation software based on Indian astrology). These Vedic astrology software (kundali software) are time-tested and accepted by astrologers and the general public alike. Many leading astrologers testify to the authenticity of the results generated by these horoscope software and it is now considered the de-facto standard in the world of astrology. Astro-Vision’s Online astrology (jyotish) software are available in English, Tamil, Malayalam, Kannada, Telugu, Gujarathi, Marathi, Hindi, Sinhala &amp; German languages. The elite group of satisfied Astro-Vision clients in India and abroad include computerised astrology centres, learned astrologers, astrology research centres, researchers and students of astrology.       </p>
