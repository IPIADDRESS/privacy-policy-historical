<br>&nbsp;<br>When you use our site, we receive and collect certain information. 
The information that we receive and collect depends on what you do when you 
visit Indiaclub.com.&nbsp;</font></font><br designtimesp="18367">&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li designtimesp="18368"><u designtimesp="18369">Information Collected via 
  Cookies</u>. We use cookies to enhance the browsing and shopping experience on 
  the Indiaclub.com site. "Cookies" are small files or records that we place on 
  your computer's hard drive to collect information about your activities on the 
  Indiaclub.com site. The cookies transmit this information back to the 
  computers at Indiaclub.com or our third-party distributors of banners and 
  newsletters; these computers are, generally speaking, the only computers which 
  are authorized to read such information. The information captured makes it 
  possible for us (i) to speed navigation, keep track of items in your shopping 
  cart, and provide you with custom tailored content; (ii) to remember 
  information you gave to us so you don't have to reenter it each time you visit 
  the Indiaclub.com site; (iii) to monitor the effectiveness of certain of our 
  marketing email campaigns; and (iv) to monitor total number of visitors, pages 
  viewed, and the total number of banners served. <br designtimesp="18370">&nbsp;<br designtimesp="18371">Most people do not know 
  that cookies are being placed on their computers when they visit the 
  Indiaclub.com site or most web sites because browsers are typically set to 
  accept cookies. You can choose to have your browser warn you every time a 
  cookie is being sent to you or you can turn off cookie placement. If you 
  refuse cookies, you will not be able to open a Indiaclub.com Shopping Cart and 
  therefore will not be able to complete an order with us online. Also, by not 
  using cookies, your overall Internet browsing experience will be affected. <br designtimesp="18372">&nbsp;<br designtimesp="18373">If you would like to 
  obtain more information about the third-party distributor of banners on the 
  Indiaclub.com site and to know your choices about having such distributor's 
  cookies turned off, please visit <a href="http://www.privacychoices.org">www.privacychoices.org</a>. If you turn 
  off the third-party distributor's cookies, you will still see banners on our 
  site; however, the banners will not be tailored to your shopping 
  experience.<br>&nbsp;<br>
  </li><li><u>Information Collected Using Pixel Tags or Clear GIFs</u>. To help us 
  understand the effectiveness of certain of our email marketing efforts, 
  Indiaclub.com may use "message format" and "message open" sensing 
  technologies. Both technologies require the use of pixel tags or clear GIFs 
  (also called web beacons). The "message format" sensing technology allows us 
  to recognize whether you have enabled your email program to receive HTML 
  emails; if so, this information is then associated with your email address so 
  that subsequent messages can be sent to you in HTML format. The "message open" 
  sensing technology allows us to recognize whether you have opened our email 
  message. We can only detect this if your have enabled your email program to 
  receive HTML emails.<br>&nbsp;<br>
  </li><li><u>Information You Actively Submit to Indiaclub.com </u>. For most of the 
  browsing services we provide, we neither require nor collect "Personal 
  Customer Information" -- your name, email address, billing address, shipping 
  address(es), phone number and credit card information. You can browse the 
  Indiaclub.com site and take as much time as you want to review our books and 
  other products, services and reviews without having to submit such Personal 
  Customer Information. Even when you use our shopping cart as you browse, there 
  is no need to submit Personal Customer Information. <br>&nbsp;<br>In the 
  following instances, however, we do need you to actively submit Personal 
  Customer Information: when you want to (i) open an account or complete an 
  order, (ii) subscribe to our Newsletters, (iii)&nbsp;subscribe to books of my 
  choice newsletter and other promotions<br>&nbsp;<br>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Creating a Indiaclub.com Account or Completing an Order.</b> You can 
    create a customer account with Indiaclub.com&nbsp; to complete an order. To 
    open an account, you will need to create a password-protected account with 
    us. In doing so, we require that you provide us with all of the following 
    Personal Customer Information: your name, email address, billing address, 
    shipping address(es), and credit card information. We use industry standard 
    e-commerce security technology to protect the Personal Customer Information 
    that you transmit to us when you establish your account and each time you 
    access your account information. When setting up the account, we ask you to 
    create a password. When you want to make a purchase or change your stored 
    Personal Customer Information, we approve your access by verifying your 
    email address with your password.<br>&nbsp;<br><!-- Here Phil -->
