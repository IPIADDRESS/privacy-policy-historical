<span class="centralTitle">COMEDY CENTRAL PRIVACY POLICY AND YOUR CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS</span> 
<br><br><p>This is the official privacy policy ("Privacy Policy") for www.indecisionforever.com, the official website for Comedy Central, a cable television ("Comedy Central Channel") and Internet programming service ("Comedy Central Site," "Site," "we," "us," or "our"). The Comedy Central Channel and this Comedy Central Site are owned by Comedy Partners, a wholly-owned division of MTV Networks ("MTVN"), which is a division of Viacom International Inc. (collectively, "Parent Companies"). This Privacy Policy governs only the personally identifiable information ("Personal Information") collected by this Site and does not cover any such information collected in any other manner or for any other purpose, any other MTVN programming channel, MTVN's "Jobhunt" website, by the Parent Companies, corporate affiliates, or any other company, unless specifically stated.<br>
<br><br></p><p><strong>Overview: This Privacy Policy is intended to explain our privacy practices and inform you as to: </strong>
</p><ul>
<li>The kinds of Personal Information we collect from users of the Site and how that information is collected;</li> 
<li>How we use your Personal Information; </li>
<li>The circumstances under which we disclose Personal Information to third parties; </li>
<li>How you can access, update or delete any Personal Information collected about you by us; and</li>
<li>The mechanisms we have implemented to protect your Personal Information.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<br><br><p>This Site is offered and made available only to users 18 years of age or older who reside in the United States of America, it territories and possessions ("U.S"). <strong>If you are not yet 18 years old, or do not reside in the U.S., please discontinue using the Site immediately, or if, for any reason, you do not agree with this Privacy Policy, please do not participate in the features, activities and services that require you to provide your Personal Information.</strong> This Privacy Policy is a part of the terms and conditions which are set forth in our <a href="/terms.jhtml"><u>Terms of Use Agreement</u></a>. Both the Privacy Policy and Terms of Use Agreement are legally binding on all users. We reserve the right to revise this Privacy Policy at any time by updating this posting without advance notice to you. Such revisions shall be effective to you immediately upon posting. Notice of material changes to either document will be posted on the Site's homepage. However, we encourage you to check this Privacy Policy and Terms of Use Agreement often for updates. We may also e-mail you about these changes.<br></p>
<br><br><p>We are committed to protecting our users' privacy. Keeping the Personal Information you share with us on the Site secure and ensuring your understanding of how we collect, use, disclose and maintain your Personal Information is important to us. We maintain reasonable physical, electronic and procedural safeguards to protect your information and while no data transmission over the Internet is 100% secure from intrusion, we have used and will continue to use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure the protection of your Personal Information. <br></p>

<br>

<span class="centralTitle"><u>YOUR CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS</u><p></p> 
<br><br><p>Residents of the State of California, under a new provision of the California Civil Code, have the right to request from companies conducting business in California a list of all third parties to which the company has disclosed Personal Information during the preceding year for direct marketing purposes. Alternatively, the law provides that if the company has a privacy policy that gives either an Opt-out or Opt-in choice for use of your Personal Information by third parties (such as advertisers or affiliated companies) for marketing purposes, the company may instead provide you with information on how to exercise your disclosure choice options. <br></p>
<br><br><p>www.indecisionforever.com qualifies for the alternative option; it has a comprehensive privacy policy and provides you with details on how you may either Opt-out or Opt-in to the use of your Personal Information by third parties for direct marketing purposes. Therefore, we are not required to maintain or disclose a list of the third parties that received your Personal Information for marketing purposes during the preceding year. <br></p>
<br><br><p>If you are a California resident and request information about how to exercise your third party disclosure choices you must send a request to the following address with a preference on how our response to your request should be sent (email or postal mail). Send an email to the Privacy Administrator at <a href="mailto: privacy@comedycentral.com"><u>privacy@comedycentral.com</u></a>, or you may contact us via postal mail at: <br></p>

<br><span class="centralTitle">Wireless Marketing Services and Promotional Opportunities (When Available).<p></p><br>

<br><br><p>Comedy Central may, in the future, provide its valued website users and viewers with the opportunity to register for special promotions, services, news, programming and information delivered via text messaging and other wireless devices such as mobile phones. Once available, users will be required to provide their consent to receive such information from Comedy Central, either by registering on this Site or via their wireless device. Such services and promotional opportunities are provided by MTVN affiliates for Comedy Central. The information requested as part of the online registration process is a user's telephone number or a wireless email address, but only if specifically requested, and the carrier's name. Optional information may be requested for specific promotions, such as a user's preferences regarding goods or services, choices of music or artists, or other similar survey information. Depending on the promotion, we may also collect an Internet email address or other information and, depending on the information collected, the user may also be required to confirm his or her agreement to the Comedy Central Site's Privacy Policy and Terms of Use Agreement.<br></p> 
<br><br><p>We caution that most wireless transmissions are not secured and there is a greater risk of an unknown third party's interception of messages or a user's Personal Information when using a wireless communications device.<br></p> 
<br><br><p>Users that register for Comedy Central's wireless marketing services acknowledge, understand and agree that they will be charged by the user's wireless carrier for all messages sent to the user from Comedy Central. Standard messaging rates will apply, unless noted otherwise. <strong>Under no circumstances will Comedy Central, its Parent Companies, or their corporate affiliates be responsible for any wireless email or text messaging charges incurred by a user or by a person that has access to a user's wireless device, telephone number, or email address.</strong> 
</p><p><strong>a. Registration</strong>It is contemplated that there will be two registration methods provided for Comedy Central's wireless marketing services. Standard rate promotions will be subject to either the "single opt-in" or the "double-opt-in (Site/SMS)" method, at the discretion of Comedy Central depending on the type of promotion. Premium rate services will require the "double opt-in" (Site/SMS or SMS/SMS) method.
</p><ol><li><strong>Single Opt-in Method:</strong> In response to a print, radio, television, Internet, or other promotional message, users will be directed to send a specific word or code via a text message to a designated telephone number to register for the service promoted. The user's voluntary submission of the designated word or code to Comedy Central will mean that the user has freely and affirmatively granted permission to Comedy Central to send text messages to him or her. Comedy Central will thank the user for his or her registration by sending a "Thank you" message. The user may terminate the service at any time by using the unsubscribe command in any text message from Comedy Central or by sending a text message to Comedy Central that says "STOP", "END", "CANCEL", "REMOVE", "UNSUBSCRIBE" or "QUIT". </li>
<li><strong>Double Opt-in (Site/SMS) Method:</strong> In response to a print, radio, television, Internet, or other promotional message, users will be directed to this Site to start the registration process. The user must affirmatively consent to Comedy Central's sending of wireless messages to his or her designated wireless device by submitting a telephone number (or wireless email address, only if requested by Comedy Central) and by clicking the consent statement on the Comedy Central Site's registration page. The user must also agree to the Comedy Central Site's Privacy Policy and Terms of Use Agreement before the online registration process is completed. Comedy Central will then send a "Confirmation" message to the user's designated wireless device and will request that the user confirm that he or she has agreed to receive messages from Comedy Central to that particular telephone number (or wireless domain name when appropriate). The user must respond to the "Confirmation" message with a text message that states "YES" or "Y" that will indicate the user's acceptance of Comedy Central's wireless marketing service. Until the user responds to the "Confirmation" message, the user is not registered for the specific wireless marketing service subject to the promotion. A user may respond to the "Confirmation" message at any time provided that Comedy Central may choose to terminate offering wireless marketing service at any time and the user's response to the "Confirmation" is only valid if the response is received while Comedy Central continues to offer the specific wireless marketing service.</li>
<li><strong>Double Opt-in (SMS/SMS) Method:</strong> In response to a print, radio, television, Internet, or other promotional message, users will be directed to send a specific word or code via a text message to a designated telephone number to register for the service promoted. Comedy Central will then send a "Confirmation" message to the user's designated wireless device and will request that the user confirm that he or she has agreed to receive messages from Comedy Central to that particular telephone number (or wireless domain name when appropriate). The user must respond to the "Confirmation" message with a text message that states "YES" or "Y" that will indicate the user's acceptance of Comedy Central's wireless marketing service. Until the user responds to the "Confirmation" message, the user is not registered for the specific wireless marketing service subject to the promotion. A user may respond to the "Confirmation" message at any time provided that Comedy Central may choose to terminate offering wireless marketing service at any time and the user's response to the "Confirmation" is only valid if the response is received while Comedy Central continues to offer the specific wireless marketing service. </li>
</ol>
<p></p>
<p><strong>b. Termination of Wireless Services by User</strong> Regardless of which one of the above opt-in methods was used to register, users may revoke their consent to receive messages from Comedy Central by the following procedure: </p>
<p>A user may cancel one or more services via his or her wireless device at any time by using the unsubscribe mechanism provided by Comedy Central at the time the message is sent, or by sending a text message that says "STOP", "END", "CANCEL", "REMOVE", "UNSUBSCRIBE" or "QUIT". Comedy Central will terminate the user's registration for the most recent wireless service sent to the user. Any of these words followed by the word "ALL" in the user's termination request will cancel all of the user's registered wireless services with Comedy Central. If the user unsubscribes from one or all of Comedy Central service(s) via his or her wireless device, the service(s) will be terminated immediately and will cancel the user's previous opt-in.</p>
<p><strong>c. Termination of Wireless Services by COMEDY CENTRAL </strong>A user understands, acknowledges and agrees that Comedy Central may, at its sole discretion and without liability to any user, terminate its offer of any specific wireless marketing service or all wireless marketing services at any time without advance notice. Comedy Central may provide notice of terminations or changes in services on this Site.</p>
<p><strong>d. Use of Information </strong>Comedy Central will not use a wireless telephone number, wireless or conventional Internet email address, or other information submitted for its wireless marketing services for any other purpose but to provide the service requested, unless we provide advance notice of any other use. We will not share this Personal Information with Advertisers or other third party marketers unless you opt-in to such disclosure. We will share this information with the operational service providers that assist us in delivering these wireless services to you and with corporate affiliates related to Comedy Central and MTVN. </p>
