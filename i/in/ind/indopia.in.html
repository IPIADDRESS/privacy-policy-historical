			<p align="left">The Learning Network is a free service for parents, teachers  and students, and does not require registration. The Student Connections  section is specifically directed at students, grades 6 to 12; within this  section, the Ask Indiareport.com allows students to send a question to Indiareport.com  providing their first name, grade, school and state/country and optionally their  e-mail address. The information requested on these pages is used solely for  participation in these activities, and is not shared or sold to third parties.  Access to the above services is not conditioned on more information than is  reasonably necessary to provide the services. Because we're concerned about a  Parent's right to consent to the collection and use of their child's personal  information, when a question is published, only the student's first name,  grade, and state/country appear on the site. To request removal of this  information (non-personally identifiable) or to review or remove the optional  e-mail address (personal information collected), please use this form to  contact the Learning Network. </p>
