            <p class="MsoNormal"><b><span>Privacy Policy</span></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b><span>1. Introduction and General Terms</span></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>Indiemoviesonline.com, Inc. ("IMO") recognizes that its customers, visitors, Members, and others who use <a href="http://www.indiemoviesonline.com" title="www.indiemoviesonline.com">www.indiemoviesonline.com</a> (the "IMO Site") (collectively or individually "Members") value their privacy. This Privacy Notice details important information regarding the use and disclosure of User information collected on the IMO Site. IMO provides this Privacy Notice to help you make an informed decision about whether to use or continue using the IMO Site. This Privacy Notice is incorporated into and is subject to the IMO Terms of Use. Your use of the IMO Site and any personal information you provide on the IMO Site remains subject to the terms of this Privacy Notice and our Terms of Use.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>By visiting the IMO Site (whether or not you are a registered member) or using any of the IMO Services on any of the Sites, you are accepting this Privacy Policy. If you do not want information about you to be used in the manner set forth in this Privacy Policy, please do not use the IMO Services.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b><span>2) The Information IMO Collects</span></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>(i) Account Information: </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>When you register, we may ask for information such as your name, email address, birth date &amp; gender. From time to time, we<span>&nbsp; </span>may also ask you optionally to provide other information. If you choose to provide such information, you are giving IMO the permission to use and store it consistent with this policy. Therefore, please understand when you sign in to the IMO site, you are not anonymous to us.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>Account Information is used:</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span><span>-<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>to personalize communications to you and identify you in our system.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span><span>-<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>for identity verification</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span><span>-<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>emailing of system messages, personal IMO messages, IMO newsletters, special offers and other IMO communications.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span><span>-<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span><span>&nbsp;</span>to determine whether you are of legal age to view mature content.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>(ii) Profile</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>Your supplied gender, age and chosen username will be displayed as part of your public profile, you may however, also elect to provide more information about yourself in your profile. IMO does not require you to fill out the extra fields on your profile in order to participate in the service or community.<span>&nbsp; </span>IMO makes no claims about the privacy of publicly available profile information.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>(iii) Cookies, log files and clear GIF information</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>When you visit the IMO Site, we may send one or more cookies - a small text file containing a string of alphanumeric characters - to your computer that uniquely identifies your browser. IMO uses both session cookies and persistent cookies. A persistent cookie remains after you close your browser. Persistent cookies may be used by your browser on subsequent visits to the site. Persistent cookies can be removed by following your web browser help file directions. A session cookie is temporary and disappears after you close your browser. You can reset your web browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some features of the IMO Site may not function properly if the ability to accept cookies is disabled. We do not link the information we store in cookies to any personally identifiable information you submit while on our site.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>When you use the IMO Site, our servers automatically record certain information that your web browser sends whenever you visit any website. These server logs may include information such as your web request, Internet Protocol ("IP") address, browser type, browser language, referring / exit pages and URLs, platform type, number of clicks, domain names, landing pages, pages viewed and the order of those pages, the amount of time spent on particular pages, the date and time of your request, and one or more cookies that may uniquely identify your browser.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>When you use the IMO Site, we may employ "clear GIFs" (a.k.a. Web Beacons) which are used to track the online usage patterns of our Members anonymously (i.e., in a non-personally-identifiable manner). In addition, we may also use clear GIFs in HTML-based emails sent to our Members to track which emails are opened by recipients.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>The cookies, log files and clear GIF information is used to:</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span><span>-<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>remember information so that you will not have to re-enter it during your visit or the next time you visit the IMO Site;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span><span>-<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>provide custom, personalized content and information;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span><span>-<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>monitor the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span><span>-<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>monitor aggregate metrics such as total number of visitors, pages viewed, etc.; </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span><span>-<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span><span>&nbsp;</span>track your entries, submissions, and status in promotions and contests;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span><span>-<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>determine where you are accessing the IMO site from geographically and which services are therefore available.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>(iv) Surveys and polls:</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>IMO values opinions and comments from members, so we may conduct online surveys. Participation in these surveys is entirely optional. Typically, the information is aggregated and used to make improvements to IMO and to develop appealing content, features and promotions for members. Survey participants are anonymous unless otherwise stated in the survey.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>(v) Forums, comments and private messaging</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>Any personally identifiable information you submit through the forums and comments system can be read, collected, or used by other users of these forums, and could be used to send you unsolicited messages.<span>&nbsp; </span>We are not responsible for the personally identifiable information you choose to submit in these forums or by private message to other users.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>(vi) Combined information</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>We use both your personally identifiable information and certain non-personally-identifiable information (such as anonymous User usage data, cookies, IP addresses, browser type, clickstream data, etc.) to improve the quality and design of the IMO Site and to create new features, promotions, functionality, and services by storing, tracking, and analyzing User preferences and trends</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>(vii) Anonymous aggregated data</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>Anonymous data is information (originally personally identifiable or non-personally identifiable) that subsequently is used in aggregate form. We may use anonymous data for purposes of research or analysis. We may conduct research on our customer demographics, internet usage, and interests and behavior based on personal data we gather. Although anonymous data may be based in part on personal data, it does not identify you personally. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>(viii) Film viewing history</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>IMO stores information about which films you watch in streaming flash format. The list of films is also posted to your public profile.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>This information is used to:</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span><span>-<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>improve the site experience.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span><span>-<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>allow friends to recommend movies to each other.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span><span>-<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>track film watches so we can return royalties to the film distributors. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>

Similarly, we may share your personally identifiable information with other people or entities in order to provide goods or services that you have requested or to complete a transaction at your request.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>(iv) Legal requirements and IMO protection</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span>The IMO Services may be linked to websites operated by other companies. Some of these websites may be co-branded with our name or logo, even though they are not operated or maintained by us. IMO is not responsible for the privacy practices of other websites operated by third parties that are linked to any of the Sites. Once you have left the IMO Site by clicking on a link, you should check the privacy policy of the other website to determine how it handles any personally identifiable information they collect from you.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span>Some of the advertisements that appear in connection with the IMO Services may be delivered to you by internet advertising companies (also called "ad networks" or "network advertisers"). These companies may use cookies and other technologies to deliver advertisements to you, measure their effectiveness, and personalize advertising content. IMO does not have access to or control over cookies or other technologies that they may use. The information practices of these advertising companies are governed by their own privacy policies and are not covered by this Privacy Policy.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b><span>6) Data Security</span></b><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>(i) Safeguards</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>IMO uses commercially reasonable physical, managerial, and technical safeguards to preserve the integrity and security of your personal information. We cannot, however, ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to IMO and you do so at your own risk. Once we receive your transmission of information, IMO makes commercially reasonable efforts to ensure the security of our systems. However, please note that this is not a guarantee that such information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b><span>7) International Members</span></b></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b><span>8) Business Transitions</span></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>In the event IMO goes through a business transition, such as a merger, acquisition by another company, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, your personally identifiable information will likely be among the assets transferred.<span>&nbsp; </span>You will be notified via email or prominent notice on our Web site for 30 days of any such change in ownership or control of your personal information. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b><span>9) How long will IMO keep my personal information?</span></b></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><b><span>10) Changes to IMO's Privacy Policy</span></b></p>
