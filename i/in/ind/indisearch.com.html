<p><strong>Privacy Policy Overview:</strong></p>
      <p>This Privacy Policy covers the indisearch.com treatment of personal information 
        that is recorded when you submit your site for inclusion in our database. 
        <br>
        Our privacy policy does not apply to the practices of other companies 
        advertised, or otherwise listed, on the indisearch.com web site, nor does it 
        extend to people that indisearch.com does not employ or manage.please note 
        that this policy applies only to indisearch.com,and not to other companies' 
        or organizations' Web sites to which we link. We have clearly marked indisearch.com 
        and these branded Web sites with our logo so you know where this policy 
        applies.</p>
      <p><strong>Information Collection and Use:</strong> </p>
      <p>In general, our service automatically gathers certain usage information 
        like the numbers and frequency of visitors to indisearch.com.com and its areas, 
        very much like television ratings that tell the networks how many people 
        tuned in to a program. We only use such data in the aggregate. This collective 
        data helps us determine how much our customers use parts of the site, 
        so we can improve our site to assure that it is as appealing as we can 
        make it for as many of you as possible. For example, indisearch.com may use 
        a technology nicknamed "cookies" that tells us how and when pages in our 
        site are visited, and by how many people. indisearch.com cookies do not collect 
        personally identifiable information and we do not combine information 
        collected through cookies with other personally identifiable information 
        to tell us who you are or even what your screen name or e-mail address 
        is. We also may provide statistical "ratings" information, never information 
        about you personally, to our indisearch.com partners about how our "members", 
        collectively, use indisearch.com. We do this so they too can understand how 
        much people use their areas and our site in order for them to provide 
        you with the best possible Web experience as well. </p>
      <p>We use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server, and 
        to administer our Web site. Your IP address is used to help identify you 
        and your site and to gather broad demographic information, as well as 
        to protect against fraud. We track IP addresses in forms for this reason.</p>
      <p>Our site's registration form requires users to give us only site address 
        (URL) and valid e-mail address. We use customer information from the registration 
        form to send the user information about our company and promotional material 
        in the form of newsletter or website ads. We may share our client's private 
        information with our partners or any advertisers.</p>
      <p>Your use of indisearch.com services ( listing of your web site or sites) constitutes 
        a business relationship wherein we provide a promotion service for your 
        web site(s). In exchange, indisearch.com reserves the right to use the contact 
        information collected during site submission to deliver notices regarding 
        changes or updates to our service, to provide free sample newsletters, 
        to inform you of additions to the Network of web sites, or to send announcements 
        and carefully screened offers and information from our partners. </p>
      <p>With the exception of auto-response messages which are sent at the time 
        of site submission and which contain important confirmation details regarding 
        your site listing, you may remove yourself from any or all other notice 
        and announcement mailings at anytime using the unsubscribe methods provided 
        in those mailings. Any mailing received from our company is clearly identified 
        and includes method to remove yourself from future mailings. Should you 
        encounter problems in this regard, contact <a href="mailto:support@indisearch.com">support@indisearch.com</a>. 
        Our turnaround time for responding to unsubscribe requests is generally 
        48 hours. </p>
      <p><strong>Information Sharing and Disclosure:</strong> </p>
      <p>indisearch.com maintains your email address and other information, provided 
        at the time of your site submission, on the premises. indisearch.com allows 
        carefully screened vendors the opportunity to send you offers and information 
        that we have deemed may be of value to you. You may opt-in out of this 
        feature at any time. </p>
      <p><strong>Security:</strong></p>
      <p>indisearch.com has security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse 
        and alteration of the information under our control. Access is restricted 
        to indisearch.com staff.</p>

      <p>indisearch.com may amend this policy from time to time. If significant changes 
        are made in the way your personal information is used, we will post a
