<p><a name="2"><strong>2</strong></a><strong>. What Information we collect</strong></p>
<p>The information collected on our Site(s) generally falls into the following two categories: Personally Identifiable Information and Non-Personally Identifiable Information.</p>

<p><u>Non-Personally Identifiable Information</u>: This refers to information that does not by itself identify a specific individual. The non-personally identifiable data we collect when you visit our Site(s) may include the Uniform Resource Locator (URL1) of the pages you visit on our Site(s) and our Internet Protocol (IP2) address. This Statement also contains more information about how we use cookies and other technology to collect this data.</p>
<p>We do not connect the Personally Identifiable Information and Non-Personally Identifiable Information we collect on our Site(s).</p>
<p><a name="3"><strong>3</strong></a><strong>. Why we collect your information</strong></p>
<p>Our primary goals in collecting information are:</p>
<ul>
<li>to provide constituents with superior service, and 
</li><li>to provide all visitors a smooth, efficient, and personalized experience while using our Site.</li></ul>
<p>We use your Personally Identifiable information to process your request or provide the requested information. We use Non-Personally Identifiable Information on an aggregated basis to help us understand how visitors use our Site(s) and to measure interest in the various pages. We use this information to improve the content of our Site(s) and to make our Site(s) easier to use.</p>
<p><a name="4"><strong>4</strong></a><strong>. How We Use Your Information</strong></p>
<p>We gather and use information in a number of ways, including the following:</p>
<p><u>Surfing</u>: We collect certain Non-Personally Identifiable Information when you visit our Site.

Learn more about how we use cookies and other technology to collect this information.</p>

<p><a name="5"><strong>5</strong></a><strong>. Sharing your information</strong></p>
<p>Indygov.org will not rent, sell or give away any Personally Identifiable Information entered into the website to third parties for marketing or mailing list purposes. However, Your Personally Identifiable Information may be shared as required: by the Indiana Public Records Act, for a third party to process the request, and otherwise by law.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ai.org/legislative/ic/code/title5/ar14/ch3.html">Indiana Public Records Act</a>: We are required to maintain many documents under the Indiana Access to Public Records Act, but we do not collect personal information for any purpose other than to respond to you or for other purposes required by law.</p>
<p>All information collected or submitted may be subject to disclosure pursuant to the Indiana Access to Public Records Act. In accordance with Indiana public record statutes, we may be required to disclose the information you submit. If you use one of our online forms, the information you provide is up to you. If you do not provide your name or other information, it may be impossible for us to refer, respond to, or investigate your complaint or request.</p>

<p><u>Third Party Processing</u>: Indygov.org will send Personally Identifiable Information about you to other companies, agencies, or people when:</p>
<ul>
<li>We need to share your information to provide the product or service you have requested. For example, we might use a third party billing company, and we send information for billing purposes only; and 
</li><li>We need to send the information to companies who work on behalf of Indygov.org to provide a product or service to you. Unless we tell you differently, these companies do not have any right to use the personally identifiable information we provide to them beyond what is necessary to assist us. CivicNet is an example of a "third party" in this context.</li></ul>

<p><a name="7"><strong>7</strong></a><strong>. Use of Cookies On This Site</strong></p>
<p>A "cookie" is a small data file transferred by a website to your computer's hard drive. You are sent cookies when you surf Indygov.org, make on-line payments, respond to online surveys, or request information. Accepting Indygov.org cookies does not give us access to your Personally Identifiable Information, but we can use the cookies to identify your computer. The aggregate information collected permits us to analyze traffic patterns on our Site(s). This can enable us over time to provide you with a better experience on our Site(s) by improving the content and making it easier to use.</p>
<p>Most browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually refuse cookies, or selectively accept certain cookies, by adjusting the preferences in your browser. If you turn off cookies, though, there may be some features of our Site(s) that will not be available to you and some Web pages may not display properly. You can find information on popular browsers and how you can adjust them to control cookies at the following Web sites:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><i>Microsoft Internet Explorer: <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/info/cookies.htm">http://www.microsoft.com/info/cookies.htm</a><br>Netscape Navigator: </i><a href="http://www.netscape.com/legal_notices/cookies.html"><i>http://www.netscape.com/legal_notices/cookies.html</i></a></p></blockquote>
<p><a name="8"><strong>8</strong></a><strong>. Protecting Your Information</strong></p>
<p>The City of Indianapolis and Marion County acknowledge your trust and is committed to protecting the information you provide us. To prevent unauthorized access, maintain accuracy, and ensure proper use of information, we have employed physical, electronic, and managerial processes to safeguard and secure the information we collect online.</p>
<p>When you complete on-line transactions on our Site, we use Secure Sockets Layer ("SSL") encryption technology to safeguard your sensitive information while it is being sent to us. The SSL encryption is designed to make the information unreadable by anyone but us. This security measure is working when you see either the symbol of an unbroken key or closed lock (depending on your browser) on the bottom of your browser window.</p>
<p><a name="9"><strong>9</strong></a><strong>. Links to Other Web Sites</strong></p>
<p>Parts of our Site(s) contain links to third-party websites for your convenience and information. If you use these links, you will leave the Indygov.org website. When you access a non-Indygov.org website, even one that may contain the Indygov.org logo (such as CivicNet.net), please understand that we do not control the content and are not responsible for the privacy practices of that site. We suggest that you carefully review the privacy policies of each site you visit. This Privacy Statement does not cover the information practices of those websites linked to our Site. These other sites may send their own cookies to users, collect data, or solicit personal information.</p>
<p><a name="10"><strong>10</strong></a><strong>. Children's Privacy Protection</strong></p>

<p>Notes:&nbsp;<br><sup>1</sup> A URL is the global address of documents and other resources on the World Wide Web. For example, <a href="/">http://www.Indygov.org</a> is the URL for the City of Indianapolis and Marion County's home page.&nbsp;<br><sup>2</sup> An IP address is an identifier for a computer or device on a Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol ("TCP/IP") network, such as the World Wide Web. Networks use the TCP/IP protocol to route information based on the IP address of the destination. In other words, an IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you are surfing the Web, allowing Web servers to locate and identify your computer. Computers require IP addresses in order for users to communicate on the Internet, browse and shop.</p>
