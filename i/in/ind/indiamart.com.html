    <blockquote><font size="-1" face="arial">IndiaMART InterMESH Ltd
      {hereinafter referred to as “IndiaMART ”} is committed to
      safeguarding your privacy online. Please read the following policy to
      understand how your personal information will be treated as you make full
      use of our many offerings. The policy may change from time to time so
      please check periodically.<br>
       <br> 1. <strong>Personal Information</strong><br>
       <br> During registration, IndiaMART asks for your name and email address. Once
      you register you are no longer anonymous to IndiaMART and you are able to
      take full advantage of IndiaMART’s offerings. Wherever IndiaMART
      collects personal information, we make an effort to include a link to this
      Privacy Policy on that page.<br>
       <br> 2. <strong>Use of Personal Information</strong><br>
       <br> IndiaMART’s primary goal in collecting personal information is to
      provide you, the user, with a customized experience on our network of
      sites. This includes personalization services, interactive communications
      and many other types of services, most of which are completely free to
      you. In order to provide services free of charge, we display
      advertisements. By knowing a little about you, IndiaMART is able to
      deliver more relevant advertisements and content, and hence better
      service, to you. <br><br>
       3. <strong>Collection of information by IndiaMART</strong><br>
       <br> When you are on a IndiaMART site and are asked for personal information,
      you are sharing that information with IndiaMART alone, unless it is
      specifically stated otherwise. If data is being collected and/or
      maintained by any company other than IndiaMART, you will be notified prior
      to the time of the data collection or transfer by not using that
      particular service.<br>
       <br> Promotions that run on IndiaMART may be sponsored by companies other than
      IndiaMART or may be co-sponsored by IndiaMART and another company. Some or
      all date collected during a promotion may be shared with the sponsor. If
      data will be shared, you will be notified prior to the time of data
      collection or transfer. You can decide not to participate in the promotion
      if you don’t want your data to be shared.<br>
       <br> Please be aware that IndiaMART advertisers or websites that have links on
      our site may collect personally identifiable information about you. This
      privacy statement does not cover the information practices of those web
      sites linked to IndiaMART.<br>
       <br> 4. <strong>Sharing of Information<br>
      </strong><br>
       As a general rule, IndiaMART will not disclose or share any of your
      personally identifiable information except when IndiaMART has your
      permission or under special circumstances, such as when IndiaMART believes
      in good faith that the law requires it or as permitted in terms of this
      policy.<br>
       <br> From time to time, you may be offered the opportunity to receive
      materials or special offers from third parties. If you opt in to receive
      information from these third parties, IndiaMART will, with your
      permission, share your name and email address with them.<br>
       <br> IndiaMART may also disclose account information in special cases when
      IndiaMART has reasons to believe that disclosing this information is
      necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who
      may be violating IndiaMART Terms of Services or may be causing injury to
      or interference with (either intentionally or unintentionally) IndiaMART’s
      rights or property, other IndiaMART users, or if IndiaMART deems it
      necessary to maintain, service, and improve its products and services.<br>
       <br> 5. <strong>Distribution of Information</strong><br>
       <br> IndiaMART may, from time to time, send you email regarding our products
      and services. In addition, if you indicate upon registration that you are
      interested in receiving offers or information from IndiaMART and its
      partners, IndiaMART may occasionally send you direct mail about products
      and services that it feels may be of interest to you. Only IndiaMART or
      agents working on behalf of IndiaMART and under confidentiality
      agreements, will send you these direct mailings and only if you indicate
      that you do not object to these offers. If you do not want to receive such
      mailing, simply tell IndiaMART when you give your personal information or,
      at any time you can easily edit your IndiaMART Account information to no
      longer receive such offers and mailings.<br>
       <br> 6. <strong>Updation of personal information</strong><br>
       <br> You may edit your IndiaMART Account Information and your IndiaMART
      profile by sending a request to <a href="mailto:support@indiamart.com">support@indiamart.com</a>.<br>
       <br> Your IndiaMART account can be deleted or deactivated, but doing so will
      result in not being able to access any members-only area of the IndiaMART
      network, including your IndiaMART Mail account (if you have one). Residual
      information will remain within our archive records.<br>
       <br> 7. <strong>Protection of information</strong><br>
       <br> As with all information, IndiaMART will never rent or sell your personal,
      financial or other information, including information kept in your
      IndiaMART Portfolio. Any user statistics that we may provide to
      prospective advertisers or partners regarding financial, product or
      service usage on IndiaMART are provided in the aggregate form only and
      does not include any personally identifiable information about any
      individual user.<br>
       <br>Please remember to sign out of your IndiaMART account and close your
      browser window when you have finished your work. This to ensure that
      others cannot access your personal information and correspondence if you
      share a computer with someone else or are using a computer in a public
      place. Whenever IndiaMART handles personal information as described above
      regardless of where this occurs, IndiaMART takes steps to ensure that your
      information is treated securely and in accordance with the relevant Terms
      of Services and this Privacy Policy.<br>
       <br> Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed
      to be 100% secure. As a result, while IndiaMART strives to protect your
      personal information, IndiaMART cannot ensure or warrant the security of
      any information you transmit to IndiaMART and you do so at your own risk.
      Once IndiaMART receives your transmission, it makes best efforts to ensure
      its security on its systems. Please keep in mind that whenever you
      voluntarily disclose personal information online-for example on message
      boards or through email -that information can be collected and used by
      others. In short, if you post personal information online that is
      accessible to the public, you may receive unsolicited messages from other
      parties in return.<br>
