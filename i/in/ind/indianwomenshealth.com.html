                          We may use third parties                            that we refer to as internal service providers to facilitate                            or outsource one or more aspects of the business, product                            and service operations that we provide to you on the                            Site (e.g., search technology, discussion boards, bill                            collection, affiliate and rewards programs, co-branded                            credit cards) and therefore we may provide some of your                            personal information directly to these internal service                            providers. These internal service providers' are subject                            to confidentiality agreements with us and other legal                            restrictions that prohibit their use of the information                            we provide them for any other purpose except to facilitate                            the specific outsourced Site related operation, unless                            you have explicitly agreed or given your prior permission                            to them for additional uses. In some instances, the                            internal service provider may collect information directly                            from you (such as for Site surveys or for a co-branded                            credit card). In these cases, you will be notified of                            the involvement of the internal service provider, and                            all additional information you provide them and their                            additional uses will be strictly up to you. If you provide                            additional information to an internal service provider                            directly, then their use of your personal information                            is governed by their applicable privacy policy. <br>

                          We share much of our data, including                            personal information about you, with our parent, affiliates,                            subsidiaries, and joint ventures that are committed                            to serving your online needs and related services, throughout                            the world. To the extent that these entities have access                            to your information, they will treat it at least as                            protectively as they treat information they obtain from                            their other users. Our parent, affiliates, subsidiaries,                            and joint ventures follow privacy practices no less                            protective of all users than our practices described                            in this document, to the extent allowed by applicable                            law. The Site, its sponsirs, affiliates, subsidiaries,                            its joint ventures, or any combination of such, will                            share some or all of your personal information with                            another business entity should we plan to, merge with,                            or be acquired by that business entity. Should such                            a combination occur, we will require that the new combined                            entity follow this privacy policy with respect to your                            personal information. <br>

                          <span class="heading-2"> 5. Legal Requests</span> <br>
                          
                          We cooperate                            with law enforcement inquiries, as well as other third                            parties to enforce laws, such as: intellectual property                            rights, fraud and other rights, to help protect you                            and the community from bad actors. Therefore, in response                            to a verified request by law enforcement or other government                            officials relating to a criminal investigation or alleged                            illegal activity, we can (and you authorize us to) disclose                            your name, city, state, telephone number, email address,                            UserID history, fraud complaints, listing history without                            a subpoena. Without limiting the above, in an effort                            to respect your privacy and our ability to keep the                            community free from bad actors, we will not otherwise                            disclose your personal information to law enforcement                            or other government officials without a subpoena, court                            order or substantially similar legal procedure, except                            when we believe in good faith that the disclosure of                            information is necessary to prevent imminent physical                            harm or financial loss; or report suspected illegal                            activity. Further, we can (and you authorize us to)                            disclose your name, street address, city, state, zip                            code, country, phone number, email, and company name                            to Intellectual Property right's owners under confidentiality                            agreement, as we in our sole discretion believe necessary                            or appropriate in connection with an investigation of                            fraud, intellectual property infringement, piracy or                            other unlawful activity. <br>
                          <br>
                          Due to the existing regulatory                            environment, we cannot ensure that all of your private                            communications and other personal information will never                            be disclosed in ways not otherwise described in this                            Privacy Policy. By way of example (without limiting                            the foregoing), we may be forced to disclose personal                            information to the government or third parties under                            certain circumstances, third parties may unlawfully                            intercept or access transmissions or private communications,                            or users may abuse or misuse your personal information                            that they collect from the Site. Therefore, although                            we use industry standard practices to protect your privacy,                            we do not promise, and you should not expect, that your                            personal information or private communications will                            always remain private. <br>
