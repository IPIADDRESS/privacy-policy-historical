This statement  discloses the privacy practices for India Today Group Digital, located  at <a href="http://www.intoday.in." target="_blank"> www.intoday.in.</a></p>
            <p>Questions regarding this statement should be directed to India Today Group Online at <a href="mailto:itgo@intoday.com" target="_blank">itgo@intoday.com</a> or by contacting India Today Group Online, A-61, Sector 57, Noida - 201 301 or by calling our main number at (91) 0120-4078000.</p>
            <p align="justify">The  information gathered by India Today Group Digital falls into two  categories: (1) information voluntarily supplied by visitors to our  websites through optional registration and (2) tracking information  gathered as visitors navigate through our sites.</p>
            <p align="justify">To  make use of certain features on our websites, visitors must provide  certain information as part of the registration process. (We may ask,  for example, for your name, email address, sex, age, and PIN code, and  we might request information on your occupation, interests, and the  like.) The information you supply will help us to make <a href="http://www.intoday.in" target="_blank">www.intoday.in</a> a better website by allowing us to tailor our site to your interests  and make it more useful to you. Supplying such information is entirely  voluntary. In some instances, which involve, for example,  subscriptions, you may need to provide all the information before the  subscription can reach you. We can't deliver your magazines or notify  you that you've been lucky enough to win a prize in a promotional  contest if we don't know how to contact you. Of course, even if you  want to remain completely anonymous, you are still free to take  advantage of the wealth of content available on our site without  providing any personal information.</p>
            <p align="justify">To  help make our websites more responsive to the needs of our visitors, we  invoke a standard feature of browser software, called a "cookie", to  assign each visitor a unique, random number (a sort of user ID) that  resides on your computer. The cookie does not personally identify the  visitor as an individual; rather, cookies merely identify the computer  that a visitor uses to access our sites. Unless you voluntarily  identify yourself (through registration, for example), we will have no  way of knowing who you are, even if we assign a cookie to your  computer. The only personal information a cookie can contain is  information you supply (an example of this is when you ask for our  Personalised Horoscope). A cookie cannot read data off your hard drive.  Our advertisers may also assign their own cookies to your browser (if  you click on their ads), a process that we do not control.</p>
            <p align="justify">We  use cookies to help us tailor our sites to meet your needs, and to  deliver a better service that is keyed to the interests of our  visitors. We use cookies to determine what features our visitors prefer  and which are less popular. We can build a better site if we know which  pages our users are visiting and how often. And we use cookies to avoid  showing you the same ad, repeatedly, during a single visit.</p>
            <p align="justify">If  you do not want the benefit of cookies, there is a simple process to  manually delete your cookies. Please consult your web browser's Help  documentation for more information on this process.</p>
            <p align="justify">Our  web servers automatically collect limited information about your  computer's connection to the Internet, including your IP address, when  you visit our websites. (Your IP address is a number that lets  computers attached to the Internet know where to send you data -- such  as the web pages you view.) Your IP address does not identify you  personally. We use this information to deliver our web pages to you  upon request, to tailor our websites to the interests of our users, to  measure traffic within our websites and let advertisers know the  geographic locations from where our visitors come.</p>
            <p align="justify"><a href="http://www.intoday.in" target="_blank">www.intoday.in</a> includes links to other websites whose privacy policies we do not  control. Once you leave our servers (you can tell where you are by  checking the URL in the location bar on your browser), use of any  information you provide is governed by the privacy policy of the  operator of the site you are visiting. That policy may differ from  ours. If you can't find the privacy policy of any of these sites via a  link from the site's homepage, you should contact the site directly for  more information.</p>
            <p align="justify">When  we present information to our advertisers -- to help them understand  our audience and confirm the value of advertising on our websites -- it  is usually in the form of aggregated statistics on traffic to various  pages within our sites. If you do register with India Today Group  Digital, we may, from time to time, contact you about content and  features that we believe may be of interest to you.</p>
            <p align="justify">All  information gathered by India Today Group Digital is stored securely  within a India Today Group Digital-controlled database. The database is  stored on servers secured behind a firewall; access to the servers is  password-protected and is strictly limited. However, as effective as  our security measures are, no security system is impenetrable. We  cannot guarantee the security of our database, nor can we guarantee  that information you supply will not be intercepted while being  transmitted to us over the Internet. And, of course, any information  you include in a posting to the discussion areas is available to anyone  with Internet access.</p>

			<p align="justify">If you are no longer interested in receiving e-mail announcements and other marketing information from us, or you want us to remove any PII that we have collected about you, please e-mail your request to <a href="mailto:response@bagittoday.com" target="_blank">response@bagittoday.com</a>.</p>

			<p align="justify">We use third-party service providers to serve ads on our behalf across the Internet and sometimes on this site. They may collect anonymous information about your visits to our website, and your interaction with our products and services. They may also use information about your visits to this and other websites to target advertisements for goods and services. This anonymous information is collected through the use of a pixel tag, which is industry standard technology used by most major websites. No personally identifiable information is collected or used in this process. They do not know the name, phone number, address, email address, or any personally identifying information about the user.</p>

			<p align="justify">If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this anonymous information used by our third party service provider, please click <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp" target="_blank">http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp</a>. You can also read more about online marketing practices and the technologies that support them by visiting the Network Advertising Initiative’s website by clicking <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/" target="_blank">http://www.networkadvertising.org/</a>.</p>

            <p align="justify">A  note to end on: The Web is an evolving medium. If we need to change our  privacy policy at some point in the future, we'll post the changes  before they take effect. Of course, our use of any information we  gather will always be consistent with the policy under which the  information was collected, regardless of what the new policy may be.</p>
