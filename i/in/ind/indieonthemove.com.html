<p>
	We may collect and store information that is generated automatically as you use our Services. &nbsp;We use cookies to collect this information.&nbsp; “Cookies” are files that your web browser saves to your computer’s hard drive when you visit a website. These files contain information that allows websites to “remember” user activities on a website and user visits to a site, and may include storage of user preferences, user ID and password, if applicable.

<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	In addition, when you use our Services, our system may automatically collect certain information. For example, when you visit our Site or other portions of our Services, our system may automatically collect information such as your web or content request, your other actions on the Services (e.g., adding a track as a favorite), Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, browser type, browser language, domain names, referring and exit pages and URLs, platform type, number of clicks, landing pages, pages viewed and the order of these page views, the amount of time spent on particular pages, the date and time of your request, and the unique identity of your browser. This information is used to analyze trends, administer our Services, improve the design of our Services, track user movement, customize certain content or features on the Services, and otherwise enhance the services we provide.

We may provide your personal information to third parties for their use in performing internal business functions (e.g., payment processing, data analysis, email transmission, or data hosting) on our behalf. Some third-party service providers may also collect information, including personal information, on our behalf. In our agreements with these third-party service providers, we require them to agree to maintain the confidentiality, security, and integrity of such personal information and to use it only for the purpose of providing their services to us.</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	We will comply with any subpoenas, court orders or other legal processes for any of the information about you in our possession, and we may use such information to establish or exercise our legal rights, or to defend against legal claims. We reserve the right to disclose information about you, including data on which pages you have visited and other information regarding your use of the Services, to third parties if we feel it is necessary to protect our systems, website, business, users or others. In addition, information about you in our possession may be disclosed as part of any merger, acquisition, sale of company assets, or transition of service to another provider, as well as in the unlikely event of insolvency, bankruptcy, or receivership in which your personal information would be transferred as one of the business assets of Indie On The Move LLC. We do not guarantee that any entity receiving such information in connection with one of these transactions will comply with all terms of this policy.</p>
