<b>Privacy Policy</b>
</p><p>
Our site and and its advertisers and affiliates are deeply committed to protecting the privacy of Internet users. Below is information outlining our continued support for the responsible management of consumer information. 
</p>
<p>
<b>Consumer Information</b>
</p>
<p>
While you visit our site we do not collect any personally identifiable information about you such as name, address, phone number, or e-mail address unless you expicitly provide it via a mailing list signup form or in one of the discussion forums (see below). We do obtain some types of non-personally identifiable information such as the Internet Service Provider you use to connect to the Internet, your browser type, or the type of computer operating system you use (Macintosh or Windows, for example). This information is used for the purpose of targeting ads and measuring ad effectiveness on behalf of our advertisers. 
</p><p>
In some cases, you may voluntarily provide personal information in response to a specific request such as a mailing list signup form or to identify you in a discussion forum. In the case of a discussion forum, your name and/or mailing address are visible to all site visitors if you provide them. It's up to your discretion whether this is acceptable to you and whether you'd prefer not to participate in the public forum. In the case of mailing lists, when you sign up for any list we add your email address to an automated list system. The addresses on that list are used only for the specific types of mailings described and will never be revealed to any advertiser or other party -- including to other members of the list. While individual mailings may contain ads, we do not rent, sell, or give away our mailing lists for any reason.
</p><p>
<b>Cookies</b> 
</p><p>
Our site, as well as most sites on the Internet, use "cookies" to enhance your experience on the web. We do not use these cookies to personally identify you in any way. What are cookies and why do we use them? A cookie is a unique piece of information that is provided by your web browser which is stored in a cookie file on your computer. This helps us know your preferences like chat room name and favorite color choice when you return next time. You can still disable cookies on your browser at any time.
</p><p>
<b>Mailing Lists And Opt Out Procedure</b>
</p><p>
If you would like to "opt out," that is, to prevent any personally identifiable data from being stored by us, simply not signing up for any of our voluntary mailing lists or participating in discussion forums is sufficient. If you're already signed up for one of our mailing lists, follow the instructions in any mailing to remove your email address and you won't be contacted again.
</p><p>
<b>Third Party Advertising</b>
</p><p>
We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our Web site. These companies may use information (not including your name, address, email address or telephone number) about your visits to this and other Web sites in order to provide advertisements on this site and other sites about goods and services that may be of interest to you. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies, please contact third party ad networks directly.
