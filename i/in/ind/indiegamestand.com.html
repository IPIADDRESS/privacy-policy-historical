	<p><strong>Effective Date: July 25th, 2012</strong></p>
    <p>Your privacy is important, so IndieGameStand ("IndieGameStand," “The Company,” "we,"  "us," or "our") has created the following Privacy Policy to  let you know what information we collect when you visit the Service, why we  collect it and how it is used. This Privacy Policy explains the data collection  and use practices of the Service; it does not apply to other online or offline Company  sites, products or services. The terms "you," "your," and  "yours" refer to the customer/purchaser utilizing our Service. This  Privacy Policy is governed by our Terms of Use. By using the Service, you  consent to the data practices described in this statement. We may periodically  make changes to this Privacy Policy that we will include on this page. It is  your responsibility to review this Privacy Policy and remain informed about any  changes to it, so we encourage you to visit this page often. Capitalized terms  that are not defined in this Privacy Policy have the meaning given them in our  Terms of Use.</p>
    <p><strong>What Information Is Collected?</strong><br>
  "Personally Identifiable  Information" means any information that may be used to identify an  individual, including, but not limited to, a first and last name, home or other  physical address, an email address, phone number or other contact information,  whether at work or at home. IndieGameStand collects the following Personally  Identifiable Information from you when you use our Service: your email address,  and payment information (credit card and address, PayPal, or Amazon  information). If you correspond with us by email or through the Service, we may  retain the content of your messages, your email address and our responses.</p>
    <p>IndieGameStand also automatically  receives and records information on our server logs from your browser,  including your IP address, cookie information, and the page you request. You  can choose not to provide us with certain information, but then you might not  be able to take advantage of some of our features.</p>
    <p><strong>How Is Such Information Used?</strong><br>
      We use the data that you provide  or we collect to provide you the services offered on our Service. The Company  uses your email address to create an account and organize your game download  page and to notify you of future promotions if you sign-up for our newsletter.</p>
    <p>IndieGameStand uses the data  you enter on the Service, such as the price you enter, to make sure that your  contributions go to the right places. We also may use the site data collected  to produce general and anonymous statistics about consumer behavior.</p>
    <p>We may use certain information  about you internally for purposes such as analyzing how the Service is used,  diagnosing service or technical problems, maintaining security, and  personalizing content.</p>
    <p><strong>Is The Information Shared or Disclosed?</strong><br>
      IndieGameStand does not sell or  share the information it collects hereunder except as described in this Privacy  Policy. Information collected from you is disclosed and used to complete and  support your purchases from and use of our Service and to comply with any  requirements of law. For example, we may disclose information to third party  payment processors. We may also disclose information to third party social  networks at your direction, e.g. when you "tweet" or "like"  something on the Service.</p>
    <p>From time to time, we may run  contests, special offers, or other events or activities ("Events") on  the Service together with a third party partner. If you provide information to  such third parties, you give them permission to use it for the purpose of that  Event and any other use that you approve. We cannot control third parties' use  of your information. If you do not want your information to be collected by or  shared with a third party, you can choose not to participate in these Events.</p>
    <p>IndieGameStand may disclose  personal information if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief  that such action is necessary to: (1) conform to the edicts of the law or  comply with legal process served on IndieGameStand or the Service; (2)  protect and defend the rights or property of IndieGameStand; or (3) act in  urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of IndieGameStand, its web sites or the public. If IndieGameStand or substantially all  of its assets were acquired, or in the unlikely event that IndieGameStand goes  out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information would be one of the  assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that  such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of IndieGameStand may continue  to use your personal information as set forth in this policy.</p>
    <p><strong>Account Security</strong><br>
      To prevent unauthorized access, maintain  data accuracy and ensure the correct use of information, we have put in place  appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and  secure the information we collect online. We DO NOT store any financial  information, credit card, or account numbers. All financial transactions are  protected and processed by the payment providers that we utilize for our  service. We cannot, however, ensure or warrant the security of any  information you transmit to IndieGameStand or guarantee that your information  on the Service may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach  of any of our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards.</p>
    <p><strong>International Transfers</strong><br>
      Personal information collected on  the Service may be stored and processed in the United States or any other  country in which the Company or its affiliates, subsidiaries or agents maintain  facilities, and by using the Service, you consent to any such transfer of  information outside of your country.</p>
    <p><strong>Cookies</strong><br>
      Your Internet browser has the in-built  facility for storing small files "cookies" that hold information which  allows a website to recognize your account. Our website takes advantage of this  facility to enhance your experience. You have the ability to prevent your  computer from accepting cookies but, if you do, certain functionality on the  website may be impaired.</p>
    <p><strong>Children's  Privacy</strong><br>
      Protecting the privacy of the very young is  especially important. For that reason, we never collect or maintain information  at our website from those we actually know are under 13, and no part of our  website is structured to attract anyone under 13. We encourage parents to  instruct their children to never give out personal information when online.</p>
    <p><strong>Choice</strong><br>
      You can access all your personally  identifiable information that we collect online and maintain by logging into  and editing your profile. We use this procedure to better safeguard your  information. You can correct factual errors in your personally identifiable  information by sending us a request that credibly shows error. To protect your  privacy and security, we will also take reasonable steps to verify your  identity before granting access or making corrections.&nbsp; You can contact us if you would like your  account closed. Once we have verified your identity, we can remove all your  personal details and IP on request.</p>
    <p><strong>Links to Other Web Sites</strong><br>
      We are not responsible for the  practices employed by websites linked to or from the Service, nor the  information or content contained therein. Please remember that when you use a  link to go from the Service to another website, our Privacy Policy is no longer  in effect. Your browsing and interaction on any other website, including those  that have a link on our website, is subject to that website's own rules and  policies. Please read over those rules and policies before proceeding.</p>
  <p><strong>Your Consent To This Privacy Policy</strong><br>
      By using this Service, you agree  to this Privacy Policy. This is our entire and exclusive Privacy Policy and it  supersedes any earlier version. Our Terms and Conditions take precedence over  any conflicting Privacy Policy provision. We may change this Privacy Policy by  posting a new version of this Privacy Policy on this Service which it is your  responsibility to review. Your continued use of the Service constitutes your  agreement to this Privacy Policy and any updates.</p>
    <p><strong>Contacting IndieGameStand</strong><br>
      If you have any questions about  this Privacy Policy or the privacy practices of the Company, please contact us  by emailing info@indiegamestand.com.  </p>
