		<p><strong>Do Not Track Signal</strong></p>
		<p>Index Exchange does not honor the 'DNT' browser signal. Instead, we utilize the cookie based mechanisms described above to facilitate opt-out of all advertising, which are in line with broadly adopted industry standards.</p>
		<p><strong>Full Safe Harbor Compliance</strong></p>
		<p>Index Exchange adheres to the Safe Harbor Agreement as it relates to our European Union based clients, or other third parties utilizing this website to request information. Any transfer of personal data from the European Union (“EU”) to the United States of America would be in full compliance with this agreement, as defined by the United States Department of Commerce. The Safe Harbor agreement takes precedent over all aspects of this general Privacy Policy.</p>
		<p><strong>Cookies</strong></p>
		<p>A cookie is a small amount of data, which often includes an anonymous unique identifier that is sent to your browser from a website's computer and stored on your computer's hard drive.</p>
		<p>Index Exchange uses both session and persistent cookies on our website. These are needed for site navigation and to perform aggregate analysis of what is viewed on our site. Cookies do not and cannot provide Index Exchange with PII.</p>
		<p>The Index Exchange Online Advertising Exchange uses cookies for the purpose of tracking when an Internet user has seen an advertisement. These cookies do not and can not provide Index Exchange with any PII about an Internet user. These cookies serve two purposes:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>They are used to inform the Index Exchange Online Advertising Exchange whether or not an advertisement has been served to the same computer before, and if so, when the advertisement was served. These cookies are not used by Index Exchange to build a profile of a user's behavior nor are they used by Index Exchange for the purposes of behavioral tracking or behavioral targeting.</li>
			<li>They are used to facilitate retargeting at a campaign level. Retargeting is the process of serving an ad from a particular advertiser to a user, based on the fact that the user has previously visited the advertiser's website. Retargeting occurs within the confines of a user-to-advertiser relationship, and is not available for general targeting on Index Exchange. Retargeting is not available for sensitive health-related topics.</li>
		</ol>
		<p><strong>Third party data</strong></p>
		<p>Index Exchange may obtain data from third party companies for the purpose of informing ad selection. This data is supplied in aggregate form and does not include any PII.</p>
		<p><strong>Collection and use of non-personally identifiable information.</strong></p>
		<p>All information shared with both advertisers and publishers within the Index Exchange Online Advertising Exchange is done so in an aggregate fashion. This allows us to provide clients of the Index Exchange Online Advertising Exchange with broad percentages regarding the users who are receiving advertisements through the Exchange. This data is not linked to any form of PII.</p>
		<p><strong>Data retention</strong></p>
		<p>The unique user identification number, associated with when and how many times an individual has seen an advertisement, is deleted after 90 days of user inactivity. These unique IDs are not tied to any PII. Aggregated statistical information, such as the popularity of an advertiser campaign, will be retained as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.</p>
		<p>Log files are created to analyze trends, keep track of user movement in the aggregate and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. This information includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp. IP addresses stored within log files are not linked to PII. Log file data may be retained for up to a maximum period of fifteen months.
</p>
		<p><strong>Collection and use of personally identifiable information by advertisers</strong></p>
		<p>Advertisers who are clients of Index Exchange may collect PII on their own websites. These details are provided directly by the individual Internet user in the form of online order forms, contests, etc. PII provided through an advertiser's website is not visible to Index Exchange while being entered, nor provided to Index Exchange at any time in the future. This PII collected by the advertiser is subject to the privacy policy of the individual advertiser involved.</p>
		<p><strong>Online behavioral advertising</strong></p>
                <p>Index Exchange adheres to the Digital Advertising Alliance's Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising, <a href="http://www.aboutads.info/" target="_blank">http://www.aboutads.info/</a> and to the NAI (Network Advertising Initiative) Code of Conduct, <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/" target="_blank">http://www.networkadvertising.org</a>.</p>
                <p>The Index Exchange Online Advertising Exchange prides itself on providing an atmosphere that is non-disruptive to Internet users. Our proprietary targeting methodologies enable advertisers to effectively target their campaigns to the audience(s) they are looking to reach without engaging in profiling practices.</p>
		<p><span class="submenuheader">Web site (http://www.indexexchange.com/)</span></p>

		<p><strong>Collection and use of non-personally identifiable information</strong></p>
		<p>Like most standard website servers we use log files. This includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, and number of clicks to analyze trends, administer the site, track user's movement in the aggregate, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses, etc. are not linked to PII. Log file data may be retained for up to a maximum period of fifteen months. After this storage period, the expired logs are deleted or archived in an encrypted state in cold storage.</p>
		<p><strong>Collection and use of personally identifiable information</strong>
		</p><p>Registering to become a member of the Index Exchange Online Advertising Exchange, either as an advertiser or a publisher, requires the submission of PII to our company. This can include your full name, mailing and/or billing address, email address, company name, and website URL. We use this information to service our accounts and respond to inbound inquiries related to sales or technical support requests. Communications to our business users are related to the Advertising Exchange. We hold all such information submitted in strict confidence.

Registered members who wish to update or correct their PII can contact us through our <a href="/contact/">online form</a>.</p>
		<p>PII cannot be used or disclosed for purposes other than those for which it was collected. The collection of PII must be limited to the purposes identified by Index Exchange.</p>
		<p><strong>Retention of data collected through our website</strong></p>
		<p>Use of data collection forms on the www.indexexchange.com corporate website grants us your consent to use this information within the framework provided in this Privacy Policy.

We will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements. PII that is no longer required to fulfill the identified purposes will be destroyed.</p>
		<p><strong>Security</strong></p>
		<p>We follow strict Information Security policies to protect PII submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure.</p>
		<p>Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your PII, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. If you have any questions about security on our website, please contact us using our <a href="/contact/">online form</a>.</p>
		<p>We reserve the right to disclose your PII as required by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on our website.</p>
		<p><strong>Changes to this privacy policy</strong></p>
		<p>Index Exchange may find it necessary to update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted at this site. Except as otherwise required by law, any modifications made to this Privacy Policy will not materially affect the privacy of data collected by Index Exchange prior to the effective date of the policy change.</p>
