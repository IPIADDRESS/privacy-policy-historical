<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

<p>This privacy policy applies to all of the products and  services offered by INNITY or its subsidiaries or affiliated companies.<br>
</p>
<p><strong>Overview of Innity Advenue's Technology</strong><br>
  Innity Advenue offers a technology platform for the  management of online display campaigns for advertisers. The platform is  designed to compose, deliver and optimize millions of highly relevant ad  experiences across search, display and social media from a single platform.&nbsp; This technology platform does not use any  personally identifiable information for these or any other purpose.<br>
  <br>
</p>
<p><strong>Why Do We Collect and Use Information?</strong><br>
  Advertising supports free content and experiences we all  love on the web. Our goal is to make advertising more effective, because  relevant ads are less annoying, and help the services that depend on  advertising, because advertisers pay more for effective ads.<br>
  <br>
</p>
<p><strong>What Types of Information Do We Collect and Use?</strong><br>
  We do not collect or use Personally Identifiable Information  (PII). We do not collect your name, address, phone number, e-mail address, id  number, credit card information, or anything else that can personally identify  you.<br>
  <br>
  We do not collect Sensitive Consumer Information, such as  insurance plan numbers, financial account numbers, or information about medical  conditions.<br>
  <br>
  We collect only anonymous, non-Personally Identifiable  Information, such as browser type, operating system, IP address and whether you  respond to an ad. We do not collect sensitive data.<br>
  <br>
  The non-Personally Identifiable Information that we collect  via cookies is used for the purpose of targeting ads and measuring the  effectiveness of ads on behalf of Innity's advertisers and to identify  the audience most likely to respond to an advertisement. This information also  helps Innity ensure that you don't repeatedly see the same ad. We may  also use non-PII data from third parties.<br>
  <br>
</p>
<p><strong>What Technology Do We Use to Collect Information?</strong> <br>
  We use two technologies to collect information, both of  which are widely used on the Internet: <br>
</p>
<p>Cookies<br>
  <br>
  Cookies are small text files that web sites place in your  browser when you visit them or see an ad. When you return to the site or view  another ad, a site can access these cookie files. Sites can then determine how  often you've visited a site or seen an ad. Cookies cannot be used to access any  other data on your computer.</p>
<p>Pixel Tags<br>
  <br>
  Pixel tags are small images on a web page or other document.  Pixel tags allow the operator of the web page or other document, or a third  party who serves the pixel tag, to set, read, and modify cookies.<br>
  <br>
</p>
<p><strong>Data Storage and Security</strong><br>
  We retain the non-Personally Identifiable Information  collected via our technology for up to one year. After one year, we discard the  information.<br>
</p>
<p>Even though our information is anonymous, security is  important to us. We have implemented reasonable measures to protect the  information we collect. No method protecting information is 100% secure, and we  cannot guarantee its absolute security.<br>
  <br>
</p>
<p><strong>Information Relating to Children</strong><br>
  Our products and services are designed for those 13 years of  age and older. We do not knowingly collect information from anyone under the  age of 13. If we are made aware that we have received such information, or any  information in violation of our policy, we will use reasonable efforts to  locate and remove that information from our records.<br>
  <br>
</p>
<p><strong>Disclosures</strong><br>
  Some of our web site partners may place their own cookies on  your Internet browser outside of our service; however, we have no access to or  control over these cookies.<br>
</p>
<p>In the event another company acquires all or most of our  assets, all data compiled or owned by us may be among the items transferred in  that transaction. In such event, all the data will continue to be governed by this  policy.<br>
</p>
<p>We may transmit or share our data with third-party service  providers (e.g., data storage and processing facilities) in order for those  service providers to perform business functions for us or on our behalf.<br>
</p>
<p>We may share, in an aggregated format, the non-Personally  Identifiable Information we collect to do business with related third parties,  such as our advertising clients.<br>
</p>
<p>We may disclose your information to third parties when we  reasonably believe we are obligated to do so by law, and in order to  investigate, prevent, or take action regarding suspected or actual prohibited  activities, including but not limited to, fraud and situations involving  potential threats to the physical safety of any person.<br>
  <br>
</p>
