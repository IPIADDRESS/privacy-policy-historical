                          If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post 
                          those changes to this privacy statement, the homepage, 
                          and other places we deem appropriate so our users are 
                          always aware of what information we collect, how we 
                          use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose 
                          it. We will use information in accordance with the privacy

                          the time of collection we will notify users via email. 
                          Users will have a choice as to whether or not we use 
                          their information in this different manner. However, 
                          if users have opted out of all communication with the

                          on our Web site notifying users of the change. In some 
                          cases where we post a notice we will also email users,
