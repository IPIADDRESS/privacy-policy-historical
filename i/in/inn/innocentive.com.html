<b>Website Privacy Policy</b> 
</font>

<br>
<br>

<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="-1">
With respect to this website, InnoCentive, Inc. ("InnoCentive") will collect, store or use personally identifiable information, such as your name, address, telephone number, or e-mail address ("Your Information"), when you voluntarily submit it to us (such as through our registration page) or when we acquire such information from other sources that are publicly available.  By providing us Your Information, by accepting our Problem Solver Agreement, or by continuing to use this website, you are consenting to our gathering, use, storage and processing of Your Information and the undertaking of all of these activities in the United States with databases located in the United States. 
<br>
<br>

We will use Your Information to respond to requests you may make of us, and from time to time, we may refer to Your Information to better understand your needs and how we can improve our website, products and services. Any and all uses would comply with applicable laws.  We may also use Your Information to contact you. Any other information transferred by you in connection with your visit to this site ("Other Information" -- i.e., information that cannot be used to identify you) may be included in databases owned and maintained by InnoCentive or its agents.  InnoCentive retains all rights to these databases and the information contained in them. 
<br>
<br>

Our website, like nearly all sites on the internet, will use Other Information and pool it with information tracking the total number of visitors to our site, the number of visitors to each page of our site, and the domain names of our visitors' Internet service providers. 
<br>
<br>

In addition, this website uses a technology called "cookies". A cookie is a piece of information that the computer that hosts our site gives to your computer (actually to your browser) when you access a website.  Our cookies help provide additional functionality to the site or help us analyze site usage more accurately. For instance, our site may set a cookie on your browser that allows you to see a personalized view of our website each time you visit.
<br>
<br>

Our website has security measures in place, including the use of industry standard secure socket layer encryption (SSL), to protect the confidentiality of any of Your Information that you volunteer; however, to take advantage of this your browser must support encryption protection.  These security measures also help us to honor your choices for the use of Your Information.  
<br>
<br>

If for some reason you believe that this website has not adhered to these principles, or if you would like to see the information that we have maintained regarding your activities on our website, please notify us by e-mail at webmaster@InnoCentive.com, so that we may address your comments or inquiry promptly.  Please allow us some time to process your request for access to Your Information.
<br>
<br>

As a convenience to our visitors, this website currently contains links to a number of sites that we believe may offer useful information. The policies and procedures we described here do not apply to those sites. We suggest contacting those sites directly for information on their privacy, security, data collection and distribution policies.
<br>
<br>

We may update this Website Privacy Policy from time to time.  When we do update it, however, for your convenience, we will make the updated policy available on this page.
