                    I am committed to keeping all your personal details safe and secure.

I will not pass on your details to any third party and do not send out marketing e-mails to customers unless they have registered to receive such material, purchased from me, or downloaded one of my free or paid products.<br>
                    <br>
                    The type of information I ‘may’ collect about you includes:<br>

                    <br>
                    How I Control Your Personal Information<br>
                    <br>
                    I will not use your personal information for any other reason other than to contact you. We do not sell, give away or rent your email address to any third party. If in the future I did for any reason wish to rent, sell or use your email address for any other purpose we will ask you for your permission first.<br>
                    <br>
                    How We Use Your Personal Information<br>
                    <br>
                    Your personal information is used for four main purposes and they are as follows:<br>
                    <br>
                    1. To send out information, recommendations and resources to you.<br>
                    <br>
                    2. To provide assistance to you after you have purchased products from me.<br>
                    <br>
                    3. To help me create and deliver content most relevant to you.<br>
                    <br>
                    4. To enlighten you about new products, services, tool, upgrades, special offers and information which I feel may be of use to you.<br>
                    <br>
                    I will only disclose your personal information, without notice, if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to:<br>
