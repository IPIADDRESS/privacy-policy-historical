			<br>
			</font><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica">ONLINE DONATION PRIVACY POLICY</font></b><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><br>
			<br>
			</font><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica">Commitment to Privacy</font></b><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><br>
			Entango was founded for the purpose of helping not-for-profit organizations ("NPOs") receive online donations
			inexpensively and efficiently. We, at Entango, understand the concerns that NPOs have with protecting the integrity
			of donor information. We also understand the concerns donors have with using their credit cards for online transactions.
			It is therefore in Entango's best interest to protect donors' credit card information in order to provide our customers
			with the best service possible. We have developed the following Privacy Policy to fulfill our commitment to donor
			privacy.<br>
			<br>
			</font><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica">Credit Card Numbers</font></b><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><br>
			When a donor uses Entango-enabled services to make an online donation, the credit card billing information, such
			as the name on the donor's card, billing address, and expiration date, is used to process the donation. We use
			SSL, industry standard secure technology, to encrypt donor credit card information. This technology is designed
			to prevent the theft or interception of the information.<br>
			<br>
			The non profit organization has access to an encrypted version of the donor's credit card number, showing the actual
			last four digits of the number, and a transaction identification number issued by Entango. Unlike retailers, which
			commonly keep complete credit card numbers in case there is a billing dispute, Entango only stores encrypted versions
			of donors' credit card numbers. The NPO normally receives only the encrypted version. However, in a case such as a billing dispute, it
			may be necessary for the NPO to have access to the actual number. In such a case, Entango will try to help the
			NPO resolve the billing dispute with only the encrypted number. If that is not possible, Entango will take every
			precaution available to ensure that the donor's credit card number is released only to authorized employees of
			the NPO. <br>
			<br>
			Donating online with Entango will not open your credit card information to dissemination. Entango will not disclose,
			sell, trade, rent, or otherwise reveal donors' credit card information used for online donating to third parties,
			including advertisers or marketers, without first receiving the donor's consent. This information is only used
			to process the donation. <br>
			<br>
			</font><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica">Other Donor Information</font></b><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><br>
			<br>
			As for the donor's other personally identifiable information, Entango may disclose aggregate use statistics (for
			example, 50% of our users are male) in order to describe our services to prospective partners, investors, and otherwise
			relevant third parties, such as non profit industry leaders. Such disclosed information will not include any personal
			information about individual donors. Other than this statistical use, Entango will not disclose, sell, trade, rent,
			or otherwise reveal personal information about individual donors to third parties, without first receiving the
			donor's consent. EACH NPO MAY HAVE A PRIVACY POLICY THAT DIFFERS FROM ENTANGO'S. PLEASE REFER TO THE NPO FOR ITS
			OWN PRIVACY POLICY.<br>
			ENTANGO IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY USES OF DONOR INFORMATION BY THE NPO.<br>
			<br>
			</font><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica">E-mail Addresses</font></b><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><br>
			Entango collects the donor's e-mail address to send him or her a confirmation of the transaction for the donor's
			records. Entango will automatically send updates on information such as transaction activity and password changes
			as a security measure; personal page access schedules, and other periodic reports unless the donor checks the box
			on the online donation form requesting not to be sent any such information.<br>
			<br>
			Entango will not disclose, sell, trade, rent, or otherwise reveal donors' e-mail addresses with a third party,
			other than the NPO receiving the donation. EACH NPO MAY HAVE A PRIVACY POLICY THAT DIFFERS FROM ENTANGO'S. PLEASE
			REFER TO THE NPO FOR ITS OWN PRIVACY POLICY. ENTANGO IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY USES OF DONOR<br>
			INFORMATION BY THE NPO.<br>
			<br>
			Â»The Online Donation Privacy Policy outlined above is subject to any legal requirements of disclosure dictated
			by statute or by an order of an appropriate court of law.</font>
