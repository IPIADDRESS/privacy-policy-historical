<h2>Privacy and cookies policy</h2><br>

<h3>About this policy</h3>

<p>Hello, and thanks for visiting Intu's privacy and cookies policy. This is where we explain how we use and look after the information you provide to us.  Your information is important and reading our policy will help you understand how we collect information, what we do with it and what choices you have.</p>

<p>If you have not heard of Intu before, our full company name is IntuDigital Limited and our parent company, Intu Properties plc runs many of the UK’s favourite shopping centres. This website or ‘Site’ brings our nationwide network of shopping centres together for you under one digital roof.</p>

<p>We do sometimes update this policy so you may want to return to this page and read it through again from time to time. The last time we updated this policy was on 12 June 2013.</p>

<h3>What information may Intu collect about me?</h3>

<p>We collect different types of information through this Site, including personal information from which we can identify you and other information about how you use the Site, our services and what interests you. This information helps us to make the Site more relevant to what you want.</p>

<p>We will typically collect personal information (such as your name, email, postal address, telephone number, payment and service details) whenever you ask us to deliver a service to you, for example when you:</p>

<ul>
<li>register and set up an account with us;</li>
<li>make a purchase from this Site;</li>
<li>sign-up to receive one of our newsletters;</li>
<li>take part in one of the competitions or promotions we run on the Site;</li>
<li>agree to fill in a questionnaire about our Site and services so we can check how we are performing and make improvements;</li>
<li>ask us a question or submit any queries or concerns you have; and</li>
<li>post information to the Site, for example when we offer the option for you to comment on, or join, discussions.</li>
</ul>

<p>We hope you do join in, but of course you do not have to give any information if you don't want to use our services.</p>

<p>If you register for Intu's free WiFi Service at our shopping centres, we will add to the information we collect from you from this Site with statistics on your use of our wireless service. This includes which of our centres you visit, your real time location in the centre,  which stores you use, the length of your visit and whether you connect to this Site from your mobile device. To learn more about the information we collect from registered users of our Free WiFi Service, visit our WiFi Service <a target="_blank" href="http://free.intu.co.uk/">Privacy policy</a>.</p>

<p>We sometimes run referral programmes where you can tell us about a friend or someone else who is known to you who may be interested in our Site, or what services we have to offer. If your friend gives you their permission to provide us with their details, then we promise we will only use their information for that reason and not to send them any wider marketing offers.  We will also mention that it was you who made the referral in the message we send to them.</p>

<p>We also collect other information about the use of our Site and services. Some of this information we may automatically collect when you visit the Site, such as what type of device you have and which type of internet browser or mobile device you use, whether you visited our Site from another website or service and your IP address (the unique reference number that identifies your device on the internet). We only use this information to give us a statistical picture of how the Site is used.</p>

<p>We also collect information using cookies. Cookies are small pieces of information stored on your browser which sometimes follow the movements of visitors on the Site and tell us how the Site and our services are used.  You can learn more about how we use cookies <a href="#cookies">below</a>.</p>

<a name="information-used"></a>
<h3>What uses are made of information collected about me?</h3>

<p>The information we collect helps us to understand your needs and to provide you with a better service. In particular we use your information to:</p>

<ul>
<li>deliver the services you ask for from us;</li>
<li>secure and verify payments you make;</li>
<li>help us review and improve our products, services and offers;</li>
<li>carry out market research from time to time by phone, mail or email;</li>
<li>administer competitions and promotions;</li>
<li>provide you with service information and account updates;</li>
<li>occasionally send you promotional messages about products, services and offers available from our Site which we think you may find useful; and</li>
<li>deliver instore messaging to your mobile device (but only where you have registered for our free WiFi Service and have elected to get promotional messaging services).</li>
</ul>

<a name="marketing"></a>
<h3>Will I receive marketing?</h3>

<p>Like you, we hate junk mail and spam contact and we will not sell your information to marketing companies.  Intu news, offers and messaging services will only be sent to you where you have agreed to receive these.</p>

<p>We also understand that you might change your mind about receiving our occasional Intu communications. If you do not wish us to continue to contact you in this way, you can either follow the unsubscribe instructions on any of our communications to you or contact us by using the <a href="#contact-us">contact us</a> information at the end of the policy.</p>

<a name="disclose-information"></a>
<h3>When will Intu disclose my information?</h3>

<p>As explained above, we don't sell your information to marketing companies although, like most organisations, there may be cases when we need to share information.</p>

<p>We may share statistics about users of our Site and services to help us develop our services or so that others can understand what we do. This will not include any information that identifies individuals.</p>

<p>We work with employees, partners or agents who are involved in delivering the products or services that you order and use through this Site and under appropriate contractual and confidentiality protections.</p>

<p>If we're reorganised or sold to another organisation, we may transfer any personal information we hold about you to that organisation as part of the sale or re-organisation.</p>

<p>We may also share information where we are required or allowed to do so by law or if we believe that this is necessary to prevent fraud or cybercrime or to protect the site or the rights or safety of its users or any other person.</p>

<a name="cookies"></a>
<a name="monster"></a>
<h3>What about cookies?</h3>

<p>Cookies are used by most websites and we are no exception.  This section of our policy explains what cookies are, how we use cookies and how you can control cookies on this Site and other websites you visit.</p>

<p>Cookies are pieces of information that include a unique reference code that a website passes to your device. This means the website can remember you and how you move from page to page within the website during your session online or they may persist on your device meaning the site can remember you when you leave and later return.</p>

<p>In addition to cookies, we use web beacons which are small image files that we use on the Site or in the body of our newsletters so that we can understand which parts of the Site are visited or whether certain products or services are of interest.</p>

<p>We don't use cookies that store personal information such as your name, although a cookie does mean we can look up who you are in cases where you are a registered user of our Site and services.</p>

<p>We have put our cookies into categories to help explain how these are used.</p>

<h4>Strictly necessary</h4>

<p>These cookies are essential for you to move around the Site and use its features, such as accessing secure payment areas. Without these cookies you would not, for example, be able to use our shopping bag or make payments.</p>

<h4>Performance</h4>

<p>These cookies help us to understand how visitors use our Site and services and whether they are also registered users of our free WiFi service. From this we generate anonymous statistics on our visitors, such as how they came to visit us, how long a visitor spends on our Site or uses our services and what they look at.  We analyse this information to understand how we can make improvements to how our Site and services work.</p>

<h4>Functionality</h4>

<p>These cookies allow us to remember choices that you make, such as your user name, language, the pages you wish to view, items you have compared, competitions and prize draws you have entered and your wishlist. They may be used to provide services you have asked for and provide you with enhanced, personal features.</p>


<p>We do not use advertising cookies to track or target you on this Site.</p>

<p>Flash cookies – We may use Adobe Flash Player to display video or image content. It may not be possible to block or restrict flash cookies using your browser settings, however information on how to control Flash Player privacy, and security settings is available from the Adobe website at: <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.adobe.com/products/flashplayer/security">http://www.adobe.com/products/flashplayer/security</a>.</p>

<p>Most computer or mobile browsers automatically accept cookies but, if you prefer, you can change your browser to prevent that or to tell you each time a cookie is set.  You can also learn more about cookies by visiting <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.allaboutcookies.org">www.allaboutcookies.org</a> which includes additional useful information on cookies and how to block cookies using different types of browser.  Don't forget however, that if you block or delete all cookies you may not be able to make full use the Site or services.</p>

<a name="forums"></a>
<h3>Can I participate in public forums?</h3>

<p>We may, from time to time, make chat rooms, message boards, or other public forums available to our visitors. Any information that is disclosed in these areas becomes public information and so you should exercise caution when using these and never disclose your personal information.</p>

<a name="younger-visitors"></a>
<h3>I am a visitor aged 16 or under</h3>

<p>Protecting the safety of younger visitors on the internet is very important to us.  Anyone aged 16 or under must get the permission of their parent or guardian before using this Site or any service or before sending personal information to us or anyone else.</p>

<a name="external-links"></a>
<h3>Who is responsible for my information when I follow an external link?</h3>

<p>Our Site may, from time to time, contain links to external sites. We are not responsible for the privacy policies or the content of external sites.</p>

<a name="security"></a>
<h3>How is my information secured?</h3>

<p>We place great importance on the security of all personally identifiable information associated with our visitors and users. We have security measures in place to attempt to protect against the loss, misuse and alteration of personal information under our control. For example, our security and privacy policies are periodically reviewed and enhanced as necessary and only authorised personnel have access to personal information. Whilst we cannot ensure or guarantee that loss, misuse or alteration of information will never occur, we use all reasonable efforts to prevent it.</p>

<p>Payments are made through our secure payment solutions provider. You will be providing credit or debit card information directly to them using a secure server to process payment details, encrypting your credit/debit card information and authorising payment.  Information, which you supply them, is not within our control and is subject to their own privacy policy and terms and conditions.</p>

<p>We recommend that you close your browser when you have finished your user session to help ensure others do not access your personal information, if you use a shared computer or a computer in a public place.</p>

<a name="your-information"></a>
<h3>Will my information be held overseas?</h3>

<p>Information that you provide to us via the Site is stored on secure servers located in the United Kingdom. Your information may be transferred to countries outside the European Economic Area (“EEA”) where, for example, one or more of our servers are from time to time located in a country outside the EEA or one of our service providers is located in a country outside the EEA.  If we transfer your information outside the EEA in this way, we will take steps to ensure that your privacy rights continue to be protected.</p>

<p>In addition, if you use our services while you are outside the EEA, your information may be transferred outside in order to provide you with these services.</p>

<a name="information-access"></a>
<h3>Can I access my information?</h3>

<p>You can access a copy of the personal information about you held by us. On making a request we will provide you with a copy of this information subject to a small admin fee (not over the maximum we are allowed to charge you). You also have a right to correct any errors in that information. As mentioned above, you also have a right to prevent the use of your personal information for direct marketing purposes.</p>

<a name="contact-us"></a>
<h3>How do I contact Intu?</h3>

<p>Just submit any questions, concerns or comments you have about this privacy policy or any requests concerning your personal data by email to <a href="mailto:customercare@intudigital.co.uk?subject=Privacy and cookies policy">customercare@intudigital.co.uk</a> or via the <a href="/contact-us">Contact Us</a> page.</p>
