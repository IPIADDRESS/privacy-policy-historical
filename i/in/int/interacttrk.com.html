<p>
	CAKE is also committed to protecting the privacy of our users. To this end, we believe you have the right to know everything regarding the information we collect about you, how the information is used, and how you can opt out of providing any of this information.</p>
<p>
	This privacy policy explains how we use your information and explains what you can expect from CAKE. By using this site, you indicate your acceptance of CAKE’s Privacy Policy.</p>
<h3>
	What Information Is Collected?</h3>
<p>
	We collect personally identifying information from voluntary user registrations, requests for information, surveys, contact forms and emails. We also collect non-personally identifying information when you visit our website about which pages you visit, how long you visit certain pages, and how you arrived at our website among other things. For more information on exactly what information is obtained, please contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@getCAKE">privacy@getCAKE</a>.</p>
<h3>
	Why Do You Collect Information?</h3>
<p>
	The information we collect allows us to improve your user experience through the customization of content and layouts of various pages. It also enables us to respond to your requests for information and keep you informed about new features and services that we offer along with any content that we provide through our newsletters. In addition, some information is shared with reputable organizations who may contact you with special offers of possible interest.</p>
<p>
	We may use your personal information with non-personal information that we have collected in a manner such that the end-product does not personally identify you or any other user of our site.&nbsp; We may make your personal information non-personally identifiable by either combining it with information about other users (aggregating your personal information with information about other users), or by removing characteristics (such as your name or email address) that make the information personally identifiable.&nbsp; This process is known as de-personalizing your information.&nbsp; You grant us a royalty-free, worldwide, perpetual, irrevocable and fully transferable right and license to use your personal information in connection with the creation and development of analytical and statistical analysis tools relating to the use of the customer data we collect in providing the site and our services (the “Analytical Data”). We are expressly authorized to make any commercial use of the Analytical Data, including without limitation, sharing the Analytical Data with third parties, provided that we do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer from us any part of the Analytical Data that personally identifies any of our website users.</p>
