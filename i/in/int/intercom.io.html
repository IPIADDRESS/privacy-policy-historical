	                    This Privacy Policy covers our treatment of personally identifiable information (“Personal Information”) that we gather when you are accessing or using our Website or Services. This policy does not apply to the practices of companies that we do not own or control, or to individuals that we do not employ or manage.</p><p>
	                    We do not knowingly collect or solicit personal information from anyone under the age of 13 or knowingly allow such persons to register for the Services (as that term is defined in our 
	<a href="http://docs.intercom.io/terms">Terms of Use</a>). No one under age 13 may provide any personal information to us or on the Services.</p><h2>II. WHAT INFORMATION DOES INTERCOM COLLECT?</h2><p>
	                    We gather various types of Personal Information from our users, as explained more fully below. We may use this Personal Information to personalize and improve the Services, to allow our users to set up a user account and profile, to contact users, to fulfill your requests for the Services, to analyze how users utilize the Website, and as otherwise set forth in this Privacy Policy. We may share certain types of Personal Information with third parties (described in this Section and in Section IV below). We collect the following types of information:</p><h3>A. Information You Provide to Us:</h3><p>
	                    Your Personal Information: We receive and store any information you knowingly provide to us. For example, we collect Personal Information such as your name, email address, and browser information. You can choose not to provide us with certain information such as your credit card information, but then you may not be able to register with us or to take advantage of some of our features. We may anonymize your Personal Information so that you cannot be individually identified, and provide that information to our partners.</p><p>
	                    Your Customers’ Personal Information: In order to provide you with the Services, we also receive and store any information you choose to provide us with respect to your customers (“End User Customers”). The End User Customer information (“End User Customer Information”) we receive and store typically includes names and email addresses of your customers, but will consist of any information you choose to provide us with.</p><p>
	                    Upon sign up, if you choose to ask a friend to install intercom for you, we will ask for your friend’s email address to notify him of such a request. Intercom, Inc. stores this information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email notification.</p><p>
	                    If you choose to use our referral service to tell a friend about our site, we will ask you for your friend’s name and email address. We will automatically send your friend a one-time email inviting him or her to visit the site. Intercom, Inc. stores this information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email, and tracking the success of our referral program.</p><p>
	                    Your friend may contact us at 
	<a href="http://mailto:team@intercom.io">team@intercom.io</a> to request that we remove this information from our database.</p><h3>B. Information Collected Automatically:</h3><p>
	                    Whenever you interact with our Website, we automatically receive and record information on our server logs from your browser including your IP address, “cookie” information, and the page you requested. “Cookies” are identifiers we transfer to your computer or mobile device that allow us to recognize your browser or mobile device and tell us how and when pages in our Website are visited by you. You may be able to change the preferences on your browser or mobile device to prevent or limit your computer or device’s acceptance of cookies, but this may prevent you from taking advantage of some of our Website’s features. If you click on a link to a third party website, such third party may also transmit cookies to you. This Privacy Policy does not cover the use of cookies by any third parties.</p><p>
	                    When you visit the Website, whether as an Intercom customer or a non-registered user just browsing, our servers automatically record information that your browser sends whenever you visit a website (“Log Data”).

We use this information to monitor and analyze use of the Website and the Services and for the Website’s technical administration, to increase our Website’s functionality and user-friendliness, and to better tailor it to our visitors’ needs.</p><p>
	                    Additionally, as part of our provision of the Services to you, if you install certain software code provided by us on your website, we will also track and collect End User Customer usage information on your website. We also use third parties to collect publicly available information relating to your End User Customers. For more information on how we collect and compile End User Customer Information, please see Section IV below.</p><p>
	                    The use of cookies by our tracking utilities is not covered by our privacy policy. We do not have access or control over these cookies. Our tracking utilities use both session ID and persistent cookies to enable us to design a better experience for our customers.</p><p>
	                    Our third party partners also employ clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs), images, and scripts that help them better manage content on our site. We do [not] tie the information gathered to our Customers’ or Users’ personal information.</p><p>
	                    We partner with a third party ad network to either display advertising on our Web site or to manage our advertising on other sites.  Our ad network partner uses cookies and Web beacons to collect non-personally identifiable information about your activities on this and other Web sites to provide you targeted advertising based upon your interests.  If you wish to not have this information used for the purpose of serving you targeted ads, you may opt-out by clicking

	                    We may contact you, by email or other means; for example, we may communicate with you about your use of the Website or Services. If you do not want to receive email or other mail from us, please indicate your preference by adjusting the settings on your account screen in the Website.

	                    If you wish to subscribe to our newsletter(s), we will use your name and email address to send the newsletter to you.  Out of respect for your privacy, you may choose to stop receiving our newsletter or marketing emails by following the unsubscribe instructions included in these emails, accessing the email preferences in your account settings page or you can contact us at team@intercom.io.</p><h2>III. WHERE WE STORE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION</h2><p>
	                    If you are located outside the United States, the information that we collect from you may be transferred to, and stored and processed at, a destination in the United States. By submitting information, you agree to this transfer, storing or processing. We will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your information is treated securely and in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</p><h2>IV. WILL INTERCOM SHARE ANY OF THE PERSONAL INFORMATION IT RECEIVES?</h2><p>
	                    We neither rent nor sell your Personal Information or your End User Customers’ Personal Information in personally identifiable form to anyone. We share such Personal Information in personally identifiable form with third parties as described below.</p><p>
	<strong>   A. Trusted Third Parties:</strong> We employ other companies and people to perform tasks on our behalf and need to share your information with them to provide the Services to you. Unless we tell you differently, such third parties do not have any right to use the Personal Information we share with them beyond what is necessary to assist us. This includes third party companies and individuals employed by us to facilitate our Services, including the provision of maintenance services, database management, Web analytics and general improvement of the Services. In particular, as part of our provision of the Services to you, we provide a limited amount of your End User Customer Information to Full Contact, Inc. (“Full Contact”) so that Full Contact can collect and compile publicly available contact and social information related to your End User Customers, such as email addresses, gender, company, job titles, photos, website URLs, social network handles and physical addresses. For more information on the privacy practices of Full Contact, please visit <a href="http://fullcontact.com/privacy">http://fullcontact.com/privacy</a>. You may opt-out of having such information sent to Full Contact by adjusting the settings on your app screen in the Website.</p><p>
	<strong> B. Business Transfers:</strong> We may choose to buy or sell assets. In these types of transactions, customer information is typically one of the business assets that is transferred. Also, if we (or substantially all of our assets) are acquired, or if we go out of business, enter bankruptcy, or go through some other change of control, Personal Information would be one of the assets transferred to or acquired by a third party. You will be notified via email and/or a prominent notice on our Web site of any change in ownership or uses of your personal information, as well as any choices you may have regarding your personal information.</p><p>
	<strong> C.
