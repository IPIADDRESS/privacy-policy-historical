	<p> Your privacy is very important to Intellichat, Ltd. ("intellichat").  We want to make your experience using our services and on the Internet as  enjoyable and rewarding as possible, and we want you to use the Internet's vast  array of information, tools, and opportunities with complete confidence. <br>
          <br>
          We have created this Privacy Policy to demonstrate our firm commitment to  privacy and security. This Privacy Policy describes how intellichat collects  information from all end users of intellichat's Internet services (the  "Services") - those who access some of our Services but do not have  accounts ("Visitors") as well as those who pay a service fee to  subscribe to the Service ("Customers") - what we do with the  information we collect, and the choices Visitors and Customers have concerning  the collection and use of such information. intellichat requests that you read  this Privacy Policy carefully. </p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Introduction</strong>. intellichat collects information in different ways from Visitors  and Customers who access the various parts of our Services and the network of  Web sites accessible through our Services. We use this information primarily to  provide a customized experience as you use our Services and, generally, do not  share this information with third parties. However, we may disclose personal  information collected if we have received your permission beforehand or in very  special circumstances, such as when we believe that such disclosure is required  by law or other special cases described below.</li>
          <li><strong>Registration</strong>. Customers are asked to provide certain personal information when  they sign up for our Services including name, address, telephone number,  billing information (such as a credit card number), and the type of personal  computer being used to access the Services. The personal information collected  from Customers during the registration process is used to manage each Member's  account (such as for billing purposes). This information is not shared with  third parties, unless specifically stated otherwise or in special  circumstances. However, in instances where intellichat and a partner jointly  promote the Services, intellichat may provide the partner certain personal  information, such as the name, address, and username of persons who subscribed  to the Services as a result of the joint promotion for the sole purpose of  allowing us and the partner to assess the results of the promotion. In this  instance, personal information may not be used by the partner for any other  purpose. intellichat may also generate non-identifying and aggregate profiles  from personal information Customers provide during registration (such as the  total number, but not the names, of Customers). As explained in more detail  below, we may use this aggregated and non-identifying information to sell  advertisements that appear on the Services.</li>
          <li><strong>Domain Registration</strong>. Domain name registration information legally has to be available  to the public. Since domain name registration information is available to the  public, anyone can access it through "WHOIS" searches. The WHOIS  database is a publicly accessible database that lists the domain name and  contact information of each registrant. The domain name registration you  provide is hosted by us to the public. At times our customers may have been  included within searches of the WHOIS database. However, the SPAM they receive  does not in any way come from intellichat.</li>
          <li><strong>intellichat Partners and Sponsors</strong>. Some intellichat products and services are  offered to Visitors and Customers in conjunction with a non-affiliated partner.  To provide Visitors and Customers some of these products and services, the partner  may need to collect and maintain personal information. In these instances, we  will provide such data collected or transferred to our Partners and Sponsors  (e.g., domain registration). Additionally, many intellichat Customers have  co-branded pages that are co-sponsored by non-affiliated partners. intellichat  will share non-identifying and aggregate information (except as described  above), but not personal information, with such partners in order to administer  the co-branded products or services offered.</li>
          <li><strong>Online Shopping</strong>. At some Web sites, you can purchase products and services or  register to receive materials, such as a catalog or new product and service  updates. In many cases, you may be asked to provide contact information, such  as your name, address, email address, phone number, and credit/debit card  information. If you complete an order for someone else, such as an online gift  order sent directly to a recipient, you may be asked to provide information  about the recipient, such as the recipient's name, address, and phone number. intellichat has no control over the third parties' use of any personal information  you provide when placing such an order. Please exercise care when doing so. If  you order products directly from intellichat, we will use the personal  information you provide only to process that order. We do not share this  information with outside parties except to the extent necessary to complete  that order.</li>
          <li><strong>Online Advertisements</strong>. intellichat displays our online advertisements. We share  aggregated and non-identifying information about our Visitors and Customers  collected through the registration process as well as through online surveys  and promotions with these advertisers. Additionally, in some instances, we use  this aggregated and non-identifying information to deliver tailored  advertisements. For instance, an advertiser tells us the audience they want to  reach (for example, males between 25 and 55 years of age) and provides us an  advertisement tailored to the audience. Based upon the aggregated and  non-identifying information we have collected, we may then display the  advertisement to the intended audience. intellichat does not share personal  information about its Visitors or Customers with these advertisers.</li>
          <li><strong>Responses to Email Inquiries</strong>. When Visitors or Customers send email  inquiries to intellichat, the return email address is used to answer the email  inquiry we receive. intellichat does not use the return email address for any  other purpose and does not share the return email address with any third party.</li>
          <li><strong>Voluntary Customer Surveys</strong>. We may periodically conduct both business and  individual customer surveys. We encourage our customers to participate in these  surveys because they provide us with important information that helps us to  improve the types of services we offer and how we provide them to you. Your  personal information and responses will remain strictly confidential, even if  the survey is conducted by a third party. Participation in our customer surveys  is voluntary. We take the information we receive from individuals responding to  our Customer Surveys and combine (or aggregate) it with the responses of other intellichat customers to create broader, generic responses to the survey questions  (such as gender, age, residence, hobbies, education, employment, industry  sector, or other demographic information). We then use the aggregated  information to improve the quality of our services to you, and to develop new  services and products. This aggregated, non-personally identifying information  may be shared with third parties.</li>
          <li><strong>Special Cases</strong>. It is intellichat's policy not to use or share the personal  information about Visitors of Customers in ways unrelated to the ones described  above without also providing you an opportunity to opt out or otherwise prohibit  such unrelated uses. However, intellichat may disclose personal information  about Visitors or Customers, or information regarding your use of the Services  or Web sites accessible through our Services, for any reason if, in our sole  discretion, we believe that it is reasonable to do so, including: to satisfy  laws, such as the Electronic Communications Privacy Act, regulations, or  governmental or legal requests for such information; to disclose information  that is necessary to identify, contact, or bring legal action against someone  who may be violating our Acceptable Use Policy or other user policies; to  operate the Services properly; or to protect intellichat and our Customers.</li>
          <li><strong>"Cookies" and How intellichat Uses Them</strong>. A "cookie" is a small data file that  can be placed on your hard drive when you visit certain Web sites. intellichat  may use cookies to collect, store, and sometimes track information for  statistical purposes to improve the products and services we provide and to  manage our telecommunications networks. If you are a Member and have created  your own Personal Start Page, we will use a cookie to save your settings and to  provide customizable and personalized services. These cookies do not enable  third parties to access any of your customer information. Additionally, be  aware that if you visit non-intellichat Web sites where you are prompted to log  in or that are customizable, you may be required to accept cookies. Advertisers  and partners may also use their own cookies. We do not control use of these  cookies and expressly disclaim responsibility for information collected through  them.</li>
          <li><strong>Statistics</strong>. We use information gathered about you from our site statistics  (for example your IP address) to help diagnose problems with our server, and to  administer our Web site. We also gather broad demographic information from this  data to help us improve our site and make your browsing and purchasing  experience more enjoyable. This is not linked to any personally identifiable  information, except as necessary to prevent fraud or abuse on our system.</li>
          <li><strong>intellichat's Commitment to Children's Privacy</strong>. Protecting children's privacy is especially  important to us. It is our policy to comply with the Children's Online Privacy  Protection Act of 1998 and all other applicable laws. While we make every  effort to ensure that these Web sites are fun and age-appropriate for our  younger audience, we believe that there is no substitute for proper parental  supervision. intellichat recommends that children ask a parent for permission  before sending personal information to intellichat, or to anyone else online.</li>
          <li><strong>Public Forums</strong>. Please remember that any information you may disclose in our  Member Directory, or other public areas of our Web sites or the Internet,  becomes public information. You should exercise caution when deciding to disclose  personal information in these public areas.</li>
          <li><strong>intellichat's Commitment to Data Security</strong>. Services and Web sites we sponsor have  security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse, and alteration of the  information under our control. While we make every effort to ensure the  integrity and security of our network and systems, we cannot guarantee that our  security measures will prevent third-party "hackers" from illegally  obtaining this information.</li>
          <li><strong>How to Access or Modify Your Information</strong>. intellichat offers Customers the opportunity  to access or modify information provided during registration. To access or  modify such information contact our Customer Service Department at accounts@intellichat.com. </li>
          <li><strong>Where to Direct Questions About intellichat's Privacy Policy</strong>. If you have any questions about this Privacy  Policy or the practices described herein, you may contact: Customer Service, intellichat, Ltd., Technopole Building, Kingston Crescent, Portsmouth PO2 8FA or  sales@intellichat.com.</li>
          <li><strong>Exceptions</strong>. As stated previously in this policy, we will never give out your  information without your permission. The only exceptions to this are, when we  are required by law, in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary in  order to conform to the law, or we must comply with a legal process served on  our web site. We may also need to give out your information if one of our  partners requires it, but these situations are rare and we will always ask for  your explicit permission first.</li>
          <li><strong>Revisions to This Policy</strong>. intellichat reserves the right to revise,  amend, or modify this policy, our Internet Service Agreement and our other  policies and agreements at any time and in any manner. Notice of any revision,  amendment, or modification will be posted in accordance with the Internet  Service Agreement. </li>
