      <h1>Integral7 Privacy Policy – A Commitment to Your Privacy</h1>
      <p class="first">At Integral7, we respect the importance of your personal information and the need to maintain the security and confidentiality of that information. We are committed to safeguarding the privacy of the information we maintain about you. This Privacy Policy details Integral7’s commitment to protecting your privacy, including what information we collect, how we use that information, how we safeguard that information and what you can do to control your information. Consistent with our commitment to protect personal privacy, Integral7 adheres to the Safe Harbor privacy principles and the 15 FAQs that make up the U.S.-EU &amp; Swiss Safe Harbor Frameworks that are administered by the U.S. Department of Commerce.  The framework may be found at: <a href="http://export.gov/safeharbor/">http://export.gov/safeharbor/</a> .</p>
      <p><strong>What Information We Collect and How We Collect It<br>
      </strong>When you sign up for an Integral7 service, we collect personal information from you that typically includes your name, address, phone number, and email address. When necessary, information about the credentials you hold may also be collected. For example, if you link to the Integral7 site from your candidate account with a credential sponsor and opt in to proceed to the Integral7 site, we may automatically collect your contact information, the credential sponsor name and the credentials you hold. We may ask for additional personal information, such as title, company name, or the industry you work in. You can opt out of providing this additional information by not entering it. </p>
      <p>When you visit our websites, our system may use cookies and other technologies to enhance your online experience. These tools enable us to recognize you when you return to our site, maintain your browser session while you browse, as well as help us provide you with a better, more personalized experience when accessing the Integral7 services. If you do not want us to use cookies to enhance your online experience you should choose security settings in your browser that prohibit that capability.</p>
      <p>You can update or remove your personal information at any time by contacting Integral7 at <a href="mailto:accounts@integral7.com">accounts@integral7.com</a>.</p>

      <p><strong>How We Use Your Information</strong><br>
      </p><p><strong>We may use or disclose your information under the following circumstances:</strong> (1) to provide the services you have requested; (2) to inform you of our other products or services; (3) to verify or complete a transaction or event; (4) to verify, on your behalf, your credential status to a third party that you have authorized (i.e. employer or credential sponsor); (5) to assist an authorized third party in performing functions on behalf of Integral7 as part of the services provided to you by Integral7; (6) when forced to comply with law, regulation, or a court or government order or request; (7) in preventing fraud or imminent harm, and ensuring the security of our network and services; or (8) if you or any authorized person give us permission to do so.</p>
    <p>If you do not want your data to be shared with third parties, you can choose not to authorize the third party.
</p>
    <p>We may share aggregated non-personal information with third parties. Aggregate information is statistically relevant information based on the overall population of the user community. This information cannot be traced back to a specific individual.</p>


    <p><strong>Safeguarding Your Information – Maintaining Your Trust<br>
    </strong>Any information provided to Integral7 is treated with care and discretion. We maintain a number of physical and electronic security features as well as procedural safeguards to protect your information. We conduct periodic reviews of systems, including security and privacy measures in order to provide protection for your information. We constantly re-evaluate our security and privacy policies and adapt them as necessary to deal with new challenges.</p>
    <p>Authorized users access the system through commonly used web browsers.&nbsp; Access requires a valid username and password.&nbsp; All application pages are secured via SSL.</p>
    <p>Integral7 servers reside in a secure, tier-one data center “vault.”&nbsp; Physical access is restricted.&nbsp; Servers and system logs are monitored for suspicious activity and are periodically tested by external attack simulations.&nbsp; The data center hosting Integral7 software holds the SAS-70 Type II Compliance data center certification that meets compliance regulations for Sarbanes-Oxley, HIPAA, 21 CFR Part 11, CISP and Federal Government requirements like OMB A-130, Security Act and NIST Standards.</p>
    <p>We restrict access to personal information by our employees and agents. Only employees and agents that provide the services you requested have access to your information. Additionally, our employees are required to acknowledge their responsibility to maintain the confidentiality of your information. These individuals are bound by confidentiality obligations and may be subject to discipline, including termination and criminal prosecution, if they fail to meet these obligations. </p>

    <p><strong>Your Control of Your Information<br>
    </strong>Integral7 respects your decisions about the collection and use of your information.&nbsp; By accessing and using any of our web sites or products you consent to the use of your personal information by Integral7 in the manner specified in this Privacy Policy.</p>
	<p>We are committed to keeping accurate, up-to-date records to help ensure the integrity of the information we maintain about you; providing you the option to opt-out of an Integral7 service; and allowing you to opt-out if we want to use your personal information for a purpose other than for which it was originally collected or subsequently authorized by you.
</p>
    <p>If you hold an account with an Integral7 service and need to update or change your personal information, or decide you want to opt-out, you may do so by logging in to your account and updating the applicable fields. If you cannot access your account, or you do not hold an account with Integral7 but believe we hold information on you, please contact us at <a href="mailto:accounts@integral7.com">accounts@integral7.com</a> or (888) 754-3600 if you would like to verify, modify or remove information.

    </strong>Some of the Integral7 sites contain links to other, third-party sites whose information practices may be different than ours. This Privacy Policy only addresses the information gathering practices of Integral7.&nbsp; To the extent that you disclose personal information to other web sites, or link to other web sites, you are protected by the other web sites' privacy policies, not Integral7's.&nbsp; We encourage you to review a third party web site's privacy policy before you disclose any personal information.</p>

    <p><strong>Compliance and Enforcement</strong><br>
Integral7 will conduct compliance audits of its relevant privacy practices to verify adherence to its privacy policies. If it is determined that we are in violation of our privacy policies, we will take appropriate and reasonable corrective action including appropriate legal, organizational, and technical measures.</p>

    </p><p><strong>Changes to the Privacy Policy</strong> <br>
      Please note that Integral7 may change this Privacy Policy from time to time. By continuing to use this web site, you agree to be bound by any such revisions and should periodically review the current version of this Privacy Policy for your own edification. </p>
