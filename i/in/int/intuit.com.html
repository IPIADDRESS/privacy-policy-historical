	</p></li><li><a name="general"></a><b>More on our General Information Practices </b>. 
	<ul type="square">
		<li><b>E-mail Message Formatting.</b> When sending you e-mail we may use an image called a single-pixel GIF, that allows us to  (1) format messages that best align with your computer's capabilities, and (2) determine whether you've opened an HTML e-mail. When you click on a link within an e-mail message, you will first pass through our server, then are redirected onto the Internet.  We use this click-through data on an aggregate level to evaluate response rates to our e-mail messages and to determine which links are most useful to our customer base.</li>
		<li><b>Newsletters and Special Events.</b>  We provide you the opportunity to subscribe to newsletters and other e-mail communications.  You may unsubscribe by following the instructions provided in each e-mail newsletter or e-mail communication.  We may also offer you the opportunity to participate in special events, such as webcasts, conferences, or seminars. If you would like to participate in these special events, we may ask you for contact information, and if applicable, billing information when you sign up. </li>
		<li><b>Contests and Surveys.</b>  From time to time, we may offer you the option to participate in contests or surveys.  If you would like to participate, we may ask you for contact information, preferences or other information. This information may be used to conduct research, improve our offerings or award prizes.  Our contests may have separate rules and we will identify how the information that you supply will be used in each case.</li>
		<li><b>Mandatory and Optional Information.</b> We identify the information that is necessary to fulfill your request.  Whenever we ask for additional or optional information, we identify those fields appropriately so that you know what is required to provide the requested service.  If you choose not to provide mandatory information, we will not be able to provide the service you are requesting. </li>

                            with information about other products or services. 
                
		</li><li><b>Service Providers.</b> In some cases, we will employ or work with service providers such as consultants, temporary workers, third party software developers, or outsourcers, to complete a business process or provide a service on our behalf.  For example, we may use service providers to deliver products, to offer online software applications, or to send e-mails.
