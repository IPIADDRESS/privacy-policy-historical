	<ul type="square">
		<li><a name="email"></a><b>E-mail Messaging.</b> When sending you e-mail we may use an image called a single pixel GIF, that allows us to format messages tailored to your computer's capabilities. We also use this technology to determine, in the aggregate, the number of people who open our e-mails. When you initiate a response by clicking on a link within an e-mail message, you are re-directed onto the internet. We then record your individual response to help us deliver information that is more relevant to your interests.
		</li><li><b>Newsletters and Special Events.</b>  We provide you the opportunity to subscribe to newsletters and other e-mail communications.  You may unsubscribe by following the instructions provided in each e-mail newsletter or e-mail communication.

		</li><li><b>Contests, Sweepstakes, and Surveys.</b>  From time to time, we may offer you the option to participate in contests, sweepstakes, or surveys.  If you would like to participate, we may ask you for contact information, preferences or other information. This information may be used to conduct research, improve our offerings or award prizes.  Our contests and sweepstakes may have separate rules and we will identify how the information that you supply will be used in each case.

		</li><li><b>Intuit and its Subsidiaries</b>. Intuit and its subsidiaries may exchange customer data with each other to fulfill your requests or to provide you with information about other products or services. 
      	</li><li><b>Service Providers.</b> In some cases, we will employ or work with service providers such as consultants, temporary workers, third party software developers, or outsourcers, to complete a business process or provide a service on our behalf.  For example, we may use service providers to deliver products, to offer online software applications, or to send e-mails. When we employ service providers, we may need to share your personally identifiable information. Service providers are strictly prohibited from using your personally identifiable information for purposes other than to act on our behalf.
		</li><li><b>Intuit Partners and Co-branded or Third-Party Sites</b>. Some of the products and services offered on this Web site may be provided by Intuit's business partners.

You will have the opportunity to opt out of further secondary use of your information following any change of control.
		</li><li><b>Changes to Our Privacy Policy.</b> If we plan to make significant changes to any of our privacy policies or practices with respect to how we use personally identifiable information, we'll post those changes to this Web site 30 days before they take effect.
		</li><li><b>Legal Disclosures.</b>  In some cases we may disclose certain information to comply with a legal process, such as a court order, subpoena, search warrant, or law enforcement request.

<a name="how_why"></a><b>HOW AND WHY WE USE WEB TECHNOLOGIES TO MANAGE OUR WEB SITE.</b>
</p><p>
Here is how and why we use some common Web technologies to help manage our Web site:
</p><ul type="square">
	<li><a name="cookies1"></a><b>Cookies.</b> A "cookie" is a small piece of information that our Web site may provide to your browser while you are at our site.  The Intuit.com Web site supplies your browser with cookies that contain a unique identifier used to better understand Web site usage in the aggregate so that we know what areas of our site users prefer, based on the number of visits to those areas. We also use cookies to verify your identity and provide you access to areas of our Web site that are limited to registered users.
