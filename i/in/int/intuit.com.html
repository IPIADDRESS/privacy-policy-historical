	<p><a href="http://www.truste.org/ivalidate.php?url=www.intuit.com&amp;sealid=101"><img src="/commerce/img/truste_seal_ctv.gif" alt="TRUSTe Click-to-Verify"></a>At Intuit, we place the highest importance on respecting and protecting the privacy of our customers. Our most important asset is our relationship with you. We want you to feel comfortable and confident when using our Web site. Therefore, we would like to share with you the following principles that govern our information practices and other privacy aspects of our Web site. Throughout this policy, we refer to information that personally identifies you as "personal information".</p>
	<h2>We protect your information</h2>
	<p>We work to protect your personal information from loss, misuse or unauthorized alteration by using industry-recognized security safeguards. We use both internal and external resources to review our security procedures. Our employees are trained and required to safeguard your information.</p>
	<a class="more" href="#">&gt;&nbsp;Tell Me More</a>
	<div class="more">
	<h3>More about how we protect your information</h3>
	<p>We protect the confidentiality and security of your personal information by using industry-recognized security safeguards such as firewalls, coupled with carefully developed security procedures to protect your information from loss, misuse or unauthorized alteration. Whenever we ask for sensitive information, such as credit card numbers, we encrypt it as it is transmitted to us.</p>
	<p>Our employees are trained and required to safeguard your information and, using physical, electronic and procedural safeguards, we restrict access to personal information to those employees and agents for business purposes only. Additionally, we use internal and external resources to review the adequacy of our security procedures.</p>
	</div>
	<h2>We tell you how we use your information</h2>
	<p>When we ask you for information, we will tell you – or it will be clear – what we need to know to fulfill your request and how the information you provide to us will be used. For example, if you order a product or register for a service from us, we will ask you for your name and contact information such as mailing address, phone number, and e-mail address. In addition to responding to your request, we may use your contact information to tell you about products or services we think might interest you or to invite you to participate in a product or service-related survey. Because of the financial nature of our business, this Web site is not designed to appeal to children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly request or receive any information from children.</p>
	<ul>
	<li>We do not sell or rent your personal information to anyone.</li>
	<li>We do not share your personal information with anyone outside of Intuit for their promotional, including marketing, use.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>If you are a business partner or prospective business partner, review our privacy practices that apply specifically to you.</p>
	<a class="more" href="#">&gt;&nbsp;Tell Me More</a>
	<div class="more">
	<h3>More about Business Partners</h3>
	<p>If you are a business partner or a prospective business partner, such as a financial institution or health plan, you may visit an Intuit Web site specifically intended for you. The information you provide on these Web sites are used only to develop or maintain our business relationship with you. For example, you may sign up to receive additional information about our programs, including notifications about new products, features, and events or have an Intuit representative contact you. Once you've become a partner, the Web site may include members-only program updates and reference materials. If you decide you are no longer interested in receiving program information from Intuit, you may notify your appropriate Intuit account representative to be removed from any future program-specific communication.</p>
	<h3>More about Intuit Business Connect</h3>
	<p>Intuit Business Connect allows you to upload company information that you can invite other users to access. Users that you invite will be required to set up an Intuit user id and password for authentication before they can access the information you post. When you sign up for Intuit Business Connect, we require that you provide us your name, email address, company name, business address and telephone number.</p>
	<p>We may use non-identifying information you post to Intuit Business Connect, as well as information on interactions you have with the service, to improve existing products and services and develop new ones. We may also combine your company information with that of others in a way that does not identify you, your company or any individual personally. We may use and share this combined, non-identifying information in our products and services, for example, a tool for Intuit Business Connect customers to compare aspects of their business with other users. However, we do not share your personal financial information or other personally identifiable information with other companies for their promotional use.</p>
	<p>Once you have signed up for Business Connect services, QuickBooks will automatically upload changes in your data to Intuit Business Connect be help keep the data accurate. You can change the frequency of these updates via the Administration page of Intuit Business Connect. To stop uploading data you can cancel the service via the same administration pages.</p>
	</div>	
	<h2>We tell you about our relationships with third parties</h2>
	<p>We have limited relationships with third parties to assist us in servicing you, for example, by fulfilling customer orders or providing customer service. These service providers are contractually required to maintain the confidentiality of the information we provide them. Additionally, we have business partners that provide services, some of which are co-branded. We clearly identify partner services and sites. When you request any of these products or services, you are permitting us to provide your personal information to the partner to fulfill your dynamoRequest. We may disclose your information if we are required to by a law enforcement action such as a court order, subpoena or search warrant.</p>
	<a class="more" href="#">&gt;&nbsp;Tell Me More</a>
	<div class="more">
	<h3>More about our relationships with Third Parties</h3>
	<p>Sometimes, we enter into contracts with third parties who assist us in servicing you such as filling customer orders or providing customer service. The contracts outline the appropriate use and handling of your information and prohibit third parties from using any of your personal information for purposes unrelated to the product or service for which they've been contracted. Vendors are required to maintain the confidentiality of the information we provide to them. We may disclose or report personal information in limited circumstances where we believe in good faith that disclosure is required under the law. For example, we may be required to disclose personal information to cooperate with regulators or law enforcement authorities, to comply with a legal process such as a court order, subpoena, search warrant, or a law enforcement dynamoRequest. We have business partners that provide services, some of which are co-branded. Partner services and sites are clearly identified. When you request any of these products or services, you are permitting us to provide your personal information to the partner to fulfill your dynamoRequest. This Web site may provide links to third-party sites, such as those of our business partners and online advertisers. Because Intuit does not control the information policies or practices of these third parties, you should review their privacy policies to learn more about how they collect and use personal information.</p>
	<p>Should we sell, merge or transfer any part of our business, part of the sale may include your personal information. If so, you will have the opportunity to ask not to receive promotional information following any change of control.</p>
	<p>We may use sources outside of Intuit to supplement the information you give us. For example, we may validate your address using other sources. We use this data to help us maintain accuracy and provide you with better service.</p>
	<p>Intuit and its subsidiaries may exchange information about your transactions to fulfill your requests. We may also provide you information about products or services we believe you may be interested in unless you have asked us not to contact you. We offer you the opportunity to review privacy practices at our subsidiaries' Web sites.</p>
	</div>	
	<h2>We tell you how we use Web technology</h2>
	<p>Like many Web sites, we use technology, such as cookies, that allow us to make your visit to our Web site easier by recognizing you when you return and help to provide you with a customized experience.</p>
	<a class="more" href="#">&gt;&nbsp;Tell Me More</a>
	<div class="more">
