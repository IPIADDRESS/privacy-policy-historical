<p>IntelliSurvey, Incorporated ("IntelliSurvey") is a leading provider
of online research technology and services.  IntelliSurvey is committed
to protecting the privacy of survey participants. We strictly adhere to
the privacy policies of the Council of American Survey Research
Organizations ("CASRO"), posted online at
http://www.casro.org/codeofstandards.cfm.</p>
We perform market research for our clients, who use the results for a
variety of business purposes. Survey results may help our clients better
understand respondent preferences, use, and preferences for various
products and services. Other clients use the survey results to measure
social attitudes and public opinion on political and social issues.
We combine all partipants' survey responses and report aggregate results
to our clients. We do not disclose the identity of individual
survey responses, unless the respondent requests or permits such disclosure.
<p>
<b>Confidentiality of Personal Information.</b>
<br>
We keep each respondents survey responses confidential.  Also, we
will never sell, share, rent or otherwise intentionally transfer
respondents personal information to our clients, other market research
companies, direct marketing companies or anyone else, unless the
respondent has won a sweepstakes we sponsored, in which case we may
disclose the winner's contact information with the winner's consent.</p>
<p>
<b>Internet Policies.</b>
<br>We abide by the highest standards of privacy.  Specifically:
</p><ul><li>We never intentionally "spam" Internet users to seek their
participation in surveys. We will only send e-mail invitations to those
we believe have agreed to receive such invitations through prior,
independent communications.
</li><li>Every invitee may "opt-out" of that survey, and not be contacted again.
</li><li>We maintain a high level of security to prevent outside parties from
having access to information electronically transmitted to us by you.
</li><li>Although we may use cookies to facilitate some surveys, cookies gather
no data other than survey responses or flags to indicate participation in certain surveys.
</li><li>We never knowingly invite children to participate in research
studies without taking measures to ensure appropriate parental consent.</li></ul>
<p>
<b>U.S. - EU Safe Harbor Privacy Statement</b>
