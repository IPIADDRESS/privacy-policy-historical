<p>
  <strong>What Are Cookies and How Does Zeta Interactive Use Them?</strong></p>

<p>
  A cookie is a text–only string of information that a web site transfers to the cookie file of the browser on your computer’s hard disk so that the website can remember who you are. A cookie will typically contain the name of the domain from which the cookie has come, the “lifetime” of the cookie, and a value, usually a randomly generated unique number. Many cookies last only through a single session, or visit. Others may have an expiration date, or may remain on your computer until you delete them. Cookies can help a web site to arrange content to match your preferred interests more quickly and also to improve the user experience. Most major web sites use cookies.</p>

<p>
  Web beacons may be used to monitor web site traffic in conjunction with cookies. A web beacon is a graphic on a web page or in an email message designed to track pages viewed and messages opened. Web beacons are often invisible because they are typically only 1–pixel by 1–pixel in size. We may place Web beacons on our web pages to collect data about visitors. When a user requests a Zeta Interactive web page, a web beacon may be retrieved/activated. Once the Web beacon is retrieved/activated, it points to an external site to retrieve the image. At that time it can also pass along information such as the IP address of the computer that retrieved the image, the time the Web beacon was viewed and for how long, and the type of browser that retrieved the image. This information can then be compiled and made available to Zeta Interactive. Web beacons, along with cookies, enable us to enhance your experience on the Zeta Interactive site. Turning off the browser’s cookies will prevent web beacons from tracking your specific activity. The web beacon may still record an anonymous visit from your IP address, but personal information will not be recorded (information on how to “turn off” cookies provided below).</p>

<p>
  <strong>How Does Zeta Interactive Use Cookies?</strong><br>
  We use cookies for a number of purposes–for example, to maintain continuity during a user session, to gather data about the usage of our web site for research and other purposes, to store your preferences for certain kinds of information and marketing offers, or to store a username or encrypted customer identification number so that you do not have to provide this information every time you return to our site. Our cookies are not used to gather personally identifiable information.<br>
  How Can I Prevent the Use of Cookies? You can decide if and how your computer will accept a cookie by configuring your preferences or options in your browser. The Help portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable or delete cookies altogether. However, please note that if you choose to reject cookies, you may not be able to use certain online services or web site features.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>Does Zeta Interactive Share the Information It Receives?</strong></p>

<p>
  Zeta Interactive does not rent, loan, trade or lease any personal information without prior consent.</p>

<p>
  We reserve the right to disclose your personally identifiable information as required by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on our web site.</p>

<p>
  <strong>What Choices Do I Have?</strong></p>

<h3>
  Additional Privacy Information</h3>

<p>
  <strong>How Does Zeta Interactive Protect the Privacy of Information It Collects and Manages on Behalf of Its Clients?</strong></p>

<p>
  Zeta Interactive works with the world's leading marketers (our clients) to develop direct mail and permission-based email marketing communications to send to their customers (client’s customers/consumers).</p>

<p>
  Zeta Interactive’s role in supporting our clients may include hosting client data, compiling or procuring prospect/acquisition data for our clients, delivery of direct mail or email, tracking results of direct mail or email campaigns, analysis of data, hosting of response data collection sites, and transferring collected data back to our clients or to an Zeta Interactive hosted database.</p>

<p>
  Zeta Interactive treats all client customer data as confidential. Zeta Interactive is contractually bound to keep our clients' customer data private and this data is never shared across clients or with any third party that is not authorized by a client to receive its customer data. Zeta Interactive only uses its clients’ customer data for the specific purpose of providing services to its clients as authorized by our clients. It is our client’s responsibility (as a user of our products and services) to provide proper notice to its customers/consumers with regard to any required notices as to its data collection and data use practices, including any email or internet tracking devices.</p>

<p>
  Zeta Interactive may, however, share our clients’ customer data with a Zeta Interactive affiliate company or another company if such sharing is in connection with providing services to our clients, or in relation to a sale or consolidation of Zeta Interactive’s assets, provided, however, that all such companies agree to honor all of the privacy commitments set forth in this Policy and have demonstrated appropriate levels of their ability to so protect the privacy of our clients’ data.</p>

<p>
  Some of our clients independently use Zeta Interactive's technology platforms to design and send their direct mail or email campaigns without the involvement Zeta Interactive support staff. Zeta Interactive informs all of its clients in writing about its stringent Policy against sending unsolicited commercial email, or sending direct mail in a manner not consistent with Direct Marketing Association (DMA) guidelines. If Zeta Interactive determines that a client has knowingly used its systems for sending unsolicited commercial email, or direct mail in a manner inconsistent with DMA guidelines, it may revoke the client's permission to send direct mail or email using our products or our systems.</p>

<h3>
  US-EU Safe Harbor</h3>

<p>
  Zeta Interactive complies with the U.S.-EU Safe Harbor Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information from European Union member countries.
