We use leading technologies and encryption software to safeguard your data, and keep strict security standards to prevent any unauthorised access to it.</p><h2>What information do we collect?</h2><p>We collect three kinds of information from visitors to the Into Film site:</p><p>1) Data you give to us when you sign up to the newsletter or contact us directly</p><p>2) Data you give to us during the register, login process and feedback (through visitors emailing us) and anonymous site usage information using Google Analytics.</p><p>3) On occasion, Into Film will conduct competitions and surveys via an authorised data capture provider.</p><p>Any information collected via such service will be shared only with Into Film and used only for the purposes of the competition or survey.&nbsp;</p><p>Into Film will only collect the participant's age, name, phone number or email address and will not share this information with any other third party.
