Kourtney Kardashian: Pregnant and Alone</strong></font><br>

They’re expecting their second baby together, but as Kourtney Kardashian wandered through Beverly Hills’ Nieman Marcus with her boyfriend, Scott Disick, she looked as though she was completely alone in the world. With Scott walking near her but not saying a word, the nine-weeks-pregnant reality star continuously checked her phone, looking sad and lost, as if she’d rather be anywhere else. As unfair as it may seem, the mom-to-be has found she has no one to share her happiness with — not Scott, and especially not her two sisters, both of whom have turned away from her out of pure jealousy.<br><br>

Ashton Kutcher Afraid of Demi Moore’s Book!</strong></font><br>

Demi Moore may throw the book at Ashton Kutcher! An insider tells <em>In Touch</em> that Ashton is terrified that his soon-to-be ex-wife will air the dirty laundry about their marriage in her upcoming memoir. “She got the book deal when they were still together, and it was supposed to focus on her childhood, her complex relationship with her mom and how it affected her life and career, including her addiction and recovery,” says the insider of the actress’ $2 million deal with HarperCollins. But now she’ll be expected to talk about the demise of her marriage and Ashton’s cheating, and “he’s afraid she’ll ruin his image by exposing all of their secrets.”<br><br>


<font size="3"><strong>

Barbara Walters Blabs!</strong></font><br>

Leave it to iconic interviewer Barbara Walters to get the Kardashian sisters to admit what we all suspected on <em>The 10 Most Fascinating People of 2011</em> ABC News special. “I talked to them about being famous for being famous,” Barbara tells <em>In Touch</em>. To which Kourtney finally confessed, “We don’t disagree: None of us think we have talent!” Barbara serves up private dish on her star subjects!<br><br>

Suri Cruise’s $100,000 Letter to Santa</strong></font><br>

It looks like Suri Cruise has been a very, very good girl this year! And thanks to her parents’ generous holiday spirit — and seemingly limitless funds — the world’s luckiest 5-year-old will be opening every little girl’s fantasy gifts under the tree. “Her No. 1 wish is a pony!” a family friend explains, adding that doting dad Tom has already taken great pains to locate a stable near the family’s Beverly Hills home to board Suri’s new pal.<br></div>
