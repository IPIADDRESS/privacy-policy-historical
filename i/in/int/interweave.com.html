             We at Aspire  Media/Interweave Press, LLC (referred to hereunder as IWP, we, us, our, etc.),  producer of interweave.com and affiliated web sites (the Sites), believe that  you have the right to know how your personal and other information may be used  or disclosed. You take your privacy seriously, and we respect your concerns.  Accordingly, we have created this Privacy Statement in order to educate you as  to how we collect information, what we do with it, and what controls and  options you have. Please read this Privacy Statement carefully, and if you have  any questions or concerns, please send us a comment at privacy@interweave.com<br>
             <br>
             Unless otherwise indicated, this Privacy Statement  applies only to information collected via the Site(s), and not to any off-line  or non-Site related activities of IWP or its affiliates. <br>
             <br>
             <strong>Gathering and Use of Information</strong><br>
             We and our third party vendors and service providers  collect data from you (Information) in different ways and via many different  parts of our Site(s): when you (1) register to become a Site(s) member or use  particular features of the Site(s), (2) enter one of our contests or  sweepstakes, (3) use one of our many patterns/projects, (4) send us a question,  or (5) buy one of our products. Even if you are just surfing the Site(s) and  reading a how-to article, we may collect information from you, such as your IP  address and the particular web pages that you visit on our Site(s). <br>
             <br>
             <strong>Information Pertaining to Children and Minor</strong>s<br>
             IWP does not want to collect Information from minors  (children under 13 years of age, or any other age defined under applicable  law). If we become aware that a minor is attempting to or has submitted  Information via this Site(s), we will notify the user that we may not accept  his or her Information. We will then expunge any personally identifiable  information from our records. <br>
             <br>
             <strong>Registration Information<br>
               </strong>Registration is required to access certain areas of  this Site(s). In order to register, you must provide us with information as  prompted, which may include your name, age group, gender, zip code, email  address, interests, occupation, how you found out about our Site(s) and other  information (Registration Information).<br>
             <br>
             We use your Registration Information to maintain your  Site(s) account. We may use your Registration Information to contact you if  there is a problem with your account or other related purposes, to facilitate,  complete, or confirm a transaction that you have entered into on or through the  Site(s), or if we substantially change our services, the Site(s) (or your  standing or status with respect to our Site(s) or services), or the Site(s)  policies and feel that we need to update all of our registered users.<br>
             <br>
             We may also analyze Registration Information to  understand who visits our Site(s), so that we can better design the Site(s) to  serve you more effectively. In the event we engage a third party to perform  this analysis for us, we will have agreements with the third party requiring it  to abide by privacy protections similar to those contained in this Privacy  Statement. In addition, we may share the results of our analysis with  advertisers in order to feature the products that will best serve your needs,  but we will not share any of your personally identifiable Registration  Information without your prior consent, except as otherwise indicated in this  Privacy Statement. For purposes of this Privacy Statement, whenever we use the  term “personally identifiable” we mean information that can be used to  reasonably identify you, including by way of example, your name, phone number,  email address, and postal address. <br>
             <br>
             <strong>Contests and Sweepstakes<br>
               </strong>We may from time to time offer contests and  sweepstakes. To enter a sweepstake or contest, you may be asked to provide your  name, mailing address, email address, and your phone number and other  information. Depending on the nature of the contest or sweepstake, we may also  request additional information, such as your preferences, tastes, opinions,  interests, and behavior. We use your contact Information to notify winners.  Otherwise, we do not share personally identifiable sweepstake or  contest-related Information with third parties, except as otherwise indicated  in this Privacy Statement. <br>
             <br>
             <strong>Projects/Patterns</strong><br>
             Our Site(s) offer  projects/patterns that prompt you for information and we ask for your email  address in conjunction with such projects/patterns. We use the Information you  provide regarding your projects/patterns to perform complex automated tasks  like suggesting other recommended related products. We do not share this  Information with third parties other than our third party service providers who  assist us in providing such information. We require that these third party  service providers abide by privacy protections similar to those contained in  this Privacy Statement. <br>
             <br>
             <strong>Buying Merchandise<br>
               </strong>You can order IWP merchandise online or by email. If  you do, IWP, as applicable, will collect your product order along with your  billing and shipping information. This Information is used to fulfill your  order and bill you for your purchase, and also to analyze our product sales so  that we can better meet your needs. Our products may be shipped directly by the  vendor, in which case we will share with them only the minimum required  information to complete the shipping of your items. Except as otherwise  indicated in this Privacy Statement, we do not share this Information with  third parties. Please be aware that some products are made available by third  parties on third party web sites, in which case the section below concerning  third party links and web sites will apply. <br>
             <br>
             <strong>Navigation Information/Cookies<br>
               </strong>When visiting our Site(s), your browser sends  information to our&nbsp; hosting server  identifying the browser you are using, your Internet Service Provider, the page  you last visited, and the page you are currently visiting. IWP logs this  Information and uses it to help diagnose problems with our server, to track  user traffic patterns, and to generally administer the Site(s). We may also track  and catalog the search terms that users enter in search forms, but this  tracking is not associated with individual users, except as otherwise indicated  in this Privacy Statement.<br>
             <br>
             We make use of a standard feature of browser software  called a “cookie” which helps us recognize you when you visit. We store your  email address in a cookie file and place the file on the hard drive of your  computer. This lets us identify your computer as a unique user.<br>
             <br>
             Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies. You  can reset your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is  being sent. If you disable cookies, however, you may find the Site(s), and many  other web sites, harder to use. Cookies allow us to streamline your password  entry process and customize your Site homepage, and to generally administer the  Site(s). Our cookies cannot read other data off your hard-drive. <br>
             <br>
             <strong>Access to Information<br>
               </strong>IWP and its employees have access to your  Information. We use your Information for the purposes described above.  Accordingly, IWP has established policies with respect to its employees  designed to keep your Information confidential in accordance with the  provisions contained in this Privacy Statement. In addition, to the extent we  disclose or otherwise share your Information with third parties as described in  this Privacy Statement, we require that these third parties abide by privacy  protections similar to those contained in this Privacy Statement.<br>
             <br>
             In addition, we engage third-party technical service  providers and consultants to work on the Site(s). For example, they may host  our Site, provide customer support, repair our software, or consult on security  issues. We allow them access to Information, but only to the extent required by  their role. In such instances, we require that these third parties abide by  privacy protections similar to those contained in this Privacy Statement. <br>
             <br>
             <strong>Information Sharing and Disclosure<br>
               </strong>Other than as specifically described in this Privacy  Statement, we only share aggregated Information about our users. For example,  we might share Information about the number of people who visit our Site(s) or  their demographic information. In addition, we may share aggregated Information  with market analysts, advertisers, business partners, sponsors, and any other  third parties.<br>
             <br>
             Except as we have noted herein, we will not share any  personally identifiable Information with any third party without your express  consent, unless we have a good faith belief that such action is reasonably  necessary: (a) to comply with the law; (b) to comply with legal process; (c) to  enforce this Privacy Statement or other Site rules and policies; (d) to respond  to claims that you are engaged in activities that violate the rights of third  parties; or (e) to protect the rights or interests of IWP and its service  providers, provided that nothing in this paragraph shall impose a duty on IWP  to make any such disclosures. <br>
             <br>
             <strong>Transfer of Your Information<br>
               </strong>In the event of a merger, acquisition,  consolidation, or sale of all or substantially all the assets of IWP, or in the  unlikely event of a bankruptcy, we reserve the right to transfer all or part of  our business, including this Site(s) and your Information, to third parties. <br>
             <br>
             <strong>3rd Parties/Links<br>
               </strong>This Privacy Statement applies only to the Site(s).  This Site may include links to the web sites of both our affiliated and  non-affiliated entities (Other Sites), including access to content, products  and services of such affiliated and non-affiliated entities. Whenever you  choose to access Other Sites or non-IWP content via our Site(s), a separate  browser window will launch and you will leave a certain IWP Site. We urge you  to familiarize yourself with the individual privacy and other terms for each  linked site prior to submitting your Information. <br>
             <br>
             <strong>Classified Advertisements<br>
               </strong>This Site contains classified advertisements. These  advertisements are one more way that we help you find the products and services  you need. Please remember, however, that when you respond to a classified  advertisement by email you are sending information to a third party and not to IWP.  We cannot control the use or security of or otherwise be responsible for any  information that your send to a third party, so please be careful. <br>
             <br>
             <strong>Supplementing Your Information<br>
               </strong>We may supplement the Information that you provide  with information we receive from third parties, for example product  manufacturers or service providers. If you have any questions about the privacy  policies of other companies or associations, we encourage you to contact them  directly. If you believe you did not opt in or have opted-out of certain  services and communications from IWP, and you continue to hear from us (except  with respect to our contacting you for reasons necessary for the operation of  the Site(s), which we may continue to do), please contact us immediately and we  will help you update your preferences and choices in our database. <br>
             <br>
             <strong>Blogs</strong><br>
             The Site contains bulletin  boards which are available to the public. Please remember that any text that  you send to a bulletin board is immediately available to the general public.  You should exercise caution when deciding to disclose any sensitive Information  like your name, address, phone number or social security number. <br>

             <strong>Other Important Safety Information<br>
               </strong>You are responsible for maintaining the  confidentiality of all passwords issued to you, and are fully responsible for  all activities that occur under your passwords, whether or not expressly  authorized by you. Please notify IWP immediately upon becoming aware of any  actual or suspected abuse or unauthorized use of the passwords issued to you.<br>
             <br>
             We urge you to use only a screen name and/or e-mail  address when chatting or sending e-mail. You may wish to delete unknown e-mail  attachments before opening them. They can contain destructive viruses. Remember  that nothing you write on the Web is completely private - including e-mail. So  be careful and think about what you type and whom you tell. Not everyone is as  trustworthy and honorable as they may seem. <br>
             <br>
             <strong>Security<br>
               </strong>Although we have taken reasonable security  precautions, no security system is impenetrable. We cannot guarantee the  security of our databases, nor can we guarantee that Information you supply  will not be intercepted while being transmitted to us over the Internet. <br>
             <br>
             <strong>Opting In; Reviewing, Correcting or Deleting  Information<br>
               </strong>When you provide contact Information to us, you will  be given the ability to “opt in” to (1) receiving communications from us and  our third party vendors (except for communications necessary for the operation  of the Site(s), which do not require an opt in), (2) having your contact  Information disclosed to third parties (except as necessary for us to operate  the Site(s), or as otherwise permitted under this Privacy Statement or required  under applicable law, which, in each case, will not require an opt in). If you  do not wish to receive such communications or allow such disclosures, do not  opt in. You may view, correct and revise your Information by accessing your  account. For example, if you have previously opted in and you would like to  stop receiving communications from us and our third party vendors, or you would  like to revoke any other consent previously granted for a specific purpose  concerning your personally identifiable Information, then you can opt out by sending  IWP an e-mail at remove@interweave.com or calling us at 800-272-2193. In the event you  opt-out we may retain your email address and share your email address with our  third party marketing partners, for the purpose of honoring your request to  opt-out of receiving information from us or our marketing partners on our  behalf. <br>
             <br>
             <strong>Notice of Changes to the Privacy Statement<br>
               </strong>We may update this Privacy Statement from time to  time. We will notify you about significant changes in the way we treat  personally identifiable Information by sending a notice to the primary email  address specified in your account or by placing a prominent notice on our Site(s).  After the changes take effect, all newly collected and previously collected  Information will be subject to the terms of the revised Privacy Statement. <br>
