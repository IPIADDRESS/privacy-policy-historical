  <h1>Privacy Statement</h1>
</div>

<div class="mainbox">

<p>This privacy policy sets out how we use and protect any information that you give us when you use our services.</p>

<h3>Key points</h3>

<p>We are committed to ensuring that your privacy is protected.  Should we ask you to provide certain information by which you can be identified when using this website, then you can be assured that it will only be used in accordance with this privacy statement.</p>

It is very important for you to understand that our service is designed to make your shouts visible to others, while we keep your identity anonymous.  Therefore, when you create a shout, the text you enter in the "what", "where", "when" and "other information" fields will be visible on the Internet.  We will not publish your personal details intentionally, but if you enter your personal details into any of the aforementioned fields, then that will be made visible to others on the Internet by design.

<h3>What we store</h3>

When you sign up to use our service, we request the following information from you about you or your company.  All of this information is either entered or validated by you:

<ul>
  <li>Your visible name</li>
  <li>Your email address</li>
  <li>Your website (you don't have to provide this)</li>
  <li>Your phone number (you don't have to provide this)</li>
  <li>Your company name (you don't have to provide this)</li>
  <li>Information about you or your company (this is a block of text and you don't have to provide this)</li>
</ul>

When you use the service, regardless of whether you have signed up, we store information about how you use the service to help us to improve it, and of course we record your shouts, watches, and conversations that you hold with other users on the system.

<h3>What we do with the information you provide us</h3>

We require this information to understand your needs and provide you with a better service, and in particular for the following reasons:

<ul>
  <li>Internal record keeping.</li>
  <li>Publication of shouts on this site, and syndication to other websites (including via our API)</li>
  <li>Sharing of shouts and watches with other Intently users and/or external service providers (via our API).</li>
  <li>Sharing of information you have provided about you or your company with buyers (or potential buyers) when you act as a supplier (we will show the buyer your visible name, email address, website, phone number, and information about you or your company).</li>
  <li>We may use the information to improve our service.</li>
  <li>We may periodically send emails to you (using the email address you provided) regarding changes and improvements to our service, special offers or other information which we think you may find interesting.  We will always give you the option to unsubscribe from such mailings.
  </li><li>From time to time, we may also use your information to contact you for market research purposes.  We may contact you by email or phone, and again you may request that we do not do this in future.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Security</h3>

We are committed to ensuring that your information is secure. In order to prevent unauthorised access or disclosure, we have put in place suitable physical, electronic and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we hold about you.

<h3>Account administration</h3>

From time to time, one of our administrators may edit your watch data to ensure that you are getting the best possible supplier alerts based on shouts being raised by users.  In addition, if you are signed up and raise a shout, we may occasionally raise a further shout on your behalf if we feel that we can better target potential suppliers for your needs.

<h3>Cookies</h3>

When we provide services, we want to make them easy, useful and reliable. Where services are delivered on the Internet, this sometimes involves placing small amounts of information on your device, for example, computer or mobile phone. These include small files known as cookies. They cannot be used to identify you personally.

These pieces of information are used to improve services for you through, for example:

<ul>
  <li>Enabling our service to recognise your device so you don't have to give the same information several times during one task.</li>
  <li>Recognising that you may already have given a username and password so you don't need to do it for every web page requested</li>
  <li>Measuring how many people are using our service, so it can be made easier to use and there's enough capacity to ensure it is fast.</li>
</ul>

You can choose to accept or decline cookies. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer.  Declining cookies will prevent you from taking full advantage of our service.


<h3>Links to other websites</h3>

Our website may contain links to other websites of interest.  However, once you have used these links to leave our site, you should note that we do not have any control over that other website.  Therefore, we cannot be responsible for the protection and privacy of any information which you provide whilst visiting such sites and such sites are not governed by this privacy statement.  You should exercise caution and look at the privacy statement applicable to the website in question.


<h3>Freedom of information</h3>

You may request details of personal information which we hold about you under the Data Protection Act 1998.  If you would like a copy of the information held on you please contact us at neil_intently@gmail.com.  If you believe that any information we are holding on you is incorrect or incomplete, please email us at neil_intently@gmail.com.  We will promptly correct any information found to be incorrect, or we will delete the information at your request.

<h3>Canceling your account</h3>

If you cancel your account, we will delete all of the information you have provided to us about you and your company.  We will also delete all of the data you have created through using our service (e.g. shouts, watches, and conversations with other people on the system).
