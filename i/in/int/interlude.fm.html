        <p>Interlude US Inc. (“Interlude” or “we”, “our” or “us”) respect(s) your privacy and we are committed to protect the information that you share with us. We believe that you have a right to know our practices regarding the information we may collect when you visit our website(s) at the address: www.interlude.fm or www.helloeko.com (the “Site”); view and interact with any of the Interactive Videos (as defined below); use our creative studio and related services (“Eko Studio”), including by uploading any video/audio content (e.g.: footage, video clips, graphics, start/end screen images, buttons, designs, etc.) (“Creator Generated Content”), through use of Eko Studio, and through the use of the Interlude Player.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong style="font-style: inherit;">PLEASE READ CAREFULLY:</strong></p>
<p>THIS PRIVACY POLICY MAY BE REVISED AND UPDATED FROM TIME TO TIME, WITH OR WITHOUT NOTICE. INTERLUDE SHALL MAKE REASONABLE EFFORTS TO POST A PROMINENT NOTICE IN CASE ANY OF THE TERMS OF THIS POLICY SHALL CHANGE SUBSTANTIALLY. INTERLUDE URGES YOU TO CHECK THE “LAST REVISED” DATE APPEARING AT THE TOP OF THIS PRIVACY POLICY IN ORDER TO BE UPDATED.

<p>1.&nbsp;<strong style="font-style: inherit;">Collection of Information</strong></p>
<p>Interlude may collect both non-personally identifiable statistical information (“Non-Identifiable Information”) and individually identifiable information (“Personal Information”).</p>

Demographic information shall be collected using the Google Analytics Demographics and Interest Reporting Tool. More information can be found here:&nbsp;<a style="font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit;" href="https://www.google.com/intl/en/analytics/learn/privacy.html">https://www.google.com/intl/en/analytics/learn/privacy.html</a>.</p>

This helps us continue to improve the Site and Materials for you. We may also use the above-described information to tailor our content to suit your needs. In addition, the User Interaction Data may be used for Interlude’s internal research and development, and for marketing purposes, and we reserve the right to receive compensation for providing this information to third parties, including our clients.</p>
