                                The account system helps us to credit your account properly (if you order a paid ad), 
				while streamlining the process of placing multiple
                                ads -- all you need is a username and password

                                address.&nbsp; We contact you by email to

                                information is shared on the website unless you
                                specifically include that information in your ad.&nbsp;
                                Your real name is never revealed by us.&nbsp;
                                All information is provided by you, the user, at
                                your discretion.&nbsp; We do suggest, however,
                                that you provide on your ads only the contact
                                information you feel comfortable giving.&nbsp;
                                An example may be a business email address or
                                phone number, and perhaps the 'city, state'
                                location of the business.&nbsp; Furthermore, do
                                not share your password.&nbsp; We do not ask for

                                Most e-commerce websites advocate consumer
                                privacy and do their best to uphold the privacy
                                of Internet users.&nbsp; Kingdom Classifieds is no exception
                                to this rule. As mentioned above, we do NOT
                                share user information, nor do we make this
                                information available online.&nbsp; One aspect
                                of privacy is the theft of sensitive financial
                                information.&nbsp; You should use only one
                                credit card to make all your purchases on the
                                Internet.&nbsp; Be sure when entering credit
                                card information that you are on a secure page
                                (a closed lock symbol on your browser status
                                bar, and the web address starts with
