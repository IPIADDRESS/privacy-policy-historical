In the course of our business, it is necessary to collect Personal Information about our potential clients. We take this activity seriously and seek to provide fair, secure and appropriate methods for the handling of Personal Information. All such activities are intended to be consistent with both generally accepted privacy ethics and standard business practices. Your Personal Information may be shared with a limited number of trusted partners and/or affiliates of LCG where such use is restricted to the management of your account and will not breach any elements of the UK Data Protection Act 1998.</p>
                    <p>If you have any questions or comments about London Capital Group's Privacy Policy, you can contact our Customer Care Team: <a href="mailto:support@intertrader.com">support@intertrader.com</a> or +44 (0)20 7456 7677.</p>
                    <h4>Personally Identifiable Information</h4>
                    <p>London Capital Group will only collect Personal Information when you specifically and knowingly provide it to us. If you open a London Capital Group live spread betting account, you will be asked for information regarding your name and address, employment and salary details. As part of the current anti-money laundering regulations, we are required to establish proof of your identity and address details. This process is conducted using information provided by Identification Verification agencies. You may be asked to supply additional information to support any unsuccessful verification attempts.</p>
                    <p>Where stated we may use the Personal Information you provide to contact you in the future about London Capital Group's products and services. We only hold data which is necessary to offer the services provided on our website.</p>
                    <h4>Third Party Sites</h4>
                    <p>This website contains links to other websites. Please be notified that London Capital Group cannot be held responsible for the privacy practices of other websites. We encourage all visitors to be aware and read the privacy statements of each and every website that collects personally identifiable information.</p>

                    <h4>UK Data Protection Act 1998</h4>
                    <p>The Government of the United Kingdom passed a Data Protection Act in 1998.

                    <h4>Retention of Records</h4>
                    <p>We will keep Personal Information only as long as it is necessary, including for the purposes of updating the product or services or as required by law. When the Personal Information is no longer required, it will be destroyed either by shredding or other approved destruction methods to prevent unauthorized parties from gaining access to the information during and after the process.</p>
                    <p>We will safeguard information in our custody.</p>
                    <p>We have developed and will maintain security procedures to safeguard Personal Information against loss, theft, copying, and unauthorised disclosure, use or modification. Access to Personal Information is restricted to employees and authorised service providers who need it to perform their work.</p>
