In the event of a material change, we shall notify you via email or by means of a prominent notice on the website. This Privacy Policy Statement applies exclusively to www.Interview Mocha.com.</p>
        <br>
        <p>This Privacy Statement explains what information Insaas Software Private Limited ("insaas" or "Interview Mocha" or "Interview Mocha.com" or we), owners of the domain www.Interview Mocha.com collects on http://www.Interview Mocha.com and internet tools accessible from this web site ("Web Site"), how Interview Mocha uses that information, your choices and this Web Site's other privacy practices. This Privacy Statement only covers information collected at this Web Site, and does not cover any information collected at any other web site or offline by Interview Mocha, our affiliates or any other company (unless specifically stated). Please read this Privacy Statement carefully.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>INFORMATION COLLECTED</h2>
        <p>
            We collect two kinds of information from you: non-personal information and personal information.
            Personal information is information we collect through this Web Site that we can use to specifically identify you, and may include your:
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>•	name, telephone number, social security number and e-mail address</p>
        <br>
        <p>•	credit card or similar information</p>
        <br>
        <p>•	past employment history</p>
        <br>
        <p>•	information you provide in online tests, including responses to test questions</p>
        <br>
        <p>You have the right to request the modification or deletion of any personal information retained by Interview Mocha that is inaccurate, except that information relating to your test scores and performance, as set forth below. You understand that Interview Mocha, in its sole discretion, will determine whether personal information should be modified or deleted.</p>
        <br>
        <p>We collect personal information from you through the Web Site only when you voluntarily share it with us, such as when you fill out a registration form, an online survey, or send us an e-mail; if you choose to purchase a product or apply for a job with us or our clients; or when you use one of our online forms.</p>
        <br>
        <p><strong>Non-personal information</strong> is information we collect through this Web Site that does not identify you by name or as an individual person. It may include information like:</p>
        <br>
        <p>•	the type of web browser software your computer uses;</p>
        <br>
        <p>•	pages your computer visited and date and time your computer accessed our pages;</p>
        <br>
        <p>•	personal information that has been de-identified; and</p>
        <br>
        <p>•	the ip (internet protocol) address associated with your computer.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Cookies: We collect non-personal information from your computer's web browser. A cookie is an information file that the Web Site places on your computer for record keeping and site navigation purposes. The cookie placed on your computer by the Web Site does not store your name, e-mail address or any other personal information about you. Your browser software can be set to reject cookies, including the cookie from our Web Site. However, please note that if you reject our cookies, you will not be able to use this Web Site.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>USE AND DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION</h2>
        <br>
        <p>We do not restrict the ways that we use or disclose non-personal information. We will use non-personal information from you to help us make this Web Site more useful to users and for other business purposes</p>
        <br>
        <p>For instance, we may use non-personal information to:</p>
        <br>
        <p>•	create reports to develop programs, products, services or content</p>
        <br>
        <p>•	customize the information or services that are of interest to you, or</p>
        <br>
        <p>•	share it with or sell it to third parties</p>
        <br>
        <p>We may use personal information we collect from you through this Web Site:</p>
        <br>
        <p>•	to respond to your requests, including your request to be evaluated for possible employment opportunities;</p>
        <br>

        <p>•	for analytical purposes and to research, develop and improve programs, products, services and content;</p>
        <br>
        <p>•	to remove your personal identifiers (your name, e-mail address, social security number, etc). in this case, you would no longer be identified as a single unique individual. once we have de-identified information, it is non-personal information and we may use and treat it like other non-personal information;</p>
        <br>
        <p>•	contact you regarding any problems or questions we have relating to your use of the web site, or, in our discretion, notify you of changes to our privacy statement, terms of use or other policy or terms that affect you or your use of the web site;</p>
        <br>
        <p>•	to enforce this privacy statement or the terms of use;</p>
        <br>
        <p>•	to protect our rights or property;</p>
        <br>
        <p>•	to protect someone's health, safety or welfare; or</p>
