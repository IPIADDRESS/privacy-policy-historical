					<small><p>Personal information on this Site is collected by Interval. Interval world headquarters are located at:</p><p>6262 Sunset Drive, Miami, Florida 33143 and its telephone number is 888-784-3447.</p><p>The Site contains links to other sites at which personal information is collected.

That privacy policy should identify the entity that is collecting your personal information.</p></small>
					

					<a name="4"> </a>
					<h3>Collection of information</h3>					
					<small><p>As a visitor to this Site, you can engage in many activities without providing any personal information. In connection with other activities, such as registering on the site, performing an exchange or purchasing a getaway, we may ask you to provide certain information about yourself, such as your first and last name, mailing address (including ZIP code), member number, e-mail address, telephone and facsimile numbers and if you transact business with Interval, financial information such as your payment method (valid credit card number, type, expiration date or other financial information). Depending upon the activity, some of the information that we ask you to provide is identified as mandatory and some as voluntary. If you do not provide the mandatory data with respect to a particular activity, you will not be able to engage in that activity.</p><p>Interval may also collect and store personal information about other people that you provide to us.&nbsp; For example, if you use the Site to make cruise or other travel reservations through our system, we may store your personal information and the personal information of each such travel companion.</p><p>When you submit personal information to Interval through this Site, you understand and agree that this information may be transferred across national boundaries and may be stored and processed in any of the countries in which Interval and its affiliates and subsidiaries maintain offices, including, without limitation, the United States. You also acknowledge that in certain countries or with respect to certain activities, the collection, transfer, storage, and processing of your information may be undertaken by third-party vendors of Interval. Such vendors are bound by contract not to use your personal information for their own purposes or provide it to any third parties.</p><p>Interval has established relationships with various third parties whose services are available to you from this Site or from Web sites that are linked to this Site. Typically, these providers offer services that Interval customers might find useful, such as those that can be used in conjunction with Interval services and products. In order to use those services, you may be required to provide personal information to the providers. Unless expressly provided to the contrary, personal information that you provide while you are visiting a provider's Web site will be subject to the privacy policy posted on such site, and personal information that you provide while on this Site in conjunction with a provider's service will be subject to this Privacy Policy. You should be aware that our agreements with these service providers often provide that they will share with Interval personal information collected from you. In such instances, Interval may use this information in a manner consistent with this Privacy Policy. In the situation where sites have an Interval "look and feel," and you reasonably believe you are on an Interval site, the site is collecting information in a solely intermediary capacity and does not use personal information for secondary purposes.</p><p>Additionally, as a result of a business relationship with DoubleClick, a division of Google, Inc., we may allow third-parties, including our service providers, advertising companies, and ad networks, to display advertisements on our Site. Our Site does not provide any personal information to these third parties. These companies may use tracking technologies, such as <a href="#linked-cookies">cookies</a>, to collect information about users who view or interact with their advertisements. This information allows them to deliver targeted advertisements and gauge their effectiveness. If you would like to opt out of such ad targeting from DoubleClick, please click on the following link: <a href="http://www.doubleclick.com/privacy/index.aspx">http://www.doubleclick.com/privacy/index.aspx</a><br><br>
Use of cookies. When you visit this Site, you can browse the Site and access important information without revealing your identity. In order to improve our Site, we use "<a href="#linked-cookies">cookies</a>" to track your visit. A cookie is a small amount of data that is transferred to your browser by a Web server and can only be read by the server that gave it to you. It functions as your identification card, and enables Interval to record your travel and site preferences. It cannot be executed as code or deliver viruses.<br><br>
Most browsers are initially set to accept cookies. You can set your browser to notify you when you receive a cookie, giving you the chance to decide whether to accept it. (For some Web pages that require an authorization, cookies are not optional. Users choosing not to accept cookies will probably not be able to access those pages.)<br><br>
While Interval uses cookies to track your visit to our Site, and our web servers automatically log the IP/Internet address of your computer, we use this information for such purposes as responding to your requests, customizing future visits for you, improving our products and services, and communicating with you. In essence, we strive to ‘customize’ the look and feel of our Site to cater to your specific needs.&nbsp; We may collect information such as country of residence, member id, master resort code and other information that are exclusive to each individual so that we may provide you with a better experience while you are visiting our Site.</p><blockquote style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px" dir="ltr"><p>Your experience on our Site will be maximized if you keep cookies enabled. For example, cookies make it possible for:</p><ul><li>- us to personalize your experience of our Site</li><li>- you to use the convenience of Remember Me to avoid reentering your member number and password on every visit.</li></ul><p>If you prefer that we not place cookies on your computer, select the button below:</p><div style="MARGIN-LEFT: 4em"><p>&nbsp;</p><form onsubmit="return validateNoCookiesForm(this);" method="get" name="NoCookiesForm" action="/web/cs"><input name="a" value="103" type="hidden"><p align="center"><input class="button2" value="Disable Cookies" type="submit"></p></form><p>&nbsp;</p></div><p>Please note that <b>Remember Me</b> requires that a cookie be stored on your computer.</p></blockquote><p dir="ltr">Other Technologies. Interval may also use standard Internet technology, such as <a href="#linked-web-beacons">web beacons</a> and other similar technologies, to track your use of the Site. Interval may include web beacons in promotional e-mail messages or newsletters to determine whether messages have been opened and acted upon. The information Interval obtains in this manner enables us to customize the services we offer our Site visitors to deliver targeted advertisements and to measure the overall effectiveness of our online advertising, content, programming or other activities.</p></small>

					<h3>How your personal information is used</h3>					
					<small><p>Interval collects your information in order to record and support your participation in the activities you select.

Additionally we may provide your contact information (with the exception of e-mail address) to an authorized third party for the purpose of providing you with certain marketing promotions which extend Interval benefits and services.

In those cases, your personal information (e-mail, name, address, telephone number) is not transferred to the third party.<br><br>
Interval may collect information about the use of the Site, such as the types of services used and how many users we receive daily.
