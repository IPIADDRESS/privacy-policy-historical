<h2>Intelius Privacy Policy</h2>

<div id="privacy" class="F5">
<p>Effective April 5, 2013</p>

<p>Intelius respects your right to privacy and we are committed to protecting it. This statement discloses the information practices for the web pages associated with the domain intelius.com (the "Website"), including what type of personal information we gather and track, how we use this personal information, and with whom we share the personal information.</p>
<p>Intelius has been awarded TRUSTe's Privacy Seal signifying that this privacy policy and practices have been reviewed by TRUSTe for compliance with <a target="_blank" href="http://www.truste.com/privacy_seals_and_services/consumer_privacy/privacy-programs-requirements.html">TRUSTe's program requirements</a> including transparency, accountability and choice regarding the collection and use of your personal information. TRUSTe's mission, as an independent third party, is to accelerate online trust among consumers and organizations globally through its leading privacy trustmark and innovative trust solutions.</p>
<p>If you have questions or concerns regarding this Policy, you should first contact our Chief Privacy Officer, at <a href="mailto:privacy@intelius.com">privacy@intelius.com</a>. If you do not receive acknowledgement of your inquiry or your inquiry has not been satisfactorily addressed, you should contact <a target="_blank" href="http://watchdog.truste.com/pvr.php?page=complaint">TRUSTe here</a>. TRUSTe will then serve as a liaison with us to resolve your concerns. The TRUSTe program only covers information that is collected through this website, and does not cover information that may be collected through any software downloaded from this website.</p>

<p class="clrfloat"><strong>Personal Information</strong></p>
<p>In general, you can visit us on the Internet without telling us who you are and without giving any personal information about yourself. However, you may choose to give us personal information in a variety of situations. For example, you may want to give us information such as your name and address, phone number or e-mail address so we may correspond with you, process an order, or provide you with a subscription or service. You may give us your credit card details to buy a product or service from us, or provide us a description of your education and work experience in connection with a job opening at Intelius for which you wish to be considered. The purpose of this Policy is to inform you of how we will use your information, before you provide it. If you tell us that you do not want us to use this information in this manner or to make further contact with you beyond fulfilling your requests, we will respect your wishes. If you give us personal information about somebody else, such as a spouse or associate, we will assume that you have their permission to do so.</p>

<p class="clrfloat"><strong>How to Remove your Information from the Intelius Public Records Databases</strong></p>
<p>Public records are available from the official public records custodian or repository to anyone who requests them. In addition to public records, personal information may be publicly or commercially available. Publicly available information consists of online and offline information that is generally available but is not maintained by a government agency, such as names, addresses and telephone numbers of individuals and businesses, professional licensing and trade organization information, press releases and newspaper articles and content from blogs or social networking sites. Commercial records consist of information that is maintained by enterprises and is available for purchase, such as marketing and telemarketing lists, phone connect and disconnect information, and business profile data.</p>
<p>As a courtesy we enable you to opt out your personal information from our website. What this means is that your name as it appears in a particular record and the associated identifying information such as your address and phone number will be suppressed if you request this in the manner described below. However, please note that any time your identifying information appears in a public record or in a publicly or commercially available manner, in a way that is different from the particular record you opted out, it may again appear on our website. For example, if your address or area code changes, your new information -- including other associated identifying information  may again appear unless you opt out the new record. Similarly, if the way in which your name or address appears in a record differs from a record you opted out (e.g., "Michael" instead of "Mike," or "1212 Second AVE NE" instead of "1212-2nd Avenue Northeast"), we may include the differing record. Please also note that there may be more than one record on our website associated with your personal information. Opting out one particular record will not opt out other record(s). Your opt out will apply from processing date forward; any report purchased prior to your opt out will still be available to the purchaser therof in accordance with the terms of our service. In addition to this website, there are many other companies offering public records search services, and your request that we opt out your information from this website will not prevent your information from appearing on these other services.</p>
<p>The quickest and simplest way to have your information removed from our website is to send us a request online. You can also submit an opt-out request via fax or postal mail. Regardless of which method you choose, in order for us to suppress your personal information from appearing on our website, we need to verify your identity. To do this, we need proof of identity, consisting of either:</p>
<ul>
   <li>a copy of a government-issued ID with any photo or ID number crossed out. Examples: driver's license, U.S. passport, U.S. military ID card, state-issued ID card, or employee ID card from a state agency, or</li>
   <li><a target="_blank" href="https://intelius.com/docs/notaryverificationform.pdf">a notarized Identity Verification Form</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>We will only use this information to process your opt out request.</p>
<p>If you opt-out online, please be sure to include your email address so that we can notify you both when your request is received and when we've completed your opt out.</p>
<dl>
   <dt>Online</dt><dd><a href="http://intelius.com/optout.php">Intelius Online Opt-Out Form</a> (<a href="http://intelius.com/optout.php">https://intelius.com/optout.php</a>)</dd>
</dl>

<p>If you submit your opt-out request via fax or postal mail, in addition to your proof of identity, please include the following so we can accurately identify your records:</p>
<ul>
   <li>Name</li>
   <li>Date of birth</li>
   <li>Address</li>
</ul>

<p>Here is the contact information for submitting your request:</p>
<dl>
   <dt>Fax</dt><dd>(425) 974-6194</dd>
   <dt>Mail</dt><dd>P.O. Box 4145<br>Bellevue, WA 98009-4145</dd>
</dl>
<p>Your information will be removed from our database in approximately 7-14 days.</p>

We do not share, sell, rent, or trade your personal information with third parties for their marketing purposes. <span class="highlight">Third Party Monitoring</span>. In addition, service providers and other third parties such as advertisers may also use information-gathering technologies on this website (including cookies and beacons) in connection with their services to collect anonymous information. Cookies used for this purpose do not contain personally identifiable information.  This shared and/or collected information is controlled by the relevant affiliated company or third party and is not controlled by us; specifically, (i) such information is governed by the privacy policy and terms of use of the relevant other party and (ii) we will in no way be responsible or liable to you for any data breach by such other party that compromises or otherwise affects your information.</p>

<p class="clrfloat"><strong>Third Party Advertisers</strong></p>
We may use third-party advertising companies to serve ads on our behalf. These companies may employ cookies and action tags (also known as single pixel gifs or web beacons) to measure advertising effectiveness.
