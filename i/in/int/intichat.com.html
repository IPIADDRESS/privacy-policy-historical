<p align="left">We may collect personally identifiable information that you knowingly provide to us. For example, we may ask you to provide personally identifiable contact information (such as name, address, e-mail address and telephone number). In some cases (for example, if you register with us (or sign-in on this Website), we may also ask you to provide other information such as a personal ID, password, and a security question and answer.</p>
<p align="left">In addition, as you (and other users) browse this Website, our web servers may automatically collect certain information about such visits (usually through the use of cookies, javascript tags, clear .gif files (also known as “web beacons”), and the analysis of http headers), such as the user’s IP address, the user’s geographic location, the user’s domain name, the user’s browser type, the user’s user agent, how many users visit this Website, which pages the user visits and for how long, the date and time the user accesses this Website, the Internet address of the site from which the user directly linked to this Website and the links on this Website on which the user clicks. In addition, we may collect certain search parameters relating to searches conducted by the user which are not entered by the user.</p>
<p align="left">To improve the services we can offer you, we may decide to expand this Web Site’s capabilities for obtaining information about users in the future. We will update this Privacy Policy as our practices change to ensure that you are aware of developments in this area.</p>
<p align="left">If we collect such information, we may use it for a number of purposes, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>To establish and maintain a commercial relationship with you and to provide you with products and services.&nbsp;</b>Account information may be retained by us to enable our website to identify you, to allow you to set up and access your account (if applicable) and to change your account information and/or services. This information is used only for these purposes and is only retained in transaction records required for internal management and auditing purposes, unless you are informed otherwise or you provide your consent or we are required to disclose same pursuant to a court order or other legal process.</li>

However, your name, address, email and telephone number may be required to take advantage of bonuses or other benefits which are available to survey participants, in which case your contact information will only be used for notification and fulfillment purposes.</li>
<li><b>To manage and administer our business</b>. The nature of the Internet is such that it passively and automatically collects certain information about a user’s traffic patterns, which may be linked to their Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. These are unique Internet “addresses” assigned to all Web users by their Internet Service Providers (ISP). Server logs record statistical information, such as visitors’ IP addresses, type of operating systems, time and duration of visit, web pages requested, and identify visitors by categories such as domains and browser types. These statistics are only used on an aggregate basis and will not contain any information that could identify you personally.</li>
<li><b>To meet legal, regulatory, security and processing requirements</b>&nbsp;(such as in response to a court order), and otherwise as permitted or required by law. We may also use this personal information to contact you regarding any such legal, regulatory, security, or processing requirements, and may be required to disclose this information pursuant to our Terms of Service.</li>
