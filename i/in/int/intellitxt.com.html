                  <p><span class="bold">Vibrant Media’s Inquiry Form:</span><br>
                    The Vibrant Media Website contains an “inquiry form” 
                    for web publishers to request additional information about 
                    Vibrant Media’s products/services. The inquiry form requires 
                    web publishers to give contact information (such as name and 
                    email address.) Vibrant Media uses this information to contact 
                    Web Publishers about the services on the Website in which 
                    they have expressed interest.</p>
                  <p>Web Publishers have the option to provide demographic information 
                    (such as website address and vertical sector) to Vibrant Media. 
                    Vibrant Media encourages them to submit this information so 
                    it can provide them a more customized reply to their inquiry.</p>
                  <p><span class="bold">Insertion Orders</span><br>
                    If an advertiser purchases a service from Vibrant Media, Vibrant 
                    Media requests certain personal and company identity information 
                    from the advertiser on the insertion form. Advertisers must 
                    provide contact information (such as name, company name, street 
                    address, email and telephone number) and financial information. 
                    Vibrant Media uses this information to provide services and 
                    for billing purposes. If Vibrant Media has trouble processing 
                    an order, it will use this information to contact the advertiser.</p>
                  <p><span class="bold">Web Publisher Service Agreement</span><br>
                    If a Web Publisher signs a service agreement, Vibrant Media 
                    requires the Web Publisher to provide certain identifiable 
                    information including: name, company name, street address, 
                    email and telephone number. This information is necessary 
                    to process the Web Publisher’s agreement.</p>
                  <p><span class="bold">Web Publisher Sign-up form</span><br>
                    When a Web Publisher signs a service agreement with Vibrant 
                    Media, the Web Publisher is also required to provide company 
                    and personal identity information, commercial information, 
                    technical contact information and customization information 
                    to start their contextual advertising services. Vibrant Media 
                    uses this information to provide services and for payment 
                    purposes. If Vibrant Media has trouble processing an order, 
                    it will use this information to contact the Web Publisher.</p>
                  <p><span class="bold">Advertising Network Service Agreement 
                    </span><br>
                    When a Advertising Network signs a service agreement with 
                    Vibrant Media, the Advertising Network is also required to 
                    provide company, personal identity information and commercial 
                    information. Vibrant Media uses this information to provide 
                    services and for payment purposes. If Vibrant Media has trouble 
                    processing an order, it will use this information to contact 
                    the Advertising Network.</p>
                  <p><span class="bold">Service-related Announcements</span><br>
                    Vibrant Media will send Web Publishers service-related announcements 
                    on rare occasions when it is necessary to do so.</p>
                  <p>Generally, a Web Publisher may not opt-out of these communications, 
                    which are not promotional in nature. If a Web Publisher does 
                    not wish to receive these communications, they have the option 
                    to deactivate their account according to the terms of their 
                    Web Services Agreement.</p>
                  <p><span class="bold">Customer Service</span><br>
                    Based upon the provided personally identifiable information, 
                    Vibrant Media will send Web Publishers a welcoming email to 
                    verify their username and password and to set up their account. 
                    Vibrant Media will also communicate with them in response 
                    to their inquiries, to provide the services they request, 
                    and to manage their account. Vibrant Media will communicate 
                    with Web Publishers by email or telephone, in accordance with 
                    their wishes.</p>
                  <p><span class="bold">Legal Disclaimer:</span> Vibrant Media 
                    may disclose user information in special cases when we have
