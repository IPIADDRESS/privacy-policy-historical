	<h2>Integrys Energy Group, Inc. (Integrys)<br>
	Web Site Privacy Policy</h2>
		
	<p><i>(Revised January 1, 2007)</i></p>
				
	<p>Integrys Energy Group (also referred to as "we" or "us") is
	concerned about preventing unauthorized disclosure of customer information.
	We understand the importance you place on the privacy and security of information
	that personally identifies you or your account information. We refer to this
	information as "personal information." We want you to know what personal
	information we collect and how we use it. We have therefore adopted the
	following Privacy Policy to explain our commitment to your privacy. If you
	have any questions about our policy after reading it, please
	<a href="https://accel.integrysgroup.com/secure/ssl/contact.aspx" title="Contact Us">contact us</a>.</p>
	
	<p>By using the Web site, you agree to be bound by this Privacy Policy. Please
	check this policy frequently, as we may amend it from time to time to reflect
	changes in our services and our policies relating to customer information.
	Amendments will become effective at the time they are posted on our Web site.
	We will not provide notice of changes in this Privacy Policy.</p>
	
	<p>You may be asked to submit personal information such as
	your name, address, phone number and e-mail address. We will protect all
	information that you provide us on the Web site, as set forth below:</p>
	
	<ol class="siteSpacedList">
		<li>The personal information you provide us not only enables you to access
		various services offered on the Web site, but also enables us to provide
		you with better service. We may use this information to contact you to
		respond to an inquiry that you send to Integrys. 
		If you choose to communicate with Integrys by e-mail, 
		then e-mail from Integrys to you will be considered
		to be sent with your consent and will be accessible to anyone who has
		access to your e-mail.</li>
		<li>In order to provide you with services offered on the Web site, or 
		to complete transactions or requests initiated by you on the Web site, 
		we may transfer you to a Web site operated by third parties that help 
		us provide services to you. In such cases, we will have agreements with 
		those parties under which they will agree to maintain the confidentiality 
		of your personal information and to use it only for the purpose of helping 
		us serve you. We only transfer or share information to those who have 
		a privacy policy at least as stringent or substantially similar to 
		Integrys.</li>
		<li>Other than as set forth herein, we will not disclose your personal 
		information to third parties without your written consent (which consent 
		may be obtained electronically, such as by e-mail), unless we reasonably 
		believe that the disclosure is essential to the conduct of 
		Integrys's business, 
		including but not limited to where such disclosure is necessary to (a) 
		comply with the law, legal process or our regulators, (b) collect unpaid 
		bills, (c) enable Integrys's employees or 
		consultants to provide service to 
		you and to otherwise perform their duties, (d) comply with interchange 
		functions, (e) obtain and provide credit reporting information, or (f) 
		resolve customer disputes or inquiries. We do not provide your personal 
		information to third parties for the purpose of telemarketing, e-mail or 
		direct-mail solicitation.</li>
		<li>You should protect the confidentiality of your username and password. 
		You are responsible for all activity on the Web site accessed by your 
		username and password. Access by Integrys's 
		employees or consultants to any 
		personal information you provide is limited to only that necessary to 
		provide the business service offered and to otherwise allow such employees 
		or consultants to perform their duties.</li>
	</ol>
	
	<h3>Visitor Information</h3>
	
	<p>We do collect information about the Web site use, such as the number 
	of visitors to the Web site and the number of users that click on 
	certain links or services. For some applications, we link usage information 
	with the particular customer visiting the Web site. We use industry 
	standard software to create summary statistics of the usage data we 
	collect, which may then be used to highlight what our visitors find 
	interesting, to improve our Web site design specifications, to identify 
	system performance issues, and for other internal purposes.</p>
	
	<h3>Our Use of Your IP Address</h3>
	
	<p>An Internet Protocol ("IP") address is a number that is automatically 
	assigned to your computer every time that you browse the Internet. When 
	you visit the Web site, our servers log your current IP address. We may 
	use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our servers and to 
	administer our Web site. Data gathered from logging your IP address is 
	not tied to your personal information and is not used to identify you.</p>
	
	<h3>Our Use of Cookies</h3>
	
	<p>Cookies are small text files placed on your computer's hard drive by 
	Web page servers. When you visit the Web site, our server may create 
	"session" cookies, making it more convenient for you to use our site by 
	verifying when you travel from page to page that you have signed up with 
	our online services. Data on Web site usage that we collect using cookies 
	is not tied to your personal information and is only used in aggregate 
	form. We do not retain "persistent" cookies documenting your visit to 
	the Web site after you have exited your browser.</p>
	
	<p>While browsing the Web site, you may encounter hypertext links to 
	other Web sites operated by third parties. These other Web sites may 
	send their own cookies to you, log your IP address, and otherwise 
	collect data or solicit personal information.</p>
	
	<p><b>We do not control 
	and are not responsible for what third parties do in connection 
	with their Web sites, or how they handle your personal information. 
	Please exercise caution and consult the privacy policies posted 
	on such Web sites for further information.</b></p>
