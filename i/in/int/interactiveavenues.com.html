<ul>
	<li>
		enables Advertisers to better reach their target audiences; and</li>
	<li>
		enable Publishers to support, grow and monetize their websites through the sale of advertisements.</li>
</ul>
(collectively referred to as the ‘Services’)<br>
<br>
This Privacy Policy is as per the Indian Information Technology Act, 2000 and the Information Technology (Reasonable security and procedures and sensitive personal data or information) Rules, 2011 prescribed thereunder, (“Applicable Law”) that is intended to provide visitors to our site with clear and complete information about the data and information that we collect in connection with our Services and the way that data and information is stored and used by our Company.<br>
<br>
<strong>Information We Collect</strong><br>
<br>
<u>Non-Personal Information Collected by our Services.</u> We deliver advertisements from hundreds of Advertisers across a large number of Publisher websites. When you visit our website, our automated system may collect "click stream data" related to your visit to our website. Click stream data is anonymous and can include information such as your IP address, Operating System details, Browser details, <web pages="" viewed="">, the date and time at which those pages were viewed and interaction with content and advertisements on those web pages. Technologies used to collect this click stream data, include cookies and web beacons.<br>
<br>
We utilize the non-personal information, described above to better customize the sort of advertisements you see. We also aggregate anonymous cookie data in order to identify large audience segments that assist Advertisers in targeting their campaigns to the most relevant Internet audience. We store the information collected in log files, and log files are retained in our systems for a reasonable period of time. Anonymous data stored in our log files, that associates the log data to a particular computer include IP address and cookie ID. We purge the IP address and irreversibly obfuscate the cookie ID from our log files as soon as we believe this information is no longer required by us.<br>
<br>
<strong>Consumer Choice - Opting Out of Receiving Cookies</strong> We use technology, which includes cookies and web beacons in the delivery of our Services. We believe that the use of these tools enables us to provide users with a more meaningful web experience. You may adjust your computer's web browser settings to refuse all cookies. However, please note that because cookies are widely used, disabling the use of cookies in your web browser may interfere with full use of various websites.<br>
<br>
You may opt out of receiving Interactive Avenues cookies by <a class="readmore" href="http://www.interactiveavenues.com/thankyou.html">clicking here</a><br>

You can also opt out of receiving cookies from Interactive Avenues by <a class="readmore" href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp" target="_blank">clicking here</a></web><br>
<br>
Through this opt-out procedure, your computer will request an "opt-out cookie" ID tag that will prevent your anonymous data from being matched to your computer and thereby prevent us from using that data to deliver targeted advertising or other content to your computer's browser. Please note that this opt-out process will erase the cookie ID associated with your computer but not the cookie itself - the cookie itself must remain on your computer in order for us to recognize you as an opt-out user. This means that if you use multiple computers or multiple browsers you will need to opt out of receiving cookies on each computer and for each browser. Also, if you change computers or delete cookies from your computer you will need to repeat this opt-out process.<br>

We reserve the right to disclose personal data or information you have disclosed to us in response to any judicial process or court order or to provide information to law enforcement agencies or in connection with an investigation of matters related to public safety, as permitted by Applicable Law. In addition, your non-personal information and your personal data or information shall be shared, without obtaining prior consent from you, with Government agencies mandated under the Applicable Law to obtain information for the purpose of verification of identity, or to prevention, detection, investigation including cyber incidents, prosecution and punishment of offences.<br>
<br>

This includes undertaking necessary physical, electronic and management activities required to protect data integrity, access and use. Any data that is stored on our servers is treated as confidential and is not made generally available to the public. Our servers are protected by firewalls and are located in secure data facilities to further increase security. Please keep in mind, however, that despite these reasonable efforts to protect data on our servers no method of transmission over the Internet is guaranteed to be secure. Therefore, while we strive to protect your personal data or information at all times, we cannot guarantee its absolute security and shall not be liable for any breach of security by an outside party.<br>
<br>
<strong>Transfer of Information Upon Change of Control:</strong> In the event that another company acquires all or substantially all of the assets of our business through a consolidation, merger, asset, purchase or other transaction, we reserve the right to transfer all data (including any personal data or information) that is in our possession or under our control to such acquiring party and thereafter the Privacy Policy of such acquiring party shall govern all such data and any personal data or information that is transferred to the acquiring party.<br>
<br>
<strong>Changes to this Privacy Policy:</strong> We reserve the right to make changes to this Privacy Policy by posting an updated version on this page. The date on which the current Privacy Policy was posted will always be noted at the top of this page. Any change we make to our Privacy Policy will be made in compliance with Applicable Law.<br>
