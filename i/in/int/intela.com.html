					<p><strong>Privacy Policy </strong><br>
Last Updated July 30, 2008</p>
<p>This Privacy Policy governs your use of this web site and any  content, products or services made available from or through this  website including any sub domains thereof (“Web Site”). The Website is  made available by Intela, LLC hereafter referred to as (“Company”).</p>
<p>By visiting this Web Site and requesting information, products or  services offered on or through this Web Site, you agree to the terms of  this Privacy Policy, as they may be amended from time to time. As  Company updates or expands its Web Site, services or products, this  Privacy Policy may change and the changes are effective upon posting.  Please check back frequently for updates as it is your sole  responsibility to be aware of changes. Company does not provide notice  of changes in any manner other than by posting the changes at this Web  Site. This Privacy Policy is incorporated into, and part of, the Web  Site Terms and Conditions of Use (“Terms of Use”), which governs your  use of this Web Site in general. This Web Site is hosted in the United  States of America. The Privacy Policy shall be interpreted under the  laws of the United States.</p>
<p><strong>Purpose of the Privacy Policy. </strong></p>
<p>The purpose of this Policy is to describe the information  collection, use, and dissemination practices of Company, its parent,  subsidiaries and registered d/b/a companies (Collectively Referred  herein after as “Company”) and all related websites owned or registered  to Company and applies to Company’s collection, use, storage and  disclosure of information by Company on its (a) websites, including all  its divisions, subsidiaries and related companies (collectively, the  “Websites”), (b) on various Third Party websites, and (c) to Company’s  other information collection, including the acquisition of customer  information from third parties.</p>
<p>By reference, this Privacy Policy is incorporated into and is  subject to the Terms of Use pertaining to the use of the website. Your  use of the website and any personal information you provide via the  website or through other official Company contact remains subject to  this Privacy Policy as well as the applicable Terms and Conditions for  use of the site or services and products contained thereon.</p>
<p>By providing us with your personal information on our website or in  the course of using our services, you consent to and acknowledge that  your personal data, including any sensitive personal data is being  transferred by you to a server in the United States. You also consent to  any other data we acquire about you from third-party service providers.</p>
<p><strong>Information Collection, Use, and Dissemination practices. </strong></p>
<p>This policy applies to Company’s collection, use, storage and  disclosure of information by Company on its, (a) websites, including all  its parent companies, divisions, subsidiaries and related companies  (collectively, the “Websites”), (b) on various third party websites, and  (c) to Company’s other information collection, including the transfer  of opt-in customer lists from third parties, or the use of customer  opt-in lists from third parties. Company is not responsible for the  information collection or privacy practices of third party websites or  applications.</p>
<p><strong>1. Collection of Information.</strong></p>
<p><strong>1.1. User Direct Information.</strong> Each time you provide  information via the Website, Company may obtain and collect personally  identifiable information provided by you, including, but not limited to,  your name, email address, mailing address, social security number,  credit card information, and telephone or cell phone number. You may  also provide us with information that, when combined with personally  identifiable information, provides us with a better idea of who you are,  including but not limited to your gender, birthday, marital status, and  education level (collectively referred to as “personal information”).  If you choose to access our website, use our services or purchase our  products, we may require you to provide personal information as  indicated on the forms throughout the site.</p>
<p><strong>1.2. Survey Information.</strong> Company may collect  information from you when you voluntarily complete a Company survey,  order form, or a registration page either online by using the internet,  offline by providing this information through the mail, in person or  using a telephone. This information may be collected by surveys, order  forms, or registration pages operated by third parties. This method of  collection is collectively known as a “Survey.” In such Surveys, Company  or a third party may ask you to provide personal identifiable  information including your name, email address, street address, zip  code, telephone numbers (including cell phone numbers and carriers),  birth date, gender, salary range, education and marital status,  occupation, social security number, employment information, personal and  online interests, and such other information as may be requested from  time to time. Company may also collect such information concerning you  from another source and uses that information in combination with  information provided from the Websites. Completing the Surveys is  completely voluntary, and you are under no obligation to provide Survey  Information to Company or a third party.</p>
<p><strong>1.3. Third Party Information. </strong>Company may collect  information from you when you provide information to a third party and  Company subsequently acquires or uses the information provided by the  third party. Such information may include, but is not limited to, your  name, email address, street address, zip code, telephone numbers  (including cell phone numbers and carriers), birth date, gender, salary  range, education and marital status, occupation, industry of employment,  personal and online interests, and such other information you may have  provided to the third party. When acquiring this information, Company  seeks assurances from the third party that you agreed to provide and  have such information acquired by Company. If you did not give express  permission, or you would like to remove your permission, you may  suppress all of your information by sending notification to us at  unsubscribe@intela.com.</p>
<p><strong>1.4. Other Methods of Collecting Personal Information.</strong> Other occasions when Company obtains information from you include (1)  your claiming a prize or seeking to redeem an offer by Company or by a  third party, (2) your requests for assistance through Company’s customer  service department, and (3) when you voluntarily subscribe to a Company  service or newsletter.</p>
<p><strong>1.5. Cookies, Web Beacons, and Other Info Collected Using  Technology.</strong> Company currently uses cookie and web beacon  technology to associate certain Internet-related information about you  with information about you in its database. Additionally, Company may  use other new and evolving sources of information in the future.</p>
<p><strong>(a) Cookies. </strong>“Cookies” are a feature in your browser  software. If enabled, we may write cookies that may store small amounts  of data on your computer about your visit to any of the pages of this  Site. Cookies assist us in tracking which of our features appeal the  most to you and what content you may have viewed on past visits. When  you visit this site again, cookies can enable us to customize our  content according to your preferences. We may use cookies to: keep track  of the number of return visits to this site; accumulate and report  aggregate, statistical information on website usage; deliver specific  content to you based on your interests or past viewing history; save  your password for ease of access to our Site. You can disable cookies,  although the Site may not function properly for you. Your browser  preferences can be modified to accept or reject all cookies, or request a  notification when a cookie is set. You may read more about cookies at  http://cookiecentral.com. In order to use all of the features and  functionality of Company’s websites, you need to accept cookies.</p>
<p><strong>(b) Web Beacons. </strong>A web beacon is a programming code  that can be used to display an image on a web page, but can also be used  to transfer your unique user identification to a database and associate  you with previously acquired information about an individual in a  database. This allows Company to track certain websites you visit. Web  beacons are used to track online behavioral habits for marketing  purposes to determine products or services you may be interested in. In  addition to using web beacons on web pages, Company also uses web  beacons in email messages sent to individuals listed in Company’s  database.</p>
<p><strong>(c) IP Addresses.</strong> Company automatically tracks  certain information based upon your behavior on the site. We may use  this information to do internal research on our users’ demographics,  interests, and behavior to better understand, protect and serve you and  our community. This information may include the URL that you just came  from (whether this URL is on the site or not), which URL you next go to  (whether this URL is on the site or not), your computer browser  information, and your IP address. Your Internet Protocol (“IP”) is a  unique Internet “address” which is assigned to you by your Internet  Service Provider (“ISP”). For local area network (“LAN”), DSL, or cable  modem users, an IP address may be permanently assigned to a particular  computer. IP addresses are automatically logged by Web servers,  collecting information about a user’s traffic patterns. While the IP  address does not identify an individual by name, it may, with the  cooperation of the ISP, be used to locate and identify an individual  using the Web. Your IP address can, however, reveal what geographic area  you are connecting from, or which ISP you are using. Finally, other  websites you visit have IP addresses, and we may collect the IP  addresses of those websites and their pages.</p>
<p><strong>(d) Computer Profiles.</strong> Company may also collect and  accumulate other anonymous data which will help us understand and  analyze the Internet experience of our visitors. For instance, Company  may accumulate visitor data relating to referring domain names, the type  of browsers used, operating system software, screen resolutions, color  capabilities, browser plug-ins, language settings, cookie preferences,  search engine keywords and JavaScript enablement. When you provide us  with Personal Identification Information, we are able to use such  visitor data to identify you.</p>
<p><strong>(e) Data Analysis.</strong> Data Analysis technology may be  employed from time to time if used by a Client of Company.</p>
<p><strong>(f) New Technology.</strong> The use of technology on the  Internet, including cookies and web beacons, is rapidly developing. As a  result, Company strongly encourages individuals to revisit this policy  for any updates regarding its use of new technology.</p>
<p><strong>1.6. No Information Collected from Children.</strong> Company  will never knowingly collect any personal information about children  under the age of 13. If Company obtains actual knowledge that it has  collected personal information about a child under the age of 13, that  information will be immediately deleted from its database. Because it  does not collect such information, Company has no such information to  use or to disclose to third parties. Company has designed this policy in  order to comply with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act  (“COPPA”).</p>
<p><strong>1.7. Credit Card Information.</strong> Company may, in  certain instances, collect credit card numbers and related information  when an individual places an order from Company. When the credit card  information is submitted to Company, such information is encrypted and  is protected with SSL encryption software. Company will use the credit  card information for purposes of processing and completing the purchase  transaction, and the credit card information will be disclosed to third  parties only as necessary to complete the purchase transaction.          1.8 Security. When users submit information at the website or when  our third-party marketing partners transfer your personal information to  us, such information is protected both online and offline. The servers  in which we store the information are kept in a secure physical  environment. Currently, Company uses Secure Socket Layer Software  (“SSL”) to protect data and to secure any transactions. SSL encrypts  information, including credit card numbers, names and addresses as they  are transmitted over the Internet. Although we take reasonable  technological precautions to protect your data, no data transmission  over the Internet can be guaranteed to be secure. Therefore, Company  cannot warrant that your information will be absolutely secure. Any  transmission of data at or through our website is at your own risk.</p>
<p><strong>2. Use of Individual Information.</strong></p>
<p><strong>2.1 General Use. </strong> The following paragraphs in Section  2 describe how Company currently uses Individual Information, but  Company may change or broaden its use at any time. As noted below,  Company may update this policy from time to time. Company may use  Individual Information to provide promotional offers to individuals by  means of email advertising, telephone marketing, direct mail marketing,  online banner advertising, and package stuffers, among other possible  uses.</p>
<p><strong>2.2. Email and Unsubscribe Policy.</strong> Company uses  Individual Information to provide other businesses promotional offers by  email to individuals. Company may maintain separate email lists for  different purposes. If email recipients wish to end their email  subscription from a particular list, they need to follow the  instructions at the end of each email message to unsubscribe from the  particular list. To unsubscribe from all Company’s email lists, a person  must send an email to unsubscribe@intela.com.     Company’s unsubscribe process impacts only the future delivery of  electronic mailings disseminated by Company on its own behalf. You may  still receive electronic mailings sent on behalf of Third Parties and  your personal information may still be shared with Third Parties for use  in offline marketing and data appends, including email appends.     You should also note that unsubscribing from Company’s electronic  mailings will not automatically unsubscribe the subscriber’s information  from any Third Party business associates and licensees of the data.  Since Third Party associates and licensee partners maintain separate  databases from Company, and you will need to unsubscribe from each  source individually, if desired. This allows you the freedom to pick and  choose which subscriptions to maintain and which to discontinue.</p>
<p><strong>2.3. Content of Email Messages.</strong> You may receive  certain commercial email messages sent by third parties for products  which may be of interest to you. In such case, an Advertiser’s name will  appear in the “From:” and Replying to such email may send the message  to that Advertiser. The “Subject:” line of the email messages will  usually contain a line provided from the Advertiser. As such, if you  wish to unsubscribe from any third party emails please notify us by  sending an email to unsubscribe@intela.com.</p>
<p><strong>2.4. Solicited Email.</strong> Company only sends email to  individuals who have agreed on the Websites to receive email from  Company or to individuals who have agreed on a Third Party website to  receive email from Third Parties.

As a result, United States statutes  requiring certain formatting for unsolicited email are not applicable to  Company’s email messages.</p>
