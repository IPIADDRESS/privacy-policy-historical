<p align="left" class="style1"><strong>INTELA, LLC, all its related  web sites (“Intela”) Privacy Policy</strong><br>
  Last updated August 23, 2006.<br>
  PLEASE NOTE: OUR PRIVACY POLICY CHANGES FROM TIME TO TIME AND CHANGES ARE  EFFECTIVE UPON POSTING. PLEASE CHECK BACK FREQUENTLY FOR UPDATES AS IT IS YOUR  SOLE RESPONSIBILITY TO BE AWARE OF CHANGES. INTELA DOES NOT PROVIDE NOTICES OF  CHANGES IN ANY MANNER OTHER THAN BY POSTING THE CHANGES AT THIS WEB SITE.<br>
  IF YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH THE TERMS OF THIS PRIVACY POLICY PLEASE DO NOT PROVIDE  ANY INFORMATION TO INTELA OR USE ANY OF THE SERVICES OR PRODUCTS OFFERED OR  PROVIDED ON ANY OF THE WEB SITES REFERRED TO IN THIS PRIVACY POLICY.<br>
  The information collection, use, and dissemination practices of Intela.<br>
  This policy applies to Intela’s collection, use, storage and disclosure of  information by Intela on its (a) websites, including all its divisions,  subsidiaries and related companies (collectively, the "Websites"),  (b) on various third party websites, and (c) to Intela’s other information  collection, including the purchase of customer lists from third parties. Intela  is not responsible for the information collection or privacy practices of third  web sites or applications.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>1. Collection of Information.</strong><br>
  <strong>1.1 Survey Information.</strong><br>
  INTELA collects information from individuals by various methods, including, but  not limited to, when an individual voluntarily completes an INTELA survey,  order form, or a registration page either online or offline, or by means of  online or offline surveys, order forms, or registration pages operated by third  parties (collectively, a "Survey"). (As used herein,  "online" means using the Internet, including the Websites, and  related technologies, and "offline" means by methods other than  online, including in person, in the postal mail, using telephones and cell  phones, and other similar means.) In the Surveys, INTELA or a third party (a  "Third Party") may ask an individual to provide various information  to INTELA, which may include his or her name, email address, street address,  zip code, telephone numbers (including cell phone numbers and carriers), birth  date, gender, salary range, education and marital status, occupation, social  security number, employment information, personal and online interests, and  such other information as may be requested from time to time (together,  "Survey Information"). Intela may also collect information concerning  an individual from another source and uses that information in combination with  information provided from this web site. Completing the Surveys is completely  voluntary, and individuals are under no obligation to provide Survey  Information to INTELA or Third Party, but an individual may receive incentives  from INTELA or a Third Party in exchange for providing Survey Information to  INTELA.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>1.2 Third Party List Information.</strong><br>
  INTELA collects information from individuals when an individual provides  information to a third party and INTELA subsequently purchases, licenses, or  otherwise acquires the information from the third party (the  "Seller"). Such purchased information may include, but is not limited  to, an individual's name, email address, street address, zip code, telephone  numbers (including cell phone numbers and carriers), birth date, gender, salary  range, education and marital status, occupation, industry of employment, personal  and online interests, and such other information as the individual may have  provided to the Seller (together, "Third Party List Information").  When acquiring Third Party List Information, INTELA seeks assurances from the  Seller that the Seller has a right to transfer the Third Party List Information  to INTELA and that the Seller has a right to provide offers from advertisers to  the individuals whose personal information is included on the Seller's list.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>1.3 Other Information.</strong><br>
  Other occasions when INTELA obtains information from individuals include (1)  when an individual is making a claim for a prize or seeking to redeem an  incentive offered by INTELA or by a third party, (2) when an individual  requests assistance through Intela’s customer service department, and (3) when  an individual voluntarily subscribes to a INTELA service or newsletter  (together, "Other Information").<br>
  <br>
  <strong>1.4 Cookies, Web Beacons, and Other Info Collected Using Technology.</strong><br>
  INTELA currently uses cookie and web beacon technology to associate certain  Internet-related information about an individual with information about the  individual in our database. Additionally, INTELA may use other new and evolving  sources of information in the future (together, "Technology Information").<br>
  <strong>(a) Cookies.</strong><br>
  A cookie is a small amount of data stored on the hard drive of the individual's  computer that allows INTELA to identify the individual with his or her  corresponding data that resides in Intela’s database. You may read more about  cookies at http://cookiecentral.com. Individuals who use the Websites need to  accept cookies in order to use all of the features and functionality of the  Websites.<br>
  <strong>(b) Web Beacons.</strong><br>
  A web beacon is programming code that can be used to display an image on a web  page (by using an &lt;img src="x"&gt; programming function -- see  http://truste.org for more information), but can also be used to transfer an  individual's unique user identification (often in the form of a cookie) to a  database and associate the individual with previously acquired information  about an individual in a database. This allows INTELA to track certain web  sites an individual visits online. Web beacons are used to determine products  or services an individual may be interested in, and to track online behavioral  habits for marketing purposes. For example, INTELA might place, with the  consent of a third party website, a web beacon on the third party's website  where fishing products are sold. When Joe, an individual listed in Intela’s  database, visits the fishing website, INTELA receives notice by means of the  web beacon that Joe visited the fishing site, and INTELA would then update  Joe's profile with the information that Joe is interested in fishing. INTELA  may thereafter present offers of fishing related products and services to Joe.  In addition to using web beacons on web pages, INTELA also uses web beacons in  email messages sent to individuals listed in Intela’s database.<br>
  <strong>(c) New Technology.</strong><br>
  The use of technology on the Internet, including cookies and web beacons, is  rapidly evolving, as is Intela’s use of new and evolving technology. As a  result, INTELA strongly encourages individuals to revisit this policy for any  updates regarding its use of technology.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>1.5 Outside Information.</strong><br>
  INTELA may receive information about individuals from third parties or from  other sources of information outside of INTELA including information located in  public databases ("Outside Information").<br>
  <br>
  <strong>1.6 Individual Information.</strong><br>
  As used herein, Individual Information means Survey Information, Third Party  List Information, Other Information, Technology Information, and Outside  Information, and any other information INTELA gathers or receives about  individuals.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>1.7 No Information Collected from Children.</strong><br>
  INTELA will never knowingly collect any personal information about children  under the age of 13. If INTELA obtains actual knowledge that it has collected  personal information about a child under the age of 13, that information will  be immediately deleted from our database. Because it does not collect such  information, INTELA has no such information to use or to disclose to third  parties. INTELA has designed this policy in order to comply with the Children's  Online Privacy Protection Act ("COPPA").<br>
  <br>
  <strong>1.8 Credit Card Information.</strong><br>
  INTELA may in certain cases collect credit card numbers and related  information, such as the expiration date of the card ("Credit Card  Information") when an individual places an order from INTELA. When the  Credit Card Information is submitted to INTELA, such information is encrypted  and is protected with SSL encryption software. INTELA will use the Credit Card  Information for purposes of processing and completing the purchase transaction,  and the Credit Card Information will be disclosed to third parties only as  necessary to complete the purchase transaction.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>2. Use of Individual Information.</strong><br>
  <strong>2.1 Discretion to Use Information.</strong><br>
  THE COMPANY MAY USE INDIVIDUAL INFORMATION FOR ANY LEGALLY PERMISSIBLE PURPOSE  IN COMPANY'S SOLE DISCRETION.<br>
  The following paragraphs in Section 2 describe how INTELA currently uses  Individual Information, but INTELA may change or broaden its use at any time.  As noted below, INTELA may update this policy from time to time. INTELA may use  Individual Information to provide promotional offers to individuals by means of  email advertising, telephone marketing, direct mail marketing, online banner  advertising, and package stuffers, among other possible uses.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>2.2 Email.</strong><br>
  INTELA uses Individual Information to provide promotional offers by email to  individuals. INTELA may maintain separate email lists for different purposes.  If email recipients wish to end their email subscription from a particular  list, they need to follow the instructions at the end of each email message to  unsubscribe from the particular list. To unsubscribe from all Intela’s email  lists, a person must send an email to unsubscribe@intela.com.<br>
  <strong>2.2(a) Content of Email Messages.</strong><br>
  In certain commercial email messages sent by INTELA, an advertiser's name will  appear in the "From:" line but hitting the "Reply" button  will cause a reply email to be sent to INTELA. The "Subject:" line of  INTELA email messages will usually contain a line provided from the advertiser  to INTELA.<br>
  <strong>2.2(b) Solicited Email.</strong><br>
  INTELA only sends email to individuals who have agreed on the Websites to  receive email from INTELA or to individuals who have agreed on third party  websites to receive email from third parties such as INTELA. INTELA does not  send unsolicited email messages. As a result, statutes requiring certain  formatting for unsolicited email are not applicable to Intela’s email messages.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>2.3 Targeted Advertising.</strong><br>
  INTELA uses Individual Information to target advertising to an individual. When  an individual is using the Internet, INTELA uses Technology Information (see  also Section 2.5 below) to associate an individual with that person's  Individual Information, and INTELA attempts to show advertising for products  and services in which the person has expressed an interest in the Surveys,  indicated an interest by means of Technology Information, and otherwise. INTELA  may, at its discretion, target advertising by using email, direct mail,  telephones, cell phones, and other means of communication to provide  promotional offers.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>2.4 Direct Mail and Telemarketing.</strong><br>
  INTELA uses Individual Information to advertise, directly or indirectly, to  individuals using direct mail marketing or telemarketing using telephones and  cell phones.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>2.5 Use of Technology Information.</strong><br>
  INTELA uses Technology Information (1) to match a person's Survey Information  and Third Party List Information to other categories of Individual Information  to make and improve profiles of individuals, (2) to track a person's online  browsing habits on the Internet, (3) to determine which areas of Intela’s web  sites are most frequently visited. This information helps INTELA to better  understand the online habits of individuals so that INTELA can target  advertising and promotions to them.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>2.6 Profiles of Individuals.</strong><br>
  INTELA uses Individual Information to make a profile of an individual. A  profile can be created by combining Survey Information and Third Party List  Information with other sources of Individual Information such as information  obtained from public databases.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>2.7 Storage of Individual Information</strong>.<br>
  INTELA stores the Individual Information in a database on INTELA computers. Our  computers have security measures (such as a firewall) in place to protect  against the loss, misuse, and alteration of the information under Intela’s  control. Not withstanding such measures, INTELA cannot guarantee that its  security measures will prevent INTELA computers from being illegally accessed,  and the Individual Information on them stolen or altered.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>3. Dissemination of Individual Information.</strong><br>
  <strong>3.1 Sale  or Transfer to Third Parties.</strong><br>
  INTELA MAY SELL OR TRANSFER INDIVIDUAL INFORMATION TO THIRD PARTIES FOR ANY  PURPOSE IN INTELA’S SOLE DISCRETION.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>3.2 Order Fulfillment.</strong><br>
  INTELA will transfer Individual Information to third parties when necessary to  provide a product or service that a person orders from such third party while  using INTELA web sites or when responding to offers provided by INTELA.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>3.3 Legal Process.</strong><br>
  INTELA may disclose Individual Information to respond to subpoenas, court  orders, and other legal processes.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>3.4 Summary Data.</strong><br>
  INTELA may sell or transfer non-individualized information, such as summary or  aggregated anonymous information about all persons or sub-groups of persons.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>3.5 Access.</strong><br>
  Individuals have access to their Individual Information collected to provide an  opportunity for an individual to correct, amend, or delete such information.  Access can be obtained by contacting contact@intela.com. INTELA may also grant  advertising clients and email services providers’ access to an individual's  email address to verify the origin of the Individual Information collected.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>4. Privacy Practices of Third Parties.</strong><br>
  <strong>4.1 Advertiser cookies and web beacons.</strong><br>
  Advertising agencies, advertising networks, and other companies (together,  "Advertisers") who place advertisements on the Websites and on the Internet  generally may use their own cookies, web beacons, and other technology to  collect information about individuals. INTELA does not control Advertisers' use  of such technology and INTELA has no responsibility for the use of such  technology to gather information about individuals.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>4.2 Links.</strong><br>
  The Websites and email messages sometimes contain hypertext links to the web  sites of third parties. INTELA is not responsible for the privacy practices or  the content of such other web sites. Linked web sites may contain links to web  sites maintained by third parties. Such links are provided for your convenience  and reference only. Intela does not operate or control in any respect any  information, software, products or services available on such third party web sites.  The inclusion of a link to a web site does not imply any endorsement of the  services or the site, its contents, or its sponsoring organization.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>4.3 Affiliated Companies.</strong><br>
  INTELA may disclose, transfer, and sell Individual Information to entities  affiliated with INTELA in Intela’s discretion.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>5. Unsubscribe Procedures.</strong><br>
  If you wish to discontinue receiving email messages from INTELA, you have  several options:<br>
  <strong>(a) Unsubscribe from one email list.</strong><br>
  To unsubscribe from a particular list, either (1) send an email to  unsubscribe@intela.com or (2) follow the instructions in each promotional email  message sent by INTELA.<br>
  <strong>(b) Unsubscribe from all of Intela's email lists.</strong><br>
