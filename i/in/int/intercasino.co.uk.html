We are a controller (also known as a "data controller") in respect of your Personal Information. Controller is a legal term and means that we are responsible for determining the purposes for which your Personal Information is processed.</p>
<p>We will ensure that your Personal Information is processed in compliance with data protection laws and regulations in the countries where we operate. Accordingly, we have set out in this Privacy Policy how we use your Personal Information. </p>
<p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time, and therefore recommend that you review this Privacy Policy regularly.  Where we make any material changes to this Privacy Policy, we will notify you that changes have been made. </p>

<h3>How we collect your Personal Information</h3>
<p>So that we can operate our websites and mobile applications, you will be asked to provide your Personal Information for the purposes of registering and opening an account with us. You are under no obligation to provide Personal Information to us. However, certain Personal Information is essential in order for us to provide you with our services (for example, enabling you to play the games on the website) and you might not be able to obtain certain services if you choose to withhold information we have requested that is required for those services.
We also collect information about the transactions you make, including details of payment cards used. We may collect Personal Information through surveys which we, or companies engaged by us for such purpose, undertake.  In addition, we collect information about your use of our websites, mobile applications and services.  We will also collect other information necessary for us to process your Personal Information for the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy.  </p> 
<p>If you provide your name, address or any other Personal Information on the public area of our websites, we will process this Personal Information also. </p>
<p>We may also collect Personal Information from third party service providers, such as fraud prevention companies. </p>
<p>Finally, we also use "cookies" which may collect certain information about you, such as your devices' IP addresses, which constitutes Personal Information.  You can learn more about the cookies we use in the 'Cookies' section below.  </p>
<h3>How will we use your Personal Information?</h3>
<p>In accordance with data protection laws, we will only process your Personal Information where we have a lawful basis for doing so. In respect of your Personal Information, these bases are: (i) where it is necessary to provide services to you under the performance of the contract we have with you; (ii) where we are required to do so in accordance with legal or regulatory obligations; (iii) where such processing is in the public interest; (iv) where you have given your consent; and, (v) where it is in our legitimate interests to process your Personal Information, provided that none of these prejudice your own rights, freedoms and interests.  </p>

<h3>Cookies</h3>

<p>About Cookies: In this privacy policy, we use the expression âcookieâ to refer to cookies and similar technologies for storing information (such as web beacons). A cookie is a simple text file that is stored on your computer or mobile (or other) device by a websiteâs server, and only that server will be able to retrieve or read the contents of that cookie. Each cookie is unique to your web browser. It will contain some anonymous information, such as a unique identifier and the website name and some digits and numbers. </p>
<p>Almost all websites and applications you visit, including our website, will use cookies in order to improve your user experience by enabling that website and/or application to ârememberâ you, either for the duration of your visit (using a âsession cookieâ) or for repeat visits (using a âpersistent cookieâ). </p>
<p>Cookies do lots of different jobs that improve your use of a website or application, like letting you navigate between pages efficiently, storing your preferences, and generally improving your experience of a website. Cookies make the interaction between you and the website faster and easier. If a website or application doesnât use cookies, it will think you are a new visitor every time you move to a new page on the website. </p>
<p>Some websites, including our website and any mobile or device specific version and any related applications of our website (collectively referred to in this Cookies section as the âWebsiteâ), will also use cookies to enable them to target their advertising or marketing messages (based, for example, on your location and/or browsing habits). </p>
<p>Cookies may be set by the website you are visiting (âfirst party cookiesâ) or they may be set by other websites who run content on the page or application you are viewing (âthird party cookiesâ). </p>
<p>Our Cookies: We use a number of different cookies on this Website to help us to recognise you, track your activity and improve your use and experience of the Website. </p>
<p>In addition, we use a number of third party service providers, who also set cookies on this Website, in order to deliver the services that they are providing to us. Such services include, but are not limited to, helping us to improve your use and experience of the Website by tracking your activity on the Website, measuring the effectiveness of the Website and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns. </p>
<p>We and/or third parties may use cookies to collect or receive information from the Website and use that information to advertise to you on other websites. You can view the cookies used for such purposes on this Website and opt out of the collection and use of your information for such targeted advertising here: <a href="https://www.aboutads.info/choices">www.aboutads.info/choices</a>. </p>
<p>What to do if you donât want Cookies to be set: Some people find the idea of a website storing information on their computer or mobile (or other) device intrusive, particularly when this information is stored and used by a third party without them knowing. Although this is generally quite harmless, you may not, for example, want to see advertising that has been targeted to your interests. If you prefer, it is possible to block some or all cookies, or even to delete cookies that have already been set but you need to be aware that you might lose some functions of that website. Most online browsers automatically accept cookies. However, if you wish to restrict or block cookies you can modify your browser settings. Information on deleting or controlling cookies is available at <a href="https://www.aboutcookies.org/">AboutCookies.org</a>. </p>
<h3>Retention of your Personal Information</h3>
<p>We will retain your Personal Information for the period necessary for us to provide you with our services and to comply with our legal and regulatory responsibilities.  Accordingly, your Personal Information will be retained for a minimum of five years following the closure of your account (if applicable) or the last contact with us from you.  Where it is no longer necessary for us to process your Personal Information, we will delete it sooner.  If you request that you should not be able to access our websites, mobile applications and services (i.e. self-exclude), we will retain this information for a minimum of seven years. </p>
<h3>Updating Your Personal Information</h3>
<p>You can update your Personal Information at any time via your account.  We request that where your Personal Information changes you update your account as soon as possible. </p>
<h3>Your Rights</h3>
<p>You have the following rights in relation to your Personal Information: </p>
<p>â¢ a right to access your Personal Information as held by us (also known as a subject access request); <br>
â¢ a right to receive certain Personal Information in machine-readable format; <br>
â¢ a right to have inaccurate Personal Information rectified; <br>
â¢ where we have specifically requested your consent to process your Personal Information and have no other lawful basis to process it, you have the right to withdraw this consent; and<br>
â¢ a right to have certain Personal Information erased where it is no longer necessary for us to process it, where you have withdrawn your consent pursuant to the paragraph above, where you have objected pursuant to the paragraph below, where your Personal Information has been unlawfully processed, or where erasing your Personal Information is required in accordance with a legal obligation;  <br>
â¢ a right to object to processing where our lawful basis for processing it is that it is in our legitimate interests, but please note that we may still process your Personal Information where there are other relevant lawful bases or where we have compelling grounds to continue processing your Personal Information in our interests which are not overridden by your rights, interests or freedoms; <br>
â¢ a right to request an explanation of the logic involved where we make decisions about you solely through automated means; <br>
â¢ a right to complain to your national data protection supervisory authority;  <br>
â¢ a right to object to direct marketing, which can be done by opting-out of direct marketing either through your account or by opting out via the communication itself.  You also have a right to object to any profiling to the extent that it relates to direct marketing only. <br></p>
<p>If you are unsure about your rights or are concerned about how your Personal Information may be processed, you should contact your national data protection supervisory authority.  </p>
<p>If you would like to exercise any of your rights then you can do so by contacting us as described below.  Please be aware that while we will try to accommodate any request you make in respect of your rights, they are not necessarily absolute rights.  This means that we may have to refuse your request or may only be able to comply with it in part.  </p>
<p>Where you make a request in respect of your rights we will require proof of identification.  We may also ask that you clarify your request. We will aim to respond to any request within one month of verifying your identity.  If we receive repeated requests, or have reason to believe requests are being made unreasonably, we reserve the right not to respond.  </p>
