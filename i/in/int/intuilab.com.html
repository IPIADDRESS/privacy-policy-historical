IntuiLab will not transfer Users’ personal information to third parties without their specific consent, except under the limited conditions described under the discussion entitled “Information Sharing and Disclosure” below.IntuiLab provides its Users with the opportunity to “opt in” prior to receiving direct marketing or market research information. In other words, IntuiLab will require its Users’ affirmative action before it may use their information for purposes other than the purpose for which it was submitted. At all times, IntuiLab will always give its Users the opportunity to “opt out” of receiving such materials. </p>

	<h3>Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies</h3>

	<p>A cookie is a small data file that certain websites write to Users’ computer’s hard drive when such Users visit them. A cookie file can contain information such as a user ID that the Site uses to track the pages visited by Users, but the only personal information a cookie can contain is information provided by Users. Some parts of the Site use cookies to track user traffic patterns. A User who prefers not to receive cookies while browsing the Site or via <span class="caps">HTML</span>-formatted emails can customize his or her browser to warn him or her before accepting cookies and refuse the cookie when his or her browser alerts him or her to its presence. A User can also refuse all cookies by turning them off in his or her browser, which refusal may adversely affect the User’s experience. </p>

	<h3>How IntuiLab May Use Information Collected</h3>

	<p>IntuiLab uses information for several general purposes: to fulfill Users’ requests for certain products and services, to personalize Users’ experience on the Site, to maintain ongoing contacts with its Users, and to better understand its Users’ needs and provide them with better services. IntuiLab may also use Users’ information to send them, or to have its business partners send them, direct marketing information or contact them for market research. </p>

	<h3>Information Sharing and Disclosure</h3>

	</p><ul>
		<li>When a User has expressed his or her consent to share such information;</li>
		<li>If sharing such information is necessary to provide a product or service requested by a User (in which case, IntuiLab will only provide to such third parties the information they need to deliver the service. Also, such companies are prohibited from using Users’ information for any other purpose);</li>
		<li>As part of a joint sales promotion or to pass sales leads to one of IntuiLab’s distribution partners; and</li>
		<li>IntuiLab may also disclose Users’ personal information if required to do so by law, to enforce IntuiLab’s Terms of Use, or in urgent circumstances, to protect personal safety, the public or the Site.</li>
	</ul><p></p>
