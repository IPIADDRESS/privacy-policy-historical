<li>	<b>What Information is Collected and How it is Collected</b><br>
International SOS Online, Inc. collects personally identifiable information about you when you provide such information to the Company to purchase, use or benefit from our products or when this information is given to us by affiliated entities or third parties, such as but not limited to travel agencies, that are permitted to share your Personal Information. "Personal Information" is information that would allow someone to identify or contact you, including, for example, your full name, address, telephone number, Social Security number, or email address. In addition, depending upon the service that we provide, we may collect information about your travel plans (Travel related services) or medical information to create an emergency medical record. Personal Information does not include aggregated or information that, by itself, does not permit the identification of individual persons (such as statistics on the number of persons visiting the International SOS website each month, or how many visitors are male or female).<br>
You provide certain Personal Information to us when you: (a) order products and services from International SOS websites (b) submit forms through the Customer Care Center, or (c) send other information to us through the "Tell us what you think" interface or through our Travel Care website.  Your employer or an affiliated entity such as a travel agency may provide information about you to us to enable us to provide you and your employer services, such as  travel related services.  When you choose to pay for International SOS Online services by credit card, you will be required to provide us the name of your credit card issuer, credit card number and expiration date.<br><br>

For example, the collection of Personal Information for the Emergency Medical Records will include an  'opt-in' mechanism for you to give us your consent to use and disclose your personal medical information to enable us to provide you with medical care and related services.  For example, we may transfer your medical information to companies that provide emergency air travel or to local clinics or physicians who we arrange to treat you.

<a name="SafeHarbor"></a>
<h2 class="bb">SAFE HARBOR</h2> 

	<p>This Statement specifically applies to organizations requiring compliance with the European Commission Data Privacy Policy.</p>
	
	 <p>What is the Safe Harbor and how is it related to the European data privacy directive?</p>

<p>The European Commission's Directive on Data Protection went into effect in October 1998, prohibiting the transfer of personal data to non-European Union nations that do not meet the European "adequacy" standard for privacy protection. While the United States and the European Union share the goal of enhancing privacy protection for their citizens, the United States and the European Union adopt different approaches to data privacy. In order to bridge these different privacy approaches and provide a streamlined means for U.S. organizations to comply with the Directive, the U.S. Department of Commerce in consultation with the European Commission developed a "Safe Harbor" framework. Complying with the Safe Harbor's set of principles - approved by the EU in July of 2000 - is a way for U.S. companies to certify that they provide "adequate" privacy protection, as defined by the Directive. Consistent with its commitment to protect personal privacy, International SOS Online adheres to the Safe Harbor Principles.</p>

<p>International SOS Online processes information from the European Union according to the Safe Harbor Framework and is so registered by the Department of Commerce. To find out more about Safe Harbor you can visit the Department of Commerce's website at <a href="http://www.export.gov/safeharbor/" target="_blank">http://www.export.gov/safeharbor/</a> .</p>
