        <p><span class="blue_medium">interCLICK Privacy Policy</span><br>
interCLICK  is a leading provider of targeted and optimized digital marketing solutions for advertisers.  In the course of providing these services, interCLICK collects and analyzes the online behaviors of consumers across its network of sites.  It is critical to interCLICK that consumers’ privacy, rights and choice are maintained during<br>
 this process.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p> 

<p><a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/index.asp" target="_blank"><img src="images/NAI_logo1.gif" alt="The Network Advertising Initiative" width="151" height="61" hspace="4" vspace="4" border="0" align="left"></a><br>
Accordingly, interCLICK is committed to following the privacy guideline in accordance with <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/" target="_blank">NAI privacy principles.</a></p>

 <p>&nbsp;</p>

 <p>This document is intended to inform consumers how interCLICK collects, maintains and processes information we collect in the delivery of our network advertising services.</p>


 <p><span class="blue_medium">What types of data does interCLICK collect?</span><br>
On the interCLICK network, we collect non-personally identifiable information (non-PII) such as web sites visited, content viewed, ad interaction, interaction with advertiser websites, IP addresses, search terms used, and other click and browsing behavior.  Additionally, we may collect non-PII technical information including IP address, OS, browser type, language settings.</p>


 <p><span class="blue_medium">How does interCLICK track consumer behavior?</span><br>
Cookies are small packets of data stored on your computer that allow sites to recognize the computer when you revisit the site. Generally, sites use this cookie to provide services such as auto login, information delivery, and to better understand how you are interacting with the site. These cookies enable sites to customize the site to your needs and interests, so that they can be as valuable and relevant to you as possible. </p>

<p>Like many websites, interCLICK sets a cookie on your computer containing an anonymous identifier.  This cookie allows interCLICK to better target and analyze consumer behavior with the goal of providing better and more relevant advertising.</p>

<p>You are always free to decline cookies, but by doing so you may not be able to use certain features on the websites or take full advantage of all the website offerings and targeted advertising. You can configure your browser to accept all cookies, reject all cookies, erase cookies, or notify you when a cookie is set.</p>

<p>Alternatively, you may <a href="OptOutV2.aspx" target="_blank">click here to opt-out of data collection and targeting cookies from interCLICK.</a> Please note that if you buy a new computer, upgrade or change Web browsers or delete this "opt out" cookie, you will need to perform this process again.</p>

<p><span class="blue_medium">How does interCLICK use this information?</span><br>

interCLICK has created a technology that uses any consumer information to create anonymous consumer segments.  For example, consumers that demonstrate car buying behaviors are grouped into an auto-buyer segment.  These segments will be used to target and optimize advertiser campaigns.  interCLICK will never use this information to identify, locate or contact consumers.  </p>

<p><span class="blue_medium">Which data do we retain and for how long?</span><br>

We maintain non-PII information on consumer behavior for 90 days.  This data includes web sites visited, content viewed, ad interaction, interaction with advertiser websites, IP addresses, search terms used, and other click and browsing behavior.  Additionally, we may collect non-PII technical information including IP address, OS, browser type, language settings.</p>


<p><span class="blue_medium">What if I have questions about how my or other consumers’ data is being used?</span><br>
We are more than happy to respond to any customer inquires about privacy concerns. Please contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@interCLICK.com">privacy@interCLICK.com</a> 
    or the address below with any questions of complaints.<br><br>





For more information, please see the <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org" target="_blank">Network Advertising Initiative web site.</a></p>

<p><span class="blue_medium">What if I don’t want to be tracked - interCLICK Opt-out</span><br>
You can opt out of the targeted advertising delivered by interCLICK by requesting an "opt-out" cookie (a blank cookie) by interCLICK, which will prevent information from being uniquely associated with your browser. This allows you to opt-out of the interCLICK tracking system without erasing other cookies associated with<br> 
your browser.</p>



<p>This opt-out means that interCLICK will not store information unique to your browser behavior and will be unable to recognize your browser from one visit to the next.  Opting-out does not mean you will not receive online advertising. However, because the network is not able to uniquely identify your browser, interCLICK is unable to deliver ads tailored to your Web preferences and usage patterns. </p> 

<p>Please note that if you buy a new computer, upgrade or change Web browsers or delete this "opt out" cookie, you will need to perform this process again.<br>
