<p><strong>B. Introduction</strong></p>
<p><span>This Privacy Policy explains the following: </span></p>
<ol>
<li>What information we collect about you and why;</li>
<li>How we use information about you;</li>
<li>How your information may be shared;</li>
<li>How we store and process information about you;</li>
<li>When and how we communicate with you;</li>
<li>How long we may keep personal information about you;</li>
<li>How you can opt-out from receiving communications from us;</li>
<li>Analysis tools and our use of cookies;</li>
<li>Information over the Internet and other websites;</li>
<li>Offensive or inappropriate content;</li>
<li>Legal disclaimer;</li>
<li><span>How to contact us;</span></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>1. What information we collect about you and why:</strong></p>
<p><span>We may collect two types of information: personally identifiable information (“PII”) and information that is not personally identifiable (“Non PII”).</span></p>
<p><strong>A.&nbsp;What PII Do We Collect?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><span>When you register with us, we ask for information such as your name, postal address, zip code, email address, and telephone number. We also acquire your Internet protocol address and/or mobile device identification, which certain jurisdictions consider to be PII because it could be used to identify an individual or device if it were combined with other identifying information. </span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>We may capture user information when users send us questions or comments via e-mail. Information collected in this manner will only be used to contact the user and/or respond to the user’s inquiry/issue. Sending us an e-mail will not enroll you on our e-mail list unless you specifically request it. </span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>For purchases made on the Website, a third-party payment processor, such as PayPal, may collect your name, email address, postal address, contact details and credit or debit card information. This record will be stored and processed in the United States and other countries (see further below under “How we use information about you” and “How we store and process information about you”). </span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>We take reasonable precautions to protect the confidentiality and security of your personally identifiable information by using industry recognized security safeguards such as site monitoring, secured networks and servers, firewalls and/or encryption. When we ask for sensitive information, we protect it through the use of encryption during transmission, such as SSL (Secure Socket Layer). Unfortunately, no method of transmission over the Internet is completely secure. Therefore, while we strive to protect your personally identifiable information within industry standards, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. </span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>We may also obtain your personal information through your use of social media such as Facebook or LinkedIn, depending on your settings or the privacy policies of these social media services. To change your settings on these services, please refer to their respective privacy notices. </span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>B.&nbsp;What Non PII Do We Collect?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><span>We may capture Non PII such as your user agent, referring URL, browser operating system, device type, location, and/or the language option you chose in your device. Some of the information that we acquire cannot identify, distinguish or trace you or your device. Alternatively, some information could be considered PII when combined with other identifying information. However, the information is not used by us in a way that identifies, distinguishes or traces you or your device, but is instead used in an anonymous way, often aggregated with other anonymous information about other users. </span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>If your PII changes, or if you no longer choose to use our services or the Website, you can contact customer service by e-mail, telephone or postal mail at the contact information listed below to assist you with changes to your account. To the extent your account closes or becomes inactive, we will continue to protect your information as described in this Privacy Policy. </span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>2.&nbsp;How we use information about you:</strong></p>
<p><strong>A.&nbsp;We may use the PII we collect in the following ways:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>

<li>
<p><span>to provide users with personalized offers, promotions, news, events and other information relevant to them because they have signed up to do so through our Website; </span></p>
</li>

<p><span>to quickly process user requests for information and to allow us to respond efficiently to user questions; </span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>to monitor Website statistics; </span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>to respond to or satisfy legal requirements, such as a court order, a subpoena, or a law </span></p>
<p><span>enforcement agency’s or other public agency’s request; </span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>to help prevent the instigation of a crime, to help facilitate an investigation related to public safety, to help protect the safety of a child using our Website, to help protect the security or integrity of our Website, or to enable us to take precautions against liability; </span></p>

</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>3.&nbsp;How your information may be shared:</strong></p>
<p><span>Except as set forth below, we do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer to third parties our users’ PII unless we receive their consent. That being said, in the following situations, we may share PII with outside parties: </span></p>

<p><span><em>Website Consultants and Service Providers</em>. </span><span>We may disclose personal information to third party consultants and service providers (such as providers of hosting, support, maintenance; third party payment processing agencies; and remedial and repair services) to the extent that they require access to our databases, or the information contained in our databases, to service us and the Website. We use Outbrain as a native advertising and content discovery platform; PubGalaxy to display advertising solutions; Playbuzz, Connatix&nbsp;and Truvid as a video advertising solution; StackCommerce as a native commerce platform; JW Player as a video player software; Facebook Social Share and LinkedIn as social media plug-ins; Hotjar for user engagement and web analytics and Google Analytics and Yandex Metrica for web analytics software. For more information on how your PII is used by these companies, please refer to their respective privacy policies; </span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span><em>Enforcement of Rights/Security</em>. </span><span>We reserve the right to release personal information (i) when we are under legal compulsion to do so (e.g. we have received a subpoena) or we otherwise believe&nbsp;</span>that the law requires us to do so, (ii) when we believe it is necessary to protect and/or enforce the rights, property interests, or our safety, the safety of our users, or the safety of others, or (iii) as we deem necessary to resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems, prevent fraud and otherwise enforce the Privacy Policy and other Website user agreements;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p><span><em>Reorganization or Sale</em>. </span><span>In the event that we merge with or become a part of another organization, or in the event that we are sold, we sell all or substantially all of our assets, or we are otherwise reorganized, the information you provide will be one of the transferred assets to the acquiring or reorganized entity; </span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span><em>To Help Protect Minor Users of Our Website</em>. </span><span>In the event that the safety of our users is threatened, and we are able to do something about that by sharing PII with third parties, we reserve the right to do so. This may be done to prevent the instigation of a crime, to help facilitate an investigation related to public safety, to help protect the safety of a child using our Website, to help protect the security or integrity of our Website, or to enable us to take precautions against liability; </span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span><em>As Otherwise Allowed by Law</em>. </span><span>We may transfer personal information to third parties where we are expressly authorized by applicable law to do so; </span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span><em>Aggregated Information</em>. </span><span>We may aggregate information that you provide with information provided by other individuals in such a manner that the information is not personally identifiable to you, and we may transfer that aggregated information to third parties; </span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>We may make available services such as blogs, message boards and chat functionality to which you are able to post information and materials. Please note that any information you disclose through such services or otherwise on the Website becomes public information, and may be available to visitors to the Website and to the general public. In addition, when you choose to make a posting on such services certain personal information will be available for other users to view. We urge you to exercise discretion and caution when deciding to disclose personal information about you, or any other information, on the Website. WE ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR THE USE BY ANY THIRD PARTY OF ANY PERSONAL INFORMATION YOU VOLUNTARILY DISCLOSE THROUGH ANY SUCH SERVICES OR OTHERWISE ON THE WEBSITE; and </span></p>

<p><span>With your express consent.</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>4.&nbsp;How we store and process information about you:</strong></p>
<p><span>In order to communicate with you about products, local events, offers and opportunities, the information that we collect from you may be transferred to, stored, used and processed by Interesting Engineering in the United States or one of our service providers based in the United States or outside of the United States. Such entities may be engaged in, among other things: (i) preparing and sending newsletters to which you subscribe; (ii) the processing of payment details; and (iii) the provision of support services. </span></p>
<p><span>If you are visiting from the European Union or other regions with laws governing information collection and use that may differ from United States law, please note that you are transferring your personal information to the United States. The laws of some countries may not provide the same levels of protection of personal information as your home country, particularly if you are a resident in the European Union. By submitting your information, you agree to the collection, transfer, storage, use and processing of information about you for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy. When you provide your personal information to us or our service providers or vendors, you consent to the processing of your </span><span>information in the United States as the Website is operated in the United States. We will take reasonable steps to ensure that information about you is treated securely in accordance with this Privacy Policy, and that all information you provide to us is stored on our secure servers or those of our service providers. </span></p>
<p><span>YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE LAWS OF THE UNITED STATES TREAT YOUR INFORMATION IN A MANNER THAT MAY BE SUBSTANTIALLY DIFFERENT FROM, AND LESS PROTECTIVE THAN, THE TREATMENT REQUIRED UNDER THE LAWS OF OTHER COUNTRIES AND JURISDICTIONS. IF YOU DO NOT WANT YOUR INFORMATION TRANSFERRED TO THE UNITED STATES, YOU SHOULD NOT SHARE YOUR INFORMATION WITH US, OR MAKE USE OF THIS WEBSITE. </span></p>
<p><span>TO THE EXTENT ALLOWED BY THE LAW OF THE COUNTRY IN WHICH YOU ARE LOCATED, YOU EXPRESSLY WAIVE ANY RIGHT YOU MAY HAVE TO REQUIRE US TO TREAT YOUR IDENTIFYING INFORMATION IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF ANY COUNTRY OR JURISIDICTION OTHER THAN THE UNITED STATES. HOWEVER, THE FOREGOING WAIVER MAY NOT BE LEGALLY BINDING IN SOME COUNTRIES, SUCH AS THE MEMBER STATES OF THE EUROPEAN UNION. TO THE EXTENT IT IS NOT LEGALLY BINDING IN THE COUNTRY IN WHICH YOU ARE LOCATED, THIS FOREGOING WAIVER DOES NOT APPLY TO YOU. </span></p>
<p><strong>5.&nbsp;When and how we communicate with you:</strong></p>
<p><span>We may use the information we collect to contact you by mail, email and telephone (including automated calls, and by SMS text messages and other multimedia electronic messages such as picture messaging). </span></p>
<p><span>We will not send you unsolicited premium rate SMS messages (which are SMS messages you pay to receive), although your service provider may impose a charge on any messages that you receive. Please check with your service provider for details. </span></p>
<p><span>You can unsubscribe from promotional emails and other commercial communications by following the instructions contained within the communication. Please note that due to marketing production schedules you may receive any messages already in production. </span></p>
<p><strong>6.&nbsp;How long we will hold personal information about you</strong></p>
<p><span>We will hold personal information about you on our systems for as long as is necessary for the relevant service, or as long as is set out in any relevant contract you hold with Interesting Engineering, subject to any applicable laws and/or regulations. In the case that you wish to cancel your registration as a member of the Website once an account is deleted, we cannot use the personal information about you other than for administrative purposes. </span></p>
<p><span>Where you contribute to the Website, we will generally only keep your content for as long as is reasonably required for the purpose(s) for which it was submitted.</span></p>

<p><strong>9.&nbsp;Information over the Internet and other Websites</strong></p>

<p><span>YOUR CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS </span></p>
<p><span>A California privacy law that went into effect on January 1, 2005, the “Shine the Light” law, allows California residents to obtain a list of third parties to whom a business has disclosed personal information if it shares such information with third parties for their direct marketing purposes. However, if a business adopts and discloses in its privacy policy a policy of not disclosing customers’ personal information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes unless the customer first affirmatively agrees to the disclosure, the business may comply with the law by notifying the customer of his or her right to prevent disclosure of personal information and by providing a cost-free means to exercise that right. </span></p>
<p><span>As stated earlier in this Privacy Policy, personal information submitted at the time of registration or submission may be used for marketing and promotional purposes only with the user’s permission. Whenever a user agrees to allow us to collect personal information, we provide the user with an option to prevent such information from being shared for marketing and promotional purposes with third parties. Furthermore, you may exercise this cost-free option at any time by sending an email to <a href="mailto:contact@interestingengineering.com" rel="nofollow">contact@interestingengineering.com</a>. </span></p>
<p><span>Because the Website has a comprehensive privacy policy and provides you with details on how you may opt-in or opt-out of the use of your personal information by third parties for direct marketing purposes, we are not required to provide you with the third party list. </span></p>
<p><strong>12. How to contact us</strong></p>
<p><span>We welcome your questions, comments and concerns about privacy. Please contact us at <a href="mailto:legal@interestingengineering.com" rel="nofollow">legal@interestingengineering.com</a> with any questions or comments you may have regarding the privacy of your information.</span></p>
