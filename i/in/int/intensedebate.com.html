<h4>Cookies</h4>

<ul>
 <li>A cookie is a
     small amount of data, which often includes an anonymous unique identifier
     that is sent to your browser from a web site's computers and stored on
     your computer's hard drive. </li>

     and Services that require you to "sign in," and you may not be
     able to take full advantage of all offerings.</li>

</ul>

<h4>Information Relating to Children</h4>

<ul>
 <li>The Children's
     Online Privacy Protection Act ("COPPA") requires that we inform
     parents and legal guardians about how we collect, use, and disclose
     personal information from children under 13 years of age. The IntenseDebate
     Sites, Products and Services are not directed at children under 13 years
     of age but, we recognize that with proper adult supervision some parents
     might permit their children to visit and utilize the IntenseDebate Sites,
     Products and Services. COPPA requires that we obtain the consent of
     parents and guardians in order for children under 13 years of age to use
     certain features of the IntenseDebate Sites, Products and Services. </li>
 <li>When your child
     attempts to register and/or provide personal information to IntenseDebate
     (including on any of the IntenseDebate Sites, Products and Services), we
     require a parent or legal guardian to: </li>

 <ul>
  <li>complete the
      registration; </li>

  <li>review our
      privacy policy;</li>
  <li>possibly submit
      a valid credit card number to verify that the child's parent or guardian
      knows about and authorizes our information practices related to children
      protected by COPPA; and </li>
  <li>verify through
      the use of an email confirmation and second authorization that the parent
      or guardian consents to any applicable Terms of Service and this privacy
      policy. </li>
 </ul>

 <li>Once parental
     notice and consent has been verified, the information we collect will be
     treated the same as information collected from any other user of the IntenseDebate
     Sites, Products and Services. Without verified parental notice and
     consent, we will not knowingly collect personal information of children
     under 13 years of age, and if we learn that we have inadvertently
     collected such information, we will promptly delete it. </li>
</ul>

<h4>How Parents can Access their Children's Personal Information</h4>

<p>In compliance with COPPA, parents and
legal guardians may request us to review, delete or stop the collection of the
personally identifiable information of their child. You may do so in one of two
ways.</p>

<p>If you know the user name and password,
follow the instructions below regarding Changing your Preferences and Personal
Information, or you may contact us by letter, phone or email using the address
information provided at the bottom of this page.</p>

<p>If you request that no further
information about your child be collected or used, we will be required to
terminate your child's ability to use the IntenseDebate Sites, Products and
Services that require a user to "sign in."</p>
