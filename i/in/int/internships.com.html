    Internship's Privacy Policy</h1>
<p>
    Internships LLC ("Internships," "we" or "us") is committed to maintaining the privacy
    of personal information of users ("you" or "User") of the CareerBeam CSC, Career
    Search and Internships.com websites (the "Sites"). Since we collect certain types
    of information about our Users, we want you to understand the terms and conditions
    surrounding the capture and use of that information. This Privacy Policy discloses
    what information we collect, how we use it and how to correct and change it. Each
    time you visit any of the Sites or provide us with information, you are, by doing
    so, accepting the practices described in this Privacy Policy at that time. You agree
    that by using any of the Sites you are expressly and affirmatively consenting to
    our use and disclosure of the information that you provide, and consenting to receive
    emails, as described below in this Privacy Policy. By clicking the "Accept" button
    during registration or by using any of our Sites, you explicitly accept, without
    limitation or qualification, of the collection, use and transfer of the personal
    information provided by you in the manner described in this Privacy Policy. Please
    read this Privacy Policy carefully as it affects your rights and liabilities under
    law. If you disagree with the way we collect and process personal information collected
    on the Sites, we recommend that you do not use it.</p><br>
<p>
    Colleges and universities use the Sites for career development functions. Accordingly,
    university staff and administrators may have the ability to access and use some
    or all of the personal information on any of the Sites belonging to students and
    alumni of their schools including, without limitation, the ability to send them
    e-mails using communication tools on any of the Sites and, in certain instances
    with respect to students and alumni, to publish their resumes in the school's resume
    book on any of the Sites and to apply for jobs on their behalf. The activities and
    practices of school staff and administrators are not subject to this Privacy Policy,
    and we are not responsible for what they do with personal information about students,
    alumni which is available or accessible to them on or through any of the Sites.
    If you have questions regarding the practices and policies of a school with respect
    to your personal information, we recommend that you contact them directly.</p><br>
<p>
    We may make content or services from other web sites available to you from links
    located on any of the Sites. These other web sites are not subject to this Privacy
    Policy. We recommend that you review the privacy policy at each such web site to
    determine how that site protects your privacy. While we take measures to safeguard
    your information from unauthorized access or inappropriate use by third parties,
    we do not control these third parties and we are not responsible for their use of
    information you post or otherwise make available. Accordingly, you should ensure
    that you do not post sensitive information to any of the Sites.</p><br>
<h3>
    Personally Identifiable Information We Collect</h3>
<p>
    We receive and collect personally identifiable information about individual Users
    of our Sites (such as name, contact information, demographic information, academic
    history, etc.) from college, university or other educational institution career
    centers, alumni associations, and other school organizations; and from you, on a
    strictly voluntary basis, by specifically requesting it from you (i) when you register
    on any of the Sites, (ii) when you complete or edit your profile, (iii) when you
    use or register for certain products and services, (iv) when you respond to surveys
    or questionnaires, and/or (v) when you enter or sign up for promotions or contests;
    and from you, on a strictly voluntary basis, if and when you choose to upload resumes,
    cover letters, writing samples and other documents to any of the Sites which contain
    personal information about you.</p><br>
<p>
    We may also ask you for other information from time to time, which you may choose
    to provide or not to provide at your sole discretion, such as information regarding
    your views on career related topics and other selected issues, your opinion regarding
    various features of our site, the types of jobs or candidates you are interested
    in, etc. In certain instances, personally identifiable information with respect
    to Users may also be received from one or more of our other business partners.</p><br>
<h3>
    How We Use Personally Identifiable Information Collected</h3>
<p>
    Except as described in this Privacy Policy, we do not disclose, display or share
    your personal information to or with third parties without your permission.</p><br>
<p>
    We use personally identifying information we collect on any of the Sites for the
    following purposes:</p>
<ul>
    <li>to allow you to create an account and profile;</li>
    <li>to enable you to provide feedback, to contact us and for us to respond to you;</li>
    <li>to provide information about you and your potential interest in job postings to
        employer customers;</li>
    <li>to provide products and services to employer customers to complete the recruitment
        and hiring process, such as accessing the searchable resume database;</li>
    <li>to communicate with you with regard to your use of any of the Sites and its services
        or to advise you of Site changes or other events or occurrences which may affect
        your access to or use of any of the Sites;</li>
    <li>to provide alumni associations or career centers at universities and colleges who
        are members of our network with information and statistics on student or alumni
        Users of any of the Sites;</li>
    <li>to administer sweepstakes, contests, surveys, questionnaires, polling activities
        and other similar events and activities that you choose to participate in;</li>
    <li>to respond to subpoenas, court orders, or legal process, or to establish or exercise
        our legal rights or defend against legal claims;</li>
    <li>to prevent fraud or other illegal activity, to prevent imminent bodily harm, or
        to protect ourselves and you from people violating our <a href="/terms">Terms of Use</a>, which may include
        sharing information with other companies, lawyers, courts or other government entities;
        and</li>
    <li>for other purposes specifically communicated to you when we collect the information.</li>
</ul><br>
<p>
    If you choose to publish your profile, upload or create a resume or any other document
    containing personal information so that employers can find you in the internship.com
    database or to participate in the CareerBeam Network, InternDirect Partner Network,
    the CareerSearch Network or any of our other Networks, your personal profile information
    and resume will be searchable by and accessible to employers who have access to
    those databases. However, if you used the internship.com QuickBuild Resume™
    we will not display your email address or mailing address to employers - we will
    display all the other elements of your resume. Please note that for either uploaded
    or resumes created on our website they must not contain sensitive data relating
    to your (i) racial or ethnic origin (ii) political beliefs (iii) philosophical or
    religious beliefs (iv) membership of a trade union or political party (v) physical
    or mental health or genetic makeup (vi) addictions, sexual life (vii) the commission
    of criminal offences or proceedings and associated penalties or fines, or (viii)
    any Social Security Number or state or national identification number. If you provide
    us with details of a professional reference, it is your responsibility to ensure
    that the person is aware that you have forwarded his/her details and has consented
    in writing for you to do so.</p><br>
<p>
    While we endeavor to restrict access to these databases to eligible employers, we
    cannot guarantee that other parties will not, without our consent, gain access to
    these databases as well. You may make your profile private and thus unsearchable
    or opt out of any of our Networks at any time. However, employers and recruiters
    who have access to these databases, and other parties who have otherwise gained
    access to these databases may have retained a copy of your profile or resume in
    their own files or databases. We are not responsible for the retention, use or privacy
    of resumes in these instances, or for the use or privacy of resumes or other personal
    information of Users by any of such parties while such resumes or personal information
    are in resume books or any of our Networks.</p><br>
<p>
    With your permission, we may use your e-mail address and other contact information
    to send you articles, profiles, industry news and other career related information,
    as well as to notify you of special promotions or additional products and services
    offered by us or our business partners and advertisers that may be of interest to
    you. With your permission, we may also share your personal information with our
    business partners and other third parties to enable them to contact you regarding
    special promotions, products and services they offer which may be of interest to
    you. You have the ability to opt-out of these types of communications at any time
    (see "Opt-in/Opt-out Policy" below).</p><br>
<p>
    We may use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our Site.
    These companies may use information (not including your name, street address, email
    or telephone number) about your visits to the Sites and other web sites in order
    to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you.</p><br>
<p>
    We employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf. Examples
    may include hosting our web servers, analyzing data, providing marketing assistance,
    processing credit card payments, and providing customer service. These other companies
    will have access to your personal information as necessary to perform their functions,
    but they are required to maintain the confidentiality of your information and are
    prohibited from using your personal information except to provide services to us.</p><br>
<p>
    From time to time, we may also disclose personally identifiable information to fulfill
    certain legal and regulatory requirements or if we believe, in good faith, that
    such disclosure is legally required or necessary to protect others' rights or to
    prevent or mitigate harm. We may also disclose and transfer such information to
    a third party who acquires all or a substantial portion of our business, whether
    such acquisition is by merger, consolidation or purchase of all or a substantial
    portion of our assets. In addition, if Internships becomes the subject of a bankruptcy
    proceeding, whether voluntary or involuntary, Internships or its trustee in bankruptcy
    may sell, license or otherwise dispose of such information in a transaction approved
    by the bankruptcy court.</p><br>
<p>
    All Users should be aware that when they voluntarily display or distribute personal
    information (such as their e-mail address) to others (whether in chat rooms, message
    boards or discussion forums, by posting internships, responding to employers message
    or otherwise), that information can be collected and used by others. This may result
    in unsolicited messages from third parties, for which we are not responsible.</p><br>
<p>
    Finally, if you provide any information to parties who operate web sites that are
    linked to or from our Sites, or if you input your information on a co-branded registration
    page such as that of an Internships and partner company-sponsored contest, different
    rules may apply to the collection, use or disclosure of your personal information
    by such other party. We are not responsible for any such party's use of your personal
    information. We encourage you to review these sites' privacy policies before revealing
    any sensitive or personal information.</p><br>
<h3>
    Updating Account Information</h3>
<p>
    Internships allows you to change or correct your personal information at any time.
    To do so, simply log in to your account, go to your profile, and you will find options
    for editing the information you have submitted.</p><br>

<ul>
    <li>Never give out your social security number to a prospective employer via email or
        before you are contracted to work for them.</li>
    <li>Never provide credit card or bank numbers or monetary transaction of any sort to
        employers.</li>
    <li>Be cautious when dealing with contacts outside of your own country.</li>
    <li>Do not provide any non-work related personal information (i.e. social security number,
        eye color, marital status, etc.) over the phone or online.</li>
</ul><br>
<h3>
    Opt-In/Opt-Out Policy</h3>
<p>
    When you complete your profile or register on any of the Sites, you will be presented
    with a series of choices regarding whether you want to receive certain types of
    communications from us and/or our business partners and advertisers. If you do not
    wish to receive any or all of such communications, you may opt-out by responding
    "no" or clicking the appropriate box to opt-out. By opting in to receive any and/or
    all communications, you are granting permission to allow Internships, its business
    partners and advertisers to send the selected communications. We reserve the right
    to send you communications regarding any of the Sites and our services, or to advise
    you of Site changes or other events or occurrences which may affect your access
    to or use of any of the Sites (such as service announcements, administrative notices
    and the like) without offering you the opportunity to opt out of them.</p><br>
<p>
    If after opting-in to the Internships Network or to receive communications from
    us and/or our business partners, you wish to opt-out of participation in the Internships
    Network or from receiving future communications, you may do so at any time. To do
    so, simply log in to your Internships Network account, go to your profile, and you
    will find options for editing your opt-in preferences.</p><br>
<h3>
    Internet Protocol (IP) Addresses and Aggregated User Data</h3>
<p>
    We collect IP addresses from all Users of the Sites, and collect and monitor other
    data and information about the activities of our Users on the Sites collectively.
    We only use such data anonymously and in the aggregate. This data is not used to
    track or monitor personally identifiable information of individual Users. We gather
    and monitor this data to analyze trends, administer the Sites, identify Users when
    they visit the Sites, track Users' movements on the Sites and gather broad demographic
    information for aggregate use. We also may use the IP addresses to geo-target advertisements.
    We may share this information with our partners so that they too may understand
    our User base and Site usage patterns, but only on a collective, aggregated basis
    and in a manner which does not reveal any personally identifiable information about
    any individual User.</p><br>
<p>
    We may use spot light ads/web beacons/GIF and/or pixel tags which are site instrumentation
    tools that help us to determine, for instance, whether a page has been viewed or
    not and, if so, how many times. When you ask us to send you information on a promotion
    or a newsletter, we may use web beacons to establish how many of the emails are
    actually opened. In general, any electronic image viewed as part of a web page,
    including an ad banner, can act as a web beacon. We may use web beacons to collect
    web usage analytics.</p><br>
<p>
    When you visit our website the server housing the pages automatically generates
    a "session log." We use session logs to help us determine how people travel through
    our site. In this way, we can structure our pages so that the information most frequently
    visited is easier to find. By tracking page visits, we can also determine if the
    information we're providing is being used. The only data gathered is the Internet
    Protocol (IP) address from which you came (which contains no personal information),
    the web site that referred you, the pages you visited and the date and time of those
    visits.</p><br>
<p>
    Users may be directed to the Sites via banner ads or site links. Ads or site links
    that are placed by the Sites use cookies or web beacons to deliver metrics on the
    effectiveness of the ads or links. They do not collect personal information from
    the user.</p><br>
<h3>
    Cookies</h3>
<p>
    Cookies, which are small text files recorded in a User's hard drive, are employed
    by thousands of sites to enhance users' Web viewing Internships. Cookies cannot
    damage user files, nor can they read information from a user's hard drive. Cookies
    allow sites and advertisers to "remember" users across pages of a site and across
    multiple visits to a site. Cookies in and of themselves do not personally identify
    Users, although they do identify a User's computer. We use session and persistent
    cookies for remembering User preferences and current session information. Because
    of our use of cookies, we can deliver faster service, more consistent, updated results,
    and a more personalized site.</p><br>
<h3>
    Children</h3>
<p>
    We do not knowingly collect or solicit personally identifiable information from
    or about children under 13 except as permitted by law. If a child has provided us
    with personal information a parent or guardian of that child may contact us at Internships
    LLC 3400 W. Olive Avenue, Suite 220, Burbank, CA 91505 or legal@internships.com
    if they want this information deleted from our records. We will then make reasonable
    efforts to delete the child's information from our records.</p><br>
<h3>
    Security</h3>
<p>
    The accounts containing your registration information, profile and resume are password
    protected, so only you can access your account. Passwords are for each User’s individual
    use and you are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality and security of
    your password. All personally identifiable information we collect about you is stored
    in limited-access servers. All of the Sites have technical, administrative and physical
    security measures and safeguards in place to protect against the loss, misuse and
    alteration of the information under our control. All of the Sites are hosted in
    a secure server environment that uses a firewall and other advanced technology to
    prevent interference or access from outside intruders. While we are committed to
    placing reasonable and appropriate safeguards to protecting your information against
    foreseeable risks, no computer system or information can ever be fully protected
    against every possible hazard, and we cannot guarantee that unauthorized third parties
    will not be able to circumvent those safeguards or use your personal information
    for improper purposes.</p><br>
<p>
    Except as described in the following paragraph, when you purchase products or services
    online at any of the Sites, your credit card information is protected through the
    use of encryption software -SSL, which makes it difficult for unauthorized third
    parties to intercept or steal your credit card information while it is being transmitted.
    Internships uses a service company to process its credit card transactions. While
    on a secure page, such as one of our order forms, the lock icon on the bottom of
    Web browsers such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer versions
    4.0 or higher becomes locked.</p><br>
<p>
    While we use SSL encryption and user passwords to protect sensitive information
    online, we also protect user-information off-line. All of our users' information,
    not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted in our offices.
    Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example,
    our billing clerk or a member service representative) are granted access to sensitive
    or personally identifiable information. Furthermore, all employees are kept up-to-date
    on our security and privacy practices. Every quarter, as well as any time new policies
    are added, our employees are notified and/or reminded about the importance we place
    on privacy, and what they can do to ensure our members' information is protected.</p><br>
<h3>
    Your California Rights</h3>
<p>
    A California resident who has provided personal information to a business with whom
    he/she has established a business relationship for personal, family, or household
    purposes ("California customer") is entitled to request information about whether
    the business has disclosed personal information to any third parties for the third
    parties’ direct marketing purposes. In general, if the business has made such a
    disclosure of personal information, upon receipt of a request by a California customer,
    the business is required to provide a list of all third parties to whom personal
    information was disclosed in the preceding calendar year, as well as a list of the
    categories of personal information that were disclosed.</p><br>
<p>
    However, under the law, a business is not required to provide the above-described
    lists if the business adopts and discloses to the public (in its privacy policy)
    a policy of not disclosing customer’s personal information to third parties for
    their direct marketing purposes unless the customer first affirmatively agrees to
    the disclosure, as long as the business maintains and discloses this policy. Rather,
    the business may comply with the law by notifying the customer of his or her right
    to prevent disclosure of personal information and providing a cost free means to
    exercise that right.</p><br>
<p>
    As stated above, we do not share information with third parties for their direct
    marketing purposes unless you affirmatively agree to such disclosure. If you do
    ask us to share your information with a third party for its marketing purposes,
    we will only share information in connection with that specific promotion, as we
    do not share information with any third party on a continual basis. To prevent disclosure
    of your personal information for use in direct marketing by a third party, do not
    opt-in to such use when you provide personally identifiable information on one of
    our sites. Please note that whenever you opt-in to receive future communications
    from a third party, your information will be subject to the third party's privacy
    policy. If you later decide that you do not want that third party to use your information,
    you will need to contact the third party directly, as we have no control over how
    third parties use information. You should always review the privacy policy of any
    party that collects your information to determine how that entity will handle your
    information.</p><br>
<p>
    California customers may request further information about our compliance with this
    law by e-mailing legal@internships.com. Please note that we are only required to
    respond to one request per customer each year, and we are not required to respond
    to requests made by means other than through this e-mail address.</p><br>
<h3>
    Privacy Policy Changes</h3>
<p>
    We may deem it necessary or appropriate from time to time to modify this privacy
    policy to reflect changes in the way we collect or use information or changes in
    privacy-related laws, regulations or industry standards. Accordingly, we reserve
    the right to change this Privacy Policy at any time by posting the revised policy
    on this Site. Information will be handled according to the privacy policy in effect
    at the time the information is used. Your continued use of our Sites following the
    posting of changes to this Privacy Policy will mean you accept those changes.</p><br>
