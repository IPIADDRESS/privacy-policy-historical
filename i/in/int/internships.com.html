<p>7)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Internet Protocol (IP) Addresses and Aggregated User Data</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We may collect IP addresses from all Users of the Sites or Services, and collect and monitor other data and information about the activities of our Users on the Site or Services collectively.&nbsp; We only use such data anonymously and in the aggregate.&nbsp; This data is not used to track or monitor personally identifiable information of individual Users.&nbsp; We gather and monitor this data to analyze trends, administer the Site or Services, identify Users when they visit the Site or use the Services, track Users’ movements on the Site or through use of the Services, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use.&nbsp; We also may use the IP addresses to geo-target advertisements.&nbsp; We may share this information with our partners so that they too may understand our User base and Site and Service usage patterns, but only on a collective, aggregated basis and in a manner which does not reveal any personally identifiable information about any individual User.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We may use spot light ads/web beacons/GIF and/or pixel tags which are site instrumentation tools that help us to determine, for instance, whether a page has been viewed or not and, if so, how many times.&nbsp; When you ask us to send you information on a promotion or a newsletter, we may use web beacons to establish how many of the emails are actually opened.&nbsp; In general, any electronic image viewed as part of a web page, including an ad banner, can act as a web beacon. We may use web beacons to collect web usage analytics.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When you visit the Site, the server housing the pages automatically generates a “session log.” We use session logs to help us determine how people travel through the Site.&nbsp; In this way, we can structure our pages so that the information most frequently visited is easier to find.&nbsp; By tracking page visits, we can also determine if the information we’re providing is being used.&nbsp; The only data gathered is the Internet Protocol (IP) address from which you came (which contains no personal information), the web site that referred you, the pages you visited and the date and time of those visits.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Users may be directed to the Site or Services via banner ads or site links.&nbsp; Ads or Site links that are placed by the Site use cookies or web beacons to deliver metrics on the effectiveness of the ads or links.&nbsp; They do not collect personal information from the user.&nbsp;</p>
<p>8)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Cookies</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cookies, which are small text files recorded in a User’s hard drive, are employed by thousands of sites to enhance users’ Web viewing the Site.&nbsp; Cookies cannot damage user files, nor can they read information from a user’s hard drive.&nbsp; Cookies allow sites and advertisers to “remember” users across pages of a site and across multiple visits to a site.&nbsp; Cookies in and of themselves do not personally identify Users, although they do identify a User’s computer.&nbsp; We use session and persistent cookies for remembering User preferences and current session information.&nbsp; Because of our use of cookies, we can deliver faster service, more consistent, updated results, and a more personalized site.</p>
<p>9)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Children Under 13</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Site and Services are not intended for children under the age of 13 and we do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under the age of 13.&nbsp; If we become aware that a child under the age of 13 has provided us with personally identifiable information, we will delete such personally identifiable information from our records.&nbsp;</p>
<p>10)&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Security</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The accounts containing your registration information, profile and resume are password protected, so only you can access your account.&nbsp; Passwords are for each User’s individual use and you are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality and security of your password. All personally identifiable information we collect about you is stored in limited-access servers.&nbsp; The Site has technical, administrative and physical security measures and safeguards in place to protect against the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control.&nbsp; The Site is hosted in a secure server environment that uses a firewall and other advanced technology to prevent interference or access from outside intruders.&nbsp; We are committed to placing reasonable and appropriate safeguards to protecting your information against foreseeable risks.&nbsp; However, no computer system or information can ever be fully protected against every possible hazard, and we cannot guarantee that unauthorized third parties will not be able to circumvent those safeguards or use your personal information for improper purposes.&nbsp; While one of our primary purposes is to provide job seekers with a platform to broadcast the information in their resumes and profile to maximize their career opportunities, such a platform does present a risk that unauthorized third parties will view this data so please follow the practices suggested by this Policy and our Site to conduct a safe and secure job search.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Except as described in the following paragraph, when you subscribe to products or services online at the Site, your credit card information is protected through the use of encryption software -SSL, which makes it difficult for unauthorized third parties to intercept or steal your credit card information while it is being transmitted.&nbsp; CareerArc uses a service company to process its credit card transactions.&nbsp; While on a secure page, such as one of our order forms, the lock icon on the bottom of Web browsers such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer versions 4.0 or higher becomes locked.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While we use SSL encryption and user passwords to protect sensitive information online, we also protect user-information off-line. All of our Users’ information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted in our offices.&nbsp; Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, our billing clerk or a member service representative) are granted access to sensitive or personally identifiable information.&nbsp; Furthermore, all employees are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy practices.&nbsp;</p>
<p>11)&nbsp;<strong>Your California Rights</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A California resident who has provided personal information to a business with whom he/she has established a business relationship for personal, family, or household purposes (“California customer”) is entitled to request information about whether the business has disclosed personal information to any third parties for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes.&nbsp; In general, if the business has made such a disclosure of personal information, upon receipt of a request by a California customer, the business is required to provide a list of all third parties to whom personal information was disclosed in the preceding calendar year, as well as a list of the categories of personal information that were disclosed.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, under the law, a business is not required to provide the above-described lists if the business adopts and discloses to the public (in its privacy policy) a policy of not disclosing customer’s personal information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes unless the customer first affirmatively agrees to the disclosure, as long as the business maintains and discloses this policy. Rather, the business may comply with the law by notifying the customer of his or her right to prevent disclosure of personal information and providing a cost free means to exercise that right.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As stated above, we do not share information with third parties for their direct marketing purposes unless you affirmatively agree to such disclosure. &nbsp;If you do ask us to share your information with a third party for its marketing purposes, we will only share information in connection with that specific promotion, as we do not share information with any third party on a continual basis.&nbsp; To prevent disclosure of your personal information for use in direct marketing by a third party, do not opt-in to such use when you provide personally identifiable information on the Site or through use of the Services.&nbsp; Please note that whenever you opt-in to receive future communications from a third party, your information will be subject to the third party’s privacy policy.&nbsp; If you later decide that you do not want that third party to use your information, you will need to contact the third party directly, as we have no control over how third parties use information.&nbsp; You should always review the privacy policy of any party that collects your information to determine how that entity will handle your information.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; California customers may request further information about our compliance with this law by e-mailing legal@careerarcgroup.com. Please note that we are only required to respond to one request per customer each year, and we are not required to respond to requests made by means other than through this e-mail address.&nbsp;</p>
<p>12) &nbsp;<strong>Privacy Policy Changes</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We may deem it necessary or appropriate from time to time to modify this privacy policy to reflect changes in the way we collect or use information or changes in privacy-related laws, regulations or industry standards.&nbsp; Accordingly, we reserve the right to change this Privacy Policy at any time by posting the revised policy on this Site.&nbsp; Information will be handled according to the privacy policy in effect at the time the information is used.&nbsp; Your continued use of the Site and the Services following the posting of changes to this Privacy Policy will mean you accept those changes.&nbsp;</p>
