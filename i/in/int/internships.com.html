This Privacy  Policy discloses     what information we collect, how we use it and how to correct and  change it.

While we take  measures to safeguard     your information from unauthorized access or inappropriate use by  third parties,     we do not control these third parties and we are not responsible for  their use of     information you post or otherwise make available. Accordingly, you  should ensure     that you do not post sensitive information to any of the Sites.</p>

<p>If you choose to publish your profile, upload or create a resume or  any other document     containing personal information so that employers can find you in  the internship.com     database or to participate in the CareerBeam Network, InternDirect  Partner Network,     the CareerSearch Network or any of our other Networks, your personal  profile information     and resume will be searchable by and accessible to employers who  have access to     those databases. However, if you used the internship.com QuickBuild  Resume™     we will not display your email address or mailing address to  employers - we will     display all the other elements of your resume. Please note that for  either uploaded     or resumes created on our website they must not contain sensitive  data relating     to your (i) racial or ethnic origin (ii) political beliefs (iii)  philosophical or     religious beliefs (iv) membership of a trade union or political  party (v) physical     or mental health or genetic makeup (vi) addictions, sexual life  (vii) the commission     of criminal offences or proceedings and associated penalties or  fines, or (viii)     any Social Security Number or state or national identification  number. If you provide     us with details of a professional reference, it is your  responsibility to ensure     that the person is aware that you have forwarded his/her details and  has consented     in writing for you to do so.</p>
<p>While we endeavor to restrict access to these databases to eligible  employers, we     cannot guarantee that other parties will not, without our consent,  gain access to     these databases as well. You may make your profile private and thus  unsearchable     or opt out of any of our Networks at any time. However, employers  and recruiters     who have access to these databases, and other parties who have  otherwise gained     access to these databases may have retained a copy of your profile  or resume in     their own files or databases. We are not responsible for the  retention, use or privacy     of resumes in these instances, or for the use or privacy of resumes  or other personal     information of Users by any of such parties while such resumes or  personal information     are in resume books or any of our Networks.</p>
<p>With your permission, we may use your e-mail address and other  contact information     to send you articles, profiles, industry news and other career  related information,     as well as to notify you of special promotions or additional  products and services     offered by us or our business partners and advertisers that may be  of interest to     you. With your permission, we may also share your personal  information with our     business partners and other third parties to enable them to contact  you regarding     special promotions, products and services they offer which may be of  interest to     you. You have the ability to opt-out of these types of  communications at any time     (see "Opt-in/Opt-out Policy" below).</p>
<p>We may use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you  visit our Site.     These companies may use information (not including your name, street  address, email     or telephone number) about your visits to the Sites and other web  sites in order     to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to  you.</p>
<p>We employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on  our behalf. Examples     may include hosting our web servers, analyzing data, providing  marketing assistance,     processing credit card payments, and providing customer service.  These other companies     will have access to your personal information as necessary to  perform their functions,     but they are required to maintain the confidentiality of your  information and are     prohibited from using your personal information except to provide  services to us.</p>
<p>From time to time, we may also disclose personally identifiable  information to fulfill     certain legal and regulatory requirements or if we believe, in good  faith, that     such disclosure is legally required or necessary to protect others'  rights or to     prevent or mitigate harm. We may also disclose and transfer such  information to     a third party who acquires all or a substantial portion of our  business, whether     such acquisition is by merger, consolidation or purchase of all or a  substantial     portion of our assets. In addition, if Internships becomes the  subject of a bankruptcy     proceeding, whether voluntary or involuntary, Internships or its  trustee in bankruptcy     may sell, license or otherwise dispose of such information in a  transaction approved     by the bankruptcy court.</p>
<p>All Users should be aware that when they voluntarily display or  distribute personal     information (such as their e-mail address) to others (whether in  chat rooms, message     boards or discussion forums, by posting internships, responding to  employers message     or otherwise), that information can be collected and used by others.  This may result     in unsolicited messages from third parties, for which we are not  responsible.</p>
<p>Finally, if you provide any information to parties who operate web  sites that are     linked to or from our Sites, or if you input your information on a  co-branded registration     page such as that of an Internships and partner company-sponsored  contest, different     rules may apply to the collection, use or disclosure of your  personal information     by such other party. We are not responsible for any such party's use  of your personal     information. We encourage you to review these sites' privacy  policies before revealing     any sensitive or personal information.</p>
<h3>Updating Account Information</h3>
<p>Internships allows you to change or correct your personal  information at any time.     To do so, simply log in to your account, go to your profile, and you  will find options     for editing the information you have submitted.</p>
<h3>Some Important Tips to Use When Dealing With Prospective Employers</h3>
<ul>
<li>Never give out your social security number to a prospective  employer via email or         before you are contracted to work for them.</li>
<li>Never provide credit card or bank numbers or monetary  transaction of any sort to         employers.</li>
<li>Be cautious when dealing with contacts outside of your own  country.</li>
<li>Do not provide any non-work related personal information (i.e.  social security number,         eye color, marital status, etc.) over the phone or online.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Opt-In/Opt-Out Policy</h3>
<p>When you complete your profile or register on any of the Sites, you  will be presented     with a series of choices regarding whether you want to receive  certain types of     communications from us and/or our business partners and advertisers.  If you do not     wish to receive any or all of such communications, you may opt-out  by responding     "no" or clicking the appropriate box to opt-out. By opting in to  receive any and/or     all communications, you are granting permission to allow  Internships, its business     partners and advertisers to send the selected communications. We  reserve the right     to send you communications regarding any of the Sites and our  services, or to advise     you of Site changes or other events or occurrences which may affect  your access     to or use of any of the Sites (such as service announcements,  administrative notices     and the like) without offering you the opportunity to opt out of  them.</p>
<p>If after opting-in to the Internships Network or to receive  communications from     us and/or our business partners, you wish to opt-out of  participation in the Internships     Network or from receiving future communications, you may do so at  any time. To do     so, simply log in to your Internships Network account, go to your  profile, and you     will find options for editing your opt-in preferences.</p>
<h3>Internet Protocol (IP) Addresses and Aggregated User Data</h3>
<p>We collect IP addresses from all Users of the Sites, and collect and  monitor other     data and information about the activities of our Users on the Sites  collectively.     We only use such data anonymously and in the aggregate. This data is  not used to     track or monitor personally identifiable information of individual  Users. We gather     and monitor this data to analyze trends, administer the Sites,  identify Users when     they visit the Sites, track Users' movements on the Sites and gather  broad demographic     information for aggregate use. We also may use the IP addresses to  geo-target advertisements.     We may share this information with our partners so that they too may  understand     our User base and Site usage patterns, but only on a collective,  aggregated basis     and in a manner which does not reveal any personally identifiable  information about     any individual User.</p>
<p>We may use spot light ads/web beacons/GIF and/or pixel tags which  are site instrumentation     tools that help us to determine, for instance, whether a page has  been viewed or     not and, if so, how many times. When you ask us to send you  information on a promotion     or a newsletter, we may use web beacons to establish how many of the  emails are     actually opened. In general, any electronic image viewed as part of a  web page,     including an ad banner, can act as a web beacon. We may use web  beacons to collect     web usage analytics.</p>
<p>When you visit our website the server housing the pages  automatically generates     a "session log." We use session logs to help us determine how people  travel through     our site. In this way, we can structure our pages so that the  information most frequently     visited is easier to find. By tracking page visits, we can also  determine if the     information we're providing is being used. The only data gathered is  the Internet     Protocol (IP) address from which you came (which contains no  personal information),     the web site that referred you, the pages you visited and the date  and time of those     visits.</p>
<p>Users may be directed to the Sites via banner ads or site links. Ads  or site links     that are placed by the Sites use cookies or web beacons to deliver  metrics on the     effectiveness of the ads or links. They do not collect personal  information from     the user.</p>
<h3>Cookies</h3>
<p>Cookies, which are small text files recorded in a User's hard drive,  are employed     by thousands of sites to enhance users' Web viewing Internships.  Cookies cannot     damage user files, nor can they read information from a user's hard  drive. Cookies     allow sites and advertisers to "remember" users across pages of a  site and across     multiple visits to a site. Cookies in and of themselves do not  personally identify     Users, although they do identify a User's computer. We use session  and persistent     cookies for remembering User preferences and current session  information. Because     of our use of cookies, we can deliver faster service, more  consistent, updated results,     and a more personalized site.</p>
<h3>Children</h3>
<p>We do not knowingly collect or solicit personally identifiable  information from     or about children under 13 except as permitted by law. If a child  has provided us     with personal information a parent or guardian of that child may  contact us at Internships     LLC 3400 W. Olive Avenue, Suite 220, Burbank, CA 91505 or  legal@internships.com     if they want this information deleted from our records. We will then  make reasonable     efforts to delete the child's information from our records.</p>
<h3>Security</h3>
<p>The accounts containing your registration information, profile and  resume are password     protected, so only you can access your account. Passwords are for  each User’s individual     use and you are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality and  security of     your password. All personally identifiable information we collect  about you is stored     in limited-access servers. All of the Sites have technical,  administrative and physical     security measures and safeguards in place to protect against the  loss, misuse and     alteration of the information under our control. All of the Sites  are hosted in     a secure server environment that uses a firewall and other advanced  technology to     prevent interference or access from outside intruders. While we are  committed to     placing reasonable and appropriate safeguards to protecting your  information against     foreseeable risks, no computer system or information can ever be  fully protected     against every possible hazard, and we cannot guarantee that  unauthorized third parties     will not be able to circumvent those safeguards or use your personal  information     for improper purposes.</p>
<p>Except as described in the following paragraph, when you purchase  products or services     online at any of the Sites, your credit card information is  protected through the     use of encryption software -SSL, which makes it difficult for  unauthorized third     parties to intercept or steal your credit card information while it  is being transmitted.     Internships uses a service company to process its credit card  transactions. While     on a secure page, such as one of our order forms, the lock icon on  the bottom of     Web browsers such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet  Explorer versions     4.0 or higher becomes locked.</p>
<p>While we use SSL encryption and user passwords to protect sensitive  information     online, we also protect user-information off-line. All of our users'  information,     not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted in  our offices.     Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job  (for example,     our billing clerk or a member service representative) are granted  access to sensitive     or personally identifiable information. Furthermore, all employees  are kept up-to-date     on our security and privacy practices. Every quarter, as well as any  time new policies     are added, our employees are notified and/or reminded about the  importance we place     on privacy, and what they can do to ensure our members' information  is protected.</p>
<h3>Your California Rights</h3>
<p>A California resident who has provided personal information to a  business with whom     he/she has established a business relationship for personal, family,  or household     purposes ("California customer") is entitled to request information  about whether     the business has disclosed personal information to any third parties  for the third     parties’ direct marketing purposes. In general, if the business has  made such a     disclosure of personal information, upon receipt of a request by a  California customer,     the business is required to provide a list of all third parties to  whom personal     information was disclosed in the preceding calendar year, as well as  a list of the     categories of personal information that were disclosed.</p>
<p>However, under the law, a business is not required to provide the  above-described     lists if the business adopts and discloses to the public (in its  privacy policy)     a policy of not disclosing customer’s personal information to third  parties for     their direct marketing purposes unless the customer first  affirmatively agrees to     the disclosure, as long as the business maintains and discloses this  policy. Rather,     the business may comply with the law by notifying the customer of  his or her right     to prevent disclosure of personal information and providing a cost  free means to     exercise that right.</p>
<p>As stated above, we do not share information with third parties for  their direct     marketing purposes unless you affirmatively agree to such  disclosure. If you do     ask us to share your information with a third party for its  marketing purposes,     we will only share information in connection with that specific  promotion, as we     do not share information with any third party on a continual basis.  To prevent disclosure     of your personal information for use in direct marketing by a third  party, do not     opt-in to such use when you provide personally identifiable  information on one of     our sites. Please note that whenever you opt-in to receive future  communications     from a third party, your information will be subject to the third  party's privacy     policy. If you later decide that you do not want that third party to  use your information,     you will need to contact the third party directly, as we have no  control over how     third parties use information. You should always review the privacy  policy of any     party that collects your information to determine how that entity  will handle your     information.</p>
<p>California customers may request further information about our  compliance with this     law by e-mailing legal@internships.com. Please note that we are only  required to     respond to one request per customer each year, and we are not  required to respond     to requests made by means other than through this e-mail address.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Privacy Policy Changes</h3>
<p>We may deem it necessary or appropriate from time to time to modify  this privacy     policy to reflect changes in the way we collect or use information  or changes in     privacy-related laws, regulations or industry standards.  Accordingly, we reserve     the right to change this Privacy Policy at any time by posting the  revised policy     on this Site. Information will be handled according to the privacy  policy in effect     at the time the information is used. Your continued use of our Sites  following the     posting of changes to this Privacy Policy will mean you accept those  changes.</p>
<h3>Questions or Concerns</h3>
<p>If you have any questions or concerns regarding this Privacy Policy  or privacy issues     relating to the Sites, you can <a href="/contact">contact us by email</a> or by  mail:</p>
