<p> By visiting, using and/or submitting information to www.interest.com, you are accepting the practices described in this Privacy Policy and the terms and conditions of Interest.com's Agreement of Terms of Use located at the URL www.interest.com/terms (the "Terms of Use"). 
</p><p>Interest.com takes your privacy seriously, and has published this Privacy Policy to explain how Interest.com treats all information you may submit to www.interest.com, except that information which is submitted pursuant to a sweepstakes entry. Refer to the Official Rules and Privacy Policy for each individual sweepstakes for Interest.com's specific policies regarding information sharing and disclosure pursuant to sweepstakes entry. 


</p><p><strong>Collection of Personally Identifiable Information</strong>

</p><p>Many of the features of www.interest.com are available to you without your providing personally identifiable information. The following are certain situations in which Interest.com may collect personally identifiable information from you:
</p><ul>
	<li><strong>Registration for Newsletters and Sweepstakes.</strong>  Interest.com collects personally identifiable information from you if you register online for one of Interest.com's newsletters and when you enter Interest.com's sweepstakes. When you register online with Interest.com, Interest.com asks for personally identifiable information like your name, e-mail address, birth date, gender, ZIP code, occupation, industry, personal interests and other demographic information. 
<br><br>
	</li><li><strong>Use of Forums.</strong>  If you choose to transmit, submit or post information through Interest.com's chat rooms, bulletin boards or other forums (the "Forums"), Interest.com will collect that information you provide.  Interest.com retains this information as necessary to resolve disputes, provide customer support and troubleshoot problems as permitted by law and pursuant to Interest.com's Terms of Use.
<br><br>
	</li><li><strong>Forms.</strong>  Interest.com may collect personally identifiable information from you if you choose fill out any forms, profiles, or surveys on www.interest.com.
<br><br>
	</li><li><strong>Correspondence.</strong>  If you send Interest.com personal correspondence, such as emails or letters, or if other users or third parties send Interest.com correspondence about your activities or postings on www.interest.com, Interest.com may choose to collect such information into a file specific to you.
<br><br>
	</li><li><strong>Business Partners.</strong> Interest.com may receive your personally identifiable information from one of Interest.com's business partners.
</li></ul>

<p><strong>Use of Personally Identifiable Information</strong>

</p><p>Interest.com uses your personally identifiable information to improve and customize the advertising and content you see on Interest.com's Web sites, to fulfill your requests for certain products and services, and, if you permit Interest.com or Interest.com's affiliates, to contact you about special offers and new products.  Your personally identifiable information may also be aggregated and used by Interest.com for market research, project planning, troubleshooting problems, detecting and protecting against error, fraud or other criminal activity, to enforce Interest.com's Terms of Use, for other internal purposes, and as otherwise described to you at the time of collection. Interest.com will obtain your consent for any use of your personally identifiable information beyond the original uses for which you provided your consent.

</p><p>You agree that Interest.com may use personal information about you to improve Interest.com's marketing and promotional efforts, analyze site usage, improve Interest.com's content and product offerings, customize www.interest.com's content, layout, and services, and as otherwise set forth in this Privacy Policy.  You also agree that Interest.com may use your personal information to contact you and deliver information to you that, in some cases, is targeted to your interests, such as targeted banner advertisements, administrative notices, product offerings, and communications relevant to your use of www.interest.com. By accepting the Terms of Use and this Privacy Policy, you expressly agree to receive this information.  If you do not wish to receive these communications, Interest.com encourages you opt out of the receipt of certain communications, as set forth below.


</p><p><strong>Disclosure of Personally Identifiable Information</strong>

</p><p>Unless you are entering one of Interest.com's sweepstakes, Interest.com does not currently share, loan, rent or sell your personally identifiable information.  However, the following describes some of the ways that your personally identifiable information may be disclosed in the normal scope of business to provide Interest.com's services:
</p><ul>
	<li><strong>Advertisers.</strong>  Interest.com may aggregate personally identifiable information and disclose such information in a non-personally identifiable manner to advertisers and other third parties for their marketing and promotional purposes.  However, in these situations, Interest.com does not disclose to these entities any information that could be used to identify you personally.  Certain information, such as your name, email address, password, credit card number, and bank account number, are not disclosed to these third parties in a personally identifiable manner without your explicit consent.
<br><br>
	</li><li><strong>External Service Providers.</strong>  There are a number of separate services offered by third parties, including, without limitation, Interest.com's affiliates, that Interest.com refers to as external service providers that may be complementary to your use of www.interest.com (e.g. realtors, mortgage brokers, lenders, financial institutions, credit card issuers, information aggregators).  If you choose to use these separate services, disclose information to the external service providers, and/or grant them permission to collect information about you, then their use of your information is governed by their privacy policy.  Interest.com does not disclose your personally identifiable information to external service providers unless you provide your explicit consent.  With your consent, Interest.com may provide some of your personal information to the external service provider offering such services, for your convenience.  To prevent Interest.com's disclosure of your personally identifiable information to an external service provider, you can decline such consent or simply not use their services.  You should evaluate the practices of external services providers before deciding to use their services.
<br><br>
	</li><li><strong>Internal Service Providers.</strong>  Interest.com may use third parties that Interest.com refers to as internal service providers to facilitate or outsource one or more aspects of Interest.com's business, product and service operations that Interest.com provides to you (e.g., technology, Forums, newsletters/alerts, analytical tools, advertising campaign management) and therefore Interest.com may provide some of your personal information directly to these internal service providers.  These internal service providers are subject to confidentiality agreements with Interest.com or other legal restrictions that prohibit their use of the information Interest.com provides them for any other purpose except to facilitate the specific outsourced Interest.com related operation, unless you have explicitly agreed or given your prior permission to them for additional uses.  In some instances, the internal service provider may collect information directly from you.  In these cases, you will be notified of the involvement of the internal service provider, and all additional information you provide them and their additional uses will be strictly up to you.  If you provide additional information to an internal service provider directly, then their use of your personally identifiable information is governed by their applicable privacy policy.
</li></ul>
<p>Notwithstanding the foregoing, Interest.com reserves the right (and you authorize Interest.com) to share or disclose your personally identifiable information when Interest.com determines, in its sole discretion, that the disclosure of your personally identifiable information is necessary to identify, contact, or bring legal action against you if:
</p><ul>
	<li>you are or may be violating this Privacy Policy or Interest.com's Terms of Use;
<br><br>
	</li><li>you are interfering with another's rights or property, including, without limitation, Interest.com's rights or property; 
<br><br>
	</li><li>you are violating any applicable law, rule or regulation; 
<br><br>
	</li><li>necessary or required by any applicable law, rule or regulation; and/or 
<br><br>
	</li><li>requested by authorities in the event of any act of terrorism or instance of local, regional or national emergency.
</li></ul>
<p>Personally identifiable information and other personal information collected from you may also be transferred to a third party as a result of a sale, acquisition, merger, reorganization, other transfer or bankruptcy (a "Transfer") involving Interest.com and/or its affiliates.  Interest.com specifically reserves the right to transfer personally identifiable information collected from www.interest.com, and any of its databases, together with any personally identifiable information contained therein, to a third party in connection with a Transfer, and nothing in this Privacy Policy is intended to interfere with the ability of Interest.com to transfer all or part of its business and/or assets (including www.interest.com) to an affiliate or independent third party at any time, for any purpose, without any limitation whatsoever.

</p><p>In addition, due to the existing regulatory environment, Interest.com cannot ensure that all of your private communications and other personally identifiable information will never be disclosed in ways not otherwise described in this Privacy Policy.  By way of example (without limiting the foregoing), Interest.com may be forced to disclose personal information to the government or third parties under certain circumstances or third parties may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private communications.  Therefore, although Interest.com uses industry standard practices to protect your privacy, Interest.com does not promise, and you should not expect, that your personally identifiable information or private communications will always remain private.

</p><p><strong>NOTE: If you are submitting personally identifiable information pursuant to sweepstakes entry, Interest.com reserves the right to share, loan, rent and/or sell the personally identifiable information that you submit with its affiliates and other third parties. Please refer to the Official Rules and Privacy Policy for each individual sweepstakes for the specific guidelines regarding information sharing and disclosure.</strong>

</p><p><strong>Changes to Personally Identifiable Information and Use Preferences</strong>

</p><p>You may at any time request a copy of Interest.com's record of your personally identifiable information, change your personally identifiable information or use preferences, or opt-out of Interest.com's use of your personally identifiable information by contacting Interest.com via any of the methods set forth below:
	</p><ul>

</p><p><strong>Cookie technology</strong>

</p><p>"Cookies" are alphanumeric identifiers in the form of text files that are inserted and stored by your web browser on your computer's hard drive. Interest.com may set and access cookies on your computer to track and store preferential information about you.

</p><p><strong>Web beacons</strong>

</p><p>"Web beacons", also called single-pixels (1x1) or clear GIFs, are electronic images that allow a website to access cookies and help track marketing campaigns and general usage patterns of visitors to those websites.  Web beacons can recognize certain types of information, such as cookie numbers, time and date of a page view, and a description of the page where the Web beacon is placed.  No personally identifiable information about you is shared with third parties through the use of web beacons.  
</p><ul>
	<li><strong>Internal use of web beacons.</strong>  Interest.com may use web beacons internally to count users and recognize users through cookies.  Access to cookies helps Interest.com personalize your experience when you visit Interest.com.com.  
<br><br>
	</li><li><strong>Email.</strong>  Interest.com may include web beacons in HTML-formatted email messages that Interest.com or its affiliates or agents send.  Including web beacons in email messages helps Interest.com determine your interest in and the effectiveness of such emails.
<br><br>
	</li><li><strong>External use of web beacons.</strong>  Interest.com may also use web beacons externally.  For example, Interest.com may report aggregate information about Interest.com.com users, such as demographic and usage information, to its partners and other third parties.  Interest.com may also include other company's web beacons within Interest.com.com.  
</li></ul>

<p><strong>Security</strong>

</p><p>Personally identifiable information you submit to Interest.com is password-protected for your privacy and security. In certain areas Interest.com uses industry-standard SSL-encryption to protect data transmissions. In the unlikely event that an unauthorized third party compromises Interest.com security measures, Interest.com will not be responsible for any damages directly or indirectly caused by an unauthorized third party's ability to view, use or disseminate such information.


</p><p><strong>Links to Other Web sites</strong>

</p><p>www.interest.com may include links to other third party Web sites. Such links are not an endorsement by Interest.com of those Web sites and/or the products or services offered there. Third party Web sites may have different privacy policies and Interest.com is not responsible for the privacy practices of those third party Web sites. If you click on a link to a third party Web site, Interest.com encourages you to check the privacy policy of that Web site, as it may differ substantially from that of this Privacy Policy.

</p><p><strong>Governing Law; Arbitration</strong>

</p><p>This Privacy Policy is to be governed by and construed in accordance with the internal laws of the State of Florida, without regard for principles of conflicts of laws. Any civil action, claim, dispute or proceeding arising out of, or relating to, this Privacy Policy shall be referred to final and binding arbitration, before a single arbitrator, under the commercial arbitration rules of the American Arbitration Association in Palm Beach County, Florida. You and Interest.com shall select the arbitrator, and if you and Interest.com are unable to reach agreement on selection of the arbitrator within thirty (30) days after the notice of arbitration is served, then the American Arbitration Association shall select the arbitrator. Arbitration shall not commence until the party requesting it has deposited One Thousand Dollars ($1,000.00) with the arbitrator as a retainer for the arbitrator's fees and costs. The party requesting arbitration shall advance such sums as are required from time to time by the arbitrator to pay the arbitrator's fees and costs until the prevailing party is determined or the parties have agreed in writing to an alternate allocation of fees and costs.

</p><p>Judgment upon any award rendered by the arbitrator shall be final, binding and conclusive upon you and Interest.com, and your and Interest.com's respective administrators, executors, legal representatives, successors and assigns, and may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. Notwithstanding the previous sentence, in no event shall either you or Interest.com be entitled to punitive, special, indirect or consequential damages, and both you and Interest.com hereby waive your rights to any punitive, special, indirect or consequential damages, including, but not limited to, damages for any loss of profit, revenue or business.


</p><p><strong>Miscellaneous</strong>

</p><p>If any portion of this Privacy Policy is deemed unlawful, void or unenforceable by any arbitrator, this Privacy Policy as a whole shall not be deemed unlawful, void or unenforceable, but only that portion of this Privacy Policy that is unlawful, void or unenforceable shall be stricken from this Privacy Policy.
</p><p>The headings contained in this Privacy Policy are for convenience of reference only, are not to be considered a part of this Privacy Policy, and shall not limit or otherwise affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Privacy Policy.

</p><p>All covenants, agreements, representations and warranties made in this Privacy Policy, as may be amended by Interest.com from time to time, shall survive your acceptance of this Privacy Policy.

</p><p>This Privacy Policy and the Terms of Use represent the entire understanding and agreement between you and Interest.com regarding the subject matter of the same, and supersede all other previous agreements, understandings and/or representations regarding the same.
