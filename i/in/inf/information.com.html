<p>At Information.com, we strive to develop innovative services to better serve our users. We
recognize that privacy is an important issue, so we design and
operate our services with the protection of your privacy in mind.
This privacy policy ("Privacy Policy") outlines the types of personal information we
gather when you use Information.com services, as well as some of the
steps we take to safeguard it. 
</p>
<p><b>Data collection </b>
</p>
<ul>
	<li><p>Information.com
	does not require any personally identifying information, except as set forth below.
	</p>
	</li><li><p>We collect limited
	non-personally identifying information your browser makes available
	whenever you visit a website. This log information includes your
	Internet Protocol address, browser type, browser language, the date
	and time of your query and one or more cookies that may uniquely
	identify your browser. We use this information to operate, develop
	and improve our services. 
	</p>
	</li><li><p>
	We use Coremetrics, a service provider, to help us gather and analyze information about our customers.  Coremetrics' only role is to help us conduct our business and deliver the most relevant products and services.  If you would like to deactivate our ability to analyze your anonymous browsing and purchase behavior through the use of this service or find out more about our service provider, including its privacy policy and how to opt out, go to: http://www.coremetrics.com/info_eluminate2.html
	</p>
	</li><li><p>Some of our
	services require you to register for an account. Information.com
	asks you for some personal information in order to create an account
	(typically your name, username and a password for your account) and
	we will use that information to provide the service. 
	</p>
	</li><li><p>
	In the event that our parent company or we merge with or are acquired by another legal entity, the personal information collected by us may be transferred to that other legal entity as an asset.
	</p>
	</li><li><p>
	We will disclose personally identifiable information without your permission when we believe in good faith that such disclosure is required by law, or is necessary or desirable to investigate or protect against harmful activities to customers, employees, or others, or to property (including this site).
	</p>
</li></ul>
<p><b>Cookies </b>
</p>
<ul>
	<li><p>Upon your first
	visit to Information.com, a cookie is sent to your computer that
	uniquely identifies your browser. A "cookie" is a small
	file containing a string of characters that is sent to your computer
	when you visit a website. We use cookies to improve the quality of
	our service and to better understand how people interact with us.
	Information.com does this by storing user preferences in cookies and
	by tracking user trends and patterns of how people search. Most
	browsers are initially set up to accept cookies. You can reset your
	browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being
	sent. 
	</p>
</li></ul>
<p><b>Updating your
information</b></p>
<ul>
	<li><p>We provide
	mechanisms for updating and correcting your personally identifying
	information for many of our services. For more information, please
	see the help pages for each service. 
	</p>
</li></ul>
<p><b>Links </b>
</p>
<ul>
	<li><p>The sites
	displayed as search results or linked to by Information.com services
	are developed by people over whom Information.com exercises no
	control. These other sites may place their own cookies on your
	computer, collect data or solicit personal information. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy policy of each web site that collects personally identifiable information. This Privacy Policy applies solely to information collected by this web site.
	</p>
	</li><li><p>Information.com
	may present links in a format that enables us to understand whether
	they have been followed. We use this information to understand and
	improve the quality of Information.comâ€™s search technology.
	For instance, this data helps us determine how often users are
	satisfied with the first result of a query and how often they
	proceed to later results. 
	</p>
</li></ul>
<p><b>Changes to this Policy</b></p>
<p>Please note this Privacy Policy will change from time to time. We expect most such
changes to be minor, but there may be changes that are more
significant. Regardless, we will post those changes on this page and,
if the changes are significant, we will also provide a more prominent
notice. We archive each version of our Policy Policy and each version will be noted at the top of the page. 
</p>
<p><b>Special Notification for California Residents</b></p>
<p>
Individual customers who reside in California and have provided their personal information to us may request information about our disclosures of certain categories of personal information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes. Such requests must be submitted to us at privacy@information.com.  Within thirty days of receiving such a request, we will provide a list of the categories of personal information disclosed to third parties for third-party direct marketing purposes during the immediately preceding calendar year, along with the names and addresses of these third parties. This request may be made no more than once per calendar year. We reserve our right not to respond to requests submitted other than to the address specified in this paragraph.
