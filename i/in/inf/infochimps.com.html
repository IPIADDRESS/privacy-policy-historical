	<h2>INFOCHIMPS.ORG <span class="caps">PRIVACY POLICY</span></h2>


	<p>This Privacy Policy is posted to inform our users such as you (“you” or “user”) of our policies and procedures regarding the collection, use and disclosure of personally identifiable information received from users of this website, located at www.infochimps.org (“Infochimps” or “Site”). We reserve the right to update this Privacy Policy at any time and for any reason without notice to you. As a best practice, we recommend that all users visit this page regularly to monitor any changes. Your use of the Site is governed by the Terms of Use available at http://help.infochimps.org/help/show/UserTOS, and your continued use of the Site constitutes your agreement to and acceptance of the privacy policy and any changes to it.</p>


	<p>By using our site, you are agreeing to our collection and processing of your information as set forth in this Privacy Policy and any future iterations. Any questions, concerns or comments you have about our use of your personally identifiable information or this policy may be directed to us at privacy@infochimps.org.</p>


	<h3>A Note About the Privacy of Children Under 13</h3>


	<p>The Site is not directed to or otherwise promoted for use by children under the age of thirteen (13). We do not knowingly collect or use any personal information of anyone under the age of thirteen (13).</p>


	<h3>The Information We Collect</h3>


	<p>Users can access limited features of this website without disclosing personal information. In order to access the entire website, users must register for an account, which will provide the registrant with full access to the website. During the account registration process, in order to provide you with the products and services that we make available on our site and give you access to the full functionality of Infochimps, we will collect some personally identifiable information, including but not limited to: <span class="caps">IP </span>Address, user name, password, email address, city, time zone, telephone number and any and all other information that you share with us.</p>


	<p>We receive and store any information you enter on the Site or give us in any other way. You should be aware that portions of the Site contain functions for collecting and tracking non-personally identifiable information about you including your IP address, domain name, pages that were viewed, where you were referred from, and technical information such as browser type and operating system. If you have volunteered personal information, then we may associate such information with information already tracked, as well as track additional personal information.</p>


	<h3>Why We Collect this Information</h3>


	<p>The information we collect from you is used to respond to your request for products and services, for provision of such products and services, to determine your satisfaction with your purchase(s) and to customize our future interactions to meet your needs. The information about your computer and/or your mobile device is used to analyze marketing statistics, identify trends and continually improve the way in which we serve you.</p>


	<h3>Contact Information, Storage and Sharing</h3>


	<p>Except as provided herein, we will not sell or give any of the information we collect on our site or through any personal correspondence to a third-party entity. We reserve the right to use that information, however, to market any additional Infochimps services and products to you. Infochimps sometimes hires other companies to provide limited services on our behalf, such as sending newsletters, providing customer service, and performing statistical analysis of our services. We will only provide those companies with the information that they need to provide us with such services, and we prohibit them from using that information for any other purpose. You will always have the right to opt out of this type of communication by following the unsubscribe instructions included in any of the marketing emails we send you. Infochimps may store and process in the United States or any other country in which Infochimps, Inc. or its affiliates, subsidiaries, or agents maintain facilities. By using the Site, you consent to any such transfer of information outside of your country.</p>


	<h3>Use of User Information</h3>


	<p>Infochimps reserves the right to compile, save, use within the scope of Infochimps’ activities, and analyze any and all user data (registration data, use history, etc.). Infochimps intends to use such user data solely for internal purposes only, including without limitation for the purposes of responding to your requests for information and for contacting you. We may use information about our users on an aggregated basis and will often share such data with unaffiliated third parties.  When we refer to an “unaffiliated” third party, we mean one that (i) is not controlled by us, (ii) does not control us, and (iii) is not controlled by the same party controlling us. For example, we may hire other companies to handle the processing of payments, to provide data storage, to host websites, to fulfill orders and shipments, to assist in marketing, to conduct audits, etc. After we or third parties acting on our behalf disclose your personal information to “unaffiliated” third parties in such instances, we can no longer control the use or further disclosure of your personal information. Consequently, we or third parties acting on our behalf will not be responsible to you for such use or further disclosure.</p>


	<h3>IP Address Use</h3>


	<p>When you log in to http://infochimps.org we will collect your browser type and IP address. We may also store some information about your browser using “cookies”. A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user’s computer tied to information about the user. We use session ID cookies to confirm that users are logged in; however, you have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. If you choose to set your computer to accept cookies from this website, you may also choose to be logged into the site automatically. If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to fully experience the interactive features of the this website or the other websites that you visit and you may experience technical problems receiving current information from such cookie-disabled websites.</p>


	<h3>Law and Law Enforcement Compliance</h3>


	<p>Infochimps will cooperate with government and law enforcement officials or private parties to enforce and comply with the law. This includes the disclosure, without notice, of any information we have collected about you to government or law enforcement officials or private parties as we, at our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate to respond to claims, legal process (including subpoenas), to protect the property and rights of Infochimps or a third party, the safety of the public or any person, to prevent or stop any illegal, unethical, or legally actionable activity, or to comply with the law.</p>


	<h3>Security</h3>


	<p>At Infochimps, we are very concerned and sensitive to the confidentiality of your personally identifiable information. We use various security measures to both protect our site and keep your information as safe as possible. Infochimps secures the e-mail address you provide on our computer servers in a controlled, secure environment, protected from unauthorized access, use or disclosure. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. Therefore, while we strive to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>


	<p>Should a breach of security occur, we will make any legally required disclosures of the breach as soon as possible, while still taking in to account any legitimate needs of law enforcement or measures necessary to restore the security and integrity of our system. Any notification of breach will occur in a private email correspondence with affected members or in a highly visible forum within the Infochimps interface itself.</p>


	<h3>Links to Other Websites; Email Referrals</h3>


	<p>From time to time, we may include links to third party websites. This does not in any way speak as an endorsement, authorization or representation of our affiliation with that third party. We strongly advise our members to be aware of and review any privacy or terms of use made available by these third party sites, as we have no control over their ability to insert cookies or their collection/solicitation of your personally identifiable information. Any links that are found to link to sites that promote illegal or pornographic activity, however, will be removed. Until we have an integrated system in place for the reporting of these links, members may email us with their concerns about any link on our site at admin@infochimps.org.</p>


	<p>If you choose to use any website referral function to tell friends about the Site, you will be required to provide your name and email address and the email addresses of your friends. The form automatically sends your friends a one-time email inviting them to visit the Site. We do not access or store this information, except to send the invitation to visit the Site.  By using the referral form you are authorizing us to contact your friends on your behalf and to list your name and email address as the referring party.</p>


	<h3>Forums &amp; Other Interactive Services</h3>


	<p>The Site may include discussion forums or other interactive areas or services, including blogs, chat rooms, bulletin boards, message boards, online hosting or storage services, or other areas or services in which you or third parties create, post or store any content, messages, comments, materials or other items on the Site (“Interactive Areas”). If you use an Interactive Area, you should be aware that these areas are open to the public and any personal information you post or provide at registration may be viewable by others. We are not responsible for personal information you submit in connection with the Interactive Areas, nor are we responsible for how others might use that information, including to send you unsolicited messages. Interactive Area postings may be retained indefinitely. If at any time you would like to remove a posting, please email us at admin@infochimps.org. Keep in mind that removal of a posting from an Interactive Area does not mean that the posting will be deleted from our systems.</p>


	<h3>Non-U.S. Users</h3>


	<p>The website is hosted in the United States. If you are accessing the website from a jurisdiction with privacy laws or regulations that differ from United States laws, please be advised that through your continued use of the website, you are transferring your personal information to the United States and you consent to that transfer.</p>


	<h3>Conditions of Use, Notices and Revisions</h3>


	<p>By visiting the Site, you accept that your visit and any dispute over privacy is subject to this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Use, including limitations on damages and application of the law of the state of Texas. If you have any concern about privacy issues, please contact us as directed in this Privacy Policy.</p>


	<p>This Privacy Policy applies only to Infochimps and not to any third-parties that may be accessed through hyper-links on this website. Infochimps reserves the right to occasionally update this Privacy Policy. At such time, Infochimps will also revise the “last updated” date at the end of the Privacy Policy. We recommend that you periodically review this Privacy Policy.</p>
