<u><b>Privacy Policy</b></u></i></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Information Crawler, Inc. ("Information 
Crawler") has created this privacy policy statement in order to demonstrate our 
firm commitment to the privacy of our visitors and customers (each a "User" or 
"you"). The following discloses our information gathering, use and dissemination 
practices for www.softwareenterprise.com (the "Site"). <br>
1. Personal and Non-Personal Information When visiting the Site, in order to 
become a member, make a purchase, register to use certain services, respond to a 
survey or update your information, you may be asked to provide certain 
personally identifiable information about yourself, such as your name, e-mail 
address, physical address, telephone number, or credit card number ("Personal 
Information"). You may review and revise any Personal Information we have about 
you. <br>
<br>
In addition, we may also collect non-personally identifiable information, such 
as IP host address, pages viewed, search queries, advertisement impressions and 
other data ("Aggregate Information"). Permanently stored Aggregate Information 
is stored separate and apart from Personal Information. <br>
<br>
2. Information Usage We use Personal Information to enable and enhance User 
services and to contact a User when necessary, such as to verify downloads, 
uploads or payment information. Information Crawler may also use this 
information to notify Users about new products or services and special 
promotions offered by Information Crawler. Information Crawler will only share 
Personal Information with third parties pursuant to a User's stated preferences, 
or as necessary to provide services utilized by you on the Site, such as credit 
card processing. <br>
<br>
We may use Aggregate Information to improve and enhance your experience on the 
Site. For example, we may use certain preferences you provide to tailor your 
experience at our Site, such as showing you content and sending you notices 
concerning products and services that may interest you. We may also share this 
Aggregate Information with other unaffiliated third parties, such as advertisers 
interested in advertising on the Site or business partners, in an aggregate, 
anonymous form, which means that the shared information will not contain nor be 
linked to any Personal Information. Information Crawler will never sell your 
Personal Information, including your credit card information, to an unaffiliated 
third party without your consent except in connection with the sale or merger 
Information Crawler or the Information Crawler division responsible for the such 
services. <br>
<br>
3. Children's Online Privacy Protection Act <br>
<br>
Information Crawler does not target its services and does not knowingly collect 
Personal Information from children under the age of 13. <br>
<br>
4. Changes to policy; Opt-Out Process <br>
<br>
We reserve the right, at our discretion, to change, modify, add, or remove 
portions from this policy at any time. If at any time in the future we plan to 
use Personal Information in a way which differs from this policy, we will post 
such changes at http://www.softwareenterprise.com/privacy.html and provide you 
the opportunity to opt-out of such differing uses. Your continued use of our 
Site following the posting of any changes to these terms means you accept these 
changes. <br>
<br>
5. Cookies "Cookies" are pieces of information that may be placed on your 
computer by a web site for the purpose of facilitating and enhancing your 
communication and interaction with that web site. Many web sites use cookies for 
these purposes. <br>
<br>
We may use cookies (a) to customize your visit to the Site and your experience, 
(b) to deliver content consistent with your stated interests and the manner in 
which you browse and/or buy on our Site, (c) to save your login information (if 
you have registered with us) so you don't have to re-enter it each time you 
visit our Site, and (d) for other purposes to make your visit more convenient or 
to enable us to enhance our service. <br>
<br>
At times, some of our third party advertisers or their ad serving and tracking 
providers may place cookies on your computer system when you select their ad 
banners. We have no control over these third party cookies. In addition, 
Information Crawler may receive some of the data collected by those third party 
cookies in order to understand how you use the Internet and what products are of 
interest to you. The information that we receive from these third parties is 
only Aggregate Information. Information Crawler is not able to control the 
cookie or other information practices of third parties if you use any 
peer-to-peer services accessible through the Site. <br>
<br>
You may stop or restrict the placement of cookies on your computer or flush them 
from your browser by adjusting your web browser preferences, in which case you 
may still use our Site, but it may interfere with some of its functionality. 
Information Crawler does not use cookies to retrieve information from your 
computer for purposes that are unrelated to the Site or your interaction with 
the Site. <br>
<br>
6. Internet Protocol (IP) Address <br>
<br>
We may use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server and to 
administer the Site. Your IP address may also be used to help identify you and 
your shopping cart for the duration of a session and to gather broad demographic 
information. Your IP address will never be linked to any of your Personal 
Information unless you are in the process of making a purchase, in which case 
the link between this information will terminate upon completion of your final 
purchase. <br>
<br>
7. Clickstream <br>
<br>
As you use the Internet, a trail of electronic information is left at each web 
site you visit. This information, which is sometimes referred to as "clickstream 
data," can be collected and stored by a web site's server. Clickstream data can 
tell us the type of computer and browsing software you use, the address of the 
web site from which you linked to the Site, and, in some instances, your e-mail 
address. We may use clickstream data as a form of Aggregate Information to 
anonymously determine how much time visitors spend on each page of our Site, how 
visitors navigate throughout the Site and how we may tailor our web pages to 
better meet the needs of visitors. This information will only be used to improve 
our Site. Any collection or use of clickstream data will be anonymous and 
aggregate, and will not contain any Personal Information. <br>
<br>
8. Consent to Processing <br>
<br>
By providing any Personal Information to this Site, you fully understand and 
unambiguously consent to the collection, usage and processing of such 
information in the United States. <br>
<br>
9. Other Sites <br>
<br>
Our Site may contain links to other sites or provide access to peer-to-peer 
services. Other sites may also reference or link to our Site. Information 
Crawler encourages Users to be aware when they leave our Site or access 
peer-to-peer services and to read the privacy statements of each and every web 
site that you visit. Information Crawler is not responsible for the privacy 
practices or the content of such other sites or peer-to-peer activities. <br>
<br>
10. Security <br>
<br>
The security of your Personal Information is very important to us. We attempt to 
provide for the secure transmission of your information from your computer to 
our servers by utilizing encryption software. However, due to the inherent open 
nature of the Internet, we cannot guarantee that communications between you and 
Information Crawler, and Information Crawler and you, will be free from 
unauthorized access by third parties such as hackers and your use of the Site 
demonstrates your assumption of this risk. Only those Information Crawler 
employees who need access to your information in order to perform their duties 
are allowed access to your Personal Information. <br>
<br>
11. Your Acceptance of this Policy <br>
<br>
By using this Site, you signify your assent to our Privacy Policy. If you do not 
agree with the terms of this policy, please do not use the Site. <br>
