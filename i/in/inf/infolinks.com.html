<h3>Use of Information:</h3>

<p>

Information such as the type of browser being used, its operating system, and your IP address is gathered in order to enhance your online experience.</p>

<h3>Specific uses of information on the Website may include:</h3>

<ul>
    <li>
        <b>Infolinks' Inquiry Form:</b> The Infolinks Website contains an "inquiry form" for web publishers to request additional information about Infolinks' products/services. The inquiry form requires web publishers to give contact information (such as name and email address.) Infolinks uses this information to contact Web Publishers about the services on the Website in which they have expressed interest.<br>
    </li>
    <li>
        Web Publishers have the option to provide demographic information (such as website address and vertical sector) to Infolinks. Infolinks encourages them to submit this information so it can provide them a more customized reply to their inquiry.</li>
    <li>
        <b>Testimonials:</b> If your name appears in a testimonial on this site, you should be aware that any personally identifiable information displayed there can be read, collected, or used by other users of this website, and could be used to send you unsolicited messages. We are not responsible for the personally identifiable information you choose to submit in these testimonials.</li>
    <li>
        <b>Web Publisher Sign-up form:</b> When a Web Publisher signs a service agreement with Infolinks, the Web Publisher is also required to provide company and personal identity information, commercial information, technical contact information and customization information to start their contextual advertising services.

This information is necessary to process the Web Publisher's agreement.</li>
    <li>
        <b>Advertising Network Service Agreement:</b> When an Advertising Network signs a service agreement with Infolinks, the Advertising Network is also required to provide company, personal identity information and commercial information.

    <li>

Advertisers must provide contact information (such as name, company name, street address, email and telephone number) and financial information. Infolinks uses this information to provide services and for billing purposes. If Infolinks has trouble processing an order, it will use this information to contact the advertiser.</li>
    <li>
        <b>Service-related Announcements:</b> Infolinks will send Web Publishers service-related announcements on rare occasions when it is necessary to do so. The only other e-mails we send out are in response to feedback, contact and sign-up form submissions.</li>
    <li>
        Generally, a Web Publisher may not opt-out of these communications, which are not promotional in nature. If a Web Publisher does not wish to receive these communications, they have the option to deactivate their account according to the terms of their Web Services Agreement.</li>
    <li>
        <b>Customer Service:</b> Based upon the provided personally identifiable information, Infolinks will send Web Publishers a welcoming email to verify their username and password and to set up their account. Infolinks will also communicate with them in response to their inquiries, to provide the services they request, and to manage their account. Infolinks will communicate with Web Publishers by email or telephone, in accordance with their wishes.</li>
</ul>
