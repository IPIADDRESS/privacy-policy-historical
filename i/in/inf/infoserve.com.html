              <br>
              Infoserve Ltd has created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate 
              our firm belief and commitment to privacy. <br>
              <br>
              The following statement details what information we obtain from 
              you, how we use it and how we fulfil our obligations to protect 
              your privacy. Please take the time to consider it carefully, as 
              by using the Infoserve Ltd services you will be agreeing that you 
              are happy for Infoserve Ltd to gather and use your information in 
              the ways stated.<br>
              <br>
              <strong>Ordering an Infoserve Ltd Website Package</strong><br>
              <br>
              When you order an Infoserve Ltd Website Package there is certain 
              information we need to obtain to enable us to process and fulfil 
              your order, or contact you in case of a query. Details we may collect 
              include:<br>
              <br>

              • company name and address;<br>
              • position;<br>
              • telephone number;<br>
              • e-mail address.<br>
              <br>
              However, other relevant information may be collected if we deem 
              it necessary. <br>
              Infoserve Ltd will never offer a third party access to this information 
              for any purpose, and will only store information necessary to operate 
              effectively in our main secure database. <br>
              <br>
              <strong>Personal Information</strong><br>
              <br>
              In terms of the personal information you submit when placing your 
              order with Infoserve Ltd, this is held with the utmost commitment 
              to your privacy. <br>
              <br>
              The information is stored on a secure webserver and in accordance 
              with the UK Data Protection Act 1998, we have added security measures 
              in place to ensure that your personal information has adequate protection. 
              This not only applies to your contact details but your credit/debit 
              card details as well.<br>
              <br>
              When payments are made to Infoserve Ltd, we regard security and 
              convenience as top priorities, this is why we use companies that 
              are experts in these fields for all payments, Barclaycard EPDQ and 
              BT Click &amp; Buy (from British Telecom).<br>
              <br>
              If you use a web based payment page to pay for your Website, the 
              credit/debit card details you submit are encapsulated using Barclaycard’s 
              EPDQ encrypted and digitally-signed protocol. This is done using 
              Secure Socket Layer (SSL), the industry standard for transmitting 
              confidential information on the web using data encryption, ensuring 
              that the information passed on to us is secure and tamper-proof. 
              However SSL has been designed to work with Netscape and Explorer 
              browsers and you will need to have at least Netscape Navigator 3 
              or Internet Explorer 3 to take advantage of this added security.<br>
              <br>
              We believe that your privacy is important and have security in place 
              to protect it. However if this security is breeched we cannot guarantee 
              the security of your information. <br>
              <br>
              <strong>Public Information</strong><br>
              <br>
              Information submitted for display on your website is information 
              for the public domain and therefore cannot be classed as private.
