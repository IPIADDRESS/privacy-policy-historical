Your privacy is very important to us. We want to make your experience
on the Internet as enjoyable and rewarding as possible, and we want you
to use the Internet's vast array of information, tools, and
opportunities with complete confidence.<br>


      <br>


We have created this Privacy Policy to demonstrate our firm commitment
to privacy and security. This Privacy Policy describes how our company
collects information from all end users of our Internet services (the
"Services") -those who access some of our Services but do not have
accounts ("Visitors") as well as those who may purchase Products and/or
pay a monthly service fee to subscribe to the Service ("Members")-what
we do with the information we collect, and the choices Visitors and
Members have concerning the collection and use of such information. We
request that you read this Privacy Policy carefully.<br>


      <br style="font-weight: bold;">

      <span style="font-weight: bold;">
Personal Information Our Company Collects and How It Is Used</span><br>


      <br>

Introduction. Our company collects information in different ways from
Visitors and Members who access the various parts of our Services and
the network of Web sites accessible through our Service. We use this
information primarily to provide a customized experience as you use our
Products and Services, and generally, do not share this information
with third parties. However, we may disclose personal information
collected if we have received your permission beforehand or in very
special circumstances, such as when we believe that such disclosure is
required by law or other special cases described below.<br>


      <br>

      <span style="font-weight: bold;">
Registration:</span> Members may be asked to provide certain personal
information when they sign up for our Products or Services including
name, address, telephone number, billing information (such as a credit
card number), and the type of personal computer being used to access
the Services. The personal information collected from Members during
the registration process is used to manage each Member's account (such
as for billing purposes). <br>

      <br>

This information is not shared with third
parties, unless specifically stated otherwise or in special
circumstances.
However, in instances where our company and a partner jointly promote
our Services, we may provide the partner certain personal information,
such as the name, address, and username of persons who subscribed to
the Services as a result of the joint promotion for the sole purpose of
allowing us
and the partner to assess the results of the promotion. In this
instance, personal information may not be used by the partner for any
other purpose. We may also generate non-identifying and aggregate
profiles from personal information Members provide during registration
(such as the total number, but not the names, of Members). As explained
in more detail below, we may use this aggregated and non-identifying<br>


information to sell advertisements that appear on the Services.<br>


      <br>

      <span style="font-weight: bold;">
Our Company Partners and Sponsors:</span> Some products and services may be
offered to Visitors and Members in conjunction with an affiliate,
independent contractor seller or non-affiliated partner. To provide
Visitors and Members some of these products and services, the partner
may need to collect and maintain personal information. In these
instances, you will be notified before any such data is collected or
transferred and may decide not to use that particular service or
feature. Additionally, our partners may have advertisements or
co-branded Web Pages that are cosponsored by an affiliate, independent
contractor seller, or non-affiliated partner. Our company may share
non-identifying and aggregate information (except as described above),
but not personal information, with such partners in order to administer
the co-branded products or services offered.<br>


      <br>

      <span style="font-weight: bold;">
Online Shopping:</span> At some Web sites, you can purchase products and
services or register to receive materials, such as a newsletter,
catalog or new product and service updates. In many cases, you may be
asked to provide contact information, such as your name, address, email
address, phone number, and credit/debit card information. If you
complete an order for someone else, such as an online gift order sent
directly to a recipient, you may be asked to provide information about
the recipient, such as the recipient's name, address, and phone number.
Our company has no control over the third parties' use of any personal
information you provide when placing such an order. Please exercise
care when doing so.<br>


      <br>


If you order services or products directly from our company we will use
the personal information you provide only to process that order. We do
not share this information with outside parties except to the extent
necessary to complete that order.<br>


      <br>

      <span style="font-weight: bold;">
Online Advertisements:</span> Our company may display our online
advertisements. In those cases we share aggregated and non-identifying
information about our Visitors and Members collected through the
registration process as well as through online surveys and promotions
with these advertisers. <br>

      <br>

Additionally, in some instances, we use this
aggregated and non-identifying information to deliver tailored
advertisements or joint ventures. For instance, an advertiser or joint
venture company tells us the audience they want to reach and provides
us an advertisement tailored to the audience. Based upon the aggregated
and non-identifying information we have collected, we may then display
or send the advertisement to the intended audience. Our company does
not share personal information about its Visitors or Members with these
advertisers or joint venture companies.<br>


      <br>

      <span style="font-weight: bold;">
Responses to Email Inquiries: </span>When Visitors or Members send email
inquiries to our company, the return email address is used to answer
the email inquiry we receive. Our company does not use the return email
address for any other purpose and does not share the return email
address with any third party.<br>


      <br>

      <span style="font-weight: bold;">
Voluntary Customer Surveys:</span> We may periodically conduct both business
and individual customer surveys. We encourage our customers to
participate in these surveys because they provide us with important
information that helps us to improve the types of products and services
we offer and how we provide them to you. Your personal information and
responses will remain strictly confidential, even if the survey is
conducted by a third party. Participation in our customer surveys is
voluntary.<br>


      <br>


We may take the information we receive from individuals responding to
our Customer Surveys and combine (or aggregate) it with the responses
of other customers we may have, to create broader, generic responses to
the survey questions (such as gender, age, residence, hobbies,
education, employment, industry sector, or other demographic
information). We then use the aggregated information to improve the
quality of our services to you, and to develop new services and
products. This aggregated, non-personally identifying information may
be shared with third parties.<br>


      <br>

      <span style="font-weight: bold;">
Special Cases:</span> It
is our company's policy not to use or share the personal information
about Visitors of Members in ways unrelated to the ones described above
without also providing you an opportunity to opt out or otherwise
prohibit such unrelated uses. <br>

      <br>

However, we may disclose personal
information about Visitors or Members, or information regarding your
use of the Services or Web sites accessible through our Services, for
any reason if, in our sole discretion, we believe that it is reasonable
to do so, including: credit agencies, collection agencies, merchant
database agencies, law enforcement, or to satisfy laws, such as the
Electronic Communications Privacy Act, the Child Online Privacy Act,
regulations, or governmental or legal requests for such information; to
disclose information that is necessary to identify, contact, or bring
legal action against someone who may be violating our Acceptable Use
Policy or Terms Of Service, or other user policies; to operate the
Services properly; or to protect our company and our Members.<br>


      <br>

      <span style="font-weight: bold;">
"Cookies" and How Our Company Uses Them. </span><br>

      <br>

A "cookie" is a small data
file that can be placed on your hard drive when you visit certain Web
sites. Our company may use cookies to collect, store, and sometimes
track information for statistical purposes to improve the products and
services we provide and to manage our telecommunications networks. If you are a
Visitor or Member we may use a cookie to save your settings and to
provide customizable and personalized services. These cookies do not
enable third parties to access any of your customer information.
Additionally, be aware that if you visit other Web sites where you are
prompted to log in or that are customizable, you may be required to
accept cookies.<br>


      <br>


Advertisers and partners may also use their own cookies. We do not
control use of these cookies and expressly disclaim responsibility for
information collected through them.<br>


      <br>

      <span style="font-weight: bold;">
Our Company Commitment to Children's Privacy. </span><br>

      <br>

Protecting children's
privacy is especially important to us. It is our policy to comply with
the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 and all other
applicable laws. Therefore we restrict our Web site to persons eighteen
years or older.<br>


      <br>


YOU MUST BE EIGHTEEN (18) YEARS OR OLDER TO ACCESS THIS WEB SITE. IF
YOU ARE UNDER EIGHTEEN YEARS OF AGE, YOU ARE NOT PERMITTED TO ACCESS
THIS WEB SITE FOR ANY REASON. DUE TO THE AGE RESTRICTIONS FOR USE OF
THIS WEB SITE, NO INFORMATION OBTAINED BY THIS WEB SITE, FALLS WITHIN
THE CHILD ONLINE PRIVACY ACT (COPA) AND IS NOT MONITORED AS DOING SO.<br>


      <br>

      <span style="font-weight: bold;">
Public Forums:</span> Please remember that any information you may disclose in
any Member Directory, or other public areas of our Web sites or the
Internet, becomes public information. You should exercise caution when
deciding to disclose personal information in these public areas.<br>


      <br>

      <span style="font-weight: bold;">
Our Company's Commitment to Data Security:</span> Services and Web sites we
sponsor have security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse,
and alteration of the information under our control. While we make
every effort to ensure the integrity and security of our network and
systems, we cannot guarantee that our security measures will prevent
third-party "hackers" from illegally obtaining this information.<br>


      <br>

      <span style="font-weight: bold;">
Where to Direct Questions About Our Privacy Policy:</span> If you have any
questions about this Privacy Policy or the practices described herein,
you may contact us through the contact information provided on this Web
site.<br>


      <br>

      <span style="font-weight: bold;">
Revisions to This Policy:</span> Our company reserves the right to revise,
amend, or modify this policy, our Terms Of Service agreement, and our
other policies and agreements at any time and in any manner, by
updating this posting.<br>
