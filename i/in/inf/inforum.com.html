Forum Communications Company&nbsp; is committed to respecting your privacy rights 
when visiting any Forum Communications Company web site, such as this one. To 
protect your personal information, Forum Communications Company has adopted the 
guidelines outlined below.<b><br>
<br>
Information Collected</b><br>
While visiting any of the Forum Communications Company web sites&nbsp; we may 
ask you to register and/or provide information that personally identifies you 
for purposes of interacting with the site. Such personal information may include, 
but is not limited to, your name, phone number, street address and e-mail address.

what information is required in order to provide you with the product or service 
or enter you in the promotion you have requested, as well as respond to your inquiry 
or comment.<br>
<br>
<b>What are Cookies?</b> A cookie is an element 
of data that a web site can send to your browser, which may then be stored on 
your system. This element of data is a piece of text, not a program. The site 
can only access the information from a cookie sent by the site. We cannot access 
other cookies sent by other web sites or the information contained therein. Additionally, 
we cannot learn your e-mail address or any other information about you through 
the use of a cookie. The only way we would learn such information is if you specifically 
and voluntarily submit that information to us, for example, through a registration 
system, by entering a sweepstakes or promotion, etc.<br>
<br>
<b>Why does the site use cookies?</b> Forum Communications Company uses cookies 
to track usage of the site and further personalize your experience when you are 
visiting the site. By tracking usage, we can best determine what features of the 
site best serve the users.<br>
<br>
<b>What benefits do I receive from cookies?</b> Overall, the use of cookies helps 
to give you a more personalized experience at the site. The information is used 
to keep our site fresh and relevant to you the user. Cookies also allow you to 
avoid retyping your e-mail address and password each time you access the site.<br>
<br>
<b>May I decline to accept a cookie?</b> You may decline to accept cookies sent 
by the site by selecting an option on your browser to reject cookies. However, 
some portions of the site may require registration in order to access those areas. 
In such cases, we ask that you register and provide us with basic information 
on our registration page, or sign in if previously registered. Cookies enable 
our server to know that you are a registered user; and will eliminate the need 
for you to log in each time you access our site. In addition, our registration 
system may require that you accept the cookies from the site in order to access 
that portion of the site. Other sites linked to the site may also send cookies; 
however we do not control such activities.<br>
<br>
<b>What happens with the information collected in a cookie?</b> The information 
stored in a cookie is used to identify you to our server, to allow us to personalize 
your experience on the site, and to serve content and communications that may 
be of interest to you.<br>

location of your computer on the Internet, for systems administration and troubleshooting 
purposes and to determine site usage.<br>
<b><br>

We believe in protecting your privacy, and will not share personal information 
with third parties outside of Forum Communications Company except as described 
in this Privacy Policy. We believe that we can enhance your experience on our 
site with the information you share with us. We use personal information about 
you to improve our advertising and marketing efforts, to statistically analyze 
site usage, to improve our content and product offerings and to personalize the 
site's content, layout, and services. We may also use your personal information, 
such as your e-mail address or mailing address, to contact you regarding products 
and/or services that may be of interest to you, to respond to an inquiry from 
you regarding the information that we have collected or respond to your comments 
and suggestions.<br>
<br>
IN-FORUM will not sell you personal information or user database to outside companies, 
however, we may facilitate delivery of special offers or promotions from local 
businesses which are relevant to our users. All e-mails generated from user registration 
will come from an @forumcomm.com or @in-forum.com address.Forum Communications 
Company may match specific and/or aggregated personal information with third party

our advertising and marketing efforts. Forum Communications Company also may disclose 
aggregated user statistics in order to describe our services to potential advertisers, 
partners, other third parties, our affiliate companies, and for other lawful purposes. As

you how we will use that information, and you can avoid having us make such disclosures 
by choosing not to use these services or features of the site.<br>
