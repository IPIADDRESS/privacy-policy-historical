<p>For a more specific description of the information we collect and use from this Web site, please see the section below entitled "Infospace Corporate Web site." </p>
<p><strong class="red large">Types of Information We Collect and Use</strong></p>
<p>In general, we collect and use both anonymous and personal user information and aggregate access and use data.  We collect this information and data from a variety of sources, including use and access to Infospace Sites and other Infospace Properties, user submissions, transactions and correspondence, employee and investor relationships and from third parties such as our business partners.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong class="red">Anonymous User Information.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;We collect anonymous (i.e. non-personally identifying) information that your browser and cell phone make available each time you visit an Infospace Site or use another Infospace Property, such as our mobile data and content services.  The browser information includes your originating Internet Protocol (IP) address, browser type and operating system, the date and time of your visit, the duration and activity of your visit and the Uniform Resource Locator (URL) of the referring and exiting Web sites.  We generally use log files to collect and store this anonymous user information.  The cell phone information we collect includes type of handset, menu selection and other anonymous use information.  Additionally, for our mobile gaming tournaments, we collect anonymous demographic data that includes age, sex, type, and number of repeat subscriptions.  We use this information for a variety of purposes, including the administration and operation of our Web sites and other properties, designing and developing new products and services and generally improving the overall quality of your experience.</li>
<li><strong class="red">Personal User Information.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the anonymous user information above, we may occasionally request from you or you may otherwise voluntarily provide us information that may identify you personally.  Infospace receives personal user information through its different properties from a broad range of activities, including surveys, contests, personalization of directory services, public records services, user groups, tell-a-friend service, mobile data transmission services and general correspondence.  Also, we may receive personal information from third party service providers as part of our search and directory and mobile products and services.  Depending on the product or service used, the personal information we collect typically includes contact information (such as name, address, email address and telephone number), demographic information (such as age, gender, occupation and household income) and billing information (shipping and billing address, credit card information).  When we request personal information from you, we will inform you of the type of information we need and the purpose of our use.  Except as specifically described in this Privacy Policy and the associated privacy policies of our various properties, we will in general only use your personal information for the purpose it was collected.</li>
<li><strong class="red">Mobile User Information.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;As part of our mobile products and services, we receive personal information from wireless carriers and operators in order to provision the specific content and data services requested by individual cell phone users.  All such personal information is acquired from either the wireless carrier's Web site or from the user's cell phone via the wireless carrier's network.  This personal data is usually limited to the user's name and cell phone number.  In certain cases, such as for gaming tournament prize fulfillment, the user's mailing address is also provided.  The user must explicitly "opt in" through the wireless carrier in order for any of this information to be collected and its use is governed by this Privacy Policy and any policies or procedures of the user's wireless carrier.  We only use personal information we receive as part of our mobile products and services for the purpose of providing those products and services to the wireless carriers and operators and their subscribers.</li>

<p><strong class="red large">Cookies</strong></p>
<p>When you visit an Infospace Site or use certain Infospace Properties, one or more cookies, web beacons or action tags may be sent to your computer or otherwise used in connection with your visit or use.  A cookie is a small data file that is sent to your computer by a Web site when you visit.  When stored on your computer, a cookie uniquely identifies your browser and records your preferences and other data about your visit.  Cookies are also sometimes used to complete transactions requested by users.  Web beacons, also known as web bugs, are small, graphic images that transparently reside on a Web site or other web-based service and are designed to allow the Web site or service owner to monitor who is visiting the Web site or using the service.  Action tags assist in delivering cookies and embed a random identifying number on a user's browser.  We use both session cookies and persistent cookies.  For a session cookie, once you close your browser the cookie simply terminates.  A persistent cookie stays stored on your hard drive for an extended period of time.  You can change the settings on your browser to refuse or notify you prior to accepting cookies and to remove them from your computer.  However, some features, products and services may not function properly without cookies.</p>
<p><strong class="red large">Infospace Corporate Web site</strong></p>
<p>As a general policy, no personal information is automatically collected from visitors to the corporate Web site, located at Infospaceinc.com.

Information tracked includes the type of browser being used by the visitor (e.g., Netscape, Internet Explorer), the type of operating system (e.g., Macintosh, Windows) in use by the visitor and the domain name of the visitor's Internet service provider (e.g., America Online, EarthLink).  By having this information, we are able to automatically optimize the Web site for a particular visitor's computer.  Other use of this information may include internal review of the number of visitors to this Web site.</p>
