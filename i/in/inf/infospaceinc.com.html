</p>
    <p>Anonymous User Information.

    Third Party Service Providers. Occasionally, we engage third parties to provide us with products and services, such as support, consulting, statistical analysis and marketing research that may require access to or use of your personal information. In such event, the third party will be obligated to maintain the privacy of any personal information disclosed or shared as part of its provision to us of the product to service and to only use such information for the limited purpose of providing the product or service.
    Business Transfers. Information about our users and the access and use of the Blucora Sites and our products and services is one of our most important business assets. As such, information about our users, including personal information, may be disclosed and transferred as part of any merger or acquisition, creation of a separate business to provide Blucora products and services, the sale or pledge of company assets, as well as in the event of an insolvency, bankruptcy or receivership in which personal information would be transferred as one of the business assets.
    Protection of Blucora; Compliance with Law. We will disclose personal information or remove, destroy or alter personal information in our possession or control when we believe it is necessary to comply with legal process, respond to claims, or to protect the rights, property or safety of our company, its employees, customers or the public.
</p>
<p>We may use, disclose and share any anonymous, non–personally identifiable information and data we collect with any third party in our sole discretion.
</p>
<p>8. Third Party Information Collection and Use; Links
</p>
<p>The Blucora Sites and our products and services use and provide access to products, services and content of third parties (collectively, "Third Party Properties"), such as third party search results, directory listings, links and advertisements. Please be aware that we do not control and are not responsible for the information collection and use practices and policies of these third parties, and that by accessing or using Third Party Properties they may collect information regarding your use and access. In general, clicking on links on the Blucora Sites or as part of our products and services on our distribution partner's Web sites, whether part of a search result, advertisement or other content, will allow the third party provider of the result, link or content to collect anonymous, non–personally identifiable information about your browser and activity. We encourage you to be aware when you use a Third Party Property or leave a Blucora Site and review any such third party's data and information collection and use practices and policies with regard to their Web site, products or services.
</p>
<p>9. Information Storage and Security
</p>
<p>We have implemented and use a variety of industry accepted physical, electronic and managerial policies and procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect to help prevent unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration or destruction and to maintain its accuracy and correct use. We generally store the information and data we collect on our own servers in a secure environment and restrict access to your personal information to employees and agents who need to know that information in order to provide you with access and use of the Blucora Sites and our products and services, operate and maintain the Blucora Sites and our distribution network and as otherwise set forth and in accordance with this Privacy Policy. While we have taken efforts to safeguard and secure your personal information, we cannot guarantee that your information may not be disclosed, altered or destroyed by accidental circumstances or by the unauthorized acts of others.
</p>
<p>10. Choice
</p>
<p>Typically you will have the choice of whether or not to provide us with personal information. However, you may not be able to access or use some features of the Blucora Sites and some of our other products and services if you chose not to provide us with the information required for those products and services. Unless the cost, burden or expense of such access is unwarranted, or the rights of a third party would be violated, we will provide you with the ability to access, correct, update and/or delete the personal information we collect and store from you. Mechanisms for accessing your personal information are either described in the specific privacy policies for the particular Blucora Site or other product or service you are using or you may contact us at the contact information provided below.
</p>
<p>11. Special Notification with respect to Children's Privacy (Users under the Age of 13)
</p>
<p>In response to concerns about protecting children’s privacy online, Congress enacted the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 (“COPPA”), which sets forth rules and procedures governing the ways in which Web sites may collect, use and disclose any personal information for children under the age of 13. In accordance with Blucora policy and COPPA regulations, we DO NOT:
</p>
   <p> Request or knowingly collect personally identifiable information online or offline contact information from users under 13 years of age; or
    Knowingly use or share personal information from users under 13 years of age with third parties; It is possible that by fraud or deception we may receive information given to us or pertaining to children under 13. If we are notified of this, as soon as we verify the information, we will immediately delete the information from our servers.
</p>
<p>Questions regarding children's privacy should be directed to us at the contact information provided below.
</p>
