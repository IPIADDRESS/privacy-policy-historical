          <div class="title">PRIVACY STATEMENT (01/2016) </div>
          <p> FEN, a division of Sandbox Networks, Inc., ("FEN") operates this website ("Website") 
		  and is committed to protecting the privacy and security of its online visitors. We are also
		  extremely sensitive to family and educator concerns about children's safety and information
		  related to them. We want you to know about and understand the measures we have taken to keep
		  the websites and online services provided by FEN a safe and secure environment for everyone.
		  This privacy statement tells you about the types of information that we collect from you, how
		  we collect that information from you and how we use that information.</p>
          <p> We encourage our visitors to read through and understand our privacy statement. We may
		  update it from time to time to address new issues or reflect changes on our Website. Please 
		  refer to this privacy statement regularly. FEN reserves the right to revise this privacy 
		  statement at any time and such revisions shall be effective immediately upon notice thereof.
		  Notice may be given by any means including, but not limited to, posting the revised privacy 
		  statement on this Website. Any use of our site by you subsequent to such notice shall be
		  deemed to constitute acceptance by you of such revision.</p>
          
          <p>If you have any questions or concerns about this privacy statement, or your dealings with FEN, please:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>a)  E-mail us at <a href="http://sandboxnetworks.custhelp.com/app/ask/ ">Customer Support;</a></li>
            <li>b)  Write to us at: FEN, 50 Congress St, Suite 1025, Boston, MA 02109; or</li>

          </ol>
          <div class="title">Information We Collect From You</div>
          <p> When you use this Website, we may collect personal information and anonymized information
		  from you. Personal information means information that would identify you, directly or 
		  indirectly, such as your name, mailing address, email address or telephone number. 
		  Anonymized information means information that does not or could not reasonably be used to 
		  identify a specific individual.</p>
          <p>When you create a user account we may request that you create a unique username and password
		  and provide us with certain personal information, such as, first name, last name, email 
		  address, gender, date of birth, and ZIP code.</p>
          <p>In connection with a purchase transaction, we will ask you for the following information: 
		  first name, last name, billing zip code or postal code, phone number, credit card number, 
		  security code, and card expiration date.</p>
          <p>This Website may contain blogs, bulletin boards or other public forums where free form 
		  entry is permitted. We highly recommend that you do not post your personal information when 
		  using these features. If you provide your personal information through any of these features, 
		  then such personal information will be posted publicly.</p>
          <p>We also collect anonymized information from your computer or device such as browser type, 
		  operating system, referring pages, pages visited, time spent on a particular page and IP 
		  address.</p>
          <div class="title">How We Collect Your Information</div>
          <p> When you use this website, we collect personal information and anonymized information through a variety of methods. </p>
          <p> We collect personal information from you when you interact with this Website by filling out a form 
		  such as registering for a user account, submitting a customer service request, conducting a purchase 
		  transaction, or participating in a public discussion forum. </p>
          <p>We collect anonymized information from you by using technologies like cookies, web beacons and server logs.</p>
          <p>This Website contains cookies from FEN and third parties. While browsing through this Website, you may get 
		  cookies from our advertisers or sponsors. FEN does not control these cookies.</p>
         
          <div class="title">How We Use Your Information</div>
          <p> FEN and its affiliates may use your personal information to tailor the content programming, services, and applications 
		  that we provide to meet your needs and interests. When you conduct a purchase transaction through this Website, you are providing 
		  purchase transaction information to FEN's third party service providers (such as transaction processors and financial institutions) 
		  who will use the information solely for the purpose of the purchase transaction.</p>
          <p>When visitors request pages from FEN sites, our servers log users' IP addresses. We typically do not link IP addresses to any
		  personal information. This means that a visitor's session will be logged, but the visitor remains anonymous to us.</p>
          <p> FEN collects IP addresses for system administration, to report aggregate information to our advertisers, sponsors, and partners, 
		  and to audit the use of our site. We will use IP addresses to identify a user in the following situations: (a) in response to subpoenas, 
		  court orders or legal process, to the extent permitted and as restricted by law; (b) when disclosure is required to maintain the security 
		  and integrity of this site, or to protect any user's security or the security of other persons, consistent with applicable laws. </p>
          <p>The anonymized information we track with cookies is not used to identify, or lead us back to, any particular visitor. Visitors to this 
		  Website may have the option of disabling cookies via their browser preferences (most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies). Cookies 
		  make our Website easier for you to use because they save your preferences while you are visiting our sites (although we do not save passwords in cookies). 
		  Cookies also help us know which areas are your favorites, which areas need improvement, and what technologies and Internet services our visitors are using. 
		  Knowing this information helps us continually improve the online experience for our visitors and members. </p>
          <p>FEN may also use third party vendors who supply applications, web hosting and other technologies for this Website that may have access to your personal 
		  information and anonymized information but they will never use such information for any other purpose except to provide services in connection with this site. </p>
          <p> FEN will not share any personal information about you with any third party (a party not affiliated with Sandbox Networks, Inc.), except as otherwise stated 
		  in this Privacy Statement and in the following circumstances: (a) in response to subpoenas, court orders or legal process, to the extent permitted and as restricted by law;
		  (b) when disclosure is required to maintain the security and integrity of this site, or to protect any user's security or the security of other persons, consistent with applicable 
		  laws; (c) when disclosure is directed or consented to by the registered member who has inputted the personal information; (d) in the event that Sandbox Networks, Inc. (the owner of FEN) 
		  or any of its subdivisions or units goes through a business transition, such as a merger, divestiture, acquisition, liquidation or sale of all or a portion of its assets, your personal 
		  information will, in most instances, be part of the assets transferred; or (e) in limited circumstances, FEN may disclose your email address in order to comply with laws and regulations, 
		  including the Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing Act (CAN-SPAM of 2003). </p>
          <div class="title">Helpful Explanations</div>
          <p>An IP address is a number that is assigned automatically to your computer whenever you use the World Wide Web. Web servers -- the big computers that "serve up" Web pages -- automatically
		  identify your computer by its IP address.</p>
		  <p>The use of "cookies" is common in the Internet industry; you will find them used on this Website, as you will at other major websites. "Cookies" are small text files written to your computer. 
		  For more information about cookies please go to:<a href="http://www.allaboutcookies.org/">http://www.allaboutcookies.org/</a>.</p>
		  
          
          <div class="title">Children's Privacy </div>
          <p> We do not knowingly contact or collect personal information from children under 13 through this Website. If you believe we have inadvertently collected such information, please contact us so
		  we can promptly remove the information. </p>

          
        
          <div class="title">About Our Advertisers:</div>
          <p> This Website allows advertising by third parties. FEN does not control the linking practices of advertisers or sponsors and does not monitor or claim responsibility for any content or privacy 
		  practices of such websites. Once you have clicked on an advertisement and have left this Website, you must read the privacy policy of the advertiser or sponsor to see how your personal information will be handled.</p>
          <p>FEN may offer contests, sweepstakes, and promotions that are sponsored by third-party advertisers or sponsors. These third parties may obtain personally identifiable information that visitors voluntarily submit to
		  participate in the activity. FEN does not control the third parties' use of information.</p>
          
          <p>FEN may use advertising servers developed by third parties to display ads on this Website. Some of these ads may contain cookies that are set by third parties (advertisers, sponsors) and may use anonymized information
		  (not including your name, address, email address, telephone number) about your visits to this and other sites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. We do not have access to these 
		  cookies or any information that they transmit. The FEN privacy statement does not cover any use of information that a third-party ad server may have collected from you. For more information on ad serving, please go to: 
		  <a href="http://www.allaboutcookies.org/ad-serving/">http://www.allaboutcookies.org/ad-serving/</a>. If you would like to know your choices about not having information used by these third parties, please go to:<a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/understanding-online-advertising/what-are-my-options.">http://www.networkadvertising.org/understanding-online-advertising/what-are-my-options. </a> </p>
          
          <div class="title">A Notice About External Links</div>
          <p>Occasionally, you will find links from FEN to independently owned, controlled, and/or managed Websites whose content we believe will be of possible interest and value to our visitors. Additionally, you'll see links from advertisers, sponsors, and other partners who may use a FEN owned logo as part of a co-branding agreement. </p>
          <p>In many cases, these links represent cooperative projects or mutual links established with the organizations connected with these sites. We do not control the content of these links. These other sites may send you their own cookies, collect data, or solicit personal information. While we identify sponsor and advertiser areas of our Websites, we do not control these cookies or the content of these third parties. </p>
          <p>FEN has partnered with other companies to provide certain services. In some cases, you may see a FEN owned logo on another company's site. FEN does not share any of your personally identifiable information with these partners and they do not share any information with us. </p>
          <p>Once you leave our servers (you can generally tell where you are by checking the URL in the location bar on your browser), the use of any information collected from you is governed by the privacy policy of the operator of the site you are visiting. That policy may differ from ours. If you cannot find the privacy policy of any of these sites via a link from that site's Home page, you should contact the site directly for more information. </p>
          <p>We specifically recommend that children check with their parents, guardians, or teachers before connecting to any new sites.</p>
		  
		  <div class="title">Security, Purchases and Credit Card Use: </div>
          <p> FEN has security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse, and alteration of the information under our control. Essentially, we encrypt all transmission of sensitive data and secure all of our repositories of data. When you use your credit card to make a purchase transaction with FEN, your transaction is secure. Our servers use encryption technology to safeguard your personal information and privacy. However, you should understand that "perfect security" cannot be guaranteed.</p>
          
          <div class="title">Analytics Tools We Use</div>
          <p>We are committed to ensuring that the Website is valuable and useful to our users. To assist us in this, we have implemented the Google, Inc.'s Google Analytics demographics and interest reporting features on the Website. These tools allow us to review anonymous data regarding the gender, age and interests of Website visitors and collect and analyze certain types of information, including cookies, IP addresses, device and software identifiers, referring and exit URLs, feature use metrics and statistics, usage and purchase history, MAC Address, mobile unique device ID, and other similar information, all to adapt the Website to better reflect our users' needs. Although this information is collected through your Google ad settings, it is not provided to us in a personally-identifiable format. This means we cannot identify what information is about you, and we will not try to figure it out. We use Google's <a href="https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/4574780" target="_blank">session unification</a>.</p>
			<p>The Google Analytics demographics and interest reporting features may collect information on the Website and other online or mobile products and/or services and may combine the information collected with other information Google has independently collected from other websites and/or other online or mobile products and services relating to your activities across their network of websites as well as online and/or mobile products and services. Google collects and uses information under its own privacy policies. Google utilizes the data collected to track and examine the use of this Website, to prepare reports on its activities and share them with other Google services. Google may use the data collected to contextualize and personalize the ads of its own advertising network.</p>
			<p>The Google Analytics demographics and interest reporting features tool uses "cookies" which are text files placed on your computer, to collect standard internet log information and visitor behavior information in an anonymous form. The information generated by the cookie about your use of the Website (including IP address) is transmitted to Google. This information is then used to evaluate visitors' use of the Website and to compile statistical reports on Website activity.</p>
			<p>You may opt out of Google Advertising by visiting the <a href="http://www.google.com/policies/technologies/ads">Google advertising opt-out page</a> or you may opt out of Google Analytics by visiting the <a href="http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout">Google Analytics opt-out page.</a></p>
			<p>Google has additional information available about their <a href="">Remarketing Privacy Guidelines,</a> and Restrictions.</p>
			<p>You may view a list of other third party service providers who collect information, and/or opt-out of such collection of information about you, by visiting <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/ ">http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/ </a>or <a href="http://www.aboutads.info/choices/">http://www.aboutads.info/choices/</a>.</p>
