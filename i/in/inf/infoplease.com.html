              the Internet in an environment that is safe. In compliance with 
              COPPA (Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act), we have adopted 
              the following policies to keep kids safe: </span> 
            </p><ol>
              <ol>
                <li><span class="black">We will NOT knowingly collect, use or 
                  distribute personally identifiable information 	from children 
                  under the age of 13 without prior verifiable consent from 	 
                  a parent or guardian. </span></li>
                <li><span class="black">We will NOT knowingly collect, use or 
                  distribute personally identifiable information from teens between 
                  the ages of 13 and 17 without first notifying a parent or guardian.</span></li>
                <li><span class="black">Personally identifiable information we 
                  collect from children under the age of 13 will be used solely 
                  by Learning Network or its agents for internal purposes only 
                  and will not be sold or otherwise distributed to third parties. 
                  </span></li>
                <li><span class="black">We will NOT knowingly allow a child under 
                  the age of 13 access to chat rooms, message boards, e-mail accounts, 
                  or other services within Learning Network that would allow them 
                  to publicly post or otherwise distribute personally identifiable 
                  information without prior verifiable consent from a parent or 
                  guardian. </span></li>
                <li><span class="black">We will NOT knowingly allow a teen between 
                  the ages of 13 and 17 access to chat rooms, message boards, 
                  e-mail accounts, or other services within Learning Network that 
                  would allow them to publicly post or otherwise distribute personally 
                  identifiable information without first notifying a parent or 
                  guardian. </span></li>
                <li><span class="black">We will NOT knowingly ask a child or teen 
                  to divulge more information than is needed to participate in 
                  any activity, game, or service. </span></li>
                <li><span class="black">We will NOT knowingly provide any direct 
                  link to Websites that are unsuitable for children or teens. 
                  </span></li>
                <li><span class="black">Learning Network will not advertise on 
                  any site that does not comply with the regulations set forth 
                  under COPPA. </span></li>
                <li><span class="black">We will advise children under the age 
                  of 13 that they MUST obtain permission from their parent or 
                  guardian before sharing ANY personal information. </span></li>
                <li><span class="black">Upon request, Learning Network will provide 
                  a parent or guardian with a description of the information that 
                  may have been provided about their child or teen during a registration 
                  process for a program or service of this site. Learning Network 
                  only asks for a child's or teen's personal information if it 
                  is necessary to participate in the program or service. For example, 
                  use of the Learning Pod requires a parent or teacher to set 
                  up an account for their child or student by providing the child's 
                  first name, last initial, grade level and school zip code. This 
                  information is used to track the child's progress through the 
                  activities and exercises in Learning Pod and is only accessible 
                  to the person who set up the account via a secure password. 
                  The site administrator also has access to the registration data 
                  but it is only used for site maintenance. Registration data 
                  that is provided about children or teens is not used for marketing 
                  and is never shared with any other party. If you would like 
                  to view your child's registration data, request a change, or 
                  request that we delete any of your child's personal information, 
                  please send an e-mail to <a href="mailto:kidsprivacy@learningnetwork.com" class="LNlink">kidsprivacy@learningnetwork.com</a> 
                  which includes your child's first and last name, school zip 
                  code, and your first and last name. </span></li>
              </ol>
            </ol>
            <p><span class="black">Learning Network encourages parents and guardians 
              to spend time online with their children. We urge parents to instruct 
              their children to never give out their real names, addresses or 
              phone numbers, without permission, when using the Internet. We recognize 
              a special obligation to protect personal information obtained from 
              children. <br>
              <br>
              If you have any questions about our Kids' Privacy Policy please

              <a name="Notification" class="blacktitle">Notification and Verifiable 
              Parental Consent:</a> <br>
              <br>
              <span class="black">Certain areas and activities within Learning 
              Network ask visitors under the age of 18 to provide personal information 
              such as their name, date of birth, e-mail address or school name. 
              We only ask for the information that is necessary to participate 
              in the particular activity. <br>
              <br>
              Before any personally identifiable information is collected, we 
              will do our best to notify the parent or guardian that their child 
              or teen is participating. Notification will include the exact nature 
              and intended use of the information we are collecting, as well as 
              the opportunity for the parent or guardian to prevent the use of 
              the information and the child’s participation in the activity. If 
              the child is under 13 years of age we require the parent or guardian 
              to provide verifiable parental consent such as an e-mail, mail-in 
              letter, fax or toll free phone call to Learning Network. If the 
              individual is a teen between the ages of 13 and 17, Learning Network 
              will notify the parent or guardian that their teen is participating 
              and sharing personal information but we do not require consent. 
              </span> </p>
            <p><span class="black">When verifiable parental consent has not yet 
              been obtained, we will use online contact information (such as an 
              e-mail address) only as is appropriate to: </span> 
            </p><ul>
              <li><span class="black">request the name or online contact information 
                of a parent or guardian for the purpose of obtaining verifiable 
                parental consent or providing notification to the parent or guardian;</span></li>
              <li><span class="black">respond directly to the child’s or teen’s 
                request on a one-time basis (for example, to provide assistance 
                with a particular study question), not using that information 
                to re-contact the child or teen for any other purpose;</span></li>
              <li><span class="black">respond more than once directly to a specific 
                request from the child (for example, to satisfy the request for 
                a newsletter subscription), not using that information to re-contact 
                the child or teen for any other purpose.</span></li>

              are Cookies?</a> 
            </p><p> <span class="black">The use of cookies is common in the Internet 
              industry; you'll find them used on Learning Network, as you will 
              at other major sites. "Cookies" are small text files written to 
              your computer. They make our Website easier for you to use because 
              they save your preferences while you are at our sites (although 
              we do not save passwords in cookies). Cookies also help us know 
              which areas are your favorites, which need a bit of improvement, 
              and what technologies and Internet services our visitors are using. 
              Knowing this information helps us continually improve the online 
              experience for our visitors and members. </span> 
            </p><p><span class="black">The non-personally identifiable information 
              we track with cookies is anonymous and is not used to identify, 
              or lead us back to, any particular visitor. Visitors to Learning 
              Network may have the option of disabling cookies via their browser

            </p><p><span class="black">While browsing through Learning Network, you 
              may get cookies from our advertisers or sponsors. Learning Network

            </p><p><a name="Whatip" class="blacktitle">What are IP Addresses?</a><br>
              <br>
              <span class="black">An IP address is a number automatically assigned 
              to your computer whenever you use the World Wide Web. Web servers--the 
              big computers that "serve up" Web pages--automatically identify 
              your computer by its IP address. </span> 
            </p><p><span class="black">Learning Network collects IP addresses for 
              system administration; to report aggregate information to our advertisers, 
              sponsors, and partners; and to audit the use of our site. When visitors 
              request pages from Learning Network sites, our servers log the guests' 
              IP addresses. We normally do not link IP addresses to anything personally 
              identifiable. This means that a visitor's session will be logged, 
              but the visitor remains anonymous to us. We can and will use IP 
              addresses to identify a visitor when we feel it is necessary to 
              enforce compliance with our rules or terms of service, or to protect 
              our service, site, customers, or other individuals. </span> 
            </p><p><span class="black">Some features within Learning Network, such 
              as certain message boards, may display IP addresses along with the 
              message-poster's visitor name and message. You should review each 
              feature prior to use and only use those that disclose information 
              you are comfortable sharing. </span>

              not share any of your personally identifiable information with these 
              partners and they do not share any information back with us. Once 
              you leave our servers (you can generally tell where you are by checking 
              the URL in the location bar on your browser), the use of any information 
              you provide is governed by the privacy policy of the operator of 
              the site you are visiting. That policy may differ from ours. If 
              you can't find the privacy policy of any of these sites via a link
