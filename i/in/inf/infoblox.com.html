            Infoblox knows that you care about how your personal information is
            used and shared, and we take your privacy seriously. Please read the
            following to learn more about our privacy policy. By visiting
            Infoblox's web site, submitting information or using any of our
            services, you acknowledge that you accept the practices and policies
            outlined in this Privacy Policy.<br>
            <br>
            <b>WHAT DOES THIS PRIVACY POLICY COVER?</b><br>
            This Privacy Policy covers Infoblox's treatment of personally
            identifiable information ("Personal Information") that
            Infoblox gathers when you are accessing Infoblox's web site and when
            you use Infoblox services. The types of Personal Information
            collected include your full name, address, e-mail address, telephone
            number, and credit card information. Also, this Policy covers
            Infoblox's treatment of any Personal Information that Infoblox's
            business partners share with Infoblox. This policy does not apply to
            the practices of Infoblox's that Infoblox does not own or control,
            or to individuals that Infoblox does not employ or manage.<br>
            <br>
            <br><b>WHAT PERSONAL INFORMATION DOES INFOBLOX COLLECT?</b><br>
            The information we gather from customers enables us to personalize
            and improve our services. We collect the following types of
            information from our customers.<br>
            <br>
            <b>Personal Information You Provide to Us:</b><br>
            We may receive and store any information you enter on our web site
            or provide to us in any other way. You can choose not to provide us
            with certain information, but then you may not be able to take
            advantage of many of our special features. The Personal Information
            you provide may be used for such purposes as responding to your
            requests for certain products and services, customizing the
            advertising and content you see, and communicating with you about
            specials, sales offers, and new products.<br>
            <br>
            <b>Personal Information Collected Automatically:</b>
            <ul>
              <li>We may receive and store certain types of information whenever
                you interact with our web site or services. Infoblox may choose
                to automatically receive and record information on our server
                logs from your browser including your IP address, Infoblox
                cookie information, and the page you requested.</li>
              <li>Generally, our service may automatically collect usage
                information, such as the numbers and frequency of visitors to
                our site and its components, similar to TV ratings that indicate
                how many people watched a particular show. Infoblox only uses
                this data in aggregate form, that is, as a statistical measure,
                and not in a manner that would identify you personally. This
                type of aggregate data enables us to figure out how often
                customers use parts of the web site or services so that we can
                make the web site appealing to as many customers as possible,
                and improve those services. As part of this use of information,
                we may provide aggregate information to our partners about how
                our customers, collectively, use our site. We share this type of
                statistical data so that our partners also understand how often
                people use their services and our web site, so that they, too,
                may provide you with an optimal online experience.</li>
              <li>Our product automatically gathers certain information related
                to the usage and effectiveness of our online self-service
                support. We only use such data in the aggregate, and not in a
                form that would identify you personally. This aggregate data
                helps us determine how effective support service is, so we can
                improve our self-service tools and make them as effective as
                possible.</li>
            </ul>
            <br><b>E-mail Communications:</b><br>
            We may receive a confirmation when you open an e-mail from Infoblox
            if your computer supports this type of program. Infoblox may use
            this confirmation to help us make e-mails more interesting and
            helpful. We may also compare our customer list to lists received
            from other companies, in an effort to avoid sending unnecessary
            messages to our customers. If you do not want to receive e-mail or
            other mail from us, please notify us by e-mail at mailing@infoblox.com
            and include sufficient information for us to identify your account.<br>
            <br>
            <b>
            What About Cookies?</b>
            <ul>
              <li>Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we may transfer to
                your computer's hard drive through your browser to enable our
                systems to recognize your browser and tell us how and when pages
                in our site are visited and by how many people. Infoblox cookies
                do not collect Personal Information, and we do not combine the
                general information collected through cookies with other
                Personal Information to tell us who you are or what your screen
                name or e-mail address is.</li>
              <li>Most browsers have an option for turning off the cookie
                feature, which will prevent your browser from accepting new
                cookies, as well as (depending on the sophistication of your
                browser software) allowing you to decide on acceptance of each
                new cookie in a variety of ways.</li>
            </ul>
            <br><b>WILL INFOBLOX SHARE ANY OF THE PERSONAL INFORMATION IT RECEIVES?</b><br>
            Personal Information about our customers is an important part of our
            business. We neither rent nor sell your Personal Information to
            anyone. We share your Personal Information only with your consent or
            to business partners and affiliates as described below.<br>
            <br>
            <i>
            Agents:</i> We may employ other companies and people to perform tasks on
            our behalf and need to share your information with them to provide
            products or services to you. Unless we tell you differently,
            Infoblox's agents do not have any right to use Personal Information
            we share with them beyond what is necessary to assist us. You hereby
            consent to our sharing of Personal Information for the above
            purposes.<br>
            <br>
            <i>
            Business Transfers:</i> In some cases, we may choose to buy or sell
            assets. In these types of transactions, customer information is
            typically one of the business assets that is transferred. Moreover,
            if Infoblox, or substantially all of its assets were acquired,
            customer information would be one of the assets that is transferred
            or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers
            may occur, and that any acquirer of Infoblox may continue to use
            your Personal Information as set forth in this policy.<br>
            <br>
            <i>
            Protection of Infoblox and Others:</i> We may release Personal
            Information when we believe in good faith that release is necessary
            to comply with any law; enforce or apply our conditions of use and
            other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of
            Infoblox, our employees, our customers, or others. This includes
            exchanging information with other companies and organizations for
            fraud protection and credit risk reduction.<br>
            <br>
            <i>
            With Your Consent</i>: Except as set forth above, you will be notified
            when your Personal Information may be shared with third parties, and
            will be able to prevent the sharing of this information.<br>
            <p><b>IS PERSONAL INFORMATION ABOUT ME SECURE?</b><br>
            Your Infoblox account Personal Information is protected by a
            password for your privacy and security. You need to ensure against
            unauthorized access to your account and Personal Information by
            selecting and protecting your password appropriately and limiting
            access to your computer and browser by signing off after you have
            finished accessing your account.<br>
            Infoblox stores your credit card and other financial information in
            a secure location.<br>
            </p>
			<b>WHAT PERSONAL INFORMATION CAN I ACCESS?</b><br>
            Infoblox may allow you to access certain information about you for
            the purpose of viewing, and in certain situations, updating that
            information. The types of information that you can access update
            will change as our web site changes.<br>
            <br>
              <b>WHAT CHOICES DO I HAVE?</b> <p></p>
            <ul>
              <li>As stated previously, you can always opt not to disclose
                information to Infoblox, even though it may be needed to receive
                services or take advantage of certain Infoblox web site
                features.</li>
              <li>You may be able to add or update certain information on pages,
                such as those that may be listed in the "What Personal
                Information Can I Access" section above. When you update
                information, however, we may maintain a copy of the unrevised

                please notify us by e-mail at mailing@infoblox.com, and provide
                sufficient information for us to identify your account. Please

                responsible for reviewing such legal notices for changes.</li>
              <li>As explained earlier, the majority of browsers allow you to
                monitor and restrict our use of cookies. Please note, however,
                that if your browser does not accept cookies, you may not be
                able to take advantage of some of our services or web site
                features.</li>
