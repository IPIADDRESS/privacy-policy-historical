            Infoblox knows that you care about how your personal information is used and shared, and we take your privacy seriously. Please read the following to learn more about our privacy policy. By visiting Infoblox's web site, submitting information or using any of our services, you acknowledge that you accept the practices and policies outlined in this Privacy Policy.  If you represent an entity, then “you” also refers to such entity.<br>
            <br>
            <b>WHAT DOES THIS PRIVACY POLICY COVER?</b><br>
            This Privacy Policy covers Infoblox's treatment of personally identifiable information ("Personal Information") that Infoblox gathers when you are accessing Infoblox's web site, or in connection with Infoblox sponsored events or Infoblox services. The types of Personal Information that may be collected include your full name, address, e-mail address, telephone number, and credit card information. Also, this Policy covers Infoblox's treatment of any Personal Information that Infoblox's business partners share with Infoblox. This policy does not apply to the practices of Infoblox's business affiliates, to processes that Infoblox does not own or control, or to entities that Infoblox does not employ or manage.<br>
            <br><b>WHAT PERSONAL INFORMATION DOES INFOBLOX COLLECT?</b><br>
            The information we gather from customers enables us to personalize and improve our services. We collect the following types of information from our customers.<br>
            <br>
            <b>Personal Information You Provide to Us:</b><br>
            We may receive and store any information you enter on our web site or provide to us in any other way. You can choose not to provide us with certain information, but then you may not be able to take advantage of features or opportunities. The Personal Information you provide may be used for such purposes as responding to your requests for certain products and services, customizing the advertising and content you see, and communicating with you about specials, sales offers, new products and Infoblox events.<br>
            <br>
            <b>Personal Information Collected Automatically:</b>
            <ul>
              <li>We may receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact with our web site or services. Infoblox may choose to automatically receive and record information on our server logs from your browser including your IP address, Infoblox cookie information, and the page you requested. </li>
              <li>Generally, our service may automatically collect usage information, such as the numbers and frequency of visitors to our site and its components. Infoblox only uses this data in aggregate form, that is, as a statistical measure, and not in a manner that would identify you personally. This type of aggregate data enables us to figure out how often customers use parts of the web site or services so that we can improve the website and services. As part of this use of information, we may also provide aggregate information to our partners about how our customers generally use our site. We share this type of statistical data so that our partners also understand how often people use their services and our web site, so that they, too, may provide you with an optimal online experience. </li>
              <li>Our product automatically gathers certain information related to the usage and effectiveness of our online self-service support. We only use such data in the aggregate, and not in a form that would identify you personally. This aggregate data helps us determine how effective support service is, so we can improve our self-service tools and make them as effective as possible. </li>
            </ul>
            <br><b>E-mail Communications:</b><br>
            We may receive a confirmation when you open an e-mail from Infoblox if your computer supports this type of program. Infoblox may use this confirmation to help us make e-mails more interesting and helpful. We may also compare our customer list to lists received from other companies, in an effort to avoid sending duplicate or unnecessary messages to our customers. If you do not want to receive e-mail or other mail from us, please notify us by e-mail at <a href="mailto:mailing@infoblox.com">mailing@infoblox.com</a> and include sufficient information for us to identify your account.<br>
            <br>
            <b>
            What About Cookies?</b>
            <ul>
              <li>Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we may transfer to your computer through your browser to enable our systems to recognize your browser and tell us how and when pages in our site are visited and by how many people. Infoblox cookies do not collect Personal Information, and we do not combine the general information collected through cookies with other Personal Information to tell us who you are or what your screen name or e-mail address is. </li>
              <li>Most browsers have an option for turning off the cookie feature, which will prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, as well as (depending on the sophistication of your browser software) allowing you to decide on acceptance of each new cookie in a variety of ways. </li>
            </ul>
            <br><b>WILL INFOBLOX SHARE ANY OF THE PERSONAL INFORMATION IT RECEIVES?</b><br>
            Personal Information about our customers is an important part of our business. We neither rent nor sell your Personal Information to anyone. We share your Personal Information only with your consent or to business affiliates as described below.<br>
            <br>
            <i>
            Agents:</i> We may use other companies and people to perform tasks on our behalf and need to share your information with them to provide products or services to you.  Infoblox may also use a third party to process credit cards for billing purposes.  Unless we tell you otherwise at the time we ask you to provide specific information, Infoblox's agents do not have any right to use Personal Information we share with them beyond what is necessary to assist us. You hereby consent to our sharing of Personal Information for the above purposes.<br>
            <br>
            <i>
            Business Transfers:</i> In some cases, we may choose to buy or sell business assets. In these types of transactions, customer information is typically transferred with related assets. Moreover, if Infoblox, or substantially all of its assets were acquired, customer information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of Infoblox may continue to use your Personal Information as set forth in this policy.<br>
            <br>
            <i>
            Protection of Infoblox and Others:</i> We may release Personal Information when we believe in good faith that release is necessary to comply with any law; enforce or apply our conditions of use and other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of Infoblox, our employees, our customers, or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction.<br>
            <br>
            <i>Sponsored Events:</i> Infoblox may sponsor webcast, conference or other events in conjunction with one or more business affiliates.  When you register for or otherwise provide information in connection with such an event, Infoblox may share the information you provide with the other entities named as event sponsors.  In such event, the use of information you provide by such other entity will be subject to the other entity’s privacy policy, which may be less restrictive than Infoblox’s privacy policy.<br>
            <br>
            <i>
            With Your Consent:</i> Except as set forth above, you will be notified when your Personal Information may be shared with third parties, and will be able to opt out or otherwise given an opportunity to prevent the sharing of this information.<br>
            <p><b>IS PERSONAL INFORMATION ABOUT ME SECURE?</b><br>
            Your Infoblox account Personal Information is protected by a password for your privacy and security. You need to ensure against unauthorized access to your account and Personal Information by selecting and protecting your password appropriately and limiting access to your computer and browser by signing off after you have finished accessing your account.<br><br>
            Infoblox stores your credit card and other financial information in
            a secure location.<br>
            </p>
			<b>WHAT PERSONAL INFORMATION CAN I ACCESS?</b><br>

              <b>WHAT CHOICES DO I HAVE?</b> <p></p>
            <ul>
              <li>You can always opt not to disclose information to Infoblox, even though it may be needed to receive services or take advantage of certain Infoblox web site features. </li>
              <li>You may be able to add or update certain information on pages, such as those that may be listed in the "What Personal Information Can I Access" section above.
