	    <h1> infosnap Privacy Policy </h1>
	    <p>Please read this document and make sure you understand it. It explains the information gathered by infosnap, how the information is used, and with whom the information is shared. By continuing to use infosnap you will be deemed to have accepted the infosnap Privacy Policy. <br>
          <br>
Maintaining the privacy of your family’s personal information is at the core of our business. We are committed to taking appropriate measures to maintain the privacy of information you submit to infosnap. <br>
<br>
The essence of our privacy policy is this: First, the information you submit to infosnap is your information. infosnap does not own that information--you do. Second, infosnap stores your information in the infosnap database for you, and will distribute it only as you direct. We will not in any manner transmit the information that you trust to us to any third parties without your authorization, unless we have to disclose it to comply with legal requirements or in exigent circumstances to protect the personal safety of an infosnap subscriber. That means we will not sell or rent your information to anyone, or let anyone use it except if you have authorized its use. Since you own and control your information, you can change it at any time. We will notify third parties of changes to your data only if you have previously authorized them to receive this information. </p>
	    <p> We are especially sensitive to the need to protect information concerning children. We do not knowingly solicit information from children under the age 13, and we do not contemplate the transmission of data by children from infosnap’s database. Protecting the identity and privacy of children is an important undertaking for which both parents and infosnap share responsibility. <br>
            <br>
  We do have access to the information you store in the infosnap database, and do use this information to create and manage an infosnap account for you. We also have access to information concerning your use of our website, including to whom and when you transmit information. We need this information to provide you with the services infosnap offers. This includes the ability of the organizations to which you send information to communicate with you via email. We also collect and have access to aggregate data regarding the use of our site by all visitors--we collect information about the general use of our site so we can improve our services to you and build our business. Aggregate information, which is not in any way personally identifiable to an individual or family, may be disclosed to third parties for infosnap’s business purposes. In the future we may also use the information to which we have access to provide you with or solicit other information and to let you know of additional products and services that may be of interest to you. In this event, you will be provided with the opportunity to opt out of these communications.</p>
	    <p> Only those infosnap employees and consultants who need it to perform their job responsibilities are authorized to have access to your information stored in the infosnap database. Please note that this privacy policy applies only to infosnap and its employees and consultants, and does not automatically apply to other sites to which we link. It is infosnap’s corporate policy to require that the organizations to which we transmit your personal information agree to comply with our privacy policy. However, we cannot guarantee or be responsible for the performance of third parties.</p>
	    <p> Maintaining your privacy is a major focus of infosnap. As new technologies and methods become available for increasing your privacy protection, we will carefully examine them for applicability to our business. Finally, we employ multiple levels of security to protect your information from unauthorized third parties. <br>
            <br>
  In the event we make changes to this privacy policy, they will be posted here before they go into effect. <br>
