			<p align="left"><span style="font-weight: 400">We know that you care 
			how your information is used, and we appreciate your trust that we 
			will use it carefully and sensibly. This notice describes our 
			privacy policy. By visiting us, you are accepting the privacy policy 
			described below. <br>
			<br>
			1.&nbsp; What Personal Information Do We Collect?</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li>
				<p align="left"><span style="font-weight: 400">Information You 
				Provide. &nbsp;We receive and store information you enter.&nbsp; For 
				example, when you search for or buy a product or service, or 
				when you supply information such as your address, phone number 
				or credit card. You can choose not to provide certain 
				information, but then you might not be able to take advantage of 
				some of our features.&nbsp; We use the information that you provide 
				for such purposes as responding to your requests, customizing 
				future shopping for you, improving our website, and 
				communicating with you.&nbsp;We do not store your credit&nbsp;data in our 
				system after the sale - it is used for checkout purposes 
				only.&nbsp;In addition, if you choose, we may share your information 
				with other companies who provide goods or services that you are 
				interested in.&nbsp; Please see the “opt-in/opt-out” selection in 
				Section 4 of this policy.</span></p></li>
				<li>
				<p align="left"><span style="font-weight: 400">Cookies. Like 
				many websites, we use "cookies".&nbsp; Cookies are small programs 
				that we transfer to your hard drive that allow us to recognize 
				you and to provide you with a customized shopping experience.&nbsp; 
				If you do not want us to use cookies, you can easily disable 
				them by going to the toolbar of your web browser, and clicking 
				on the “help” button.&nbsp; Follow the instructions that will prevent 
				the browser from accepting cookies, or set the browser to inform 
				you when you receive a new cookie.&nbsp; In addition, you may visit 
				this and other websites anonymously through the use of utilities 
				provided by other private companies.</span></p></li>
				<li>
				<p align="left"><span style="font-weight: 400">Other 
				Information: Every computer has an IP (Internet Protocol) 
				address.&nbsp; IP addresses of computers used to visit this site are 
				noted.&nbsp; In addition, we automatically collect other information 
				such as email addresses, browser types, operating systems, and 
				the URL addresses of sites clicked to and from this site.</span></p></li>
				<li>
				<p align="left"><span style="font-weight: 400">Information from 
				Other Sources.&nbsp; We might receive information about you from 
				other sources and add it to our account information.&nbsp; This may 
				include updated delivery and address information from our 
				shippers or other sources so that we can correct our records and 
				deliver your next purchase or communication more easily.&nbsp;</span></p></li>
			</ul>
			<p align="left"><span style="font-weight: 400">2.&nbsp; How Do We Use 
			Your Information?</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li>
				<p align="left"><span style="font-weight: 400">Customized 
				Shopping.&nbsp; We use your information to better serve you by 
				providing a customized shopping experience.&nbsp; As noted above, you 
				may “opt-out” of this customization, or even visit and shop 
				anonymously.</span></p></li>
				<li>
				<p align="left"><span style="font-weight: 400">Agents. We employ 
				other companies and individuals to perform functions on our 
				behalf. Examples include delivering packages, sending postal 
				mail and e-mail, and processing credit card payments. They have 
				access to personal information needed to perform their 
				functions, but may not use it for other purposes.</span></p></li>
				<li>
				<p align="left"><span style="font-weight: 400">Special Offers.&nbsp; 
				We may send you special offers from time to time, unless you 
				choose to “opt-out” of receiving such offers.&nbsp; In addition, we 
				may also send you special offers from other companies.&nbsp; Again, 
				you may “opt-out”.&nbsp; If we send you offers from other businesses, 
				we do not share your personal information with them.&nbsp; The offers 
				come directly through us.&nbsp; Please see the “opt-in/opt-out” 
				selection at the end of this policy.&nbsp;</span></p></li>
				<li>
				<p align="left"><span style="font-weight: 400">Business 
				Transfers. As we continue to develop our business, we might sell 
				or buy stores or assets. In such transactions, customer 
				information generally is one of the transferred business assets. 
				Also, in the unlikely event that we are acquired, customer 
				information will be one of the transferred assets.</span></p></li>
				<li>
				<p align="left"><span style="font-weight: 400">Law 
				Enforcement.&nbsp;&nbsp; If we receive a lawful court order to release 
				account or other personal information then we will comply with 
				the law.&nbsp; We will also release information when necessary to 
				protect the life, safety or property of others. This includes 
				exchanging information with other companies and organizations 
				for fraud protection and credit risk reduction.</span></p></li>
			</ul>
			<p align="left"><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;&nbsp;3.&nbsp; How Do We 
			Protect the Security of Your Information?</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li>
				<p align="left"><span style="font-weight: 400">We work to 
				protect the security of your information during transmission by 
				using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software, which encrypts 
				information you input.</span></p></li>
				<li>
				<p align="left"><span style="font-weight: 400">We use encryption 
				to protect your information contained in our customer list.</span></p></li>
				<li>
				<p align="left"><span style="font-weight: 400">We use a firewall 
				to protect against unlawful intrusion.</span></p></li>
				<li>
				<p align="left"><span style="font-weight: 400">We limit access 
				to your information on a “need to know” basis.</span></p></li>
				<li>
				<p align="left"><span style="font-weight: 400">We reveal only 
				the last five digits of your credit card numbers when confirming 
				an order. Of course, we transmit the entire credit card number 
				to the appropriate credit card company during order processing.</span></p></li>
				<li>
				<p align="left"><span style="font-weight: 400">It is important 
				for you to protect against unauthorized access to your password 
				and to your computer. Be sure to sign off when finished using a 
				shared computer.</span></p></li>
				<li>
				<p align="left"><span style="font-weight: 400">No system can 
				guarantee absolute security, just as the finest lock can not 
				guarantee physical security. &nbsp;However, we take every reasonable 
				precaution to assure that your data is secure.</span></p></li>
			</ul>
			<p align="left"><span style="font-weight: 400">4.&nbsp; Your Choice:&nbsp; 
			Opt-in or Opt-out.It is your choice whether to receive emails or 
			special offers from us or others.&nbsp; The following section provides 
			you with this choice.&nbsp; Please note the default settings.</span></p>
