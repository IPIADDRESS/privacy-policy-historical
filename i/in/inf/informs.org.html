We will not use or share your information with anyone except as described in this privacy policy.</p><p>The terms used in this privacy policy have the same meanings as in our terms and conditions, which is accessible at informs.org, unless otherwise defined in this privacy policy. The term “us” or “we” refers to INFORMS, the owner of the website and provider of the services, whose registered office is 5521 Research Park Drive, Suite 200, Catonsville, Maryland 21228. The term “you” refers to the viewer of our website or user of our services.&nbsp; For more information about the services offered by INFORMS.

GDPR’s mandates go into effect May 25, 2018. In preparation, INFORMS will release a number of new features to align with these important regulations to informs users of INFORMS’ revised privacy policy and secure user consent at all information capturing modules. Our current association management system (AMS) updates are described below.</p><p>GDPR mandates organizations which collect, process and/or store an individual’s or corporate personal information to gain that individual’s positive consent. Positive consent requires the individual to actively express agreement with the proposed use of their data.
