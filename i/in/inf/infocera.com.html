            <b>Scope</b><br><br>
            This privacy policy describes how we handle your personal information
            for our services available through the www.infocera.com (the "Site")
            and applies generally to our subsidiaries and joint venture web sites
            whose specific privacy policies are available from our Privacy Central
            pages. Our subsidiaries and joint ventures privacy practices are similar
            to those described in this Privacy Policy. Subject to the requirements
            of applicable law, we strive to provide a consistent set of privacy
            practices throughout the global infocera community. By accepting the
            Privacy Policy and the User Agreement in registration, you expressly
            consent to our collection, storage, use and disclosure of your personal
            information as described in this Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy
            is effective upon acceptance for new users and is otherwise effective
            on March 11, 2006. <br><br>
            <b>Collection</b><br><br> You can browse the Site without telling
            us who you are or revealing any personal information about yourself.
            Once you give us your personal information, you are not anonymous
            to us. If you choose to provide us with personal information, you
            consent to the transfer and storage of that information to our servers
            located in the India.<br><br>
             We may collect and store the following personal
            information: <br><br>-email address, physical contact information, and (depending
            on the service used) sometimes financial information, such as credit
            card or bank account numbers.<br><br>-transactional information based on
            your activities on the Site (such as bidding, buying, selling, item
            and content you generate or that relates to your account).<br><br>-community
            discussions, chats, dispute resolution, correspondence through the
            Site, and correspondence sent to us.<br><br>-computer sign-on data, statistics
            on page views, traffic to and from the Site, and ad data.<br><br>-other information,
            including IP address and standard web log information.<br><br>-supplemental
            information from third parties. (For example, if you incur a debt
            to infocera, we will generally conduct a credit check by obtaining
            additional information about you from a credit bureau, as permitted
            by law. As another example, if the information you provide cannot
            be verified, we may ask you to send us additional information (such
            as your driver license, credit card statement, and/or a recent utility
            bill or other information confirming your address), or to answer additional
            questions online to help verify your information.<br><br>
             <b>Marketing</b> <br><br>We don't sell or rent your personal information to third parties for their
            marketing purposes without your explicit consent. We may combine your
            information with information we collect from other companies (such
            as demographic data) to improve and personalize our services. <br><br>
            <b>Use</b> <br><br>
            Our primary purpose in collecting personal information is to provide
            you with a safe, smooth, efficient, and customized experience. You
            agree that we may use your personal information to:
            <ul><li> -provide the services
            and customer support you request. </li><li>-resolve disputes, collect fees,
            and troubleshoot problems. </li><li>-prevent potentially prohibited or illegal
            activities, and enforce our User Agreement. </li><li>-customize, measure, and
            improve our services and the Site's content and layout. </li><li>-tell you
            about targeted marketing, service updates, and promotional offers
            based on your communication preferences; and </li><li>-compare information
            for accuracy, and verify it with third parties. </li></ul>
            <b>Our Disclosure of Your Information</b><br><br> We may disclose personal information to respond to
            legal requirements, enforce our policies, respond to claims that a
            listing or other content violates the rights of others, or protect
            anyone's rights, property, or safety. <br><br>We may also share your personal
            information with: <ul><li>- members of our corporate family to help detect
            and prevent potentially illegal acts and provide joint services;(Our
            corporate affiliates will market only to users who request these services.)
            </li><li>- service providers under contract who help with our business operations;
            (such as fraud investigations, bill collection, affiliate and rewards
            programs and co-branded credit cards) </li><li>- other third parties to whom
            you explicitly ask us to send your information; (or about whom you
            are otherwise explicitly notified and consent to when using a specific
            service) </li><li>- law enforcement or other governmental officials, in response
            to a verified request relating to a criminal investigation or alleged
            illegal activity; (In such events we will disclose name, city, state,
            telephone number, email address, User ID history, fraud complaints,
            and bidding and listing history). </li><li>- we in our sole discretion believe
            necessary or appropriate in connection with an investigation of fraud,
            intellectual property infringement, piracy, or other unlawful activity;
            (In such events we will disclose name, street address, city, state,
            zip code, country, phone number, email, and company name). </li><li>- other
            business entities, should we plan to merge with, or be acquired by
            that business entity. (Should such a combination occur, we will require
            that the new combined entity follow this privacy policy with respect
            to your personal information. If your personal information will be
            used contrary to this policy, you will receive prior notice). </li></ul>-
            Without limiting the above, in an effort to respect your privacy and our ability
            to keep the community free from bad actors, we will not otherwise
            disclose your personal information to law enforcement, other government
            officials, or other third parties without a subpoena, court order
            or substantially similar legal procedure, except when we believe in
            good faith that the disclosure of information is necessary to prevent
            imminent physical harm or financial loss or to report suspected illegal
            activity.<br><br> <b>Activity Associated with User IDs/identities</b> <br><br>Your identity/user
            ID is displayed throughout the Site and is therefore available to
            the public. All of your activities on the Site will be traceable to
            your User ID/identity. Other people can see your bids, items that
            you have purchased in the past, items for sale, storefronts, feedback,
            ratings and associated comments, and so on. Notices are sent to other
            community members regarding suspicious activity and policy violations
            on the Site and refer to User IDs/identities and specific items. Therefore,
            if you associate your name with your User ID/identity, the people
            to whom you have revealed your name to will be able to personally
            identify your infocera activities.<br><br> <b>Using Information from infocera </b><br><br>
            Our Site enables you to share personal and financial information in
            order to complete transactions. We encourage you to disclose your
            privacy practices and respect the privacy of other users. We cannot
            guarantee the privacy or security of your information and therefore
            we encourage you to evaluate the privacy and security policies of
            your trading partner before entering into a transaction and choosing
            to share your information. To help protect your privacy, we allow
            only limited access to other users' contact, shipping and financial
            information in order to facilitate your transactions. When users are
            involved in a transaction, they may have access to each other's name,
            User ID/identity, email address, and other contact and shipping information.
            In all cases, you must give other users a chance to remove themselves
            from your database and a chance to review what information you have
            collected about them.<br><br><b> You agree to use user information only for: </b>
            <ul><li>- infocera-transaction-related purposes that are not unsolicited commercial
            messages. </li><li>- Using services offered through infocera (e.g. escrow, insurance,
            shipping and fraud complaints). </li><li>- Other purposes that a user expressly
            chooses. </li></ul>
            <b>Cookies</b> <br><br>We use "cookies" (small files placed on your hard
            drive) on certain pages of the Site to help analyze our web page flow,
            customize our services, measure promotional effectiveness, and promote
            trust and safety. For more information about why we use cookies, see
            Cookies, Web Beacons, and Your Privacy (http://pages.infocera.com/help/newtoinfocera/cookies-web-beacons.html). <br><br>
            A few important things you should know about cookies are that:<ul><li>- We
            offer certain features that are only available through the use of
            cookies.</li><li>- We use cookies to help identify you and maintain your signed-in
            status. </li><li>- Most cookies are "session cookies," meaning that they are
            automatically deleted from your hard drive at the end of a session.
            </li><li>- You are always free to decline our cookies if your browser permits,
            although doing so may interfere with your use of the Site. </li><li>- You may
            encounter cookies from third parties on certain pages of the Site
            that we do not control. (For example, if you view a web page created
            by another user, there may be a "cookie" placed by that web page.). </li></ul>
            <b>No Spam, Spyware or Cookies</b> <br><br>We and our users do not tolerate spam.
            Make sure to set your infocera notification preferences so we communicate
            to you as you prefer. You are not licensed to add other infocera users,
            even a user who has purchased an item from you, to your mail list
            (email or physical mail) without their express consent. To report
            infocera related spam or spoof emails to infocera, please forward
            the email to infocera.com. You may not use our communication tools
            to send spam or otherwise send content that would violate our User
            Agreement. We do filter and automatically scan messages before they
            are sent for viruses and other illegal or prohibited content but do
            not permanently store email messages sent through these tools. If
            you send an email to an email address that is not registered in our
            community (via Refer a Friend or other tool), we do not permanently
            store that email or use that email address for any marketing purpose.
            We do not rent or sell these email addresses. <br><br>
            <b>Account Protection</b> <br><br>Your
            password is the key to your account. Use unique numbers, letters,
            and special characters and do not disclose your infocera password
            to anyone. If you do share your password or your personal information
            with others, remember that you are responsible for all actions taken
            in the name of your account. If you lose control of your password,
            you may lose substantial control over your personal information and
            may be subject to legally binding actions taken on your behalf. Therefore,
            if your password has been compromised for any reason, you should immediately
            notify infocera and change your password.<br><br><b> Accessing, Reviewing and
            Changing Your Personal Information</b><br><br> You can see, review and change
            most of your personal information by logging into the Site. Generally,
            we will not manually modify your personal information because it is
            very difficult to verify your identity remotely. You must promptly
            update your personal information if it changes or is inaccurate. Once
            you make a public posting, you may not be able to change or remove
            it. Upon your request, we will close your account and remove your
            personal information from view as soon as reasonably possible, based
            on your account activity and in accordance with applicable law. We
            do retain personal information from closed accounts in order to comply
            with law, prevent fraud, collect any fees owed, resolve disputes,
            troubleshoot problems, assist with any investigations, enforce our
            infocera User Agreement, and take other actions otherwise permitted
            by law.<br><br><b> Security</b><br><br> Your information is stored on our servers. We treat
            data as an asset that must be protected and use lots of tools (encryption,
            passwords, physical security, etc.) to protect your personal information
            against unauthorized access and disclosure. However, as you probably
            know, third parties may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions
            or private communications, and other users may abuse or misuse your
            personal information that they collect from the Site. Therefore, although
            we work very hard to protect your privacy, we do not promise, and
            you should not expect, that your personal information or private communications
            will always remain private.<br><br> <b>Third Parties</b><br><br> Except as otherwise expressly
            included in this Privacy Policy, this document addresses only the
            use and disclosure of information we collect from you. If you disclose
            your information to others, whether they are bidders, buyers, or sellers
            on our Site or other sites throughout the Internet, different rules
            may apply to their use or disclosure of the information you disclose
            to them. Since infocera does not control the privacy policies of third
            parties, you are subject to the privacy policies of those third parties.
            We encourage you to ask questions before you disclose your personal
            information to others.<br><br><b> General</b> <br><br>We may amend this Privacy Policy at
            any time by posting the amended terms on the Site.<br>
