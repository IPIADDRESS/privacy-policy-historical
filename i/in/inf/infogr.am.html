                    <p>
                        (c) <u>COOKIES</u>. Cookies are pieces of text that may be sent to and saved by your browser when you access our Site; your web browser stores these cookies in a way associated with each website you visit, and you can see your cookies through your browser settings. We use cookies to enable our servers to recognize your web browser and tell us how and when you use our Services.  Our cookies do not, by themselves, contain information that personally identifies you, and we don’t combine the general information collected through cookies with other such information to tell us who you are.  However, we do use cookies to identify that you have logged in and that your web browser has accessed aspects of the Services, and that we may associate that information the account you may have created for your use of the Services.  This information, in turn, is something used to personalize your experience with the Services. Most web browsers have an option for turning off the cookie feature, which will prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, as well as (depending on the sophistication of your web browser software) allowing you to decide on acceptance of each new cookie in a variety of ways. Infogram does not collect personally identifiable browsing information from users that exercise the “Do Not Track option on their browser(s). Please note that this Privacy Policy applies to our use of cookies only, and does not cover the use of cookies by third parties.
                    </p>
                    <h4>2.2. USES OF INFORMATION COLLECTED</h4>
                    <p>
                        (a) <u>COMPANY USE OF INFORMATION</u>. We use Contact Data to send you information about our company or our products or services, or to contact you when necessary (ie notices relating to the Service; service alerts; general customer care). We use your Financial Data to bill you for our non-free Services. While we reserve the right to send you email concerning your account billing status and service alerts, you may opt out of our general marketing and promotion emails.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        (b) <u>SHARING OF PERSONAL INFORMATION</u>. We share certain categories of information we collect from you in the ways described in this Privacy Policy. We share Contact Data and Financial Data with our business partners who assist us by performing core services (such as hosting, billing, fulfillment, data storage and security, or account registration using social media platforms) related to our operation of the Site. Those business partners only have permission to use your Contact Data and other Personal Information to carry out their specific business obligations to Company. If you do not want us to share your Contact Data with any third parties, please email us at hello@infogr.am, but please understand that such a request will limit your ability to take advantage of all of the features and services we offer on the Site. Your selection and payment for a non-free Infogram plan constitutes your permission for Infogram to store, process, and share your Financial Data for billing and fulfillment purposes.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        (c) <u>USER CHOICE REGARDING COLLECTION, USE, AND DISTRIBUTION OF PERSONAL INFORMATION</u>. You may choose not to provide us with any Personal Information. In such an event, you may still access the Site; however you will not be able to access and use the Services because, per our Terms of Use, Infogram requires accurate Personal Information for the creation of an account which allows the use of our Services.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        (d) <u>INFORMATION RETENTION POLICY</u>. Personal Information will only be retained by company for as long as necessary to provide you with Services. Company’s billing options for non-free plans provide for periodic billing, and Company may retain your Financial Data for that purpose.
                    </p>
                    <h3>3. CONFIDENTIALITY AND SECURITY OF PERSONAL INFORMATION</h3>
                    <p>
                        Except as otherwise provided in this Privacy Policy, we will keep your Personal Information private and will not share it with third parties, unless such disclosure is necessary to: (a) comply with a court order or other legal process; (b) protect our rights or property; or (c) enforce our Terms of Service. Your Personal Information is stored on secure servers that are not accessible by third parties.
                    </p>
                    <h4><u>3.1. USER ABILITY TO ACCESS, UPDATE, AND CORRECT PERSONAL INFORMATION</u></h4>
                    <p>
                        We maintain a procedure in order to help you confirm that your Personal Information remains correct and up-to-date. At any time, you may log in to your account, accessible on the Site, and review your Personal Information for accuracy and, if necessary, update your Personal Information that we have already collected.
                    </p>
                    <h4><u>3.2. LOST OR STOLEN INFORMATION</u></h4>
                    <p>
                        You must promptly notify us if your credit card, user name, or password is lost, stolen, or used without permission. In such an event, we will remove that credit card number, user name, or password from your account and update our records accordingly.
                    </p>
                    <h4><u>3.3. PUBLIC INFORMATION</u></h4>
                    <p>
                        The Site contains links to other websites. We are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such websites.

                    </p>
                    <h4><u>3.4. DATA PROVIDED BY YOU TO CREATE CHARTS AND INFOGRAPHS</u></h4>

                        Infogram’s Services enable you to upload your data to create charts and infographs embedded with or otherwise displaying your data. Per our Terms of Use, you are solely responsible for respecting your own privacy and confidentiality interests, as well as those interests of any other person or party.

                    </p>
                    <h3>4. TRANSFER OF PERSONAL INFORMATION TO SUCCESSOR IN INTEREST</h3>
                    <p>
                        Company reserves the right to sell, buy, merge or otherwise reorganize its businesses.  Any such reorganization may result in Company sharing and/or disclosing your Personal Information to prospective or actual successors-in-interest and their advisors, or receiving personal data from sellers and their advisors. Buy using this Site and its Services, you acknowledge and agree that such transfers of Personal Information may occur, and that any acquirer of Infogram is entitled to use your Personal Information as set forth in this Privacy Policy.
                    </p>
                    <h3>5. CHILDREN &amp; MINORS</h3>
                    <p>

Personal Information from children between the ages of 13 and 18 is only collected with the consent of their parents or guardians. In the event that we learn that we have collected personal information from a child under 13, we will delete that information as quickly as possible. In the event that we learn that we have collected personal information from a child between the ages of 13 and 18 without parental consent, we will delete that information as quickly as possible.
                    </p>
                    <h3>6. UPDATES AND CHANGES TO PRIVACY POLICY</h3>
                    <p>
