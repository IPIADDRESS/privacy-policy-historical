												<p><em><strong>"IncrediMail pledges to you that it will never spam you, force you to 
															install 3rd party software on your system or harm your online privacy in any 
															way. <em>IncrediMail</em> is not a spyware."</strong></em></p>
												<p><em>IncrediMail</em> takes your online privacy seriously and is committed to 
													providing you with a safe and secure working environment. The <em>IncrediMail</em>
													team is certainly aware of the ever-growing unethical behavior in today's 
													Internet world and is proud to not participate in any of the offensive business 
													models so commonly used. <em>IncrediMail</em> pledges to you that it will never 
													spam you, force you to install 3rd party software on your system or harm your 
													online privacy in any way. <em>IncrediMail</em> is not a spyware.
												</p>
												<p>Even so, with the increasing amount of spam and spywares flooding the Internet 
													it's difficult not to be skeptical. The following are the most common questions 
													you are likely to ask yourself:
												</p>
												<p><strong>Does <em>IncrediMail</em> collect any personal information?</strong></p>
												<p>When you register with <em>IncrediMail</em>, you will be asked to submit certain 
													information such as your country, age and gender. Only in cases where <em>IncrediMail</em>
													cannot identify your email account settings, you will be asked to type in 
													information such as your display name, email address and incoming/outgoing 
													server settings. <em>IncrediMail</em> does not collect personally identifiable 
													or non-personally identifiable information other than what is indicated during 
													the registration process.
												</p>
												<p><em>IncrediMail</em> uses information such as <em>IncrediMail</em> content 
													statistics in order to present users with the "Most Popular" lists in the <em>IncrediMail</em>
													Online Gallery.
													We also use the services of a marketing company to help us learn things like what pages are most attractive to our visitors, 
													which of our products most interest our customers, and what kinds of offers our customers like to see.
													 That way we can meet user preferences, and continuously enhance 
													the <em>IncrediMail</em> product. This is the only kind of non-personally 
													identifiable information used by <em>IncrediMail</em>.</p>
												<p><strong>Is <em>IncrediMail</em> spyware?</strong></p>
												<p><strong>No, it is not.</strong> <em>IncrediMail</em> does not install any PC 
													surveillance tools, capture keystrokes, log your communications, etc. Our 
													business and revenue model has nothing to do with using your personal 
													information in a harmful or deceitful manner. In fact, the <em>IncrediMail</em> 
													team is adamantly against that kind of behavior and therefore, does not violate 
													the privacy policy and agreement with our customers.</p>
												<p>IncrediMail is 100% Safe &amp; Secure - <a href="/redir/?id=111429">Read our Reviews!</a></p>	
												<p><strong>Does <em>IncrediMail</em> install anything else other than <em>IncrediMail</em>
														products on users' computers?</strong></p>
												<p><strong>Absolutely not.</strong> The only software installed on any user's 
													computer is <em>IncrediMail</em> and its supplementary program, the Letter 
													Creator. <em>IncrediMail</em> does not install any third-party software.
												</p>
												<p><strong>Will <em>IncrediMail</em> provide my personal information to third parties?</strong></p>
												<p><strong>Absolutely not.</strong> We are committed to making <em>IncrediMail</em> 
													users feel safe and comfortable when sending/receiving email. Therefore, <em>IncrediMail</em>
													does not and will not provide user's personally identifiable information it has 
													collected to any third party (including advertisers and direct marketers) 
													without the user's permission. <em>IncrediMail</em> may on occasion share usage 
													information for statistical purposes in aggregate anonymous (non-personally 
													identifiable) form, with advertisers or other third parties.</p>
												<p><strong>Will I receive spam from <em>IncrediMail</em>?</strong></p>
												<p><strong>No.</strong> When you register to <em>IncrediMail</em> you are asked if 
													you would like to receive email updates and <em>IncrediMail</em> special 
													offers. Only users that install <em>IncrediMail</em> with the indication that 
													they would like to receive updates will receive the <em>IncrediMail</em> Newsletter 
													and other special updates. In addition, each email from <em>IncrediMail</em> includes 
													an "unsubscribe" option, thus allowing you to halt your subscription at any 
													time. <em>IncrediMail</em> does not collect users' personal information and use 
													it to send advertisements and other unsolicited mail.
