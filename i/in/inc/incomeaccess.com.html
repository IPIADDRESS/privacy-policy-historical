		<span class="title">Income Access User Privacy Policy</span>
		<br><br>
<b>Internet User Privacy</b> 
		<br><br>
		Income Access was created to manage relationships between Members and Merchants, while maintaining the privacy of its users. We understand the need to safeguard sensitive information that you have entrusted to us by using our services. Consequently, we maintain standards and procedures designed to prevent misuse of this information.
		<br><br>
		This document explains Income Access ("Income Access" "we" "our") policies for the collection, use and disclosure of personal information. The following policies are only in effect for the web pages, newsletters and opt-in announcement lists owned and operated by Income Access. This policy forms part of, and should be read in conjunction with, our <a href="members/terms_and_conditions.asp" class="footer" target="_blank">Terms and Conditions</a>. 
		<br><br>
		You may contact us regarding this Privacy Policy by e-mail, <a href="info@incomeaccess.com" class="content">info@incomeaccess.com</a>  or by mail at our headquarters address:
		<p><strong>Income Access</strong> 
		<br>2020 University, Suite 1320 
		<br>Montreal QC H3A 2A5 
		<br>Canada 

		<br>
		</p><p><b>Collection, Retention, and Use of Information about You </b>
		</p><p>Information submitted through the electronic registration page on the Income Access site by a member is shared with the Merchant to whom the Member is intending to form an affiliation; solely for the purpose of the Merchant fulfilling its obligation to member.

</p><p>Information submitted through the electronic Member registration page on the Income Access website is shared with Merchants for the purpose of assessing potential affiliate partnerships, and once affiliate partnerships are established, for the purpose of fulfilling merchant compensation obligations. 

</p><p>If you have not registered or do not intend to register as a Merchant or as a Member with Income Access then our privacy policy may not be directly applicable to you, as we do not collect any  identifiable information from or about any user arriving at this website with the exception of the following users (i) persons or entities who have entered into  our program as a Merchant pursuant to a legally binding  written contract ( "Merchant Agreement") that is signed  and physically delivered and (ii) persons or entities who have entered into  our program as a Member pursuant to  the completion of an online contract and the acceptance of our "<a href="members/terms_and_conditions.asp" class="footer" target="_blank">Terms and Conditions</a>" prior to clicking the "submit" button.

</p><p>By completing the registration process, Members and Merchants agree to be solicited by Merchants and Members (respectively). All other personally identifiable information of Merchants and Members that is provided by them during the sign-up process is retained and used by Income Access in order to serve the Member and the Merchants through processes such as performance reporting and commission payments to Members. 

<br>
</p><p><b>Cookies</b>
</p><p>An Internet user's browser sets Cookies (when enabled) that contain small amounts of data on the Internet User's computer after a visit to any website. To assist merchants in the tracking Internet users' activities, originating from an Affiliate's website or e-mail. If the Internet user visits or revisits an advertiser's site directly from such Affiliate, Income Access maintains the ability to continually track the Internet user's activities on the Merchant's site and reward the Affiliate that referred the Internet user. The Cookies do not intentionally reveal any personally identifiable information to Income Access or the Merchant about the Internet user.

</p><p><b>Our collection and use of information from Merchants or Members</b>
</p><p>Although Income Access requires Merchants and Members to adhere to Good Business Practices as a condition of Membership in the Income Access Network, Income Access is not responsible for the information practices of Merchants or Members. Merchants and Members may collect information from or about Internet users, including personal information. The collection, use, and disclosure of information by Merchants and Members are subject to their respective privacy policies, which may differ from Income Access's Privacy Policy. 


</p><p>If a Member has been given permission by the Internet user to record personally identifiable Internet user data (e.g. through special promotions) the anonymous Internet user data may be coded by a Member to enable the Member to generate personally identifiable Internet user data. Under the foregoing circumstances, the information remains anonymous to Income Access. 

</p><p>In the event Income Access does receive and record partial e-mail addresses of Internet users, only in circumstances where the Internet user has voluntarily provided its identity and contact information through the Merchant's Web-site or Member's Web-site. In no way does this enable Income Access to personally identify an Internet user. 


</p><p><b>Security Measures</b> 
</p><p>This website employs industry standard security measures and furthermore takes every precaution to protect information users have voluntary submitted to Income Access. When a Member or a Merchant submits sensitive information via the website, the information is protected both online and offline. All member and merchant data is only accessible via password-protected Member and Merchant account IDs.

</p><p><b>Restrictions on Disclosing Information to Parties outside Our Company</b>
</p><p>Income Access is acting as an intermediary between the Merchant and the Member. Therefore Merchants and Members, and not Income Access, are responsible for their own privacy polices and for maintaining privacy and confidentiality for all information Income Access provides them. If a user has any questions or concerns about the privacy policies of those parties, it must contact such parties. 

</p><p>Income Access does not sell, rent or transfer personally identifying information. Income Access does not disclose personally identifying information that it is not authorized to do so, with the exception of (i) being compelled to do so by proper judicial or governmental authorities, or (ii) selling or transferring ownership, operation or control of any or all of our company that is directly related to the necessary function and maintenance of the Affiliate Network or engages any subcontractor or agent to operate any part of it affiliate management services 

</p><p><b>Account Number and Password</b> 
</p><p>It is the responsibility of each Member and Merchant to keep personal account numbers and password confidential. Income Access is not liable for an account that has been used without the authority of the registered user, as a result of disclosing their account number and password. 

</p><p><b>Protecting Children with COPPA</b>
</p><p>Income Access is committed to complying with the provisions of the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 and the Rules and Regulations made pursuant thereto. Income Access will not knowingly allow any one under the age of 18 to become a Member. Furthermore Income Access obliges its Members and Merchants to comply fully with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998.
