When your web browser loads a page on our site, a small snippet of javascript code is executed within your browser which submits information about the device from which you are connecting such as your browser user-agent, language, screen resolution, referring website, etc. to the Google Analytics service. To enhance your anonymity, inCloak have opted to only allow Google to collect only a portion of the IP address. Google Analytics may also store a web cookie to facilitate the identification of users who revisit the site. If users are concerned with being tracked by Google analytics scripts on inCloak or any other site running Google analytics, we recommend installing a <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout" target="_blank">browser add-on</a> which allows you to opt out.</p>
