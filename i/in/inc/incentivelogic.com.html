<p><strong><u>Notice to California  Residents / Your California Privacy Rights</u></strong></p>
<p>California Civil Code Section 1798.83 permits California residents who  have supplied personal information, as defined in the statute, to the Site to  request and obtain certain information regarding our disclosure, if any, of  personal information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes  (namely, the categories of personal information shared and the names and  addresses of all third parties that received personal information from this  Site for their direct marketing purposes) during the immediately prior calendar  year (for example, requests made in 2011 will receive information about 2010  sharing activities).&nbsp; To make such a  request (limit one request per year), please send an e-mail to info@incentivelogic.com,  with “California Privacy Rights” as the subject line. You must include your  full name, e-mail address, and postal address in your message.</p>
<p> <strong><u>Information Collected At This Site</u></strong></p>
<p>  There are two types of information that we can learn about you as you  browse and use this site. Each type of information can be used in a different  way:&nbsp; <strong>1.</strong>&nbsp;Internet-related  Information - generic statistical and demographic information that we gather  passively from visitors to the Site; and <strong>2.</strong>&nbsp;Personal Information  that you provide when making contact with us.</p>
<p> The Site is not directed to children younger than 13, and Incentive  Logic does not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from  children younger than 13.&nbsp; If Incentive  Logic discovers that a person younger than 13 has provided the Site with  personally identifiable information, Incentive Logic will delete that  personally identifiable information.</p>
<p><strong><u>Internet-Related Information Gathered  Passively</u></strong></p>
<p>  We collect Internet-related Information from visitors to our Site,  including the referring URL, your IP address, which browser you used to come to  the Site, the country, state or province, the pages of our Site that you viewed  during your visit and any search terms entered on our Site, for the purposes of  system administration, to gather broad demographic information, and to monitor  the level of activity on our Site. We track visitors’ traffic patterns  throughout their online sessions, including which pages or specific URLs a  customer views while using the Site.&nbsp; We use your Internet-related  Information to diagnose problems with our servers and software and to  administer our Site. We may share aggregated statistics about pages viewed on  our Site, demographic information and sales and other browsing information with  third parties to enrich your visitor experience.</p>
<p><strong><u>Cookies</u></strong></p>
<p>When you visit  this Site, we leave a "Cookie" in the memory of your Web browser. We,  and our third party web analytics service providers, use both session ID  cookies and persistent cookies to make it easier for you to navigate our site.  A session ID cookie expires when you close your browser. A persistent cookie  remains on your hard drive for an extended period of time. Cookies cannot  access or read the files on your hard drive and cannot be used as a  virus.&nbsp;You can remove persistent cookies by following the directions  provided in your Internet browser’s “help” file.&nbsp; We do not link the information we store in  cookies to any personally identifiable information you submit while on our  site.&nbsp; If you prefer, you can set your  browser to refuse Cookies.&nbsp; However, by doing so you may not be able to  access some features of the Site. The  use of cookies by our web analytics service providers is not covered by our  privacy statement.&nbsp; We do not have access  or control over these cookies.</p>
<p><strong><u>Clear  Gifs (Web Beacons/Web Bugs)</u></strong></p>
<p>Our third party traffic  analyzer partner employs a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web  Beacons/Web Bugs), that help us better manage content on our site by informing  us what content is effective.&nbsp; Clear gifs  are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and  are used to track the online movements of Web users.&nbsp; In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a  user’s computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on Web pages and  are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. We do not tie the  information gathered by clear gifs to our customers’ personally identifiable  information. </p>
<p><strong><u>Actively Collected Personal Information You  Provide</u></strong></p>
<p>If you provide information about yourself (such as your name, email  address, physical address and company name) by registering on a page,  participating in any activities on the Site, or otherwise voluntarily telling  us about yourself or your activities, we will collect and use that Personal  Information to respond to your request, and for other business purposes,  including, without limitation, identifying consumer preferences, and improving  our products and services and the content of this Site.&nbsp; </p>
<p>We may also contact you by email, regular mail, fax, or telephone from  time to time with information about our new products and services, special  offers, upcoming events and changes to this Site.&nbsp; If you do not wish to  be contacted by all or any of these methods, you may let us know by contacting  us through one of the ways listed under the Contact Us section.&nbsp; Please be  sure to give us your exact name and address, and your detailed request so we  can respond appropriately.&nbsp; </p>
<p>We will retain your  information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you  services. &nbsp;If you wish to request that we  no longer use your information to provide you services, please contact us  through one of the methods listed below.&nbsp; We will retain and use your information  as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and  enforce our agreements.<strong><u> </u></strong></p>
<p><strong><u>Sharing Information</u></strong></p>
<p>We may provide  your personal information to companies that provide services to help us with  our business activities such as sending service related emails on our behalf. &nbsp;These companies are authorized to use your  personal information <em>only as necessary to provide </em>these services to us.</p>
<p>We will share  your personal information with third parties only in the ways that are  described in this privacy statement.&nbsp; We  do not sell your personal information to third parties for their promotional  purposes.</p>
<p>Incentive Logic also reserves the right to disclose and transfer user  information, including personally identifiable information, in connection with  a corporate merger, consolidation, restructuring, financing, the sale of  substantially all assets, or other corporate change.&nbsp; You will be notified via email and/or  a prominent notice on our Web site of any change in ownership or uses of your  personal information, as well as any choices you may have regarding your  personal information.</p>
<p>We may also disclose your personal information as  required by law, such as to comply with a subpoena or similar legal process, when  we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights,  protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud, or respond to a  government request.</p>
<p><strong><u>Links To Other Websites</u></strong></p>
<p>On this Site, we may provide as a convenience  to you links to other websites, including sites operated by us, our partners,  associates, or independent third parties.&nbsp; Each website has its own  privacy practices, as described in that site's privacy policy.&nbsp; Those  practices may be different than the practices described herein, and we urge you  to read each website's privacy policy carefully before you use or submit  information to that site.&nbsp; Additionally, to the extent that you follow a  link to a website operated by an independent third party, please be aware that  we exercise no authority or control over that third party, and cannot and are  not responsible for any information that you may submit at that site.<br>
  <br>
  <strong><u>Testimonials</u></strong></p>
<p>We post customer testimonials on  our web site which may contain personally identifiable information.&nbsp; We do obtain the customer's consent via email  prior to posting the testimonial to post their name along with their testimonial.
