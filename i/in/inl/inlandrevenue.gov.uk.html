      </p><p><b>Privacy and Data Protection</b> 
      </p><p>The Inland Revenue is a Data Controller under the Data Protection Act. 
        We hold information for the purposes of taxes, social security contributions, 
        tax credits and certain other statutory functions as assigned by Parliament. 
        The information we hold may be used for any of the Inland Revenue's functions.</p>
      <p>We may get information about you from others or we may give information 
        to them. If we do, it will only be as the law permits, to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li> check accuracy of information</li>
        <li> prevent or detect crime</li>
        <li> protect public funds</li>
      </ul>
      <p>We may check information we receive about you with what is already in 
        our records. This can include information provided by you as well as by 
        others such as other government departments and agencies and overseas 
        tax authorities. We will not give information about you to anyone outside 
        the Inland Revenue unless the law permits us to do so.</p>
      <p><b>Confidentiality and security</b></p>
      <p>The Inland Revenue has a legal duty to protect the confidentiality of 
        taxpayer information. We take every precaution to protect any information 
        you submit via our website, both online and offline, in accordance with 
        legislation such as the Data Protection Act 1998. Any data, which we use 
        in our offices, is protected in accordance with Government standards.</p>
      <p>Throughout the registration process, and also when you are submitting 
        sensitive information such as that required in a tax return, the information 
        is encrypted to protect confidentiality, and protected according to industry 
        best practice. </p>
      <p><b>Sharing of Information</b></p>
      <p>Any information you submit via our website will only be shared in accordance 
        with the law. </p>
      <p><b>Registration</b></p>
      <p>The Inland Revenue website offers several services including the facility 
        to send tax returns via the Internet. To use some of these services, you 
        must first complete the registration form. During registration, we ask 
        you to provide certain details to allow us to verify your identity. You 
        may also be asked to provide contact information (such as an e-mail address), 
        which we will use to let you know about the services on our website and 
        to respond to your questions about the services. Once you have registered, 
        we will send a welcoming e-mail detailing the services currently available 
        and any plans to offer new services. We may send further e-mails later 
        to announce the availability of new services. </p>
      <p>We do offer you the option not to provide your e-mail address during 
        the registration process.</p>
      <p> <b>Cookies</b></p>
      <p>A cookie is a piece of data stored locally on your computer and contains 
        information about your activities on the Internet. On our website, we 
        use cookies to track users' progress through the site, allowing us to 
        make improvements based on usage data. The information on a cookie is 
        not linked to any personally identifiable information you submit to our 
        site. </p>
      <p>Once you close your browser, our access to the cookie simply terminates. 
        If you choose not to accept the cookie, this will not affect your access 
        to the facilities available on our website.</p>
      <p> <b>Log Files</b></p>
      <p>When you use the Internet, you are assigned a unique address, known as 
        an IP address. We use IP addresses to analyse trends, to administer the 
        site, track users' movements, and gather statistical information. IP addresses 
        are not linked to personally identifiable information.</p>
      <p> <b>Links</b></p>
      <p>Our website contains links to other sites, mainly those of other government 
        departments, but also to those of third parties. The Inland Revenue is 
        not responsible for the privacy practices within any of these other sites. 
        We encourage you to be aware of this when you leave our site and to read 
        the privacy statements on other websites you visit which collect personally 
        identifiable information. This privacy statement applies solely to information 
        collected on our website.</p>
      <p> <b>Correction/Updating Personal Information</b></p>
      <p>If your personally identifiable information changes, or if you no longer 
        wish to use our services, we will provide a way to correct, update or 
        remove your personal data from the records on our Internet system. You 
        will be able to de-register from the service either online or by contacting 
        your local Tax Office.</p>
      <p> <b>Notification of Changes to Policy</b></p>
      <p>If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post details of any 
        changes on our Homepage. This will help ensure that you are always aware 
        of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, 
        if any, we share it with other parties.</p>
