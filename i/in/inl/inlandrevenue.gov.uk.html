  <h2>General</h2>
  <p> Our Privacy Policy is designed to tell you about our practices regarding 
    the collection, use and disclosure of information that you may provide via 
    the HM Revenue &amp; Customs (HMRC) website. Whenever you use this site, you 
    consent to the collection, use, and disclosure of that information in accordance 
    with this Privacy Policy.</p>
  <h2> Ways that we collect information</h2>
  <p> Some areas of the site require you to actively submit information in order 
    for you to benefit from specific features (such as our range of online services). 
    You will be informed at each information collection point what information 
    is required and what information is optional.</p>
  <p> Some of this information may be personal (information that can be uniquely 
    identified with you, such as your full name, address, email address, phone 
    number etc).</p>
  <p> We only collect such information when you choose to supply it to us.</p>
  <p> Information is also gathered without you actively providing it, through 
    the use of various technologies and methods such as Internet Protocol (IP) 
    addresses and cookies. These methods do not collect or store personal information.</p>
  <p> An IP address is a number assigned to your computer by your Internet Service 
    Provider (ISP), so you can access the Internet. It is generally considered 
    to be non-personally identifiable information, because in most cases an IP 
    address is dynamic (changing each time you connect to the Internet), rather 
    than static (unique to a particular user's computer).</p>
  <p> We use your IP address to diagnose problems with our server, report aggregate 
    information, and determine the fastest route for your computer to use in connecting 
    to our site, and to administer and improve the site.</p>
  <p>&nbsp; </p>

  <h2> Cookies</h2>
  <p> Cookies are small files that are often created when you visit a website, 
    and which are stored in the cookie directory of your computer. A cookie often 
    includes an anonymous unique identifier. Cookies do not damage your computer. 
    Each website can send its own cookie to your browser if your browser's preferences 
    allow it, but to protect your privacy your browser only permits a website 
    to access the cookies it has already sent to you, not the cookies sent to 
    you by other sites. You do not have to accept cookies. You can decide if you 
    want to accept cookies by changing the settings on your browser to either 
    accept all cookies, reject all cookies, or notify you when a cookie is set. 
    Switching off cookies will still allow you to view the majority of information 
    available on our website, however, you will not be able to make full use of 
    our online services.</p>
  <p> We use cookies to track users’ progress through the site, allowing 
    us to make improvements based on usage data. The information in a cookie does 
    not contain any personally identifiable information you submit to our site.</p>
  <p> There are two types of cookie. Persistent cookies remain on your computer 
    for a specified time. Our persistent cookies will remain on your computer 
    for 5 years. </p>
  <p> We use persistent cookies to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li> identify that a user has returned</li>
    <li> collect information about how the website is used that allows us to make 
      improvements to it</li>
  </ul>
  <p> Session-specific cookies are deleted when you leave the website. We use 
    session-specific cookies to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li> hold the information given while using some of our online services and 
      tools</li>
    <li> hold your login details when you are logged into our online services</li>
    <li> collect information about how the website is used that allows us to make 
      improvements to it</li>
  </ul>
  <p> The <a href="http://www.iab.net/iab_products_and_industry_services/1421/1443/1464">Internet Advertising 
    Bureau</a> (IAB) (this link will open a new window) provides in depth information 
    about cookies. </p>
  <h2> Page tagging</h2>
  <p> We use JavaScript page tags to aggregate and analyse customer usage patterns 
    on our website. This provides us with data on your site usage and behaviour. 
    We use this information to make changes to the layout of the website and to 
    the information in it. This process does not collect any personal or identifiable 
    information about users. You can disable JavaScript on your computer however, 
    disabling JavaScript may affect your ability to access some of our online 
    tools and services.</p>
  <p> Sometimes we tag pages on the site when we are promoting various campaigns. 
    These tags are provided by our advertising management partners, DoubleClick 
    and Atlas. These tags enable DoubleClick and Atlas to recognise a unique cookie 
    on your browser, which in turn enables us to learn which advertisements bring 
    users to our web site. The cookie was placed by us, or by another advertiser 
    who works with DoubleClick and Atlas. With this technology, the information 
    that we collect and share is anonymous and not personally identifiable. It 
    does not contain your name, address, telephone number, or email address. There 
    is more information about DoubleClick and Atlas - including information about 
    how to opt out of these technologies - on their websites.</p>

    analysis helps us to understand usage patterns on our website and to make 
    improvements to our service.</p>

  <p> Except as otherwise stated, we may use information you provide via this 
    site to improve the content, to customise the site to your preferences, to

    parties or other government departments except where:</p>
  <ul>

      (for example to prevent or detect crime).</li>
