                  <p>The Inland Revenue is a Data Controller 
                    under the Data Protection Act. We 
                    hold information for the purposes 
                    of taxes, social security contributions, 
                    tax credits and certain other statutory 
                    functions as assigned by Parliament. 
                    The information we hold may be used 
                    for any of the Inland Revenue's 
                    functions.</p>
                  <p>We may get information about you 
                    from others or we may give information 
                    to them. If we do, it will only 
                    be as the law permits, to:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>check accuracy of information 
                    </li>
                    <li>prevent or detect crime </li>
                    <li>protect public funds </li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>We may check information we receive 
                    about you with what is already in 
                    our records. This can include information 
                    provided by you as well as by others 
                    such as other government departments 
                    and agencies and overseas tax authorities. 
                    We will not give information about 
                    you to anyone outside the Inland 
                    Revenue unless the law permits us 
                    to do so.</p>
                  <h2>Confidentiality and security</h2>
                  <p>The Inland Revenue has a legal 
                    duty to protect the confidentiality 
                    of taxpayer information. We take 
                    every precaution to protect any 
                    information you submit via our website, 
                    both online and offline, in accordance 
                    with legislation such as the Data 
                    Protection Act 1998. Any data, which 
                    we use in our offices, is protected 
                    in accordance with Government standards.</p>
                  <p>Throughout the registration process, 
                    and also when you are submitting 
                    sensitive information such as that 
                    required in a tax return, the information 
                    is encrypted to protect confidentiality, 
                    and protected according to industry 
                    best practice. </p>
                  <h2>Monitoring e-mail</h2>
                  <p>We may monitor e-mail communications 
                    with the Inland Revenue (this includes 
                    any Inland Revenue member of staff). 
                    Any such monitoring will take place 
                    in accordance with the law.</p>
                  <h2>Sharing of Information</h2>
                  <p>Any information you submit via 
                    our website will only be shared 
                    in accordance with the law. </p>
                  <h2>Registration</h2>
                  <p>The Inland Revenue website offers 
                    several services including the facility 
                    to send tax returns via the Internet. 
                    To use some of these services, you 
                    must first complete the registration 
                    form. During registration, we ask 
                    you to provide certain details to 
                    allow us to verify your identity. 
                    You may also be asked to provide 
                    contact information (such as an 
                    e-mail address), which we will use 
                    to let you know about the services 
                    on our website and to respond to 
                    your questions about the services. 
                    Once you have registered, we will 
                    send a welcoming e-mail detailing 
                    the services currently available 
                    and any plans to offer new services. 
                    We may send further e-mails later 
                    to announce the availability of 
                    new services. </p>
                  <p>We do offer you the option not 
                    to provide your e-mail address during 
                    the registration process.</p>
                  <h2>Cookies</h2>
                  <p>A cookie is a piece of data stored

                    on the Internet. On our website, 
                    we use cookies to track users' progress 
                    through the site, allowing us to 
                    make improvements based on usage 
                    data. The information on a cookie 
                    is not linked to any personally 
                    identifiable information you submit 
                    to our site. </p>
                  <p>Once you close your browser, our

                    If you choose not to accept the

                    access to the majority of facilities 
                    available on our website. However, 
                    you may not be able to make full 
                    use of our online forms service.</p>
                  <h2>Log Files</h2>
                  <p>When you use the Internet, you 
                    are assigned a unique address, known 
                    as an IP address. We use IP addresses 
                    to analyse trends, to administer 
                    the site, track users' movements, 
                    and gather statistical information. 
                    IP addresses are not linked to personally 
                    identifiable information.</p>
                  <h2>Links</h2>
                  <p>Our website contains links to other 
                    sites, mainly those of other government 
                    departments, but also to those of 
                    third parties. The Inland Revenue 
                    is not responsible for the privacy 
                    practices within any of these other 
                    sites. We encourage you to be aware 
                    of this when you leave our site 
                    and to read the privacy statements 
                    on other websites you visit which 
                    collect personally identifiable 
                    information. This privacy statement 
                    applies solely to information collected 
                    on our website.</p>
                  <h2>Correction/Updating Personal Information</h2>
                  <p>If your personally identifiable 
                    information changes, or if you no 
                    longer wish to use our services, 
                    we will provide a way to correct, 
                    update or remove your personal data 
                    from the records on our Internet 
                    system. You will be able to de-register 
                    from the service either online or 
                    by contacting your local Tax Office.</p>
                  <h2>Notification of Changes to Policy</h2>
                  <p>If we decide to change our privacy 
                    policy, we will post details of 
                    any changes on our Homepage. This 
                    will help ensure that you are always 
                    aware of what information we collect, 
                    how we use it, and under what circumstances, 
                    if any, we share it with other parties.</p>
