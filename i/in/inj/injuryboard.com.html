<p><b>SERVICE PROVIDERS</b></p>

<p>The Legal Examiner is neither a lawyer referral service, nor a law firm. The Legal Examiner is an information platform that allows users to access information on our site provided by Injury Board, its members, and third parties to service your requests for information. Most information is provided by Law Firms with expertise in legal issues pertaining to personal injury law and related matters. The law firms acting as service providers on our site are not authorized to use your personally identifiable information for any purposes other than to fulfill the service requests you make on our site while <a title="Contacting an attorney" href="http://members.injuryboard.org/">“Contacting an attorney”</a> or accessing information presented by attorneys in their blogs.</p>

<p>As is true of all licensed attorneys, a duty of confidentiality governs the attorneys associated with Injury Board. State bar associations from around the United States enforce this duty of confidentiality. The duty of confidentiality prohibits attorneys from revealing your confidential information to others. The American Bar Association defines the duty of confidentiality as follows:</p>

<p><em><u>Rule 1.6 Confidentiality of Information</u></em></p>

<p><em>(a) A lawyer shall not reveal information relating to representation of a client unless the client consents after consultation, except for disclosures that are impliedly authorized in order to carry out the representation, and except as stated in paragraph (b).</em></p>

<p><em>(b) A lawyer may reveal such information to the extent the lawyer reasonably believes necessary:</em></p>

<p><em>(1) To prevent the client from committing a criminal act that the lawyer believes is likely to result in imminent death or substantial bodily harm; or</em></p>

<p><em>(2) to establish a claim or defense on behalf of the lawyer in a controversy between the lawyer and the client, to establish a defense to a criminal charge or civil claim against the lawyer based upon conduct in which the client was involved, or to respond to allegations in any proceeding concerning the lawyer's representation of a client.</em></p>

<p><b>BLOG DISCLOSURE</b></p>

<p>If you post to a bulletin board, blog, or post a comment on this website, you should be aware that any personally identifiable information you submit there can be read, collected, or used by other users of these forums, and could be used to send you unsolicited messages.

<h1>Disclaimer</h1>

<p>The Legal Examiner is the leading personal injury legal site for consumers. However, The Legal Examiner is neither a law firm nor a legal referral service, nor a doctor's office. As such, this site should not be used as a substitute for an attorney's advice or a medical doctor's diagnosis. The Legal Examiner provides general legal, health, injury and medical information. However, our website does not provide specific medical or legal advice for an individual's specific matter or concern. Instead, the information we provide is general in nature, and you are encouraged to speak with an <a href="http://members.injuryboard.org/">Injury Board member attorney</a> regarding your specific legal questions.</p>

<p>If you are concerned with a specific medical condition, we urge you to seek a doctor's advice. We cannot provide such medical advice to you. Additionally, if you have a specific legal problem, we encourage you to contact an attorney. As laws vary from state to state and change over time, only a licensed attorney can provide you with specific legal advice. Furthermore, please be conscious of Statutes of Limitation in your state, the time periods within which you are allowed to bring a claim. There are sometime exceptions to these time limits depending on special circumstances, so consult with a lawyer in your state if you have questions about <a title="Statutes of Limitations" href="/topic/tort-components-statutes.aspx">Statutes of Limitations.</a></p>

<p>The Legal Examiner allows you to contact one of our member firms free of charge. By contacting a member firm, you have not entered into an attorney/client relationship. Such a relationship can only be established after both parties have signed a written document. Injury Board member firms sponsor the efforts to create, maintain, and provide content for The Legal Examiner so that users of the site may access important safety, legal and injury information that may be unavailable or difficult to find elsewhere. Should you enter into an attorney/client relationship with an The Legal Examiner member firm, The Legal Examiner does not receive any referral fee from the member form, nor does it receive any portion of the attorneys' or law firms' fees upon resolution of a matter.</p>

<p>A great deal of the information provided on this website is provided by our members and other third parties, and these parties are responsible for the contents of the information they have provided. The Legal Examiner is not responsible for the actions and/or inactions of Injury Board member firms. Although Injury Board seeks only members who are competent, ethical, and experienced, we are unable to guarantee your satisfaction with any Injury Board member's answers or services provided.</p>

<p>Furthermore, you are not required or obligated to retain the services of our member firms in order to use this website. Certain state bar associations may consider an The Legal Examiner membership to be a form of advertising, and require that we inform our users that the hiring of a lawyer is an important decision that should not be based solely on advertisement. Such a decision should only be made after the review and careful consideration of a firm's experience and qualifications.</p>

<p>While we make every reasonable effort to provide useful, timely and accurate information, we cannot guarantee the correctness of this information, nor can we guarantee that we carry information on every conceivable injury subject. In addition, Although we closely monitor government agency initiated product recalls, alerts and warnings, we may from time to time be unaware of certain recalls and safety alerts, and encourage you to be vigilant in your research and use of information provided by government regulatory agencies such as the <a title="FDA" href="http://www.fda.gov/">FDA.</a></p>

<p>This site is not designed to and does not provide medical advice, professional diagnosis, opinion, treatment or services or otherwise engage in the practice of medicine, to you or to any other individual. Please use this information to help in your conversation with your physician. This is general information and always seek the advice of your physician or other qualified health provider with any questions you may have regarding a medical condition.
