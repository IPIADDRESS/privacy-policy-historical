<p>As is true of all licensed attorneys, a duty of confidentiality governs the attorneys associated with InjuryBoard.

The&nbsp;<a title="American Bar Association" href="http://www.abanet.org/">American Bar Association</a>&nbsp;defines the duty of confidentiality as follows:</p>
<p><em><u>Rule 1.6 Confidentiality of Information</u></em></p>
<p><i>(a) A lawyer shall not reveal information relating to representation of a client unless the client consents after consultation, except for disclosures that are impliedly authorized in order to carry out the representation, and except as stated in paragraph (b).</i></p>
<p><em>(b) A lawyer may reveal such information to the extent the lawyer reasonably believes necessary:</em></p>
<p><em>(1) To prevent the client from committing a criminal act that the lawyer believes is likely to result in imminent death or substantial bodily harm; or</em></p>
<p><em>(2) to establish a claim or defense on behalf of the lawyer in a controversy between the lawyer and the client, to establish a defense to a criminal charge or civil claim against the lawyer based upon conduct in which the client was involved, or to respond to allegations in any proceeding concerning the lawyer's representation of a client.</em></p>
