          Your privacy is important to Inmarsat. This privacy statement (together with our terms
          of use and other documents referred to on it) sets out the basics on which any
          personal information we collect from you, or that you provide to us via the Inmarsat
          website, will be processed by us. 
     </p><p>
          The Inmarsat plc group of companies have registrations under the data protection laws
          in the United Kingdom and take all reasonable care to prevent any unauthorised access
          to your personal data. 
     </p><p><strong>Information we may collect from you</strong><br>
          In general, you can visit our website home page and browse our site without telling
          us who you are and without revealing any information about yourself.
     </p><p>
          If you have an enquiry or require information from Inmarsat, you may choose to give
          us personal information, such as your name and contact details, to enable us to correspond
          with you in this regard. To enable us to respond to your enquiry, your details may
          need to be shared with Inmarsat Partners, those companies and organisations that are
          recognised by Inmarsat as distributors of its services and solutions. This may mean
          that your information is transferred to countries outside the European Economic Area. 
     </p><p>
          When we collect personal information from you in connection with an enquiry, we may
          extract some information about that query in an anonymous format and combine it with
          other anonymous information for marketing and advertising purposes. This anonymous
          information is used and analysed only at an aggregate level to help us to understand
          trends and patterns. None of this information is reviewed at an individual level. 
     </p><p>
          When we collect personal information from you in connection with an enquiry, we will
          ask you for your consent to allow us to hold these contact details on a database for
          marketing-related purposes and for the provision of offers of related services which
          we believe may be of interest to you. 
     </p><p>
          We may retain details of your visits to our website including, but not limited to,
          traffic data, location data, web logs and other communication data, whether this is
          required for our own specified purposes or otherwise, and the resources that you access. 
     </p><p>
          We will only use your personal information in a way that is fair (with reference to
          the purposes which are either disclosed to you or are relevant to the reason for your
          giving us the information). 
     </p><p><strong>IP addresses and cookies</strong><br>
          We may collect information about your computer, including where available your IP
          address, operating system and browser type, for system administration and to report
          aggregate information to our advertisers. This is statistical data about our users'
          browsing actions and patterns, and does not identify any individual. 
     </p><p>
          For the same reason, we may obtain information about your general internet usage by
          using a cookie file which is stored on the hard drive of your computer. Cookies contain
          information that is transferred to your computer's hard drive. They help us to improve
          our site and to deliver a better and more personalised service. They enable us: 
     </p><ul><li>
               To estimate our audience size and usage pattern.<br></li><li>
               To store information about your preferences, and so allow us to customise our site
               according to your individual interests.<br></li><li>
               To speed up your searches.<br></li><li>
               To recognise you when you return to our site. 
          </li></ul><p>
          You may refuse to accept cookies by activating the setting on your browser which allows
          you to refuse the setting of cookies. However, if you select this setting you may
          be unable to access certain parts of our site. Unless you have adjusted your browser
          setting so that it will refuse cookies, our system will issue cookies when you log
          on to our site. 
     </p><p><strong>Where we store your personal data</strong><br>
          The data that we collect from you may be transferred to, and stored at, a destination
          outside the European Economic Area ("EEA"). It may also be processed by staff operating
          outside the EEA who work for us or for one of our suppliers. Such staff maybe engaged
          in, among other things, the fulfilment of your order, the processing of your payment
          details and the provision of support services. By submitting your personal data, you
          agree to this transfer, storing or processing. We will take all steps reasonably necessary
          to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance with this privacy policy. 
     </p><p>
          All information you provide to us is stored on our servers which are security protected.&nbsp;
          Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password which enables you to
          access certain parts of our site, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential.
          We ask you not to share a password with anyone. 
     </p><p>
          Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely
          secure. Although we will do our best to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee
          the security of your data transmitted to our site; any transmission is at your own
          risk. Once we have received your information, we will use strict procedures and security
          features to try to prevent unauthorised access. 
     </p><p><strong>Disclosure of your information</strong><br>
          We may disclose your personal information to any member of our group, which means
          our subsidiaries, our ultimate parent undertaking, Inmarsat plc, and its subsidiaries,
          as defined in section 736 of the UK Companies Act 1985. 
     </p><p>
          We may disclose your personal information to third parties: 
     </p><ul><li>
               In the event that we sell or buy any business or assets, in which case we may disclose
               your personal data to the prospective seller or buyer of such business or assets. 
          </li><li>
               If the Inmarsat group of companies or substantially all of its assets are acquired
               by a third party, in which case personal data held by it about its customers will
               be one of the transferred assets. 
          </li><li>
               If we are under a duty to disclose or share your personal data in order to comply
               with any legal obligation, or in order to enforce or apply our <a href="http://www.inmarsat.com/Terms_and_conditions.aspx?language=EN&amp;textonly=False" target="_self">terms
               of use</a> and other agreements; or to protect the rights, property, or safety of
               Inmarsat Global Limited, our customers or others. This includes exchanging information
               with other companies and organisations for the purposes of fraud protection and credit
               risk reduction. 
          </li></ul><p><strong>Your rights</strong><br>
          You have the right to ask us not to process your personal data for marketing purposes.
          We will usually inform you (before collecting your data) if we intend to use your
          data for such purposes or if we intend to disclose your information to any third party
          for such purposes. You can exercise your right to prevent such processing by checking
          certain boxes on the forms we use to collect your data.&nbsp; You can also exercise
          the right at any time by contacting the Company Secretary.
