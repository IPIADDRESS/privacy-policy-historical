        Privacy practices on the web</span></p>
      <p>Your privacy is important to Inmarsat. This privacy statement discloses 
        the personal information practices for the Inmarsat Limited website.</p>
      <p>In general, you can visit our website home page and browse our site without 
        telling us who you are and without revealing any information about yourself. 
        You may choose to give us personal information, such as your name and 
        address, to enable us to correspond with you.</p>
      <p>We may collect any personal information that you volunteer while using 
        our services for standard purposes including administration, marketing, 
        customer services and the provision of offers of related services.</p>
      <p>We will only use your personal information in a way that is fair (with 
        reference to the purposes which are either disclosed to you or are relevant 
        to the reason for your giving us the information). We may share your information 
        with our subsidiary companies, organisations who are our business partners 
        or with other organisations where necessary to provide the services or 
        products which you requested when providing us with your information. 
        This may mean that your information is transferred to countries outside 
        the European Economic Area.</p>
      <p>When we collect personal data from you in connection with an enquiry, 
        we may extract some information about that query in an anonymous format 
        and combine it with other anonymous information for marketing and advertising 
        purposes. This anonymous information is used and analysed only at an aggregate 
        level to help us to understand trends and patterns. None of this information 
        is reviewed at an individual level.</p>
      <p>Inmarsat Limited is registered under the data protection laws in the
