This will depend upon the service you require. However we will never pass on these details other than for the purpose for which they were provided to Invest NI. This may also involve the transfer of details outside the European Economic Area to our overseas offices, for those who require the services of these offices. </p>
<p>Occasionally we may share information with other public bodies that provide economic development activities and whose services we feel would benefit those Clients who operate in the relevant area that the agency is providing a service.</p>

In addition, a number of our programmes/events will involve participation of External Delivery Organisations. If we could not share personal information with these organisations then your participation in the relevant programme/event would not be possible.
