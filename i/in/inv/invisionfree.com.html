    <td> <p><b>InvisionFree Privacy Policy:</b><br>
        Your privacy is of the utmost importance to InvisionFree. We have limited 
        the ammount and type of personal information that we need from you. We 
        wish for you to be fully informed of how your information is gathered 
        and used. <br>
        <br>
        <b>1. What information does InvisionFree gather:</b><br>
        When you register as a member on a board hosted by InvisionFree you need 
        to provide an email address, pick a username, and pick a password. The 
        username you choose does not have to be your real name. Your chosen password 
        is protected. The email address you provide can be used to allow members 
        to contact you and for InvisionFree to send important notices to you. 
        You may choose to disable features that can send you emails. InvisionFree 
        also collects other technical information such as IP addresses and the 
        date and time of your visit. Administrators of each board do have the 
        ability to view your IP address if you post messages on their board.<br>
        <b>2. How we use the information:</b><br>
        The email address you provide is used by us to validate your board/account 
        registration. We may also send important notices or warnings via email. 
        InvisionFree will never sell or spam your email address. Any survey you 
        fill out is used to provide better ads or improve our services. No information 
        provided through a survey is linked to you as an individual. All other 
        information you provide is either optional or will enhance a boards features. 
        InvisionFree reserves the right to disclose any information if we believe 
        that a law has been violated. InvisionFree may transfer the information 
        in our possession if Invisionfree is sold or merges. We may disclose group 
        statistics to our sponsors and advertisers. No personal information will 
        be given to third parties. Your email address will never be given to an 
        advertiser. <br>
        <b>3. How we protect your information:</b><br>
        We have strict policies againt spam mail being sent to you from an InvisionFree 
        free board. Many features are in place to prevent spam from ever being 
        sent. In addition if any member or board is caught sending spam their 
        account will be deleted. All passwords stored are encrypted and can never 
        be seen. We have taken several steps towards securing your information. 
        These security features are present in the server and on your board.<br>
        <b>4. Cookies:</b><br>
        Cookies are used to enhanced your board visit. You may disable cookies 
        if you wish. Our ad providers may also use cookies to rotate banner ads.
