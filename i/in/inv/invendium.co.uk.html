    and its web sites</a> (together "Invendium) will track the domains from which 
    people visit Invendium and analyze this data for trends and statistics. 
    Subject to the provisions of this Privacy Policy, <a class="sites2" href="portfolio.php">different Invendium sites</a> 
    may use accumulated data for different purposes, including but not limited 
    to marketing analysis, service evaluation and planning. <br>
    <br>
    Invendium contains links to other websites, whether owned or controlled by 
    Invendium, affiliates or unrelated third parties. Invendium is not 
    responsible for the privacy policies and practices of any linked website 
    outside its ownership. <br>
    <br>
    Currently, Invendium uses personal information as a basis for notifications 
    to users, "opt-in" emails, and in order to implement the terms of the Terms 
    of Service governing the website (the "TOS"). User names and email addresses 
    (as well as any additional information that a user may choose to post) are 
    publicly available on the Invendium site, unless a user elects to "opt-out" 
    of such display of personal information. However, in cases where users 
    voluntarily and publicly disclose personal information which may contain 
    Registration Data, or otherwise post personal information in conjunction 
    with content subject to an open source license, such personal information 
    necessarily will be disclosed subject to the terms of the applicable 
    license. <br>
    <br>
    Subject to the foregoing, Invendium may conduct surveys of other studies of 
    its customer base and usage for marketing and planning purposes. With 
    respect to information collected from such surveys or studies, and in the 
    event that responses are to be publicly disclosed, users will be notified at 
    the time they take the survey and Invendium will disclose only aggregate 
    information regarding its users and not personal information identifying any 
    specific individual. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in cases where surveys 
    allow users to submit written comments, and where Invendium advises users of 
    the possibility of such disclosure at the time they take the survey, 
    Invendium reserves the right to disclose text information provided by any 
    user through such a survey, provided that no personal information 
    identifying that user is disclosed. <br>
    <br>
    <b>Cookies: </b><br>
    Invendium employs "cookies" to provide a user with tailored information. A 
    "cookie" is an element of data which a Service or site, when visited by a 
    user, sends to that user's browser which, in turn, may store that element on 
    the user's hard drive or memory. Invendium uses cookies to better serve 
    users who use our Services. <span lang="en-gb">&nbsp;</span>However, at his or her option and at his or her sole expense and 
    responsibility, any user may block or delete our cookies from his or her 
    hard drive. However, by disabling cookies, certain site features and 
    functionality may no longer work properly, or at all. <br>
    <br>
    <b>"Opt-in" Emails: </b><br>
    Users may "opt-in" to receive site notifications, newsletters or other 
    information via email. Users may remove themselves from such services at 
    their discretion. Any email sent to an "opt-in" list will include directions 
    for how a user may remove him or herself from the list, or a URL where the 
    user may find such directions. <br>
    <br>
    <b>Other Notification: </b><br>
    In order to implement or enforce the Terms of Service of the relevant 
    Invendium site, Invendium may use personal information to contact users on 
    an individual basis. <br>
    <br>
    <b>Profiles: </b><br>
    In some cases, users' personal information may be publicly available through 
    a user's profile display.&nbsp; In cases where site profiles allow 
    users to display optional information publicly, such entry and display is at 
    the user's discretion and may be changed at any time by the user.<br>
    <br>
    <b>Email Display: </b><br>
    In some cases, users may have the opportunity to use an Invendium service to 
    send electronic mail to another user or email list. In such cases, a user's 
    valid email address and real name will be included with such messages. In 
    order to prevent abuse, users may not opt-out of such a display, but may 
    choose to refrain from using said Service to transmit an email message. <br>
    <br>
    <b>General: </b><br>
    In cases where users voluntarily and publicly disclose personal information 
    which may contain Registration Data or otherwise post personal information 
    in conjunction with content subject to an open source license, such personal 
    information necessarily will be disclosed subject to the terms of the 
    applicable license. An example of such a disclosure includes, but is not 
    limited to, a user's disclosure of personal information as part of a message 
    posted to a public message forum or a publicly-released software 
    application. <br>
    <br>
    At no time, unless such disclosure is required by law or a user specifically 
    authorizes such disclosure, will Invendium disclose individual user personal 
    information that is not publicly available to unrelated third parties. <br>
    <br>
    <b>Surveys and Resulting Information: </b><br>
    Subject to the foregoing, Invendium may conduct surveys or other studies of 
    its customer base and usage for marketing and planning purposes. 
    Participation in such surveys is at the user's option; Invendium does not 
    conduct mandatory surveys. <br>
    <br>
    With respect to information collected from such surveys or studies, and in 
    the event that responses are to be publicly disclosed, users will be 
    notified at the time they take the survey and Invendium will disclose only 
    aggregate information regarding its users and not personal information 
    identifying any specific individual. Circumstances under which Invendium 
    would publicly disclose such aggregate information include, but are not 
    limited to, sharing survey results with the site population, providing data 
    to Invendium advertisers on user preferences and/or demographics, and 
    publicizing overall usage data in press communications. <br>
    <br>
    Notwithstanding the foregoing, in cases where surveys allow users to submit 
    written comments, and where Invendium advises users of the possibility of 
    such disclosure at the time they take the survey, Invendium reserves the 
    right to disclose text information provided by any user through such a 
    survey, provided that no personal information identifying that user is 
    disclosed. <br>
    <br>
    <b>Access With regard to personal information:</b><br>
    Users can view their data on their personal profile page. When technically 
    feasible, users are permitted to update their personal information directly 
    through the Invendium service. When such updating service is not technically 
    feasible, Invendium will make reasonable efforts to assist users in updating 
    their personal information. <br>
    <br>
    <b>Security</b> </p>
    <p style="line-height: 150%; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">To secure site 
    integrity Invendium employs reasonable security measures and procedures. 
    Internal access to users' private and nonpublic personal information is 
    restricted to site administrators and individuals on a need-to-know basis.
    <br>
    <br>
    <b>Enforcement</b><br>
    In the event that Invendium becomes aware that site security is compromised 
    or user nonpublic information has been disclosed to unrelated third parties 
    as a result of external activity, including but not limited to external 
    security attacks, Invendium shall take reasonable measures which it deems 
    appropriate, including but not limited to internal investigation and 
    reporting, and notification to and cooperation with law enforcement 
    authorities. <br>
    <br>
    If Invendium becomes aware that a user's personal information provided to 
    Invendium has been disclosed in a manner not permitted by this Privacy 
    Policy, Invendium shall make reasonable efforts to notify the affected user, 
    as soon as reasonably possible and as permitted by law, of what information 
    has been disclosed, to the extent that Invendium knows this information. <br>
    <br>
    <b>Updates to the Privacy Policy </b></p>

    privacy policy, we will both post the changed version and its effective date
