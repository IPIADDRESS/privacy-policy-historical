        <b>What is covered by this Policy?</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>        Invoca (“Invoca” “we” or “us”) provides pay-per-call services, using unique phone numbers and other forms of call tracking used in both<br>
        online and offline advertising. Using unique phone numbers with personalization components, database management, and our proprietary and confidential<br>
        systems we provide networks, advertisers, agencies, publishers (directly and indirectly, our “clients”), and consumers with pay-per-call features and<br>
        services that are unmatched in our industry.
    </p>
<p>
        We recognize that privacy is important, and our collection and use of information is limited to what is necessary to create innovative and reliable<br>
        services for our clients, without compromising the individual privacy of consumers. This policy covers data collected through our website, <a href="http://www.invoca.com">www.invoca.com</a> and data collected through our services.
    </p>
<p>
        <b>CONSUMER PRIVACY</b>
    </p>
<p>
        <b>What information does Invoca collect about consumers?</b>
    </p>
<p>
        <i>General</i><br>
        <br>
        When a consumer uses our services, for example, by calling a unique phone number associated with one of our advertiser clients, we will collect their<br>
        personal information if it is made available to us by the consumer or by a third party. This information includes limited personal data such as the<br>
        caller’s name, address, phone number and email address. We will not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of thirteen.
    </p>
<p>
        <i>User-supplied Information</i><br>
        <br>
        We and our clients, for example, an advertiser, may set up order forms, questionnaires, or other mechanisms through which a consumer may be asked to<br>
        provide certain information either online or via telephone or other communications medium. Participation is purely voluntary, and any consumer not<br>
        wanting to participate may decline or terminate contact (e.g., navigate away from the web page or hang up the phone).
    </p>
<p>
        If such mechanisms are initiated by one of our clients outside of our services and our clients collect the information themselves, we cannot be<br>
        responsible for that information, although we will endeavor to ensure that such clients maintain reasonable and appropriate privacy policies.
    </p>
<p>
        In addition, we may receive from clients email addresses and telephone numbers of consumers for various purposes, for example, facilitating an outbound<br>
        marketing campaign. Prior to obtaining any such information, we will require assurances from our clients that such information was obtained rightfully,<br>
        and we must rely on those assurances in delivering our services.
    </p>
<p>
        <b>Usage Information</b>
    </p>
<p>
        <i>Web services</i><br>
        <br>
        When a consumer responds to or views an internet advertisement served by a Invoca client (such as through third-party web sites or email<br>
        solicitation) or visits a Invoca site, we may send one or more cookies (an anonymous, unique identifier) to the consumer’s computer to uniquely<br>
        identify that consumer’s browser. Like most companies doing business on the internet, we use cookies to improve the quality of our services by storing<br>
        user preferences, tracking user trends, determining how our services are used and navigated. Most cookies are automatically deleted at the end of a<br>
        session at the Web Site. While we may use what are commonly described as “persistent” cookies that remain on a specific browser after termination of a<br>
        session, any consumer may set their browser to refuse cookies or automatically clear cookies after termination of a session. Cookies we service on<br>
        third party web sites only collect data in the aggregate.
    </p>
<p>
        <i>Phone services</i><br>
        <br>
        We provide our clients unique telephone numbers to utilize on a web site, email, mobile or offline promotion. This enables us to both determine what<br>
        the consumer was looking at when making a telephone call and personalize the experience for that consumer. Our phone servers automatically collect the<br>
        caller ID results when a consumer calls the number, and we may also occasionally collect other usage information from third-party databases, including<br>
        the name and/or the address of the caller when available.
    </p>
<p>
        In addition, our phone servers use software that may be employed on behalf of an advertiser to record calls. This recorded information may be evaluated<br>
        in order to determine the quality of that call from the advertiser’s perspective and for training or other purposes. This enables us to identify high-quality<br>
        calls and collect additional usage data we can use to provide our clients with improved services and sales. We may also use third-party<br>
        services or technology for the transcription or analysis of such information. In the event we record a call on behalf of an advertiser, we will ensure<br>
        that call participants are advised of the existence and intent of the recording in a manner consistent with applicable state and federal laws. We are<br>
        not responsible in any way for the accuracy or validity of the content of any such recordings, and we take no steps to evaluate such accuracy or<br>
        validity.
    </p>
<p>
        While we strongly encourage clients to adopt responsible approaches to marketing, we are not responsible for the information practices of clients or<br>
        their partners. The collection, use, and disclosure of information by clients and partners are subject to their respective privacy policies, which may<br>
        differ from Invoca’s policy.
    </p>
<p>
        <b>Reasons for collecting usage information</b><br>
        <br>
        We may collect usage information when an internet user clicks on a link, creates a lead, initiates a phone call, receives a phone call, makes a<br>
        purchase on an advertiser’s web site, sends us a text message, receives a text message from us, or makes an inquiry or a purchase during a phone call<br>
        to an advertiser. We collect this information primarily for the purpose of paying third-parties commissions and also to optimize and personalize the<br>
        internet and phone user’s experience. If the internet user re-visits the advertiser’s site directly, or if the phone user calls the advertiser using<br>
        the unique phone number again, Invoca is able to continue to track the user’s activities on the advertiser’s site and compensate the third party<br>
        that referred the user. We reserve the right to retain all data as long as may be reasonably necessary for accounting and audit purposes.
    </p>
<p>
        Like most standard Web site servers, we use log files to collect Internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, Internet service provider (ISP),<br>
        referring/exit pages, platform type, and date/time stamp. We may use the information to analyze site usage, administer the site, understand usage and<br>
        navigation trends in aggregate, and determine the relevance of content.
    </p>
<p>
        We also may develop predictive statistical user profiles of consumers’ needs and interests by collecting both internet browsing and online purchase<br>
        data and phone user data. For improved audience targeting, some Invoca services may use marketing technology to allow advertisers to supplement<br>
        non-personally-identifying demographic information, such as age, gender, area code, or ZIP code, to the non-identifiable profile data.
    </p>
<p>
        Invoca may collect personal information, such as consumers’ names, physical addresses, email addresses, phone numbers and other information in<br>
        order to better target campaigns to meet user’s interests and to provide customized experiences. We will share this information only as described<br>
        herein.
    </p>
<p>
        <b>Does Invoca share consumers’ personal information with others?</b><br>
        <br>
        We do not share consumers’ personal information we have gathered except as described below. Our clients, however, may gather personal information by<br>
        other means, especially if a consumer completes a transaction with them.
    </p>
<p>
        We only share consumers’ personal information with companies or individuals outside of Invoca in the following limited circumstances:
    </p>
<ul type="disc">
<li>
            We have the consumer’s consent. We require opt-in consent for the sharing of any sensitive personal information.
        </li>
<li>
            We provide such information to our subsidiaries, affiliated companies, or other trusted businesses or persons for the purpose of processing<br>
            personal information on our behalf. We will require these parties to agree to process such information based on our instructions and in compliance<br>
            with this privacy policy and other appropriate confidentiality and security measures.
        </li>
<li>
            We provide such information to our clients to enable them to better provide consumers with information about products or services about which the<br>
            consumer may be inquiring.
        </li>
<li>
            We may share personal information with our affiliates and other third parties to provide consumers with goods or services requested by them.
        </li>
</ul>
<p>
        Invoca may also share personal information in connection with the sale, merger, consolidation, change in control, transfer of substantial asset,<br>
        reorganization or liquidation of Invoca.
    </p>
<p>
        Finally, Invoca may release personal information when we believe release is appropriate to respond to a subpoena or otherwise comply with the<br>
        law; enforce or apply our Terms and Conditions and other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of Invoca or others. This<br>
        includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection.
    </p>
<p>
        <b>Can a consumer “opt-out” of providing information?</b><br>
        <br>
        For consumers accessing our services through the internet, some of our cookies may have an “opt-out” option. This process does not remove the Invoca cookie from a consumer’s system; it simply replaces it with an opt-out cookie that does not contain any unique identifiers.
    </p>
<p>
        Some of our cookies do not have an “opt-out” option, but consumers always have the option of blocking the use of cookies by changing a setting in their<br>
        Internet browser.
    </p>
<p>
        Invoca does not maintain a process for an individual consumer to opt-out of a Invoca ad serving cookie. However, any consumer may set their<br>
        browser to refuse cookies or automatically clear cookies after termination of a session.
    </p>
<p>
        With regard to phone services, consumers are able to submit their phone numbers to “do-not-call” registries. We will use our best efforts to observe<br>
        do-not-call registries in any outbound calling campaign we perform or facilitate, provided that consumers who have opted-in to receive such messages,<br>
        either with a client or with us, shall not be subject to any do-not-call restriction.
    </p>
<p>
        We may partner with third-party ad networks to either display advertising on our Web site or to manage our advertising on other sites.  Our ad network<br>
        partner(s) may use cookies and Web beacons to collect non-personal information about your activities on this and other Web sites to provide you<br>
        targeted advertising based upon your interests.  If you wish to not have this information used for the purpose of serving you targeted ads, you may<br>
        opt-out by clicking here <a href="http://preferences.truste.com/truste/">http://preferences.truste.com/truste/</a>.  Please note this does not opt you<br>
        out of being served advertising.  You will continue to receive generic ads.
    </p>
<p>
        <b>Can a consumer access the personal information acquired by Invoca?</b><br>
        <br>
        Invoca’s services are not directed towards individual consumers, and we are collecting personal information on behalf of our clients to provide<br>
        them a service. Therefore, we do not maintain a process for an individual consumer to review and/or request changes to any personal information<br>
        collected.
    </p>
<p>
        Except as provided below, we do not maintain a process for an individual consumer to access his or her personal information.
    </p>
<p>
        <b>CLIENT PRIVACY</b>
    </p>
<p>
        <b>What information does Invoca collect from its clients (e.g., networks, agencies, advertisers and publishers)?</b><br>
        <br>
        We may collect personal information from all of our clients (e.g., networks, agencies, advertisers, and publishers. The collection of this information<br>
        is a part of our normal business practices. Advertisers or their representatives will be asked to provide personal information through the sign up and<br>
        registration process either directly or through a network or agency partner.  This information may include name, address, phone number, hours of<br>
        operation, coverage areas and email address.  Additionally, we may collect sensitive personal information such as social security number and tax ID<br>
        number.
    </p>
<p>
        In addition, we will use cookies, third party tracking technologies such as scripts, log files and unique phone numbers to optimize and personalize the<br>
        clients’ experience and allow us to monitor those services and usage patterns.  Both our cookies and third party tracking technologies are not linked<br>
        to personal information.
    </p>
<p>
        When using our service, clients may enter third party personal information such as other user’s email on the platform. This information is only used to<br>
        provide the client access to the system and for no other purpose.
    </p>
<p>
        <b>How does Invoca use its clients’ information?</b><br>
        <br>
        Much of the information collected from clients is principally intended for administrative needs (e.g. accounting and performance reporting), for which<br>
        purpose such data are required.
    </p>
<p>
        While we strongly encourage clients to adopt responsible approaches to online marketing, we are not responsible for the information practices of<br>
        clients or their partners. The collection, use, and disclosure of information by clients and partners are subject to their respective privacy policies,<br>
        which may differ from Invoca’s policy.
    </p>
<p>
        Periodically we may use clients’ information to communicate via email newsletters or other avenues to offer strategic marketing information and other<br>
        communications to assist in business related activities. Our clients can elect to opt-out from future communications by clicking on the unsubscribe<br>
        link in the email.
    </p>
<p>
        Except as otherwise agreed, we will keep all personal data provided by individual clients in strict confidence and will treat such data with the same<br>
        level of respect and care that we treat our own proprietary information and trade secrets. We do not sell, rent, exchange or barter any personal client<br>
        information to or with any third party for financial gain or marketing purposes. We may, from time to time, provide personal information to certain<br>

        <b>Can a client “opt-out” of providing information?</b><br>
        <br>
        Collecting information from our clients is required as a part of doing business. Invoca’s primary intent in collecting information is for<br>
        administrative purposes including accounting and reporting. However, we may periodically use information for marketing and communication purposes<br>
        targeted to our clients. Clients wishing not to receive such communications may do so by informing their designated Invoca representative in<br>
        writing at any time or by clicking on the unsubscribe link in the promotional communication.
    </p>
<p>
        When a client logs on to any browser-based Invoca reporting system, a cookie is placed within their computer. The cookie allows us to validate<br>
        the client’s identity and maintain the security and privacy of the client’s account data. This cookie does not contain any personal information.  It is<br>
        required to log into Invoca’s reporting systems and there is no method to opt-out of this cookie.

            How does Invoca protect the security of personal information?<br>
            <br>
        </b><br>
        Invoca takes appropriate security measures to protect against unauthorized access to or unauthorized alteration, disclosure or destruction of<br>
        data. Any data stored on our servers is treated as proprietary and confidential and is not available to the public. We restrict access to personal<br>
        information to those employees or third parties who have a need to know such information for the purpose of effectively delivering Invoca<br>
        products and services by means of user login and password requirements. We routinely evaluate our data security practices to identify security threats<br>
        or opportunities for improvement.
    </p>
<p>
        No transmission of data over the Internet or even the phones is guaranteed to be completely secure. It may be possible for third parties not under the<br>
        control of Invoca to intercept or access transmissions or private communications unlawfully. While we strive to protect your personal<br>
        information, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us.
    </p>

        <b><br>
            How are changes made to the Privacy Policy?<br>
            <br>
        </b><br>
        We may find it necessary or be legally obligated to update this Privacy Policy from time to time. When we do, we will post those changes on this page<br>
        and update the effective date so that everyone is aware of the information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances we disclose it.<br>
        Except as otherwise required by law, modifications to this Privacy Policy will not affect the privacy of data collected by Invoca prior to the<br>
        effective date of the policy change.

            What are Invoca’s policies regarding children and SPAM?<br>
            <br>
        </b><br>
        Our services are not developed for or directed at children. Children (persons under the age of 18) are not eligible to do business with us, and we do<br>
        not collect personal information from any person we actually know is under the age of 13. If you believe your child has provided Invoca with any<br>
        personally identifiable data, please contact us at <a href="mailto:legal@invoca.com" target="_blank">legal@invoca.com</a> to have them removed.
    </p>
<p>
        Invoca is committed to proper Internet practices and full compliance with the CAN-SPAM Act of 2003 (15 U.S.C. § 7701). It is our policy to<br>
        prohibit the sending of unsolicited or “Spam” e-mail by Invoca or any of its marketing partners.
    </p>
<p>
        Please note that under the CAN-SPAM Act, an advertiser is required to provide an opt-out mechanism for consumers to unsubscribe from future emails<br>
        about the advertiser.

             Safe Harbor Compliance<br>
            <br>
        </b><br>
      The European Union (“EU”) maintains strict privacy laws. These rules differ significantly from U.S. laws. To reconcile these differences,<br>
      the United States and the EU have created a Safe Harbor that defines mutually acceptable privacy operations for personal data transferred from the EU to the United States.<br>
      The U.S. and Switzerland have created a similar, but separate Safe Harbor that defines mutually acceptable privacy operations for personal data transferred from Switzerland to the United States.<br>
      Invoca, Inc. complies with the U.S. – E.U. Safe Harbor Framework and U.S – Swiss Safe Harbor Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use and retention of personal<br>
      data from the European Union and Switzerland. Information regarding both the Safe Harbor Frameworks can be found at: <a href="http://export.gov/safeharbor">http://export.gov/safeharbor</a>.
