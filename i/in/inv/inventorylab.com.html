				<p>Please note that InventoryLab Inc.'s business activity does not fall within GDPR guidelines; therefore, this privacy policy does not infer compliance with GDPR regulations.</p>
				<p>This Privacy Policy describes InventoryLab's and its subsidiaries (collectively "InventoryLab"),  practices regarding the collection, and the use and disclosure of the information we collect from and about you when you use InventoryLab's web-based and mobile applications (the "Service"). We take our obligations regarding your privacy seriously and have made every effort to draft this Privacy Policy in a manner that is clear and easy for you to understand. By accessing or using the Service, you agree to this Privacy Policy and our End User License Agreement and Terms of Service.</p>
				
				<h4>Our Collection and Use of Information You Provide to Us</h4>				
				
				<p>In order to set up a user account for use of the Service, we collect personal information, such as your name, address, phone number, email address, payment information, and Amazon account data when you register for an account on the Service. You may also provide us with optional information such as a photograph, your user name, and any optional profile information that you elect to associate with your account is referred to herein as your "Profile Information." InventoryLab maintains this information indefinitely for record purposes.</p>
				
				<p>If you are a user of our paid Service, we will utilize a third party credit card payment processing company to collect payment information, including your credit card number, billing address, and phone number. We will share this payment information with the third party processing company as detailed below in "How We Share Your Information: With Trusted Service Providers And Business Partners." We do not store your payment information.</p>
				
				<p>We may use your email address to send you Service-related notices (including any notices required by law, in lieu of communication by postal mail). We may also use your email address to send you announcements and information about other products or services (including third-party services) that you may be interested in (together, the "Marketing Messages"). You may opt-out of receiving Marketing Messages at any time by following the instructions provided in the Marketing Message. Through your account interface, you may also opt-out of receiving categories of Service-related notices that are not deemed by InventoryLab to be integral to your use of the Service.</p>
				
				<p>Even if you are not a registered user of our Service, if you email us we may retain a record of such email communication, including your email address, the content of your email, and our response indefinitely.</p>
				
				<p>If you choose to use our invitation service to invite a friend to the Service, we will ask you for that person's contact information, which may include their email address or their social network identity, and automatically send an invitation. InventoryLab stores the information you provide to send the invitation, to register your friend if your invitation is accepted, and to track the success of our invitation service.</p>
				
				<h4>Your Content</h4>

				<p>Your use of the Service will involve you uploading or inputting various content into the Service; including but not limited to: tasks, attachments, project names, team names, and conversations (together, the "Content").</p>

				<p>You control how your Content is shared with others via your settings on the Service. InventoryLab may view your Content only as necessary (i) to maintain, provide and improve the Service; (ii) to resolve a support request from you; (iii) if we have a good faith belief, or have received a complaint alleging, that such Content is in violation of our Acceptable Use Guidelines; (iv) as reasonably necessary to allow InventoryLab to comply with or avoid the violation of applicable law or regulation; or (v) to comply with a valid legal subpoena or request that meets the requirements of our Law Enforcement Guidelines. We may also analyze the Content in aggregate and on an anonymized basis, in order to better understand the manner in which our Service is being used.
				</p>
				
				<h4>Information We Collect Automatically</h4>

				<p>We use technologies like cookies and pixel tags to provide, monitor, analyze, promote, and improve the Service. For example, a cookie is used to remember your user name when you return to the Service and to improve our understanding of how you interact with the Service. You can block cookies on your web browser; however, please be aware that some features of the Service may not function properly if the ability to accept cookies is disabled. While we collect this information automatically, at no time is your personal information ever used to make automated decisions for the Service provided or the Company as a whole.</p>

				<h4>Embedded Content</h4>

				<p>This site may include embedded content (e.g. videos, images, articles, etc.). Embedded content from other websites behaves in the exact same way as if the visitor has visited the other website.</p>

				<p>These websites may collect data about you, use cookies, embed additional third-party tracking, and monitor your interaction with that embedded content, including tracing your interaction with the embedded content if you have an account and are logged in to that website.</p>
				
				<h4>Log Files</h4>

				<p>When you use the Service, our servers automatically record certain information in server logs. These server logs may include information such as your web request, Internet Protocol ("IP") address, browser type, referring/exit pages and URLs, number of clicks and how you interact with links on the Service, domain names, landing pages, pages viewed, mobile carrier, and other such information. Log files help us to monitor, analyze, improve, and maintain the Service and to diagnose and fix any Service-related issues.</p>
				
				<h4>Device Identifiers</h4>

				<p>When you access the Service using a mobile device, we collect specific device information contained in your mobile device's "device identifier." This device identifier includes information such as the type of device you are using, its operating system, and mobile network information, which may include your mobile phone number. We may associate this device identifier with your Service account and will use data associated with your device identifier to customize our Services to your device and to analyze any device-related issues.</p>
				
				<h4>Location Information</h4>

				<p>We may collect and process information about the location of the device from which you are accessing the Service. Location data may convey information about how you browse the Service and may be used in conjunction with personally identifiable information.

				<p>The security of your information is important to us. When you enter sensitive information (such as a credit card number) as part of our service, we encrypt the transmission of that information using industry-standard encryption.</p>

				<p>InventoryLab uses commercially reasonable and industry-standard physical, managerial, and technical safeguards to preserve the integrity and security of your information. For example, we continuously and regularly back up your data to help prevent data loss and aid in data recovery. We also guard against common web attack vectors, host data in secure SAS 70 audited data centers, and implement firewalls and access restrictions on our servers to secure our network and better protect your information.</p>
