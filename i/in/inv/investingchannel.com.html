		<p>InvestingChannel, Inc. is committed to protecting your privacy. The following statement describes InvestingChannel’s privacy policy as it relates to InvestingChannel's services, including ad placements, advertising, marketing and lead generation.</p><h3>User Information</h3><p>Non-personally identifiable information is information that, by itself, cannot be tracked to a specific individual.&nbsp; InvestingChannel may collect non-personally identifiable information while you are visiting an InvestingChannel Web site or the Web site of one of InvestingChannel’s customers, including advertisers and Web publishers.&nbsp; With each advertising impression served, InvestingChannel collects information such as the time of day, URL visited, browser type, browser language, and IP address. InvestingChannel analyzes certain web pages of those publisher websites within our network. InvestingChannel may use page content, form data and URL parameters in order to improve its service to the users. In addition, the visited URL is sent to InvestingChannel's servers from the browser so that InvestingChannel may retrieve the applicable page content from the publisher's servers. </p><p>As part of our on-going efforts to ensure the best possible experience, we may use any number of features, including Web beacons and cookies, to collect non-personally identifiable information. Web beacons, also known as clear gif technology or action tags, are small colorless image files placed on a Web page for the purpose of tracking the completion of transactions and the submittal of applications, which, in turn, enhances the online experience for our users. </p><p>Similarly, a Cookie is a file that the Internet browser places on your computer's hard drive. It is not a virus and cannot erase your hard drive or otherwise damage your computer. A cookie controls the delivery rate of ads to Web browsers such that the number of times a Web browser receives any one advertisement is limited to ensure the best online experience for our users. A cookie also allows InvestingChannel reporting system to estimate the total reach of an ad campaign so that our advertisers can determine with greater accuracy the composition of the audience they reach.</p><p>Neither Web beacons nor cookies provide InvestingChannel with an email address or any other personally-identifiable information, and InvestingChannel does not and cannot use Web beacons or cookies to recover such information from the computers of our users. Again, InvestingChannel simply collects non-personally identifiable information for the limited purpose of optimizing the operation of InvestingChannel services, maintaining the quality and integrity of the services, and providing general statistics regarding our users. Although cookies enhance the online experience, Web users always have the option of blocking the use of the same by altering a setting in their browser. Please see your browser supplier's Web site for details on how this may be done if you object to the collection of non-personally identifiable information. </p><p>InvestingChannel may place advertisements of third-party advertisers on Web sites that you are visiting.&nbsp; If you choose to click on an advertisement, InvestingChannel may provide non-personally identifiable information to the advertiser and Web publisher.&nbsp; Also, the Web publisher or InvestingChannel’s other partners may use cookies, action tags, GIFs, or Web beacons to collect information when you are visiting their Web sites.&nbsp; The information they collect is governed by their individual privacy policies, not InvestingChannel’s.</p><h3>Submission of Personally Identifiable Information</h3><p>When using services offered through InvestingChannel or its customers and affiliates, you may choose to enter your name, contact information, and other personal information.&nbsp; You will have clear notification that we are collecting this information so that you can choose not to provide it.&nbsp; Users may also provide contact information while visiting investingchannel.com to request information.</p><h3>Use of the Information We Collect</h3><h3>Use of Non-Personally Identifiable Information</h3><p>InvestingChannel may use non-personally identifiable information collected to improve the quality of InvestingChannel services, for example, by increasing ad placements on Web sites that are receiving more Web traffic and presenting you with ads that we think you would be interested in viewing.&nbsp; InvestingChannel may market its services by sharing Web surfing data with business partners in such a way that you are not identified. InvestingChannel also may provide your non-personally identifiable information to companies so that they can perform services for us.</p><h3>Use of Personally Identifiable Information</h3><p>InvestingChannel&nbsp; does not provide personally identifiable information to third parties except under the following conditions.&nbsp; If you provide personally identifiable information as part of an inquiry about products or services provided by one of our business partners, we will provide that information only to that business partner so that they may attempt to provide you with information regarding the products or services you inquired about.</p><p>InvestingChannel may use the personally identifiable information provided by users or business partners at investingchannel.com for internal purposes, such as sales, human resources, marketing, and administration (e.g., billing, newsletters and communicating with our business partners and maintaining their account information).&nbsp; We may share this information with third parties who provide InvestingChannel with administrative services.&nbsp; If InvestingChannel shares any of the information collected from you with a third party, their use of that information will be governed by the third party's privacy policy.</p><h3>Advertising Content</h3><p>InvestingChannel's services display links to other sites in the form of "contextual advertising." InvestingChannel has no control over the content presented in such advertisements; third party advertisers provide them. The content of these advertisements is intended to show a high degree of relevance to the content you view. InvestingChannel parses the content of the URL visited, determines the relevant context and keywords and passes this information to the third party to obtain the advertisement to display.</p><h3>Child Protection</h3><p>InvestingChannel does not offer services to, or target, persons under the age of 18.&nbsp; In compliance with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act, any information we receive from people we believe to be minors will be purged from our database.</p><h3>Contacting the Web Site</h3><p>If you have questions or concerns regarding this policy, you should contact InvestingChannel by sending email to <a href="mailto:privacy@investingchannel.com">privacy@investingchannel.com</a> with "Privacy" in the subject line, or by writing to Privacy, InvestingChannel, Inc., 52 E. 13th St., Suite 5D, New York, New York 10003. </p><h3>Acceptance of Privacy Statement</h3><p>Your use of our Web site is subject to this privacy policy.&nbsp; BY USING OUR WEB SITE, YOU ARE ACCEPTING THE PRACTICES SET OUT IN THIS PRIVACY POLICY.&nbsp; We reserve the right to modify this privacy policy at any time by posting the changes on this page. Please check the effective date at the bottom of this page to determine if the privacy policy has been modified since you last reviewed it.&nbsp; Your continued use of our Web site following posting of the updated privacy policy will constitute your acceptance of the changes.</p><h3>Effective Date</h3><p>The privacy policy was last revised on April 2, 2008.</p>
