              <p><strong>General Information Collection and Use</strong></p>
              <p>Inventables is the sole owner of the information collected on 
                the Website. We will not sell, share or rent this information 
                to others in ways different from what is disclosed in this statement, 
                without first obtaining your consent. Information collected is 
                used to register the user for certain selected services (e.g. 
                access to the Inventables database) and to contact the user about 
                such services (e.g. e-mail address). </p>
              <p>Some of our services may be offered in conjunction with partner 
                companies, affiliates or other companies or websites with which 
                we work. In order for us to provide these services to you, it 
                may be necessary for us to share your personal information with 
                one of such entities. These parties are not allowed to use personally 
                identifiable information except for the purpose of providing these 
                services. If you do not want your data to be shared, you can choose 
                not to allow the transfer by not using that particular service.</p>
              <p><strong>Cookies</strong></p>
              <p>A "cookie" is a piece of data stored on a user's hard 
                drive containing information about the user. As part of offering 
                and providing personalized services, we may use cookies in an 
                effort to save you time while on our Website. If a user rejects 
                the cookie, he or she may still have limited use of the Website. 
                Generally we use cookies to:</p>
              <p>1. Remind us who you are and to access your account information; 
                <br>
                2. Track and target the interests of our users to enhance the 
                experience on our Website; and <br>
                3. Estimate our audience size and measure certain traffic patterns. 
              </p>
              <p><strong>IP Addresses</strong></p>
              <p>Every computer connected to the Internet is given an IP address. 
                We use IP addresses to analyze trends, administer the Website, 
                track users' movement and gather broad demographic information 
                for aggregate use. IP addresses are not linked to personally identifiable 
                information, and our web servers do not record the e-mail addresses 
                of our visitors.</p>
              <p><strong>Sharing</strong></p>
              <p>As a general rule, except as described in this privacy statement, 
                we will not disclose any of your personally identifiable information 
                except when we have your permission or under special circumstances 
                (such as when we believe the law requires it). We may disclose 
                or share aggregated demographic information with certain partners, 
                affiliates and advertisers, however, except as described above, 
                this is not linked to any personal information that can identify 
                any individual person or company. In addition, Inventables may 
                disclose account or other personal information when we have reason 
                to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, 
                contact or bring legal action against someone who may be causing 
                injury to or interference with Inventables's rights or property, 
                other Website users or anyone else that could be harmed by such 
                activities.</p>
              <p><strong>Links</strong></p>
              <p>This Website may contain links to other websites. Please be aware 
                that we are not responsible for the privacy practices of such 
                other websites, as this privacy statement applies solely to the 
                Website. We encourage our users to remain vigilant when they leave 
                our Website and to read the privacy statements of each and every 
                website that collects personally identifiable information.</p>
              <p><strong>Surveys</strong></p>
              <p>From time-to-time our Website may request information from users 
                via surveys. Participation in these surveys, to the extent we 
                run any, is completely voluntary and the user therefore has a 
                choice whether or not to disclose this information. Information 
                requested may include contact information (such as name and shipping 
                address) and demographic information (such as zip code and age 
                level). Survey information will be used for purposes of monitoring 
                or improving the use and satisfaction of the Website.</p>
              <p><strong>Security</strong></p>
              <p>All of our users' sensitive information is restricted in our 
                offices. While Inventables employs commercially reasonable security 
                measures to protect our data and seeks to partner with companies 
                which do the same, we cannot absolutely guarantee the security 
                of any data transmission over the Internet or any wireless network. 
                Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet or any wireless 
                network can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, and we therefore 
                are not responsible for any breach of security or for any actions 
                of any third parties that may receive any such information.</p>
              <p><strong>Correction/Updating Personal Information</strong></p>
              <p>If your personally identifiable information changes at any time, 
                please send an e-mail to <img src="images/support_email.gif" width="151" height="22" align="absmiddle">.</p>
              <p><strong>Choice/Opt-out</strong></p>
              <p>Our users are given the opportunity to "opt-out" of 
                receiving communications from Inventables by sending us an e-mail 
                at <img src="images/support_email.gif" width="151" height="22" align="absmiddle">.</p>
              <p><strong>Notification of Changes</strong></p>
              <p>If we decide to change our privacy statement, we will post those 
                changes under the appropriate link on the "home page" 
                of our Website so our users are always aware of what information 
                we collect, how we use it and under what circumstances, if any, 
                we disclose it. The new terms shall be effective 10 days after 
                they are initially posted on the Website. It is the responsibility 
                of each user to review the latest terms from time to time, and 
                if any user does not agree with any updates to the privacy statement, 
                such user should immediately cease use of the Website and purchased 
                services. <br>
