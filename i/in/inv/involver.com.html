<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p class="small">RapOuts, Inc. (the parent corporation of involver.com) is committed to maximizing your  experience on our website within a trusted environment. This privacy policy  explains how we collect, protect, use and share information gathered about you  online. We hope this disclosure will help increase your confidence in the  RapOuts website and enhance your experience. Please note that this privacy  policy applies only to information submitted and collected online at our  website.&nbsp; It does not apply to information that you may submit to us  offline, or to websites maintained by other companies or organizations to which  we may link.</p>
<p class="small"><strong>What types of information does RapOuts  collect and how will it be used?</strong><br>RapOuts only collects information from you on  a voluntary basis. We do not send Spam or sell email addresses. So that we can  provide you with the most efficient and enhanced experience, we request that  you register for a personal account accessible through a confidential password  and screen name that you select. For purposes of registration, we collect  identifiable information about you such as your name, email address, and  demographic information such as age, gender and zip code. We also may collect  your IP address, browser type, domain name, access times and referring website  address. This information is collecting during registration or in response to  specific requests from you, for things such as signing up for an email  newsletter, chat room, or other online information service we may offer,  entering a contest, answering a survey, or contacting us. Surveys are conducted  strictly for internal profiling purposes and only keep track of anonymous  demographic data (e.g., your age, usage of the RapOuts website, favorite  features). Our website contains links through which an online user can email  us. We collect personal information contained in the email for the purpose of  responding to a user’s questions and/or comments. From time to time, we may  post on our website job openings at RapOuts and provide an email address to  which interested applicants can submit their resume. Although we can assure you  that any personal information contained in a resume will be used solely for its  intended purpose (i.e., to evaluate the applicant’s qualifications), such  information is not subject to this privacy policy. <br>No matter what method we use to collect  information and no matter how we use that information, we will only collect the  information deemed reasonably necessary to fulfill your online requests and our  legitimate business objectives.</p>
<p class="small"><strong>RapOuts does not knowingly collect  information from children under the age of 13</strong><br>This is not a website directed to children  under the age of 13, and RapOuts does not knowingly collect personally  identifiable information from children under 13 years of age. If you are under  13 years of age you should not use this website, and under no circumstances  should you send information about yourself to RapOuts. If RapOuts discovers  that a child under the age of 13 has provided RapOuts with personally identifiable  information, RapOuts will immediately delete that child’s personally  identifiable information from the website.</p>
<p class="small"><strong>What happens if I refuse to provide my  personal information to RapOuts?</strong><br>If you choose not to submit personally  identifiable information when requested, you may not be able to access certain  areas of our website and you may considerably limit the services we can provide  you. To simply access our website, however, you do not need to give us any  personally identifiable information.<br></p>
<p class="small"><strong>Does RapOuts use cookies or other  means to collect information?</strong><br>You  will know when personally identifiable information is collected because you  will be asked to fill out a form. However, we may collect some information  about you by using data collection technology, so that it may not be readily  apparent to you that it is being collected. For instance, when you come to our  website, your IP address is collected so that we know where to send information  you are requesting. An IP address is a number that is used by computers on the  network to identify your computer every time you log on to the Internet. A  "cookie" is a small file or record-keeping device that websites often  store on a user's computer. (You can disable cookies or set your browser to  alert you when cookies are being sent to your computer.)&nbsp; We do not use IP  addresses or cookies to collect personally identifiable information, such as  your name, or to link this information to personally identifiable information  already collected about you. This information may be used to make our website  more interesting and useful to you. Additionally, we may combine this  information with personally identifiable information to identify a user in  order to enforce compliance with our <strong>Terms of Use</strong> or  to protect our service, website or users to the website.</p>
<p class="small"><strong>With  whom does RapOuts share my personally identifiable information?</strong><br>From time to time, we may employ and share  your personal information with vendors who use it solely to provide support for  the internal operations of our website (e.g., technical support and network  delivery). These entities will not use your personally identifiable information  for any other purpose, and have agreed to maintain the confidentiality,  security, and integrity of the personal information they obtain from us.</p>
<p class="small">
  It is our policy not to share, sell or rent your personal information to any  company not directly related to RapOuts as a provider or customer. RapOuts  reserves the right to share your personally identifiable information with our  parent or affiliated companies. Further, RapOuts may sell, transfer or  otherwise disclose user information, including personally identifiable  information, in connection with a corporate merger, consolidation, the sale of  substantially all assets, or other fundamental corporate change.<br>We may disclose your personal information in  the good faith belief that we are required to do so by law or to comply with  legal processes, respond to any claims or protect the rights, property, or  personal safety of RapOuts staff or the public.</p>
<p class="small"><strong>Third party advertisements and content</strong><br>When you are using the RapOuts website,  certain content, including advertisements, may be created or hosted by a third  party. Such third parties may place cookies and/or use web beacons, which may  be used to identify some of your preferences or to recognize you if you have  previously had contact with them. We do not control the use of such technology  by third parties, the information they collect, or how they use such  information. RapOuts does not disclose your personally identifiable information  to third parties serving ads or other content on our website.</p>
<p class="small"><strong>What is RapOuts’s policy regarding links to  third party websites?</strong> <br>
  You should be aware that while you are on a  website operated by us, you may be directed to links to other websites. The  privacy policies of these other websites are beyond our control and we take no  responsibility for their practices. Because we cannot guarantee that the  privacy policies of these websites meet our high standards, we recommend that  you read the privacy policy of the website to which you link before you submit  any personal information.</p>
<p class="small"><strong>How can I access my personal information?</strong><br>If you wish to review, update, or delete any  personal information that we may have collected about you, please contact us  via email at <a href="mailto:privacy@rapouts.com">privacy@rapouts.com</a></p>
<p class="small"><strong>What safeguards does RapOuts use to protect  my personally identifiable information?</strong> <br>
  We maintain appropriate safeguards that  ensure the security, integrity and privacy of the personally identifiable  information we collect from all users. The RapOuts account of every user is  password protected.&nbsp; Personal information collected by us is stored in  secure operating environments that are not available to the public and are only  accessible by authorized employees. We also have security measures in place to  protect the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control.</p>
<p class="small"><strong>What are my privacy rights if I am located  outside the United States of America?</strong><br>RapOuts makes an effort to protect the  personally identifiable information of all users of its website. We attempt to  comply with local data protection and consumer rights laws to the extent they  may apply to RapOuts’s services. If you are uncertain whether this privacy  policy conflicts with the applicable local privacy laws where you are located,  you should not submit your personally identifiable information to RapOuts. If  you are located within the European Union, you should be aware that your  personally identifiable information will be transferred to the United States of America,  the laws of which may be deemed by the European Union to have inadequate data  protection. If you are located in a country outside the United States of America and voluntarily submit  personally identifiable information to us, you thereby consent to the general  use of such information as provided in this privacy policy and to the transfer  of that information to, and/or storage of that information in, the United States of America.</p>
<p class="small"><strong>Changes in the RapOuts privacy policy</strong><br>We reserve the right to make changes to this  privacy policy at any time. If we change our privacy policy, we will post those  changes on our website so that you and other users are always aware of what  information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we  disclose it. You should also check back from time to time to ensure you are  aware of any changes. If we are going to use personally identifiable  information in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection,  we will notify you and others via email or by placing a prominent notice on our  website.</p>
<p class="small"><strong>By using this website, you signify your assent to the  RapOuts Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to this privacy policy, please do  not use this website.&nbsp; Your continued use of this website will signify  your acceptance of these changes.</strong></p>
<p class="small">This RapOuts Privacy Policy was updated May 20, 2008. </p>
