                    is secured using a Thawte Digital Certificate. This ensures 
                    that all information (credit card number, address, phone number, 
                    etc.) you send to us through our web site will be encrypted. 
                    If any other Internet user intercepts the communication he/she 
                    will only be able to see it in an encrypted (garbled) form. 
                    Certificate technology allows us to decrypt the information,

                    or rent this information to others in ways different from 
                    what is disclosed in this statement. Inventing.com collects

                    </b> <font size="1">We request information from the user on 
                    our order form. Here a user must provide contact information 
                    (like name and shipping address) and financial information 
                    (like credit card number, expiration date). This information 
                    is used for billing purposes and to fill customer’s orders. 
                    If we have trouble processing an order, this contact information 
                    is used to get in touch with the user.</font><b><br>

                    Cookies<br>
                    </b><font size="1">A cookie is a piece of data stored on the 
                    user’s hard drive containing information about the user. Usage 
                    of a cookie is in no way linked to any personally identifiable 
                    information while on our site. Once the user closes their 
                    browser, the cookie simply terminates. For instance, by setting 
                    a cookie on our site, the user would not have to log in a 
                    password more than once, thereby saving time while on our 
                    site. If a user rejects the cookie, they may still use our 
                    site. The only drawback to this is that the user will be limited 
                    in some areas of our site. For example, the user will not 
                    be able to participate in any of our Sweepstakes, Contests 
                    or monthly Drawings that take place. Cookies can also enable

                    the experience on our site.</font><b> <br>
