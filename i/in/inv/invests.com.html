<h1>I can show you how to turn $10,000.00 into $1 MILLION in no time flat.</h1>
<p>But don’t take my word for it – I am going to give you your first pick free – and if it does not gain at least 100% don’t buy my service. Actually my normal service is 100% free, however if you decide to buy my service after receiving your first pick, then you will get put to the front of the line and get my smoking hot picks before anyone else – we call this “first in first out.”</p>

IT IS THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE USER AND/OR MEMBER OF THIS SITE TO ASCERTAIN THE TERMS OF AND COMPLY WITH ANY LOCAL LAW OR REGULATION TO WHICH THEY ARE SUBJECT.</p>

<p>Notice &amp; Disclaimer: Invests.com</p>

<p>Please carefully review the following before using this Site.</p>

<p>We are a team of stock market researchers. We research stock market info online and monitor relevant lines of communication to make Invests.com. This and all our Invests.com were compiled by individuals not licensed in any jurisdiction whatsoever to analyze stock or give investment advice. The information contained herein is our non-biased opinion based on the data available to us. We are United States News and Information Services. We were created for the betterment of investment information available online. We do not offer or solicit any offers to buy or sell securities. Neither the owner of Invests.com nor any of its contributors, officers, directors, contractors, agents, or employees are licensed broker-dealers, account representatives, market makers, investment bankers, investment advisors, analyst or underwriters in any jurisdiction whatsoever.</p>

<p>You hereby acknowledge and accept that we provide Tips (opinion based on public information) regarding Stocks (publicly traded securities). Trading shares of such publicly traded companies carries a level of risk and may not be suitable for all investors. Some stock investments are considered to be of a speculative nature and because of this may carry an exceptionally high level of risk. Most penny stocks are considered to be speculative, which in theory means that this particular class of securities carries an exceptionally high level of risk due to their small capitalization levels, low trading volumes, volatility and lack of a substantial shareholder base. Many individuals acquire these stocks in anticipation of price appreciation, company growth and the chance to own a substantial amount of shares in a small/micro cap company. Invests.com often features companies within the speculative stock category with news releases, company profile, analysis and the general forecast of the company being featured. However, this is simply a forecast and, just like the weather, may not develop as expected. Before deciding to trade this type of stock, the so-called speculative stocks, you should carefully consider your investment objectives, which should take into account your level of experience and your risk appetite.</p>

<p>With stock trading, especially penny stock trading, we strongly urge you to consider using a broker that offers a ‘stop-loss’ feature with your brokerage account. This feature allows you to set a level of loss that you are willing to risk on any given trade. This level should be adjusted with every trade to reflect the investment at hand. Please note that the stop-loss feature does not guarantee that you will not sustain losses, it simply aims to minimize your losses in the event that the market does indeed take a turn for the worse.</p>

<p>You should always remember that markets crash, successful companies go into bankruptcy, products can become obsolete and talented individuals can leave the company or even unexpectedly expire; any of these instances can utterly hurt your intended investment and leave you holding an empty bag that may have been filled with your life savings. Many investors, especially penny stock investors, focus on rapid growth rather than the preservation of capital, a process that may carry an extremely high risk of losses; hence, you should not invest money or other assets that you cannot afford to lose.</p>

<p>We at Invests.com strongly urge you to be aware of all the risks associated with the volatile world that is the stock market and seek advice from an independent financial advisor if you have any doubts (regardless of the convincing nature of our opinion).</p>

<p>The contents of this site (opinions, news, research, analyses, prices, or any other information) are general market commentary and under no circumstance should be considered investment advice. We simply yearn to expose you to the fun and excitement that is the stock market. We hope that your investment portfolio stands to gain on every given trade.</p>

<p>By using this Site, you hereby warrant and guarantee that you are personally responsible for obtaining adequate investment advice (ie. from a trusted financial advisor) prior to making any investment decision. It is your responsibility to maintain a balanced portfolio that will meet or exceed your investment objectives.</p>

<p>You should also remember that, as a successful investor, you should never invest your entire portfolio (or even a substantial portion of your portfolio) on any given trade, especially when the investment is surrounded by speculation.

</p><p>The recommendations (Invests.com) provided by this Site should never be considered as the sole or final source of information on which you would base your final investment decision. You should research the stock and seek professional investment advice from a qualified financial advisor before executing any investment transaction.</p>

<p>We recommend that if any such part of your investment portfolio is allocated towards speculation and growth investments, it should only contain funds that you are prepared to lose in their entirety. You are solely responsible for determining the nature, value, and suitability of individual securities and you alone bear the risk of all transactions that you enter.</p>

<p>Forward-Looking Information<br>

The majority of the information on this Site contains forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties and speak only as of the date on which they are made. The words “believe”, “expect”, “anticipate”, “optimistic”, “projected”, “forecast”, “intend”, “aim”, “will” or similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. You hereby agree and accept that you will not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date on which they are made and they involve deductions and conclusions reached based on the available data and information.
We undertake no obligation to update publicly or revise any such forward-looking statements. These are believed to be timely and accurate on the date when issued, however the passage of time can render information stale or obsolete and you shall not rely on the continued accuracy of any such material beyond the date of issuance. We have no responsibility to update any information contained in such material.</p>

<p>1.Your financial situation<br>
We do not request nor analyze your financial situation or your needs for financial stability. It is not our intent to provide you with advice to ensure that your risk is minimized and that your funds are maximized within “established” risk boundaries, as no such analysis or relationship has been established with you. We take no responsibility whatsoever for your portfolio of investments, and have made no analysis of what percentage of your available income or capital should be allocated to this type of investment. You hereby indemnify us and hold us harmless from fulfilling your short term or long term investing and capital goals.</p>

<p>2. Brokerage Fees &amp; Charges<br>
Our recommendations and tips do not take into account the fees and costs which may be charged to you by your Broker for each trade, nor how they deal with trading volume. We make no recommendations regarding the volume of stock to be held in a given account, or to be traded at any one time. It is possible that where the volume of the trade is low, and the brokerage house has a minimum fee per trade, where their minimum volume is not met, that the cost of the trade will exceed the profit made in the trade. We take no responsibility for such losses generated through brokerage fees and charges.</p>

<p>3. Handling of your Brokerage Account<br>
No Member funds are accepted in Invests.com’s name, and you hereby agree that you will open your brokerage account where you are best able to get the service, and are responsible for negotiating brokerage fees and service costs, as well as the application of the stop-loss feature. We will not be responsible for acting, under any circumstances, as an intermediary for you, receiving funds of any nature from you or assisting you in any way to establish a Brokerage Account. We will not introduce you to any Broker, nor do we maintain a list of recommended Brokers. We may provide, without prejudice, information on our Site regarding the recommended features that a broker should have in order to trade by our method; however we take no responsibility for any broker chosen by you utilizing our list of features.</p>

<p>4. Relevant Qualifications<br>
We make no statement or assertion regarding relevant qualifications which qualify us to provide investment advice; and hereby assert that we do not provide “investment advise”, but simply state our opinion based on publicly available information.</p>

<p>5. Membership of a relevant professional body<br>
We are not a member of any relevant professional body.</p>

<p>6. Professional Indemnity Insurance<br>
We maintain NO professional indemnity insurance, as we are not providing professional services, but rather our personal investment opinions and experiences.</p>

<p>7. Criminal Convictions and related matters<br>
Since the beginning, neither Invests.com nor any of the principal officers of Invests.com:<br>

(a) have been convicted of an offense under securities legislation of any country where they are a resident or have operating investment accounts;<br>
