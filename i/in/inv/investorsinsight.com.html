Privacy Policy </p>
<p>InvestorsInsight recognizes that personal privacy is an important issue, so 
  we design, maintain and operate our services with the protection of individual 
  privacy as one of our utmost concerns. Our readership and subscriber databases 
  are securely maintained for the proprietary publication and distribution of 
  selected newsletters, financial and economic data and timely news reports and 
  notices. </p>
<p>In this recently revised and expanded Privacy Policy we set out examples of 
  the types of information we collect and how we may possibly share that information 
  and with whom. These examples are provided for illustration purposes and should 
  not be considered a complete and exhaustive listing of our information collection, 
  use and sharing practices. </p>
<p><b>Information Obtained.</b> When you register to receive any of our publications, 
  we usually obtain, at the minimum, your name and your e-mail address. When you 
  elect to "contact us," we may obtain additional information including 
  your name, e-mail address, phone number, address and company name. We utilize 
  this information to respond to individual inquiries as appropriate and to send 
  you selected newsletters, financial data and timely news reports and notices. 
  From time to time, we may forward additional information to you including special 
  offers from InvestorsInsight or specially selected partners who offer products, 
  services, or information which we believe may be of interest to our readership. 
  By providing your contact information and/or registering to receive any of our 
  publications and/or viewing our web and e-mail information, you consent to the 
  establishment of an "opt-in business relationship" between you and 
  InvestorsInsight. </p>
<p>InvestorsInsight also collects limited non-personally identifying information 
  your browser customarily makes available whenever you visit any website on the 
  Internet or open an e-mail. This information may include your Internet Protocol 
  address, browser type, browser language, the date and time of your access and 
  one or more cookies that may uniquely identify your browser. We use this information 
  on an aggregate basis, to analyze the readership trends of our e-mails and access 
  to our publishing services.</p>
<p>Some of our newsletters, reports and notices may include ads from third parties. 
  In order to measure advertising effectiveness, we may employ cookies or action 
  tags (also known as single pixel gifs or web beacons). Any information that 
  is collected via cookies and action tags is maintained under the same security 
  measures as employed for personal information. </p>
<p><b>Information Sharing. </b>We are required by law to provide information in 
  response to subpoenas, court orders, or legal process, from law enforcement 
  agencies or state and federal regulators. If we sell or otherwise transfer substantially 
  all of our assets related to this website, we will contractually require such 
  third parties to honor our current Privacy Policy, until the third party provides 
  you with notice of changes to the Privacy Policy and permits you to exercise 
  any nondisclosure rights you may have under applicable law.</p>
<p>We do not sell InvestorsInsight's subscribers' e-mail addresses to third parties. 
  We may, however, provide selected information that we have obtained on a confidential 
  basis to certain nonaffiliated companies who are considered to be joint venture 
  or strategic partners, advisors, contractors or consultants who are working 
  with InvestorsInsight. Information will be shared with such third parties only 
  to the extent reasonably necessary, and pursuant to confidentiality obligations. 
</p>
<p>Non-personal information may be compiled for statistical purposes and provided 
  to third parties. However, none of this non-personal data will include individually 
  identifiable information. </p>
<p><b>Information Security</b>. InvestorsInsight diligently works to insure the 
  integrity and security of our network and systems. InvestorsInsight, however, 
  cannot guarantee that our security measures will totally prevent third-party 
  "hackers" from illegally obtaining access to such information.</p>
<p><b>Updating Your Information.</b> If you wish to update or change your information, 
  you may go to our website and select "subscriber services." The screen 
  that appears allows you to update or change your e-mail address.</p>
<p><b>Opting Out.</b> We hope you value the unique and insightful publications 
  and information we publish. You can, however, choose to opt-out of individual 
  communications at any time by following the simple instructions provided in 
  each e-mail. Alternatively, you may go to our website and select "subscriber 
  services" to unsubscribe from any of the selected publications.</p>
<p><b>Changes to This Policy.</b> This Privacy Policy may be updated at any time, 
  at InvestorsInsight's sole discretion. We expect that most changes will be minor. 
  However, from time to time the changes can be significant. In either case, we 
  will post those changes on this page and, if the changes are significant, we 
  will also provide a more prominent notice on our website home page. The date 
  of the last revision to our Privacy Policy appears at the end of this notice.</p>
<p>If you have any questions regarding our website or this Privacy Policy, please 
  e-mail <a href="mailto:webmaster@investorsinsight.com">webmaster@investorsinsight.com</a>.
