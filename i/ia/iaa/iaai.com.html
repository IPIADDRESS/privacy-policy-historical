                    <p>The following is the manner in which Insurance Auto Auctions, Inc. 
                        ("IAA") handles information gathered about you from your visit to 
                        this web site (“Site”) through our web pages, newsletters, 
                        discussion lists, and announcement lists or when you fill out any of our forms 
                        within this Site. This Privacy Policy does not apply to the use or disclosure 
                        of information that is collected or obtained by us through means Sother than 
                        this Site.</p>
                    <p>By accessing, browsing and/or using this Site, you acknowledge you have read, 
                        understood and agree to be bound by the policy provided herein. If you do not 
                        agree to this policy, do not use this Site and exit immediately.</p>
                    <p>IAA reserves the right to revise this policy at any time without prior notice. 
                        If, at any time, you do not agree with the Privacy Policy of this Site, or of 
                        any subsequent revisions to the Privacy Policy, immediately discontinue using 
                        and accessing this Site. By using this Site, you agree to be bound by any such 
                        revisions and you should therefore periodically visit this page to determine 
                        the then-current Privacy Policy to which you are bound.</p>
                    <p><strong>Personally Identifiable Information </strong>
                        <br>
                        You can browse our Site without entering any personal information and thereby 
                        remain anonymous during your visit. However, there are cases where we may ask 
                        you for personal data. When personally identifiable information is collected, 
                        you will know because you will have to fill out a form. For example, IAA may 
                        collect names, addresses, email addresses and the like for the purposes of 
                        conducting a survey, communicating with a visitor, or to provide additional 
                        services such as viewing auction lists, subscribing to newsletters, entering 
                        contests or providing requested information relating to new products, web site 
                        updates, or inquiries. Whenever we request the identity of a visitor or 
                        customer, we will clearly indicate the purpose of the inquiry before the 
                        information is requested and then only use the information for the purpose for 
                        which it was obtained. For example, when you enter a contest or other 
                        promotion, we may ask for your name, address, and email address so we can 
                        administer the contest and notify winners. If you choose not to give 
                        information we request, you can still visit most of the Site, but you may be 
                        unable to access certain options, contests, offers, and services.</p>
                    <p>When you purchase products from us, request product information or otherwise 
                        provide us with personal information, we may automatically place you on our 
                        list to receive e-mail regarding product updates, special offers, important 
                        issues and new products. If you do not wish to receive these e-mail messages, 
                        you can simply respond by telling us that you do not want to receive any future 
                        communications or contact our Customer Support organization at the contact 
                        points specified below. We maintain a "No-Spam" policy and once you 
                        are on one of our mailing list we will not sell, rent, trade, or otherwise give 
                        your email address to a third party without your consent, except as otherwise 
                        provided in this Privacy Policy.
                    </p>
                    <p>In case you change your mind or wish to update or delete personal information 
                        (such as your address), we will endeavor to correct, update or remove the 
                        personal data you give us. You can do this by contacting our Customer Support 
                        organization at the contact points specified below.</p>

                    <p>Every computer connected to the Internet is given a domain name and a set of 
                        numbers that serve as that computer's "Internet Protocol address" 
                        also known as the "IP address." When a visitor requests a page from 
                        our Site, our web servers automatically receive that visitor's domain name and 
                        IP address. The domain name and IP address reveal nothing personal about you 
                        other than the IP address from which you have accessed our Site. We use this 
                        information to examine our Site traffic, but do not collect and evaluate this 
                        information for individuals. Our web servers do not record the email addresses 
                        of the visitors to our Site unless you voluntarily provide that information to 
                        us.</p>
                    <p><strong>Purchasing and/or Registering Products or Services </strong>
                        <br>
                        If you are purchasing merchandise from IAA we need to know your personal 
                        information, including your name, email address, mailing address, shipping 
                        address, etc. This allows us to process your transaction and to notify you of 
                        your purchase status. In addition, we may use this information to notify you of 
                        related products and services, however your information will not be shared or 
                        sold to any third parties for any purpose except as otherwise provided in this 
                        Privacy Policy. For all purchases, we use a shopping cart feature that 
                        safeguards your order information using industry standard SSL (Secure Socket 
                        Layer) encrypted servers. SSL codes the information transferred between you and 
                        the server, rendering it unreadable to anyone trying to intercept the 
                        information. This type of technology is also called a secure web site or a 
                        secure server. You will know when you are on a secure web site when the front 
                        of the web address has "https" instead of the normal 
                        "http".</p>
                    <p><strong>Disclosure of Information to Outside Third Parties and Special Cases</strong><br>

                        necessary.

                    <p>We may share statistical or aggregated non-personal information about our

                        This data is used to customize our Site content and to deliver a better 
                        experience to our users and does not involve revealing your personal 
                        information.</p>
                    <p>While we use all reasonable efforts to safeguard the confidentiality of your 
                        information, IAA will have no liability for any breach of security, for

                        provided that we will make reasonable efforts to see that your privacy 
                        preferences are honored by the transferee. You may Opt Out from allowing us to share your personal 
						information by sending a written request to the Marketing Department at our corporate address.</p>
                    <p><strong>Links to Other Sites </strong>
                        <br>
                        As a resource to our visitors, IAA provides links to other web sites. We try to

                        However, the presence on this Site of links to non-IAA sites does not mean that 
                        IAA endorses or accepts any responsibility for the content or use of such 
                        sites. IAA has no control over such sites and will not be responsible for the
