<em>Welcome</em>
<p>
Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu is delighted you're visiting our IAS Plus Website. By using this Website, you agree that you will abide by the below terms and conditions:
</p><p>

<em>Legal</em>
</p><p>
<b class="b">About Deloitte</b>
</p><p>
Deloitte Entities refers to one or more of Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu, a Swiss Verein, and its network of member firms, each of which is a legally separate and independent entity. Please see <a href="http://www.deloitte.com/about">www.deloitte.com/about</a> for a detailed description of the legal structure of Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu and its member firms.
</p><p>
"Deloitte" is the brand under which tens of thousands of dedicated professionals in independent firms throughout the world collaborate to provide audit, consulting, financial advisory, risk management, and tax services to selected clients. These firms are members of Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu (DTT), a Swiss Verein. Each member firm provides services in a particular geographic area and is subject to the laws and professional regulations of the particular country or countries in which it operates. DTT helps coordinate the activities of the member firms but does not itself provide services to clients. DTT and the member firms are separate and distinct legal entities, which cannot obligate the other entities. DTT and each DTT member firm are only liable for their own acts or omissions, and not those of each other. Each of the member firms operates under the names "Deloitte", "Deloitte &amp; Touche", "Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu", or other related names. Each DTT member firm is structured differently in accordance with national laws, regulations, customary practice, and other factors, and may secure the provision of professional services in their territories through subsidiaries, affiliates and/or other entities.
