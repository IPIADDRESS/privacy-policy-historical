                <h3>4. How We Use Your Personal Data</h3>
                <p>
                    We will only use your personal data when the law allows us to. Most commonly, we will use your personal data in the following circumstances:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Where we need to perform the contract we are about to enter into or have entered into with you.</li>
                    <li>
                        Where it is necessary for our legitimate interests (or those of a third party) and your interests and fundamental rights do not override 
                        those interests.
                    </li>
                    <li>Where we need to comply with a legal or regulatory obligation.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Generally we do not rely on consent as a legal basis for processing your personal data other than in relation to sending third party direct 
                    marketing communications to you via email or text message. You have the right to withdraw consent to marketing at any time by contacting us. 
                </p>

                    <li><strong>Access</strong> to your personal data. You can access your information online by looking at your account.</li>

                    <li>
                        <strong>Request erasure</strong> of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal data where there is no good 
                        reason for us continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal data where you have successfully 
                        exercised your right to object to processing (see below), where we may have processed your information unlawfully or where we are required to 
                        erase your personal data to comply with local law. Note, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for 
                        specific legal reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request.  We also remove your name from the membership

                        <strong>Object to processing</strong> of your personal data where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there 
                        is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts your fundamental 
                        rights and freedoms. You also have the right to object where we are processing your personal data for direct marketing purposes. In some cases, 
                        we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which override your rights and freedoms.

                        want us to erase it; (c) where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal 
                        claims; or (d) you have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it.

                        <strong>Request the transfer</strong> of your personal data to you or to a third party. We will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, 
                        your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Note that this right only applies to automated information which you

                    access your personal data (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any 
                    person who has no right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response.
