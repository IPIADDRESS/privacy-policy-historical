				<h3 class="front">Summary of our Policy</h3>
  <p>iATN has always considered 
    the protection of your private personal information to be of the utmost 
    importance. This privacy policy will detail exactly what our policy is 
    for keeping your information private, but a summary of our policy is:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>We do not sell 
      or rent your personal information to third parties.</li>
    <li>We do not share 
      your personal information with advertisers or sponsors.</li>

    <li>We have zero tolerance 
      for unsolicited commercial email (a.k.a. "spam"). For information 
      on the email iATN sends, please see <a href="/no-spam">this 
      page</a>.</li>
    <li>We encrypt credit 
      card information and otherwise secure your personal data.</li>
    <li>We will display 
      the name, company name, position, and general location (city, state, 
      country, zipcode) of registered members in our public member directory, 
      and may also in other areas of our site, including areas showing who 
      is "online" on our network, and in any <a href="#interactive-content">Interactive 
      Content</a> created by said member.</li>
    <li>We may display the company name, phone number and street address of a  business premium member on their iATN web page, so that consumers can locate  and contact the business through our <a href="https://iatn.net/directory">Member Directory</a> and <a href="https://iatn.net/repair?gc=1">Repair Shop  Finder</a>. This would only be shown if the company has indicated that they  do business with the general public, and this information can be turned  off through the Account Settings area of our site.</li>

    <li>Any <a href="#interactive-content">Interactive 
      Content</a> posted to or sent through the network (e.g. TechHelp, forum 
      posts, etc.), is not private and is not covered by this privacy policy.</li>
    <li>You may cancel 
      your membership at any time if you do not wish your information to be 
      listed in our public member directory.<br>
      </li>
  </ul>
  <p>By accessing iATN, 
    you are accepting the practices described in this privacy policy. </p>
  <h3 class="front"><b>What Personal Information 
    Does iATN Gather?</b></h3>

  <p>The information we 
    receive from members helps us personalize and continually improve the 
	network. Here are the types of information we gather:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Information 
      You Give Us</b>: We receive and store any information you enter on our 
      web site or give to us in any other way. Some of the most common situations 
      in which this occurs include: registering to join iATN, upgrading your 
      account to premium membership status, updating your account settings, submitting 
      a message to the network (including the forums, TechHelp help requests, 
      file library, chat rooms, etc.), replying to a TechHelp help request 
      sent by another member, purchasing something from the iATN Store, corresponding 
      with iATN staff, and more. <br>
      <br>
      You can choose not to provide certain information, but then you might 
      not be able to take advantage of many of our features. We use the information 
      that you provide for such purposes as responding to your requests, customizing 
      future features for you, improving and securing our site, and communicating 
      with our members. <br>
      <br>
      Any correspondence with iATN staff (by email, phone, FAX, postal mail, 
      or in person) is not guaranteed to be kept private unless you explicitly 
      request that it be, due to the fact that we may have to share some or 
      all of the information with others to respond adequately to comments, 
      questions, and concerns. <br>

      <br>
      </li>
    <li><b><a name="interactive-content"></a>Interactive 
      Content</b>: We receive and store any information entered on the "interactive" 
      portions of our network. We do not consider this information to be private, 
      and as such, this privacy policy does not govern that content. Examples 
      of such content include (but are not limited to): forum posts, chat 
      room discussions, <a href="http://members.iatn.net/techmail/">TechHelp</a>, 
      comments on other members' content, etc.<br>
      <br>
      In addition, please note that the following personal information may 
      be permanently displayed with any Interactive Content you submit to 
      iATN: name, company name, position, city, state, country, and zipcode.<br>
      <br>

      Since we cannot prevent you from entering other personal information 
      with your Interactive Content, we cannot protect that private information 
      in that case, and it is not governed by this privacy policy. <br>
      <br>
      For example, if a member posts a message to our forums, and they include 
      their email address or phone number in the body of the message, we will 
      not be able to protect that private personal information.<br>
      <br>
      Interactive Content on iATN is also regulated by our <a href="/terms-of-use">Terms 
      of Use</a>.<br>
      <br>

      </li>
    <li><b>Replies to 
      TechHelp</b>: Whenever you respond to another member's <a href="http://members.iatn.net/techmail/">TechHelp</a> 
      help request via email, your response is sent through our email servers, 
      to be filtered for attachments, known viruses, vacation notices or auto-replies, 
      and "spam" (unsolicited commercial email), and is then stored 
      in our database. These replies follow the same guidelines as those for 
      <a href="#interactive-content">Interactive Content</a>, and are likewise 
      regulated by our <a href="/terms-of-use">Terms of 
      Use</a>.<a href="#interactive-content"> </a><br>
      <br>
      </li>

    <li><b>Automatic Information</b>: 
      We receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact 
      with us, and each access of our web site is recorded in logs which we 
      can use for statistical and security analysis. Each time you access 
      our web site, your browser sends your unique IP address, your browser 
      name/version, your operating system version, any "cookies" 
      stored for iatn.net (more on cookies below), the current resource requested, 
      and usually the last page you visited, called the "referrer link."<br>
      <br>
      </li>
    <li><b>Other Information</b>: 
      Specific uses of personal information that vary from this privacy policy, 
      if any, may be found throughout our network. If those uses are different 
      than what has been disclosed here, you will be notified beforehand as 
      to the differences which will govern those transactions.<br>
      <br>
      There may be situations where iATN collects data through a survey, web 
      form, or similar process when the page does not link to this privacy 
      policy. In those cases, unless you are informed otherwise, you should 
      assume that iATN treats all information from those pages as it treats 
      its other valuable business records.<br>

      <br>
      </li>
    <li><b>Information 
      from Third-Parties</b>: We do not actively collect personal information 
      from any outside sources. However, your personal information may be 
      supplied to us by a third-party in the event of a complaint or legal 
      matter. In those cases, this personal information is not governed by 
      this privacy policy.<br>
      <br>
      </li>
    <li><b>Through Network 
      Maintenance</b>: During the course of testing and updates to the software 
      on iATN, certain staff members may see information that you submit in 
      a context that seems private, such as sending email to another member 
      on our network, through our web site. We try to avoid these circumstances, 
      but live testing is often required while improving or repairing the 
      network. <br>
    </li>

  </ul>
  <h3 class="front"><b>More Information on Cookies</b> 
  </h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Cookies are simply 
      pieces of information stored in your browser, specific to the site that 
      sends them to your browser. They are very useful for making iATN easy 
      to use, and they are essential to our "automatic login" feature, 
      which allows members to access the secured areas of our site without 
      having to manually login each time. (An optional feature available to 
      all members.)<br>
      <br>
      </li>
    <li>No other site 
      can access iATN's cookies, and we cannot access other site's cookies. 
      All cookies are stored on your computer hard drive, except for "temporary 
      cookies," which exist only in memory while your browser is open. 
      (In general, we only use permanent cookies.)<br>

      <br>
      </li>
    <li>We use cookies 
      to store certain preferences you have selected for viewing our site, 
      your username, and your encrypted password. As we develop the site further, 
      we may increase the number of cookies in use. We will NEVER store critical 
      information in cookies, such as credit card numbers, due to security 
      concerns.<br>
      <br>
      </li>
    <li>There are many 
      programs available to you that can block all cookies sent to your browser. 
      Blocking iATN cookies may result in making iATN harder to enjoy (or 
      eliminate certain features completely). We recommend that you leave 
      cookies turned on. However...<br>
      <br>
      </li>

    <li> You may tell 
      your browser to ignore "3rd-party cookies" or cookies that 
      are not sent "by the originating server," with no ill effect 
      on iATN. Those types of cookies are normally used by advertising sites 
      to track your movements. We do NOT use those types of cookies.<br><br></li>
      
    <li>We use Google Analytics to allow us to track aggregate information and  statistics on how people use iATN's web services. As part of the Google  Analytics service, Google uses cookies to track visitor information. We  do not share any personal or identifiable information about you with  Google. However, we do share aggregate information, and as with any web  site you access, Google can also see your IP address and basic browser  information. If you don't wish to allow the use of Google Analytics,  you can install a third-party add-on like <a href="http://noscript.net/" rel="nofollow">NoScript</a> on <a href="http://www.mozilla.com/" rel="nofollow">Firefox</a>, and disable all  JavaScript requests to the google-analytics.com domain. </li>

  </ul>
  <h3 class="front"><b>Does iATN Share the Information 
    It Receives?</b></h3>
  <p>Information about our members is an important part of our business, and  we take great pains not to reveal the following private personal  information to others: email address, username, password, and credit  card information. We also do not share your phone number and street  address (not including city, state, country, zipcode), with one  exception: business premium members of iATN have web pages that may show their  phone number and street address, unless they choose to turn this off,  and this is explained <a href="#business">below</a> in more detail. Only authorized iATN staff,  agents, and credit card processors have access to private member  information, and even then only in a tightly controlled manner.</p>
    
  <ul>
    <li><b>Agents of iATN</b>: 
      From time to time we may need to use third party agencies to carry out our
      normal business operations, such as sending email, delivering content over
      the internet, or providing services to you. When we do this, we will ensure
      these agencies agree to adhere to our privacy policy when working with 
      our data.<br>

      <br>
      </li>
	  
    <li> <b>Credit Card 
      Processing</b>: If you purchase something from the <a href="http://members.iatn.net/store/">iATN 
      Store</a>, or <a href="http://members.iatn.net/upgrade/">upgrade your 
      iATN account</a> to premium member status, your name, billing &amp; 
      shipping addresses, purchase information, and credit card information 
      is necessarily shared with our credit card processing companies to complete 
      the transaction. We are currently using <a href="https://stripe.com/">Stripe</a> for
      credit card processing services. All communication between our servers
      and theirs is encrypted with SSL 128-bit security to protect your information
      while in transit.<br>
      <br>

      </li>
    <li><b>Aggregate and 
      Anonymous Information</b>: iATN may share aggregate and/or anonymous 
      statistics and related information with third parties. At no time will 
      any personally-identifiable information be included. Most of this information 
      will be in the form of network growth, usage statistics and demographics 
      of registered members. <br>
      <br>
      </li>
	  <li><a name="connecting-with-members"></a><b>Connecting With Members Through Other Services</b>: From time to time we advertise
	  on other social networks, such as Facebook and Twitter, to try and connect with
	  past and current members of iATN, encouraging those members to "like" or "follow" us on
      those services. These networks typically provide a mechanism for us to target our members 
	  by matching email address, phone number and similar information. When we use these 
	  advertising techniques, they are always done in a way where none of the parties involved 
	  are permitted to use our members' information in ANY way other than to help us target 
	  our advertisements. In fact, in the case of Facebook and Twitter, those services never 
	  even receive the actual email or phone number data, instead receiving only a "hash" that
	  allows them to look for matching accounts. In the case of Twitter advertisements, we use
	  a third party called MailChimp to securely exchange the targeting information, and our
	  agreement with MailChimp forbids them from using member information for anything other
	  than our targeted advertising on Twitter. You can read more about how these targeted 
	  advertisements work: <a href="https://www.facebook.com/help/459892990722543/">Facebook Audiences</a> and <a href="https://blog.twitter.com/2014/new-ways-to-create-and-use-tailored-audiences">Twitter's Tailored Audiences</a>.
	  <br>
      <br>

      </li>
    <li><b>Industry Sponsors</b>: 
      iATN has several <a href="http://www.iatn.net/industry">industry sponsors</a> 
      which subsidize the network and provide great support to our members. 
      At no time have we ever shared your personal information with these 
      companies, nor will we in the future without your express consent.<br>

      <br>
      </li>
    <li><strong><a name="business" id="business"></a>Business Sponsor Pages</strong>: Those members that upgrade their account  to have a Business or Business+ premium membership receive a web page on iATN to advertise their  services to the public. These pages can be used to supply as much or as  little information about the business as they wish. Many  business premium members choose to reveal their street address, phone number,  FAX number, email address, and more. iATN does not control what  personal information business premium members choose to display on their  pages. However, we do create a default web page that includes the phone  number and street address of the business, if they have  indicated that they do business with the general public. Each business is able to <a href="http://members.iatn.net/config/" rel="nofollow">update their web page</a> at any time to add or remove  such information as they see fit.<br>
      <br>
      </li>
    <li><b>Member Directory 
      / Signature</b>: Members of iATN agree (upon registration) to allow 
      us to display their full name, company name, position, city, state, 
      and country in our <a href="https://iatn.net/directory">member directory</a>. 
      This information is thus freely available to anyone browsing the iATN 
      web site, and is not protected by iATN. If they do not wish to have 
      this information displayed, they can <a href="http://members.iatn.net/config/#account_cancellation">cancel 
      their iATN account</a>, and their listing in the directory will be removed 
      within one week. <br>

      <br>
      In addition, this same personal information is displayed, to some extent, 
      with all <a href="#interactive-content">Interactive Content</a> created 
      on iATN (any messages posted to the forums, TechHelp help request system, 
      chat rooms on iATN, etc.). We feel that requiring this minimum amount 
      of personal information on your content on the network is necessary 
      to add legitimacy to iATN. You may choose not to submit <a href="#interactive-content">Interactive 
      Content</a> on iATN if you do not wish to reveal this personal information 
      in this instance. <br>
      <br>
      </li>
    <li><a name="business-transfers"></a><b>Business Transfers</b>: 
      In the event that iATN, it's parent company Service Repair Solutions (or Solera Holdings, 
	  the parent company of Service Repair Solutions), or 
	  substantially all of iATN's assets are acquired by another company, member 
	  information will most likely be one of the transferred 
      assets. However, before such a transfer takes place, we would require 
      that the acquiring company abide by this privacy policy when dealing 
      with member information, and/or we will give members the opportunity 
      to "opt out," at which point their personal information would NOT be 
      transferred. <a href="#interactive-content">Interactive Content</a> submitted to 
	  iATN by the member is not considered "personal" information, and would be transferred.<br>

      <br>
      </li>
    <li><b>Third-Party 
      Web Sites</b>: iATN does not control the privacy practices of its advertisers, 
      sponsors, and other third-party sites that it promotes or links to. 
      If you click through a banner ad or link and submit your information 
      to a third-party, you will be subject to their privacy policies.<br>
      <br>
      </li>
    <li><b>Private Email 
      from Members</b>: As explained in this policy, iATN does not reveal 
      your email address to other members (although you may have decided to 
      release that information in <a href="#interactive-content">Interactive 
      Content</a> submitted on our network, which we cannot control). However, 
      we DO make it possible for other members to contact you on iATN through 
      the use of a form on our website. Your email address is never revealed 
      to the member in this case. They would see only your non-private personal 
      information, such as your name, company name, position, and general 
      location (city, state, country, zipcode). We may also allow the general 
      public to send private email to members in the same fashion.<br>

      <br>
      </li>
    <li><b>Breach of Terms 
      of Use, Guidelines, Etc.</b>: In the event that a registered member 
      breaches our <a href="/terms-of-use">Terms of Use</a>, 
      <a href="/guidelines">our guidelines</a>, the <a href="http://join.iatn.net/">member 
      agreement</a>, or the laws governing iATN and its members, we reserve 
      the right to use any information we have obtained from said member -- 
      personal, or otherwise -- to (among other things) protect the property, 
      safety, and rights of iATN. Under these circumstances, said information 
      is not governed by this privacy policy.<br>
      <br>
      </li>

    <li><b>With Your Consent</b>: 
      Other than as set out above, you will receive notice in the unlikely 
      event that information about you might go to third parties, and you 
      will have an opportunity to choose not to share the information. <br>
      <br>
      </li>
    <li><b>Unforeseen 
      Circumstances</b>: Due to the existing regulatory environment, we cannot 
      ensure that all of your private communications and other personal information 
      will never be disclosed in ways not otherwise described in this privacy 
      policy. For example: third parties may unlawfully intercept or access 
      transmissions or private communications; authorities may supply search 
      warrants for our premises; a program error, hardware glitch, network 
      problem, or other technical issue may inadvertantly reveal personal 
      information; we may need to disclose personal information to enforce 
      our <a href="/terms-of-use">Terms of Use</a>, or 
      to protect the property, safety, and rights of iATN. Therefore, although 
      we constantly strive to protect your privacy, we do not promise, and 
      you should not expect, that your personally identifiable information 
      or private communications will always remain private.<br>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3 class="front"><b>How Secure Is Information 
    About Me?</b> </h3>
  <ul>
    <li>We work to protect 
      the security of your credit card information during transmission by 
      using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software, usually with the largest 
      key-lengths available.<br>
      <br>
      </li>
    <li>We display only 
      the last two digits of your credit card numbers when confirming the 
      processing of your credit card information. Of course, we securely transmit 
      the entire credit card number (using SSL) to the appropriate credit 
      card company during card processing.<br>
      <br>

      </li>
    <li> Any credit card 
      numbers stored in our computer database are protected using very strong 
      encryption, of which only authorized staff members have key knowledge. 
      We will also protect physical access to the machine(s) on which the 
      secured database resides, and network access to the machine(s) will 
      be severely prohibited or denied entirely. We strive to achieve maximum
	  PCI compliance to protect all credit card information.<br>
      <br>
      </li>
    <li>We do not disclose 
      member passwords to any party that cannot validate their identity, except 
      to those who can receive email at the same address used to create the 
      membership. (Thus, you must maintain the security of your personal email 
      account if you wish to keep your iATN account secure.) <br>
    </li>
  </ul>

  
  <h3 class="front"><b>What Information Can I 
    Access?</b></h3>
  <p>We provide an <a href="http://members.iatn.net/config/">Account 
    Settings</a> page where registered members can view their personal information 
    stored on iATN. Most of this information can be updated by members from 
    that same location. (Note that when you update information, we usually 
    keep a copy of the prior version for our records.) If there is any personal 
    information listed in that area which you cannot change directly, such 
	as your name, please contact iATN Support (<a href="" onclick="var x = '@iatn.net'; this.href='mai' + 'lto:' + 'supp' + 'ort' + x;"><img src="/images/addresses/support-orange-plain.png" class="absmiddle" alt="support" width="115" height="15"></a>).</p>
     
  <h3 class="front"><b>What Choices Do I Have?</b> 
  </h3>
  <ul>
    <li>You can always 
      choose not to provide information to us, although this may result in 
      the inability to use certain or all parts of iATN, including the entire 
      members-only area of our network.<br>

      <br>
      </li>
    <li>You can add or 
      update certain information in the <a href="http://members.iatn.net/config/">Account 
      Settings</a> area of our site. When you update information, we usually 
      keep a copy of the prior version for our records.<br>
      <br>
      </li>
    <li> If you do not 
      wish to receive email from iATN, you must cancel your account, also 
      available near the bottom of the <a href="http://members.iatn.net/config/">Account 
      Settings</a> page. For information on the email iATN sends, please see 
      <a href="/no-spam">this page</a>.<br>

      <br>
      </li>
    <li>Your browser can 
      be configured as to how it receives, handles, and stores "cookies" 
      sent by our site. The degree to which you can manipulate these settings 
      depends on your web browser's capabilities. Restricting the cookies 
      accepted from iATN by your browser may have a negative impact on your 
      ability to use iATN.<br>
      <br>
      </li>
    <li>Many third-party 
      programs exist to allow you to control and limit the information which 
      flows between your computer and the internet. Installation of some of 
      these programs may have a negative impact on your ability to use iATN.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h3 class="front">What Happens When I Cancel 
    My iATN Account?</h3>

  <p>If you cancel your 
    iATN membership account, you will no longer receive email from us, and 
    your name, company, position, and location will no longer be listed in 
    our member directory. (Please allow up to one week for this to be completed.) 
    <br>
    <br>
    Your personal information will remain in our database, though your account 
    will be flagged as "cancelled," and only iATN staff will have 
    access to this information (except where noted above in regards to your 
    name, company name, position, and general location appearing with all 
    <a href="#interactive-content">Interactive Content</a>). This information 
    will still be subject to this privacy policy, regardless of account status. 
    <br>
    <br>
    We keep this information to prevent duplicate accounts from being created, 
    to prevent fraudulent use of iATN, and to allow people to re-activate 
    their accounts in the future more easily. (Registration forms would not 
    have to be completed again.)<br>
    <br>

    PLEASE NOTE: Any <a href="#interactive-content">Interactive Content</a> 
    you previously submitted to iATN will still be displayed and used by iATN, 
    and cannot be removed from the network. For more information on our Interactive 
    Content policies, please consult our <a href="/terms-of-use">Terms 
    of Use</a>.</p>
  <h3 class="front"><a name="children"></a><b>Does iATN Collect Information 
    From Children?</b></h3>
  <p>iATN permits students that are 16 years or older to register for a read-only
  membership, under the tutelage of an automotive instructor that has an existing
  iATN membership. In this situation, we collect the same kinds of information that
  we collect from any other member of iATN. We do not knowingly accept member 
  registrations from anyone under the age of 16.</p>
  <h3 class="front"><b>Terms of Use, Notices, 
    and Revisions</b> </h3>

  <p> If you choose to 
    visit iATN, your visit and any dispute over privacy is subject to this 
    policy and our <a href="/terms-of-use">Terms of Use</a>, 
    including limitations on damages, arbitration of disputes, and application 
    of the law of the state of California. If you have any concern about privacy 
    at iATN, please email us at <a href="" onclick="var x = '@iatn.net'; this.href='mai' + 'lto:' + 'supp' + 'ort' + x;"><img src="/images/addresses/support-orange-plain.png" class="absmiddle" alt="support" width="115" height="15"></a>. 
    <br>
    <br>
    This policy and the <a href="/terms-of-use">Terms 
    of Use</a> will most likely change in the future, and use of information 
    that we gather now is subject to the privacy policy in effect at the time 
    of our use of said information. You should check our web site frequently 
    to see recent changes. We provide the current version number and last 
    date of change for help identifying updated policies.</p>
