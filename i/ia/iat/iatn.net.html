      <h3><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Summary of our Policy</font></h3>
      <p>iATN has always considered the protection of your private personal information 
        to be of the utmost importance. This privacy policy will detail exactly 
        what our policy is for keeping your information private, but a summary 
        of our policy is:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>We do not sell or rent your personal information to third parties.</li>
        <li>We do not share your personal information with advertisers or sponsors.</li>
        <li>We have zero tolerance for unsolicited commercial email (a.k.a. "spam").</li>
        <li>We encrypt credit card information and otherwise secure your personal 
          data.</li>
        <li>We will display the name, company name, position, and general location 
          (city, state, country, zipcode) of registered members in our public 
          member directory, and in other areas of our site, including any <a href="#interactive-content">Interactive 
          Content</a> created by said member.</li>
        <li>Any <a href="#interactive-content">Interactive Content</a> posted 
          to or sent through the network (e.g. TechMail, forum posts, etc.), is 
          not private and is not covered by this privacy policy.</li>
        <li>You may cancel your membership at any time if you do not wish your 
          information to be listed in our public member directory.<br>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>By accessing iATN, you are accepting the practices described in this 
        privacy policy. </p>
      <h3><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>What Personal Information 
        Does iATN Gather?</b></font></h3>
      <p>The information we receive from members helps us personalize and continually 
        improve the network. Here are the types of information we gather: 
      </p><ul>
        <li><b>Information You Give Us</b>: We receive and store any information 
          you enter on our web site or give to us in any other way. Some of the 
          most common situations in which this occurs include: registering to 
          join iATN, upgrading your account to sponsorship status, updating your 
          account settings, submitting a message to the network (including the 
          forums, TechMail help requests, file library, chat rooms, etc.), replying 
          to a TechMail help request sent by another member, purchasing something 
          from the iATN Store, corresponding with iATN staff, and more. <br>
          <br>
          You can choose not to provide certain information, but then you might 
          not be able to take advantage of many of our features. We use the information 
          that you provide for such purposes as responding to your requests, customizing 
          future features for you, improving and securing our site, and communicating 
          with our members. <br>
          <br>
          Any correspondence with iATN staff (by email, phone, FAX, postal mail, 
          or in person) is not guaranteed to be kept private unless you explicitly 
          request that it be, due to the fact that we may have to share some or 
          all of the information with others to respond adequately to comments, 
          questions, and concerns. <br>
          <br>
        </li>
        <li><b><a name="interactive-content"></a>Interactive Content</b>: We receive 
          and store any information entered on the "interactive" portions 
          of our network. We do not consider this information to be private, and 
          as such, this privacy policy does not govern that content. Examples 
          of such content include (but are not limited to): forum posts, chat 
          room discussions, <a href="http://members.iatn.net/techmail/">TechMail</a>, 
          comments on other members' content, etc.<br>
          <br>
          In addition, please note that the following personal information may 
          be permanently displayed with any Interactive Content you submit to 
          iATN: name, company name, position, city, state, country, and zipcode.<br>
          <br>
          Since we cannot prevent you from entering other personal information 
          with your Interactive Content, we cannot protect that private information 
          in that case, and it is not governed by this privacy policy. <br>
          <br>
          For example, if a member posts a message to our forums, and they include 
          their email address or phone number in the body of the message, we will 
          not be able to protect that private personal information.<br>
          <br>
          Interactive Content on iATN is also regulated by our <a href="http://www.iatn.net/disclaim.html">Terms 
          of Use</a>.<br>
          <br>
        </li>
        <li><b>Replies to TechMail</b>: Whenever you respond to another member's 
          <a href="http://members.iatn.net/techmail/">TechMail</a> help request 
          via email, your response is sent through our email servers, to be filtered 
          for attachments, known viruses, vacation notices or auto-replies, and 
          "spam" (unsolicited commercial email), and is then stored 
          in our database. These replies follow the same guidelines as those for 
          <a href="#interactive-content">Interactive Content</a>, and are likewise 
          regulated by our <a href="http://www.iatn.net/disclaim.html">Terms of 
          Use</a>.<a href="#interactive-content"> </a><br>
          <br>
        </li>
        <li><b>Automatic Information</b>: We receive and store certain types of 
          information whenever you interact with us, and each access of our web 
          site is recorded in logs which we can use for statistical and security 
          analysis. Each time you access our web site, your browser sends your 
          unique IP address, your browser name/version, your operating system 
          version, any "cookies" stored for iatn.net (more on cookies 
          below), the current resource requested, and usually the last page you 
          visited, called the "referrer link."<br>
          <br>
        </li>
        <li><b>Other Information</b>: Specific uses of personal information that 
          vary from this privacy policy, if any, may be found throughout our network. 
          If those uses are different than what has been disclosed here, you will 
          be notified beforehand as to the differences which will govern those 
          transactions.<br>
          <br>
          There may be situations where iATN collects data through a survey, web 
          form, or similar process when the page does not link to this privacy policy. In those cases, unless you are informed otherwise, you should 
          assume that iATN treats all information from those pages as it treats 
          its other valuable business records.<br>
          <br>
        </li>
        <li><b>Information from Third-Parties</b>: We do not actively collect 
          personal information from any outside sources. However, your personal 
          information may be supplied to us by a third-party in the event of a 
          complaint or legal matter. In those cases, this personal information 
          is not governed by this privacy policy.<br>
          <br>
        </li>
        <li><b>Through Network Maintenance</b>: During the course of testing and 
          updates to the software on iATN, certain staff members may see information 
          that you submit in a context that seems private, such as sending email 
          to another member on our network, through our web site. We try to avoid 
          these circumstances, but live testing is often required while improving 
          or repairing the network. <br>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">More Information on Cookies</font></b> 
      </h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Cookies are simply pieces of information stored in your browser, specific 
          to the site that sends them to your browser. They are very useful for 
          making iATN easy to use, and they are essential to our "automatic 
          login" feature, which allows members to access the secured areas 
          of our site without having to manually login each time. (An optional 
          feature available to all members.)<br>
          <br>
        </li>
        <li>No other site can access iATN's cookies, and we cannot access other 
          site's cookies. All cookies are stored on your computer hard drive, 
          except for "temporary cookies," which exist only in memory 
          while your browser is open. (In general, we only use permanent cookies.)<br>
          <br>
        </li>
        <li>We use cookies to store certain preferences you have selected for 
          viewing our site, your username, and your encrypted password. As we 
          develop the site further, we may increase the number of cookies in use. 
          We will NEVER store critical information in cookies, such as credit 
          card numbers, due to security concerns.<br>
          <br>
        </li>
        <li>There are many programs available to you that can block all cookies 
          sent to your browser. Blocking iATN cookies may result in making iATN 
          harder to enjoy (or eliminate certain features completely). We recommend 
          that you leave cookies turned on. However...<br>
          <br>
        </li>
        <li> You may tell your browser to ignore "3rd-party cookies" 
          or cookies that are not sent "by the originating server," 
          with no ill effect on iATN. Those types of cookies are normally used 
          by advertising sites to track your movements. We do NOT use those types 
          of cookies.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3></h3>
      <h3><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Does iATN Share the Information 
        It Receives?</b></font></h3>
      <p>Information about our members is an important part of our business, and 
        we take great pains not to reveal the following private personal information 
        to others: email address, username, password, phone number, street address 
        (not including city, state, country, zipcode), and credit card information. 
        Only authorized iATN staff, agents, and credit card processors have access 
        to private member information, and even then only in a tightly controlled 
        manner. 
      </p><ul>
        <li><b>Agents of iATN</b>: We currently employ one outside agency, <a href="http://www.lsoft.com/">L-Soft</a>, 
          which only has access to iATN member names and email addresses, for 
          the express purpose of delivering portions of iATN email to them. In 
          the normal course of the day, no one at L-Soft directly interacts with 
          your information. We have your name and email address securely stored 
          in their "email list server," and only if a problem occurs 
          would any L-Soft staff see your address. Both iATN and L-Soft work hard 
          to ensure the privacy of your information.<br>
          <br>
        </li>
        <li> <b>Credit Card Processing</b>: If you purchase something from the 
          <a href="http://members.iatn.net/store/">iATN Store</a>, or <a href="http://members.iatn.net/upgrade/">upgrade 
          your iATN account</a> to sponsoring member status, your name, billing 
          &amp; shipping addresses, purchase information, and credit card information 
          is necessarily shared with our credit card processing companies to complete 
          the transaction. We are currently using Authorize.Net and VeriSign for 
          credit card processing services. All communication between our servers 
          and theirs is encrypted with SSL 128-bit security to protect your information 
          while in transit.<br>
          <br>
        </li>
        <li><b>Aggregate and Anonymous Information</b>: iATN may share aggregate 
          and/or anonymous statistics and related information with third parties. 
          At no time will any personally-identifiable information be included. 
          Most of this information will be in the form of network growth, usage 
          statistics and demographics of registered members. <br>
          <br>
        </li>
        <li><b>Corporate Sponsors</b>: iATN has several <a href="http://www.iatn.net/atn/">corporate 
          sponsors</a> which subsidize the network and provide great support to 
          our members. At no time have we ever shared your personal information 
          with these companies, nor will we in the future without your express 
          consent.<br>
          <br>
        </li>
        <li><b>Member Sponsor Webpages</b>: Those members that upgrade their account 
          to sponsorship status receive the ability to maintain a webpage on iATN 
          that can be used to supply as much or as little information about themselves 
          as they wish. Many members choose to reveal their postal address, phone 
          number, FAX number, email address, and more. iATN does not control what 
          personal information sponsoring members choose to display on their pages, 
          and each sponsor is able to update their webpage at any time to add 
          or remove such information.<br>
          <br>
        </li>
        <li><b>Member Directory / Signature</b>: Members of iATN agree (upon registration) 
          to allow us to display their full name, company name, position, city, 
          state, and country in our <a href="http://www.iatn.net/dir/">member 
          directory</a>. This information is thus freely available to anyone browsing 
          the iATN web site, and is not protected by iATN. If they do not wish 
          to have this information displayed, they can <a href="http://members.iatn.net/config/#account_cancellation">cancel 
          their iATN account</a>, and their listing in the directory will be removed 
          within one week. <br>
          <br>
          In addition, this same personal information is displayed, to some extent, 
          with all <a href="#interactive-content">Interactive Content</a> created 
          on iATN (any messages posted to the forums, TechMail help request system, 
          chat rooms on iATN, etc.). We feel that requiring this minimum amount 
          of personal information on your content on the network is necessary 
          to add legitimacy to iATN. You may choose not to submit <a href="#interactive-content">Interactive 
          Content</a> on iATN if you do not wish to reveal this personal information 
          in this instance. <br>
          <br>
        </li>
        <li><b>Business Transfers</b>: In the unlikely event that iATN (or substantially 
          all of its assets) are acquired, member information will most likely 
          be one of the transferred assets. However, before such a transfer takes 
          place, we would require that the acquiring company abide by this privacy 
          policy when dealing with member information, and/or we will give members 
          the opportunity to "opt out," at which point their information 
          would NOT be transferred. <br>
          <br>
        </li>
        <li><b>Third-Party Web Sites</b>: iATN does not control the privacy practices 
          of its advertisers, sponsors, and other third-party sites that it promotes 
          or links to. If you click through a banner ad or link and submit your 
          information to a third-party, you will be subject to their privacy policies.<br>
          <br>
        </li>
        <li><b>Private Email from Members</b>: As explained in this policy, iATN 
          does not reveal your email address to other members (although you may 
          have decided to release that information in <a href="#interactive-content">Interactive 
          Content</a> submitted on our network, which we cannot control). However, 
          we DO make it possible for other members to contact you on iATN through 
          the use of a form on our website. Your email address is never revealed 
          to the member in this case. They would see only your non-private personal 
          information, such as your name, company name, position, and general 
          location (city, state, country, zipcode). We may also allow the general 
          public to send private email to members in the same fashion.<br>
          <br>
        </li>
        <li><b>Breach of Terms of Use, Guidelines, Etc.</b>: In the event that 
          a registered member breaches our <a href="http://www.iatn.net/disclaim.html">Terms 
          of Use</a>, <a href="http://www.iatn.net/guide.html">our guidelines</a>, 
          the <a href="http://www.iatn.net/join.asp">member agreement</a>, or 
          the laws governing iATN and its members, we reserve the right to use 
          any information we have obtained from said member -- personal, or otherwise 
          -- to (among other things) protect the property, safety, and rights 
          of iATN. Under these circumstances, said information is not governed 
          by this privacy policy.<br>
          <br>
        </li>
        <li><b>With Your Consent</b>: Other than as set out above, you will receive 
          notice in the unlikely event that information about you might go to 
          third parties, and you will have an opportunity to choose not to share 
          the information. <br>
          <br>
        </li>
        <li><b>Unforeseen Circumstances</b>: Due to the existing regulatory environment, 
          we cannot ensure that all of your private communications and other personal 
          information will never be disclosed in ways not otherwise described 
          in this privacy policy. For example: third parties may unlawfully intercept 
          or access transmissions or private communications; authorities may supply 
          search warrants for our premises; a program error, hardware glitch, 
          network problem, or other technical issue may inadvertantly reveal personal 
          information; we may need to disclose personal information to enforce 
          our <a href="http://www.iatn.net/disclaim.html">Terms of Use</a>, or 
          to protect the property, safety, and rights of iATN. Therefore, although 
          we constantly strive to protect your privacy, we do not promise, and 
          you should not expect, that your personally identifiable information 
          or private communications will always remain private.<br>

      <h3><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>How Secure Is Information 
        About Me?</b> </font></h3>
      <ul>
        <li>We work to protect the security of your credit card information during 
          transmission by using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software, usually with 
          the largest key-lengths available.<br>
          <br>
        </li>
        <li>We display only the last four digits of your credit card numbers when 
          confirming the processing of your credit card information. Of course, 
          we securely transmit the entire credit card number (using SSL) to the 
          appropriate credit card company during card processing.<br>
          <br>
        </li>
        <li> Any credit card numbers stored in our computer database are protected 
          using very strong encryption, of which only authorized staff members 
          have key knowledge. We will also protect physical access to the machine(s) 
          on which the secured database resides, and network access to the machine(s) 
          will be severely prohibited or denied entirely.<br>
          <br>
        </li>
        <li>We do not disclose member passwords to any party that cannot validate 
          their identity, except to those who can receive email at the same address 
          used to create the membership. (Thus, you must maintain the security 
          of your personal email account if you wish to keep your iATN account 
          secure.) <br>

      <h3><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>What Information Can I 
        Access?</b></font></h3>
      <p>We provide an <a href="http://members.iatn.net/config/">Account Settings</a> 
        page where registered members can view their personal information stored 
        on iATN. Most of this information can be updated by members from that 
        same location. (Note that when you update information, we usually keep 
        a copy of the prior version for our records.) If there is any personal 
        information listed in that area which you cannot change directly, such 
        as your name, please contact <a href="mailto:support@iatn.net">iATN Support</a>.

      <h3><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">What Choices Do I Have?</font></b> 
      </h3>
      <ul>
        <li>You can always choose not to provide information to us<a href="/exec/obidos/tg/cm/top-reviewers-list/-/1/102-7655709-0898503"></a>, 
          although this may result in the inability to use certain or all parts 
          of iATN, including the entire members-only area of our network.<br>
          <br>
        </li>
        <li>You can add or update certain information in the <a href="http://members.iatn.net/config/">Account 
          Settings</a> area of our site. When you update information, we usually 
          keep a copy of the prior version for our records.<br>
          <br>
        </li>
        <li> If you do not wish to receive email from iATN, you must cancel your 
          account, also available near the bottom of the <a href="http://members.iatn.net/config/">Account 
          Settings</a> page.<br>

          Restricting the cookies accepted from iATN by your browser may have 
          a negative impact on your ability to use iATN.<br>

        <li>Many third-party programs exist to allow you to control and limit

      <h3><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">What Happens When I Cancel 
        My iATN Account?</font></h3>
      <p>If you cancel your iATN membership account, you will no longer receive 
        email from us, and your name, company, position, and location will no 
        longer be listed in our member directory. (Please allow up to one week 
        for this to be completed.) <br>
        <br>
        Your personal information will remain in our database, though your account 
        will be flagged as "cancelled," and only iATN staff will have 
        access to this information (except where noted above in regards to your 
        name, company name, position, and general location appearing with all 
        <a href="#interactive-content">Interactive Content</a>). This information 
        will still be subject to this privacy policy, regardless of account status. 
        <br>
        <br>
        We keep this information to prevent duplicate accounts from being created, 
        to prevent fraudulent use of iATN, and to allow people to re-activate 
        their accounts in the future more easily. (Registration forms would not 
        have to be completed again.)<br>
        <br>
        PLEASE NOTE: Any <a href="#interactive-content">Interactive Content</a> 
        you previously submitted to iATN will still be displayed and used by iATN, 
        and cannot be removed from the network. For more information on our Interactive 
        Content policies, please consult our <a href="http://www.iatn.net/disclaim.html">Terms 
        of Use</a>.</p>
      <h3><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Does iATN Collect Information 
        From Children?</b></font></h3>
      <p>iATN does not currently offer any services to children, and therefore 
        does not knowingly accept membership or other information from those under 
        18 years of age.</p>
