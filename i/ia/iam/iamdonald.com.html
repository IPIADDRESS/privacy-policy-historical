<h4>Email List Information Collection</h4>
<p>
For each visitor that signs up for our email list, we collect only the
information that is requested on the list signup form. Required fields are 
denoted with an asterisk (*). Our web servers may collect the
domain name or IP address of visitors to our web page(s). Unless otherwise
stated on our web site, we collect the email addresses of those who communicate
with us via email and information volunteered by you such as but not limited to
list signup information, survey information, and/or site registrations. 
We also may collect clickstream information. 
In our email messages to you which are distributed through
this list, we may have information from third party providers for products and
services which may be advertised or promoted within messages we send to you
from this email list--the privacy policies of those third-party provider sites
govern the method by which they collect and use such information.</p>

<h4>Use of Web Site Information Collected</h4>
<p>
The information we collect may be used to create an aggregate demographic
profile of our user base and those of the MailerMailer email list
management service so that we and MailerMailer can improve content and services
and provide aggregate information to potential advertisers (no individual
information is provided to any third-party without your consent), to customize
the content and/or layout of our email messages or pages for each individual
visitor, to notify you about updates to our web site and services, to send you
our opt-in e-mail newsletter(s), to provide you with the products and/or
services for which you signed-up or registered, which may include sending
service disruption notices or other service- or product-related information via
email, and is not shared with other organizations for commercial purposes
without your consent.   We may share collected information with another company in 
the event that we merge with or are acquired by another company.  Upon request, 
we will provide you with the information (e.g., email address, name, etc.) that 
we maintain about you.</p>

the future, please follow the "unsubscribe" instructions contained in
the newsletter(s).</p>

<h4>Postal Address Collection and Use</h4>
<p>

information for which you provided us your address. If you supply us with your
telephone number, you will only receive telephone contact from us with
information regarding your inquiry.</p>

<h4>Cookies</h4>

content based on your browser type or other information.</p>

<h4>Ad Servers and Other Partners</h4>
<p>
To try and bring you offers and information that may be of interest to you, we
may have relationships with other companies that we allow to place ads or
provide other services or products in our e-mail newsletter(s). As a result of
your visit to our site, these companies may collect non-personally-identifiable
information such as your domain type, your IP address and clickstream

<h4>Security</h4>
<p>
We and MailerMailer, providers of the email list management service used
for this list, strive to maintain appropriate security measures in our
respective physical facilities to protect against the loss, misuse or
alteration of information that we have collected from you for being part of our
email list. Although we and MailerMailer take reasonable measures to secure our
data, we cannot guarantee that the measures taken are or will remain adequate.
Since we may include links from messages sent to the email list to other companies'
web sites, please refer to the privacy policies of those sites for information
on how they handle security for information they collect.
</p>

<h4>Changes to Email List Privacy Policy</h4>
<p>
From time to time, we may use customer information for new, unanticipated uses
not previously disclosed in this Email List Privacy Policy notice. If our
information practices change at some time in the future, we will post the
policy changes to this Email List Privacy Policy page to notify you of these
changes and provide you with the ability to opt out of our list. If you are
concerned about how your information is used, you should check back at this
Email List Privacy Policy page periodically.</p>
