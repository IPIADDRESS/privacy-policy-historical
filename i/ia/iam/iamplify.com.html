<hr class="thick">
iAmplify, LLC ("iAmplify") is very sensitive to the privacy concerns of iAmplify customers and visitors to our website (the "Site") at www.iamplify.com (collectively, the "iAmplify users"). This iAmplify Online Privacy Policy ("Privacy Policy") explains our practices with respect to the collection, use, and disclosure of personal and non-personal information provided by iAmplify users.
