Any processing performed by any recipients will be governed by the necessary data processing agreement in the form and substance required by applicable law, thereby preserving your and/or your referred players rights under applicable data protection laws.</p>
<h2>Your responsibility towards your referred players</h2>
<p>If you yourself receive and process personal information from players that you subsequently refer to us then you shall ensure that they have given their express consent to such transfer to us and this personal information is processed and transferred by you to us in accordance with relevant laws but in any event under terms no less stringent that those set out herein.

<h2>To whom your and/or your referred players information is disclosed ("recipients")</h2>
