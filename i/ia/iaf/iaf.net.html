<p align="left"><font color="#000080">iaf.net promotes responsible use and
dissemination of information. We fully support and adhere to the Individual Services
Group Principles (IRSG), the GLB act, and the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA).</font></p>
</font>

<p align="left"><font size="2" color="#000080">All information provided by iaf.net
is either from public records or publicly available information. The products provided are intended to be used for locating individuals for
various lawful purposes, e.g. reuniting old friends, finding lost relatives,
re-establishing business contacts, adoption reunification, class reunion searches, and
other harmless activities of sorts.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="2" color="#000080">But we don't stop there. As a
self imposed rule, we also DO NOT maintain nor
sell information on known minors, celebrities, government officials, or members
of law enforcement. Additionally, we NEVER provide full social security numbers
or full date of births to anyone in any of our reports.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="2" color="#000080">Furthermore, we at iaf.net
have put in place another level of scrutiny. Although the order taking process is
automated, the order processing part isn't. Another filter for inappropriate
requests is placed on all incoming orders which are reviewed by a live person in our Compliance
Dept. who runs the order through
a series of checks and balances which allows us to catch suspicious orders.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="2" color="#000080">To enable this level of
filtering, all orders placed with us require full disclosure of buyer's
identity, including name, address and phone, which many of our competitors do
not. This allows us to enforce the various
filtering and alarm mechanisms we have in place, and often to check with the
buyer on the validity and motive of their order. We cannot reveal what these
filters are in this
page so as not to give someone a chance to circumvent them, but they do work and
as a matter of extremely safe and conservative practices on our part, we end up turning
down approx. 1% of all orders. These same
mechanisms are also used to protect both the buyer and us from online fraud.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="2" color="#000080">We are committed to protect your privacy and credit
while providing the highest quality data possible to our customers, and&nbsp; maintaining a high degree of respect for the sensitive nature of
the information provided. As a matter of policy, iaf.net will not sell information
to individuals who do not agree to its lawful use, nor to anyone under the age of 18. Nor
will it sell information about individuals who it knows to be under the age of 18. <br>
<br>
<em><u>What about me the buyer?</u></em><br>
