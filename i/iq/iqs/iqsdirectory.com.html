<p class="p4"><span class="s1"><b>To provide online forums</b>
Some services available on our websites permit you to participate in interactive discussions, post comments, opportunities, or other content to a bulletin board or exchange, or otherwise engage in networking activities. Some of these services are moderated; all may be accessed for technical reasons (for example, for improvements or fixes). Industrial Quick Search, Inc. does not control the content that users post to these forums or social networks. You should carefully consider whether you wish to submit personal information to these forums or social networks and tailor any content you submit appropriately and in accordance with the relevant terms of use.

These third-parties are restricted from using this data in any way other than to provide services for Industrial Quick Search, Inc. or for the collaboration in which they and Industrial Quick Search, Inc. are contractually engaged (for example, hosting an Industrial Quick Search, Inc. database or engaging in data processing on Industrial Quick Search, Inc.’s behalf). These third-parties are carefully selected by Industrial Quick Search, Inc. and obligated to keep your data secure.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"><b>To get feedback or input from you</b>
In order to deliver products and services of the most interest to our audience and Customers, from time to time, we may ask existing advertisers and Users to provide us with input and feedback (for example, through surveys, usability studies, and focus groups).</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"><b>To Forward to a Friend</b>
We use third-party email addresses provided for the "email a friend" feature only for the purpose of sending newsletters, Product Alerts or webinar invitations to a subscriber-specified third-party, and for no other purpose.</span></p>

<p class="p6"><span class="s1">The instructions to review, amend, or delete your information may be found in the edit profile area on our site –</span><span class="s5">email <a href="mailto:copro@industrialquicksearch.com"><span class="s6">copro@industrialquicksearch.com</span></a> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Users may change information at any time and as often as necessary. Users who are experiencing problems with our services, or who have questions about how our services work, can contact us by sending an email to: <a href="mailto:copro@industrialquicksearch.com"><span class="s7">copro@industrialquicksearch.com</span></a></span></p>

<ul class="ul1">
 	<li class="li4"><span class="s1"><b>Registration Password</b></span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">Your profile information is password-protected to control access to this information by third-parties. We recommend that you do not divulge your password to anyone. Industrial Quick Search, Inc. never asks for passwords in unsolicited phone calls or unsolicited emails. Remember to sign out and close your browser window when you have finished using any of our sites.

<p class="p4"><span class="s1">To contact us regarding a privacy issue, please send an e-mail to <a href="mailto:copro@industrialquicksearch.com"><span class="s7">copro@industrialquicksearch.com</span></a>. Where applicable, please be sure to include the site, or product so that we may better serve you.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Technical Information</b></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">We collect information about the services you use and how you use them (e.g., viewing a technical video, visiting an advertiser’s page on our site, or reading an article in the News &amp; Analysis section). This information includes:</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"><b>Device Information</b>
We collect device-specific information (e.g., hardware model, operating system version, unique device identifiers, and mobile network information).</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"><b>Logging Practices</b>
Industrial Quick Search, Inc. automatically records the Internet Protocol (IP) addresses of visitors. The IP address is a unique number assigned to every computer on the internet. Generally, an IP address changes each time you connect to the internet (it is a "dynamic" address). Note, however, that if you have a broadband connection, depending on your individual circumstance, the IP address that we collect may contain information that could be deemed identifiable. This is because, with some broadband connections, your IP address doesn't change (it is "static") and could be associated with your personal computer.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">We track pages visited on Industrial Quick Search, Inc.’s websites, the amount of time spent on those pages, and the types of searches done on them. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Industrial Quick Search, Inc. also captures and stores information that you transmit. This may include:</span></p>

<ul class="ul1">
 	<li class="li4"><span class="s1">Browser/Device type/version</span></li>
 	<li class="li4"><span class="s1">Operating system used</span></li>
 	<li class="li4"><span class="s1">Media Access Control (MAC) address</span></li>
 	<li class="li4"><span class="s1">Date and time of the server request</span></li>
 	<li class="li4"><span class="s1">Volume of data transferred</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"><b>Unique Application Numbers</b>
Certain services include a unique application number. This number and information about your installation (for example, the operating system type and application version number) may be sent to Industrial Quick Search, Inc.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"><b>Local Storage</b>
We may collect and store information (including personal information) locally on your device using mechanisms such as browser web storage (including HTML 5) and application data caches.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"><b>Cookies and Web Beacons</b>
Cookies and web beacons are electronic placeholders that are placed on your device by websites to track your individual movements on that website over time. Industrial Quick Search, Inc. uses both session-based cookies (which last only for the duration of the user's session) and persistent cookies (which remain on your device and provides information about the session you are in and waits for the next time you use that site again).</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">These cookies and web beacons provide useful information to Industrial Quick Search, Inc., enabling us to recognize repeat users, facilitate the user's access to and use of our sites, allows us to track usage behavior, and to balance the usage of our websites on all Industrial Quick Search, Inc. web servers.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Tracking cookies, third-party cookies, and other technologies such as web beacons may be used to process additional information, enable non-core functionalities on the Industrial Quick Search, Inc. website and enable third-party functions (such as a social media "share" link). We may also include web beacons and other similar technology in promotional email messages to determine whether the messages have been opened.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"><b>Third-Party and Co-branded Web Sites</b>
Some Third-Party Content made available through other organizations is maintained on the website of the content provider, and not on the Industrial Quick Search, Inc. site. This means that when you click through to that Third-Party Content, you will be leaving the Industrial Quick Search, Inc. website. It will be clear to you when this happens, as the look and feel of your web page will change, and the URL will no longer refer to a website owned and operated by Industrial Quick Search, Inc.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Industrial Quick Search, Inc. websites may contain links to other websites. Industrial Quick Search, Inc. is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such sites. Users should be aware of this when they leave our site and review the privacy statements of each website they visit that collects information. This Privacy Policy applies solely to information collected by Industrial Quick Search, Inc.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"><b>Disclosure of Anonymous, Aggregated Information</b>
Industrial Quick Search, Inc. provides summary reports to our Affiliates, Customers and other third-party suppliers, advertisers, and service providers, based on our analysis of clickstream data. This aggregated information is anonymous and does not disclose any personal data about individual users.</span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Industrial Quick Search, Inc. reserves the right to share your information to respond to duly authorized information requests of governmental authorities or where required by law.</span></p>
