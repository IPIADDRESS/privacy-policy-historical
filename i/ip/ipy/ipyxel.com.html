                        growth.

                        Our primary goals in collecting personally identifiable information are to provide you with the

                        may provide on our software platforms as a requirement to fully utilize the software capabilities.
                        These private user information will only be used to internally troubleshoot problems, detecting

                        and protecting against errors, preventing fraudulent and criminal activity, to analyze and
                        improve our services to you, to enforce our Terms of Use, to fulfill your requests for certain

                        become a registered user, and to submit certain personally identifiable information to
                        ThriveTracker. This may happen in a number of instances, such as when you sign up for a free
                        trial of the Subscription Services or you download materials from the Site, if you desire to
                        receive our newsletter or other marketing materials and information, or if you wish to enter into a
                        contests, sweepstakes or promotions (collectively, “Promotions”) we provide via the Site.
                        Personally identifiable information that we may collect in such instances may include your user
                        name, password, company title (if applicable), email address, physical address and telephone
                        number. If you decide to become a paying customer for the Subscription Services, we may
                        collect additional information from you, such as your credit card number or other billing
                        information. If you contact us by email through the Site, we may keep a record of your contact
                        information and correspondence, and may use your email address, and any information that you
                        provide to us in your message, including any information you may provide about your
                        advertising spending, to respond to you. In addition, we may use your contact information to
                        market to you, and provide you with information about, our products and services, including but
                        not limited to our Subscription Services. If you decide at any time that you no longer wish to
                        receive such information or communications from us, please follow the unsubscribe instructions

                        When you visit the Site, our servers automatically record information that your browser sends
                        whenever you visit a web site (“Log Data”). This Log Data may include information such as your
                        internet protocol (“IP”) address, browser type or the domain from which you are visiting, the
                        web-pages you visit, the search terms you use, and any advertisements on which you click. For
                        most users accessing the Internet from an Internet service provider the IP address will be
                        different every time you log on. Except in the instances described herein, we do not use this
                        information to identify you personally. We use it to monitor the use of the Site and of any
                        services or Promotions we provide via the Site including our Subscription Services, and for the
                        Site’s technical administration. But the same pieces of information are considered non-
                        identifying information when they are taken alone or combined only with other non-identifying
                        information (for example, your viewing preferences). For users of the Subscription Services
                        only, we may combine your personally identifiable information with non-identifying information
                        and aggregate it with information collected from Site users to attempt to provide you with a
                        better experience, to improve the quality and value of the services and Promotions we provide
                        via the Site and to analyze and understand how our Site, services and Promotions are used.

                        Subscription Services. A cookie is a small data file that we transfer to your computer’s hard disk.

                        We do not use cookies to collect personally identifiable information. ThriveTracker may use both
                        session cookies and persistent cookies to better understand how you interact with the Site and

                        usability and performance of the Site. A session cookie enables certain features of the Site and

                        We also use “”web beacons,” “pixel tags,” “clear GIFs” or similar means (individually or
                        collectively “Tags”) on our Site and on Customer Sites. A Tag is an electronic image, often a
                        single pixel, embedded on web pages. Tags are ordinarily not visible to users. Tags allow us to
                        count the number of users who have visited certain pages of the Site or Customer Sites, to
                        deliver branded services and to generate statistics about how our Site and Customer Sites are
                        used.

                    <p>
                        We use the services of third party companies to help us carry out and measure the
                        effectiveness of our own and Customer advertising campaigns. For example, these third party
                        companies may ensure that you are shown ads at appropriate frequencies, so that you do not
                        see the same ad repeatedly. As part of these services, one or more Tags may be placed on the
                        Site and on Customer Sites. These Tags do not enable third parties to collect your name, e-mail
                        address, phone number or other similar information that directly identifies you. Rather, when
                        you visit the Site or Customer Sites, these Tags will direct your web browser to contact these
                        third party companies, at which time they may set or read a cookie on your device and collect
                        information about your visit – such as your IP address, cookie ID, which parts of the websites
                        are viewed or clicked, and date/time information.

                    <p>
                        Currently, we use our own Tags on the Site and on Customer Sites to enable collection of
                        information about visitors to our Site and such Customer Sites.

                    <p>
                        We use information collected from Tags to gather non-personally identifiable information,
                        including, but not limited to, your computer’s IP address, browser type or the webpage you were
                        visiting before you came to our Site or the applicable Customer Site, pages of our Site or the
                        applicable Customer Site that you visit, the time spent on those pages, information you search
                        for on our Site or on the applicable Customer Site, access times and dates, and other statistics.
