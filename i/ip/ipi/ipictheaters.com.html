<p style="color: #cb9f67; font-weight: bold;"><a name="thirdparty">THIRD PARTY AD NETWORKS AND ANALYTICS PROVIDERS</a></p>

<p>Although the Services
currently do not display ads from third parties, we work with network
advertisers, ad agencies, third party traffic measurement services and other
vendors to provide us with information regarding traffic on the Services, to
serve our advertisements on other web sites, within third party applications,
and other places online, and to provide us with information regarding the use
of the Services and the effectiveness of our advertisements. For example, if
you clicked on an iPic advertisement that led you to our Services, our service
provider(s) may be able to tell us which iPic advertisement you clicked on and
where you were viewing the advertisement. In connection with providing
analytics and advertisement services, our service providers may collect certain
information about your visits to this or other web sites. We do not share
Personal Information with these service providers, but they may set and access
their own tracking technologies on your computer or mobile device including (<a href="#cookies">cookies</a>
and <a href="#webbeacons">web beacons</a>) and may otherwise collect or have access to information about
you (such as your general interest in movies and entertainment and Usage
Information). Cookies and web beacons, including those set by third party
network advertisers, may be used to, among other things, target advertisements,
prevent you from seeing the same advertisements too many times and to conduct
research regarding the usefulness of certain advertisements to you. We may
share Usage Information about visitors with third party advertising companies,
analytics providers and other vendors for similar purposes.&nbsp; While we may use a
variety of service providers to perform advertising and analytics services, you
may wish to visit www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp which
provides information regarding this practice by Network Advertising Initiative
(“NAI”) members, including the “opt-out” procedures of NAI members.</p>

<p style="color: #cb9f67; font-weight: bold;">UPDATING YOUR ACCOUNT INFORMATION</p>

<p>You are
responsible for maintaining the accuracy of the information you submit to us. You
may review and update the information you have provided to us within the “your
account” feature on the Services, by calling us at (561)886-3232, or by writing
to us at iPic Theaters, Attn: Privacy Dept., 433 Plaza Real Boulevard, Suite
335, Boca Raton, FL. &nbsp;We will make good faith efforts to make requested changes
in our then active databases as soon as reasonably practicable. Note, however,
that information may persist internally for administrative purposes and that
residual data may remain on backup media or for other reasons. If you have made
any public postings on or through the Services, such as in a community forum,
these communications generally will not be removed; we reserve the right to
undertake traditional editorial functions concerning the content available
through the Services. </p>

<p style="color: #cb9f67; font-weight: bold;">THIRD
PARTY CONTENT, LINKS TO OTHER SITES, AND IPIC CONTENT FOUND OUTSIDE OF THE SERVICES</p>

<p>Certain
content provided through the Services may be hosted and served by third
parties, which may include third party widgets (such as those that allow you to
“like” or “share” content with third party web sites and online services). In
addition, the Services may link to third party web sites or content and iPic
content and widgets may be included on web pages and web sites that are not
associated with us and over which we have no control. These third parties may
independently collect data. iPic is not responsible for the privacy practices
or business practices of any third party.</p>

<p style="color: #cb9f67; font-weight: bold;">SECURITY</p>

<p>iPic takes
commercially reasonable security measures to protect the Personal Information
submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. For example,
when you enter certain Personal Information, such as a credit card number and
CCV2 number on our checkout forms, that information is encrypted using secure
socket layer (SSL) technology, to help protect the communications between you
and our payment partners. However, no method of electronic transmission or
method of electronic storage is 100% secure. Therefore, we cannot guarantee the
security of any information you submit and you do so at your own initiative and
risk.</p>

<p style="color: #cb9f67; font-weight: bold;">CONSENT TO TRANSFER</p>

<p>The Services
are operated in the United States. If you are located outside of the United
States, please be aware that information we collect will be transferred to and
processed in the United States. By using the Services, or providing us with any
information, you fully understand and unambiguously consent to this transfer,
processing and storage of your information in the United States, a jurisdiction
in which the privacy laws may not be as comprehensive as those in the country
where you reside and/or are a citizen.</p>

<p style="color: #cb9f67; font-weight: bold;">CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY</p>

<p>We may update
this Privacy Policy at any time and any changes will be effective upon posting.&nbsp;
However, we will use your Personal Information in a manner consistent with the
Privacy Policy in effect at the time you submitted the information, unless you
consent to the new or revised policy. </p>

<p style="color: #cb9f67; font-weight: bold;">QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS</p>

<p>If you have
questions or comments about this privacy policy, please contact us through the
applicable form available through the Services or contact us at:</p>

<p style="color: #cb9f67; font-weight: bold;">California Residents - Your CA Privacy Rights</p>

<p>Pursuant to
California Civil Code Section 1798.83, residents of the State of California
have the right to request from companies conducting business in California
certain information relating to third parties to which the company has
disclosed certain categories of personal information during the preceding year
for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes. Alternatively, the law
provides that a company may comply, as iPic does, by disclosing in its privacy
policy that it provides consumers choice (opt-out or opt-in) regarding sharing
personal information with third parties for those third parties’ direct
marketing purposes, and information on how to exercise that choice.&nbsp; As stated above
in this Privacy Policy, iPic provides you choice prior to sharing your personal
information with third parties for their direct marketing purposes. If you do
not opt-in or if you opt-out at the time iPic offers that choice, iPic does not
share your information with that identified third party for its direct
marketing purposes. </p>

<p>If you are a
California resident and you have questions about our practices with respect to
sharing information with third parties for their direct marketing purposes and
your ability to exercise choice, please send your request to us at the
following mailing address: Boca Raton, Attn: Privacy Department You must put
the statement "Your California Privacy Rights" in your writing. You
must include your name, street address, city, state, and zip code. We are not
responsible for notices that are not labeled or sent properly, or do not have
complete information.</p>
