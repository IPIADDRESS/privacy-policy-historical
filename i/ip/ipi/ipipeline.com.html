When you come to our Web site, our Web server sends a cookie to your computer. Cookies are files that Web browsers place on a computer's hard drive and are used to tell us whether customers and visitors have visited the Site previously.</p><p>Standing alone, cookies do not identify you personally. They merely recognize your browser. Session cookies exist only during an online session. They disappear from your computer when you close your browser software or turn off your computer.

They include such information as a unique identifier for your browser.</p><p>We use session cookies containing encrypted information to allow the system to uniquely identify you while you are logged in. This information allows us to process your online transactions and requests. Session cookies help us make sure you are who you say you are after you've logged in and are required in order to use our application. We use persistent cookies, that only we can read and use, to identify the fact that you are our user or prior Site visitor (whatever the case may be).

Finally, we provide unique user names and passwords that must be entered each time a user logs on (unless you are entering the system through another trusted website). These safeguards help prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the appropriate use of Personal Information.</p><p>Users are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality and security of their UserID and password.</p><p><strong>Opt-Out Policy</strong></p><p>If, at any time after using the service, you change your mind about sharing your information with third parties, send us a request specifying your new choice.
