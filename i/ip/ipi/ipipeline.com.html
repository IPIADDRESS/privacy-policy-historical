		<p><strong>Privacy Statement Effective as of April 12, 2007</strong></p>

		<p>Internet Pipeline, Inc. ("iPipeline", "we", "our" or "us") has created this privacy statement  
("Statement") in order to demonstrate our commitment to customer privacy. Privacy on the  
iPipeline web site (the "Site") is of great importance to us. Because we gather important  
information from our users, we have established this Statement as a means to communicate  
our information gathering and dissemination practices. This policy only applies to  
http://netrac.ipipeline.com, http://igoforms.ipipeline.com, www.ipipeline.com, and  
www.myagency.net and does not extend to the practices of other Web Sites that we may link  
to, companies that we do not own or control, or to people that we do not employ or manage.  
We reserve the right to change this Statement and will provide notification, through the Site, of  
the change at least thirty (30) business days prior to the change taking effect.</p>

<p><strong>Use of Personal Information  </strong></p>
  
<p>The iGOFORMS Site collects user and client information on behalf of insurance companies and  
other third parties to complete online insurance applications and other forms. A UserID and  
password is used to display the correct content within the Site. Personal Information collected  
on the Site is stored in an encrypted database and not used for marketing nor solicitation  
purposes by us.  </p>

<p>We may also access and use any Personal Information provided by you in order to perform any  
services which you request through the Site and, if necessary, to access such information to  
obtain contact information in order to provide notifications relating to these services to you. </p>
  
<p>We may also access and use any Personal Information provided by you in order to perform any  
services which you request through the Site and, if necessary, to access such information to  
obtain contact information in order to provide notifications relating to these services to you.  
We may also collect certain information from users of the Site, such as Internet addresses. This  
information is logged to help diagnose technical problems, and to administer our Site in order  
to constantly improve the quality of the Service. We may also track and analyze non-identifying  
and aggregate usage and volume statistical information from our users and provide such  
information to third parties.  </p>
  
<p><strong>Sharing of Personal Information  </strong></p>
  
<p>Our Site allows the user to print the information collected. Our Site also allows a user to submit  
and transmit the Personal Information to third parties through secure channels. Third parties  
include: insurance companies, brokerage general agencies, insurance agencies, paramedical  
companies, insurance technology vendors, and other parties who may provide services for the  
purpose for which the data was entered and transmitted.  </p>
  
<p><strong>Retention of Personal Information </strong></p>

<p>We shall retain Personal Information in accordance with federal, state and local laws, rules and  
regulations.  </p>
  
<p><strong>Updating Personal Information  </strong></p>
 
<p>Personal Information may be updated by the user entering the Site with a valid UserID and  
password and modifying the information on the Site. However, any Personal Information which  
has been electronically signed or submitted through the system may not be changed or  
deleted.  </p>
  
<p><strong>Cookies  </strong></p>
  
<p>When you interact with the Site we strive to make that experience easy and meaningful. When  
you come to our Web site, our Web server sends a cookie to your computer. Cookies are files  
that Web browsers place on a computer's hard drive and are used to tell us whether customers  
and visitors have visited the Site previously.  </p>
  
<p>Standing alone, cookies do not identify you personally. They merely recognize your browser.  
Session cookies exist only during an online session. They disappear from your computer when  
you close your browser software or turn off your computer. Persistent cookies remain on your  
computer after you've closed your browser or turned off your computer. They include such  
information as a unique identifier for your browser.  </p>
  
<p>We use session cookies containing encrypted information to allow the system to uniquely  
identify you while you are logged in. This information allows us to process your online  
transactions and requests. Session cookies help us make sure you are who you say you are after  
you've logged in and are required in order to use our application. We use persistent cookies,  
that only we can read and use, to identify the fact that you are our user or prior Site visitor  
(whatever the case may be). We are especially careful about the security and confidentiality of  
the information stored in persistent cookies. For example, we do not store account numbers or  
passwords in persistent cookies. Users who disable their Web browsers' ability to accept  
cookies will be able to browse our Website but will not be able to successfully use our Service.  </p>
 
<p><strong>Third Party Cookies  </strong></p>
  
<p>We may from time to time engage third parties to track and analyze non-personally identifiable  
usage and volume statistical information from visitors to our website to help us administer our  
website and improve its quality. Such third parties may use cookies to help track visitor  
behavior. Such cookies will not be used to associate individual website visitors to any personally  
identifiable information. All data collected by such third parties on behalf of iPipeline is used  
only to provide us with information on site usage and is not shared with any other third parties.  </p>
  
<p><strong>Third-Party Sites </strong></p>

<p>The Site may contain links to other web sites. We are not responsible for the privacy practices  
or the content of these other web sites. Users will need to check the policy statement of these  
others web sites to understand their policies. Users who access a linked site may be disclosing  
their private information. It is the responsibility of the user to keep such information private  
and confidential.</p>   

<p><strong>Security  </strong></p>

<p>Our Site has security measures in place to help protect against the loss, misuse, and alteration  
of the Personal Information under our control. When our Site is accessed using Microsoft  
Internet Explorer versions 5.5 or higher, Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology protects  
information using both server authentication and data encryption to help ensure that your  
Personal Information is safe, secure, and available only to you. We also implement an advanced  
security method based on dynamic data and encoded session identifications, and host the Site  
in a secure server environment that uses a firewall and other advanced technology to prevent  
interference or access from outside intruders. Finally, we provide unique user names and  
passwords that must be entered each time a user logs on (unless you are entering the system  
through another trusted website). These safeguards help prevent unauthorized access,  
maintain data accuracy, and ensure the appropriate use of Personal Information.  </p>
  
<p>Users are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality and security of their UserID and  
password.</p>
  
<p><strong>Opt-Out Policy</strong></p>
  
<p>If, at any time after using the service, you change your mind about sharing your information  
with third parties, send us a request specifying your new choice. Simply send your request to  
<a href="mailto:privacy@iPipeline.com">privacy@iPipeline.com</a>.</p>
