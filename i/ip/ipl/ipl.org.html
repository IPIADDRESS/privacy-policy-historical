<h1>The Internet Public Library's Privacy Statement</h1>


<p>The Internet Public Library has created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate our firm
commitment to privacy.  The following discloses our information gathering and dissemination
practices for this website: http://www.ipl.org. </p>

<p>We use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server, and to administer our web
site.  Your IP address may also be used to gather broad demographic information about our
users.  Please see our <a href="/about/circpol.html">Server Access Log Policy</a>
for more details. </p>

<p>This site contains links to other sites.  The Internet Public Library is not responsible for the
privacy policies or content of such web sites. </p>

<p>Our reference question forms ask visitors for contact information (like their e-mail address) and
demographic information (like age range and profession).  The visitors' contact information is
used to contact visitors when necessary, such as to respond to reference questions or other
comments you send to our site.  This site is experimental, which means it is used for research
purposes in addition to providing a service for visitors.  Any reference question you submit may
be used for educational or research purposes, as well as for demonstrations of our question
management system.  Your name and identifying information including your e-mail address will
be removed before being used for research and will not be supplied to any outside parties.  If
you DO NOT want your question included in our database, please do not submit a question.  If
you have previously submitted a question and would like it removed from consideration for
research purposes, please e-mail ipl@ipl.org.</p> 

<p>Our on-line surveys are anonymous and are used to improve our site and better serve our
patrons.  Demographic information is collected, but we do not ask for any personally
identifying information. </p>

<p>The Internet Public Library has a <a href="/about/update.html">listserv</a> mailing list.  Only those people who have requested
to be on this list are included.  If you would like to be removed from this list, please e-mail the
IPL with the word "unsubscribe" in the subject field.  We will not contact you unless you have requested to be added to our mailing list or you have submitted a reference question or
comment to our site.</p> 

<p>If you have any questions about this privacy statement, the practices of this site, or your
dealings with this web site, you can contact:
