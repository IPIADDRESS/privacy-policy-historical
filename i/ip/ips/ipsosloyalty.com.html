          <p>
		  The purpose of this Privacy Statement is to inform you about the practices and procedures of IPSOS (as follows, “we” or “us”) in handling Personal Information and to inform you about the Personal Information we collect about you (for example, when you participate in one of our surveys).

		  We are demonstrating our commitment to your privacy, by complying with the laws and regulations under applicable privacy laws in Canada, including the <em>Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act</em> (“PIPEDA”). 
		  </p>
          <p>
		  From time to time, we may make changes to this Privacy Statement. The Privacy Statement is current as of the “last revised” date which appears at the top of this page.  We will treat Personal Information in a manner consistent with the Privacy Statement under which it was collected and our Privacy Policy, unless we have your consent to treat it differently.  This Privacy Statement applies to any information we collect or receive about you, from any source.

          <h2><a name="1"></a>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;What is Personal Information?</h2>
          <p>
			<strong>Personal Information</strong> is any information that is identifiable with you.  This information may include but is not limited to your name, mailing address, phone numbers, email address, identification numbers and, in certain circumstances, your opinions and individual preferences.  Personal Information, however, does not include (i) your name, business title or business address and business telephone number and fax in your capacity as an employee of an organization; and (ii) depending on the jurisdiction, publicly available information.  However, if in your capacity as an employee of an organization you participate in one of our surveys, your responses will be treated as Personal Information.

		  <h2><a name="2"></a>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;How do we collect your Personal Information?</h2>
          <p>
			We will always collect your Personal Information by fair and lawful means (for example, when you respond to one of our surveys). We collect your Personal Information where we have obtained your consent to do so or as otherwise permitted by law. 
		  </p>
          <p><a href="#top">Return To Top</a></p>
          
		  <h2><a name="3"></a>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;How do we use your Personal Information?</h2>
          <p>
		 We identify the purposes for which we use your Personal Information at the time we collect such information from you and obtain your consent, in any case, prior to such use.  One of the primary purposes for which we collect your Personal Information is to conduct marketing and social research through conducting surveys.  We may also use your Personal Information as otherwise permitted by law.  If you provide us with sensitive personal information such as health or financial information, we will obtain your express consent for the collection, use and disclosure of sensitive personal information.

          <h2><a name="4"></a>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;To whom do we provide your Personal Information?</h2>
          <p>
			We identify to whom, and for what purposes, we disclose your Personal Information, at the time we collect such information from you and obtain your consent to such disclosure.  For example, we may disclose your Personal Information:
		  </p>
          <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
			<li>to a client of IPSOS for the client’s purposes of conducting further research;</li>
			<li>a third party engaged by IPSOS to perform functions on its behalf;</li>
			<li>such other disclosures of Personal Information to such persons for which you provide your consent; and</li>
			<li>as otherwise permitted by law.</li>
          </ol>
          <p><a href="#top">Return To Top</a></p>
          
		  <h2><a name="5"></a>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;When and how do we obtain your consent?</h2>
          <p>
			We obtain your consent prior to collecting, and in any case, prior to using or disclosing your Personal Information for any purpose.  You may provide your consent to us either orally or in writing.  For example, when you respond to a survey, you provide your consent to allow us to use your Personal Information for the purposes of conducting marketing and social research and, in certain circumstances, to disclose your Personal Information to our clients.  From time to time, we may collect, use or disclose your Personal Information based on your consent and as permitted by law.  If you provide us with sensitive Personal Information such as health or financial information, we will obtain your express consent for the collection, use and disclosure of such sensitive personal information.

		  <h2><a name="8"></a>8.&nbsp;&nbsp;How can you review your Personal Information that we have collected, used or disclosed?</h2>
          <p>
		 We will make available to you any specific Personal Information on you in our custody or control, that we have collected, used or disclosed, upon your written request, to the extent permitted by law.

		  <h2><a name="9"></a>9.&nbsp;&nbsp;How do you know that the Personal Information we have on you is accurate?</h2>
          <p>
		  We will ensure that your Personal Information is kept as accurate, complete and up-to-date as possible.  When we collect Personal Information from you, we rely on you for its accuracy.  When we collect personal information from other sources, we ask for a representation from such source as to the accuracy of such personal information.

          <p>
		 You can at any time, demonstrate in writing the accuracy or completeness of the Personal Information we have on you.  If you successfully demonstrate that the Personal Information we have on you is inaccurate or incomplete, we will amend the Personal Information as required.  Where appropriate, we will transmit the amended information to third parties having access to your Personal Information.

          <p>
		  We will not assess any costs to you for access to your Personal Information or on our Privacy Policy or practices without first providing you with an estimate of the approximate costs, if any.  You may withdraw your requests for access to information by notifying us within the thirty-day notice period disclosed on the estimate.
