<h3>Ipsos-NA 
Privacy Statement</h3>  <p align="right"><em>Last revised December 22, 2003</em></p>
  <p>The purpose of this Privacy Statement is to inform you about the practices and procedures of Ipsos-NA (as follows, “we” or “us”) in handling Personal Information and to inform you about the Personal Information we collect about you when you participate in one of our surveys. It explains how we use and disclose that information, the choices you have regarding such use and disclosure, and how you may correct that information.</p>  <p>We are proud to demonstrate our commitment to your privacy, by complying with the laws and regulations under applicable privacy laws in Canada, including the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (“PIPEDA”).</p>  <p>From time to time, we may make changes to this Privacy Statement. The Privacy Statement is current as of the “last revised” date which appears at the top of this page. We will treat Personal Information in a manner consistent with the Privacy Statement under which it was collected and our Privacy Policy, unless we have your consent to treat it differently. This Privacy Statement applies to any information we collect or receive about you, from any source.  </p>  <ol>

          <p></p><li><a name="1"></a><strong>What is Personal Information?</strong></li>
          <p>Personal Information is any information that is identifiable with you. This information may include but is not limited to your name, mailing address, phone numbers, email address, identification numbers and, in certain circumstances, your opinions and individual preferences. Personal Information, however, does not include (i) your name, business title or business address and business telephone number, fax and email in your capacity as an employee of an organization; and (ii) depending on the jurisdiction, publicly available information. However, if in your capacity as an employee of an organization you participate in one of our surveys, your responses will be treated as Personal Information.</p>

          <li> <a name="2"></a><strong>How do we collect your Personal Information?</strong><br>
            <p>
          We will always collect your Personal Information by fair and lawful means (for example, when you respond to one of our surveys). We collect your Personal Information where we have obtained your consent to do so or as otherwise permitted by law. </p>

            <p>
          We identify the purposes for which we use your Personal Information at the time we collect such information from you and obtain your consent, in any case, prior to such use. One of the primary purposes for which we collect your Personal Information is to conduct marketing and social research through conducting surveys. We may also use your Personal Information as otherwise permitted by law. If you provide us with sensitive personal information such as health or financial information, we will obtain your express consent for the collection, use and disclosure of sensitive personal information.</p>

          We identify to whom, and for what purposes, we disclose your Personal Information, at the time we collect such information from you and obtain your consent to such disclosure. For example, we may disclose your Personal Information:</p>
		  <p> 
		   </p><ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;"><li>to a client of Ipsos-NA for the client’s purposes of conducting further research;</li>
            <li>a third party engaged by Ipsos-NA to perform functions on its behalf;</li>
            <li>such other disclosures of Personal Information to such persons for which you provide your consent; and</li>
          <li>as otherwise permitted by law.</li>

          <li> <a name="5"></a><strong>When and how do we obtain your consent?</strong><p>
          We obtain your consent prior to collecting, and in any case, prior to using or disclosing your Personal Information for any purpose. You may provide your consent to us either orally or in writing. For example, when you respond to a survey, you provide your consent to allow us to use your Personal Information for the purposes of conducting marketing and social research and, in certain circumstances, to disclose your Personal Information to our clients. From time to time, we may collect, use or disclose your Personal Information based on your consent and as permitted by law.
