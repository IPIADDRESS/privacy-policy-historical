We use the Beauty Profile information to personalize your experience.  If you subscribe to our Glam Bag program then we will use the Beauty Profile information to send you Glam Bag items that fit your unique profile, alerts about ipsy products, services, and other beauty news that might interest you.</p>
                      <p>At the end of the beauty quiz, in order to join ipsy you must choose a username and password.  Your username will be visible to other ipsters when they visit the Site, so please choose carefully.  You also must provide a valid email address and your date of birth.  We use your email to communicate with you about our Site and your registration.  We ask for your date of birth to make sure you're old enough to use our Site and services.  And, of course, we also like to wish you a happy birthday.</p>
                      <p>If you provide us your email address but choose not to become a member, then  we will retain your email address for a period to invite you back to the Site.</p>

                      <p>We collect your credit card information through our Site. The credit card information is encrypted, and transmitted for storage to a high security vault according to strict industry standards. Once the data reaches the vault it is "tokenized".  No credit card information is retained in ipsy's own systems. Instead we retain a token associated with your account that has no intrinsic value. Your credit card information is not exposed anywhere in our own systems.  Please do not send your credit card information to our team directly, for example by emailing this information to an ipsyCare representative.  Please use our secure, online system to enter your credit card information.</p>

                      <p><em><strong>Public information you post on the Site.</strong></em>  Information you post publicly on our Site is intended for public consumption.  Please be aware that your username and profile image will be publicly displayed.  The date you joined ipsy and some information from your Beauty Profile (such as skin tone, hair color and eye color) will be publicly displayed under your user name, as well as reviews, photos, looks, videos and comments you choose to post. In addition, postings you make on our Site may appear when Internet users execute searches on the subject of your posting.</p>
                      <p>Site visitors may be able to identify you or associate you with your ipsy account if you include personal information in your account profile or in any content you post.

                      <p>You can reduce the risk of being personally identified by choosing a username and profile image that do not identify you and by taking care to exclude any personal information in your comments, reviews, looks, or videos. You can change your username and profile picture at any time by logging into your account.</p>
                      <p>Public information you post on other sites. We also may collect information you post publicly on third-party sites, but only if you choose to follow instructions we provide.

                        <li><p><strong>Cookies.</strong>  This is a small data file sent from a server to your web browser that is stored in your browser and sent back to the server each time the browser makes a request to the server.  Cookies can improve a site user's experience by, for example, allowing the site to keep a user logged in while browsing, saving a user's site preferences, and allowing a user to add items to a shopping cart and preserve cart contents between site visits, even when the user is not logged in.</p></li>
                        <li><p><strong>Clear gifs, web beacons, tracking pixels.</strong>  These are tiny graphics with a unique identifier. They function similarly to cookies and are used to track the online movements of web users. Unlike cookies which are stored on a user's computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded on web pages and are single pixel wide. ipsy does not tie information gathered by clear gifs to your personally identifiable information.</p></li>
                      </ul>
                      <p><strong>Tracking Technology Lifespans</strong></p>
                      <ul>
                        <li><p><strong>Single-session</strong> tracking technology:  lasts only as long as your site visit. Single-session cookies expire and delete themselves when you leave the site or close your browser. They are used for technical purposes such as enabling better navigation through a site or generating aggregated statistics about how a site is used. Single-session cookies do not publicly expose your personal information.</p></li>
                        <li><p><strong>Multi-session or persistent</strong> tracking technology:  remains on your browser or mobile device until you choose to delete it or the cookie expires. Persistent cookies are used to recognize a computer that has previously visited a site. This can improve the user's experience, for example by continuing preference settings from previous visits and by allowing users to login without entering a password with every site visit.</p></li>
                      </ul>
                      <p><strong>Tracking Purposes</strong></p>
                      <p>We use tracking technologies for these general purposes:</p>
                      <ul>
                        <li><p>Because it is <strong>strictly necessary</strong>.  This tracking is needed to make ipsy work properly.</p></li>
                        <li><p>For <strong>performance</strong>.  This tracking helps ipsy understand how the Site is functioning so ipsy can improve the Site.</p></li>
                        <li><p>For <strong>functionality</strong>.  This tracking retains your personal preferences as you use the Site.</p></li>
                        <li><p>For <strong>advertising</strong>.  This tracking gathers data to help deliver advertising to you that interests you.</p></li>
                      </ul>
                      <p><strong>Cookies ipsy currently uses</strong></p>
                      <ul>
                        <li><p>Single session cookies are used to ensure the Site displays correctly on your device.</p></li>
                        <li><p>Persistent cookies are used to measure Site metrics such as which pages are popular, how often people visit the Site, whether people are visiting the Site for the first time, and whether visitors make purchases on the Site.  They also are used to enhance Site functionality, for example to allow returning users to use the Site without logging in.</p></li>
                      </ul>
                      <p><strong>Cookies for email subscribers</strong></p>
                      <p>We may use cookies to measure the effectiveness of our email communications and to tailor email content. For example, we may connect the data showing that you clicked a link in an email from ipsy then completed an action on our Site such as buying a Glam Bag.  This links cookie data with an individual user, so we only do this for users who have consented and opted in to receiving emails from ipsy.</p>
                      <p><strong>Third Party Cookies</strong></p>
                      <p>ipsy partners with third-party service providers who set cookies and tracking pixels for Site visitors and members on our behalf in order to deliver their services. These services include targeted online marketing and analysis of data collected through cookies. These technologies allow a partner to recognize your computer or mobile device each time you visit ipsy.com or other sites that also utilize the third party's services, but do not allow access to personally identifiable information from ipsy.</p>
                      <p>Third parties may choose to include ipsy widgets on their sites. When you load a site that has chosen to include our widgets, we receive analytics information through a cookie that may be used to enhance our data or to improve our services.</p>
                      <p>ipsy does not have access to or control over these third-party technologies, and they are not covered by our Privacy Policy.</p>
                      <p><strong>Managing Cookies</strong></p>
                      <p>You can delete cookies stored in your browser at any time.  You also can choose not to accept cookies from any site, including ipsy.com, by changing the settings of your browser.  If you reject or block all cookies in your browser settings, then you will not be able to fully use ipsy's services.</p>
                      <p>ipsy does not currently act on "do not track" request headers.</p>
                      <p>For more information about cookies, including how to delete them from your computer and configure the type of browser you use to refuse cookies from any site, visit <a href="http://privacy.getnetwise.org/browsing/tools/" target="_blank">GetNetWise</a>.</p>

                    <li>
                      <p><strong>Information from other sources.</strong>  We may receive information about our users from third party social platforms, such as Facebook. When you access or use our site or mobile application through such a site, you allow us to access or collect information made available by the third party site in accordance with its privacy policy. This information may be available from your profile or account with the third party site or from cookies placed on your device by the third party site. Depending on your privacy settings this information may include: Facebook interests, gender, friends and location.</p>

                    <li>
                      <p><strong>Information collected automatically.</strong> We automatically collect information from your browser or device when you visit the Site. This information includes your IP address, device ID, your browser type and language, access times, the content of any undeleted cookies that your browser previously accepted from us, and the referring site address.This information also includes your operating system or application,&nbsp;your location, and your activities voluntarily have submitted to us (for example, your email address).</p>

                <li>
                  <strong>Other Information We Receive About You.</strong>
                  <p class="margin-top">As you might expect, we usually collect or receive information through our Site.  But we also may collect information offline, and it's important to us that we preserve the privacy of your personal information both online and off.  For example, if you call us to place an order, we ask for the shipping address needed to place that order. There are other ways we could learn of personal information offline, but this Privacy Policy doesn't try to predict all those methods.  We just want you to know that we try to treat offline information collection, uses, and disclosures consistently with our online privacy practices.</p>
                  <p>If you're not an ipsy member but we contacted you, then we may have received your contact information from one of your friends. An ipsy member may give us your name and email address so ipsy can send a personalized invitation to you to join ipsy.  We also may send you personalized email ‘reminders' about ipsy from your friends.  Similarly, an ipsy member may provide your personal information to us so we can ship a gift or other merchandise to you.  We ask your contacts to share your personal information only with your permission.</p>
                  <h1><strong>HOW WE MAY DISCLOSE THE INFORMATION WE COLLECT OR RECEIVE</strong></h1>
                  <p class="margin-top">Information we collect from you may be either personal or aggregate.  Personal information is identifiable to you, like your name, email address, shipping and billing addresses, credit card information, and phone number.  Aggregate information is summary data of the behaviors and interests of groups or categories, so it won't identify you.</p>
                  <ol>
                    <li><p><strong>Aggregate Information.</strong> We use aggregate information for the purposes of internal business research, sales and business development and reporting back to our brand partners.  We may share aggregated information about our visitor and user base with third parties such as our advertising partners.  This information may include the number of daily visitors to our Site and the number of orders placed on a certain date.  We also may share Beauty Profile information with brand partners.  We do not link aggregated data with our ipsters' personal information.</p></li>
                    <li><p><strong>Personal Information.</strong> We do not sell, rent, trade, license, or otherwise disclose your personal information to third parties, except in these limited circumstances:</p>
                      <ol type="a">
                        <li><p><strong>Disclosures to ipsy Agents, Consultants and Related Third Parties.</strong>   Like most Internet retailers, we use third parties to help ensure our business runs smoothly.  We disclose your information to these third-party companies so they can perform their specific functions for us.  For example, we may provide your name, shipping address, email and phone number to third-party shippers like the U.S. Postal Service and the United Parcel Service to deliver our products to you.  We also may provide your credit card information to third-party credit card processors and issuers to help us process your orders from us.  ipsy’s third party vendors may recognize a tracking code&nbsp;used by your browser or application to enable you to receive customized content, or to enable you to use other technologies such as tags and scripts.&nbsp;The tracking code may reflect de-identified demographic or other data linked to data you. When we employ other companies to perform functions of this nature, we only disclose the information that they need to perform their requested function. We do not authorize them to retain, share, store, or use personal information provided by us for any other purpose.</p></li>
                        <li><p><strong>Disclosures Required by Law or Otherwise.</strong>  We may disclose your personal information if we believe, in good faith, that it's necessary to: (1) comply with a legal obligation such as in response to a court order or subpoena; (2) protect the safety of fellow ipsters or the public; (3) protect against legal liability; or (4) protect and defend ipsy's rights or property.</p></li>
                        <li><p><strong>Disclosures for a Business Transaction or Insolvency.</strong>  We also may disclose your personal information in connection with an actual or proposed corporate transaction or insolvency proceeding involving all or part of ipsy's business or assets.  For example, if we merge with another company, we may disclose your personal information to that company, but the disclosure would be subject to our Privacy Policy.</p></li>
                        <li><p><strong>Disclosures of Giveaway Winners.</strong> We post the ipsy user names or social media handles of our lucky Giveaway winners on our Facebook page.</p></li>
                        <li><p><strong>Disclosures through Social Media.</strong> Remember that you control the privacy settings on each of your social media platforms. We allow you to share information from the Site to social media. In order for this to happen you first must opt-in. You can revoke permission to do this by logging into the social media service and disconnecting the ipsy application from there.</p></li>

              <ol>
                <li><p><strong>Log Into Your Account.</strong>  You can change the personal information you provide to us and remove any content you post publicly on our Site, including reviews, looks and videos, by logging into your ipsy account and making the appropriate changes.</p></li>

                <li><p><strong>Opt-Out.</strong>  You can always "opt-out" of having your personal information used for certain purposes.

              <h1><strong>HOW WE PROTECT YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION</strong></h1>
              <p class="margin-top">At ipsy, we take data security seriously.  We use technical, physical and administrative safeguards.  Online, we encrypt your personal information using Secure Sockets Layer ("SSL").  SSL allows for a private, reliable Site connection where your identity is authenticated with cryptography.  Offline, we restrict access to your personal information to only those ipsy employees who need it to perform a specific job function.   And we require all ipsy employees with access to your personal information to follow specific practices concerning its proper handling.  We also hold our vendors who need access to your personal information to strict confidentiality requirements.  Third-party service providers assist us with the physical security of some of our computer hardware.  When you visit our Site, you access servers that we backup constantly. Our servers are hosted at locations which are private and secure data center facilities, behind physical and virtual firewalls.</p>
              <p>But please remember, while we use industry-standard precautions to safeguard your personal information, we can't guarantee absolute security.  We wish we could, but 100% security just doesn't exist anywhere online or off.</p>
              
              <h1><strong>CHILDREN'S PRIVACY</strong></h1>
              <p class="margin-top">We respect children's privacy.  This Site is not intended for persons under the age of 13 (see ipsy's Terms of Use).  If you're under 18 years old, please do not submit any personal information to us without the consent and supervision of a responsible parent or legal guardian.</p>
              
              <h1><strong>DATA RETENTION</strong></h1>
              <p class="margin-top">ipsy will retain your information as long as we deem necessary. If you no longer want ipsy to use your information to provide you Services, you may close your account.  If you close your account then your profile and the content you posted to the Site will no longer appear on the Site.</p>
              <p>You may inform us of any changes or requests in regards to your personal data, and in accordance with our obligations under local data protection law, we will use all reasonable means to update or delete your personal data accordingly.  Please email ipsyCare using this link: <a href="http://help.ipsy.com/customer/portal/emails/new" target="_blank">help.ipsy.com/customer/portal/emails/new</a>. You should not expect that all of your information will be completely removed from our databases in response to your request.  ipsy will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes and enforce our agreements.</p>
              
              <h1><strong>UPDATES TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY</strong></h1>
              <p class="margin-top">We will post any changes and updates to this Privacy Policy on this Site so you can always be aware of what information we collect, use and disclose.
