		<p>Your privacy is important to IP.com. This statement discloses the
		information practices for IP.com on the web, including what type of information
		is gathered and tracked, how the information is used, and with whom the
		information is shared. </p>
		
		<p>In general, you can visit IP.com on the Internet without telling us who you
		are and without giving any personal information about yourself. There are
		times, however, when we or our partners may need information from you. </p>
		
		<p>You may choose to give us personal information in a variety of situations.
		For example, you may want to give us information, such as your name and address
		or e-mail ID, to correspond with you, to process an order, or to provide you
		with a subscription to our services. You may give us your credit card details
		to buy something from us. We intend to let you know how we will use such
		information before we collect it from you; if you tell us that you do not want
		us to use this information to make further contact with you beyond fulfilling
		your requests, we will respect your wishes. If you give us personal information
		about somebody else, such as a spouse or work colleague, we will assume that
		you have their permission to do so. </p>
		
		<p>The following paragraphs describe in more detail how IP.com may use your
		personal information and with whom we may share it. Depending on the type of
		IP.com Web site you are visiting, one or more of the paragraphs may apply. </p>
		
		<p>If you request something from an IP.com Web site, for example, a product or
		service, a callback, or specific marketing materials, we will use the
		information you provide to fulfill your request. To help us do this, we may
		share information, with others, for instance, other parts of IP.com, IP.com's
		Business Partners, financial institutions, shipping companies, postal or
		government authorities (for example, Customs authorities) involved in
		fulfillment. In connection with a transaction we may also contact you as part
		of our customer satisfaction surveys or for market research purposes. </p>
		
		<p>The information you provide to IP.com on certain IP.com Web sites may also
		be used by IP.com and selected third parties for marketing purposes. Before we
		use it, however, we will offer you the opportunity to choose whether or not to
		have your information used in this way. </p>
		
		<p>We sometimes collect non-identifiable information from visits to our Web
		sites to help us provide better customer service. For example, we may keep
		track of the domains from which people visit, and we also measure visitor
		activity on IP.com Web sites, but we do so in ways that keep the information
		non-identifiable. This information is sometimes known as "clickstream
		data." IP.com or others on IP.com's behalf may use this data to analyze trends
		and statistics and to help us provide better customer service. </p>
		<p>Also, when we collect personal data from you in a transaction, we may
		extract some information about that transaction in a non-identifiable format
		and combine it with other non-identifiable information such as clickstream
		data. This information is used and analyzed only at an aggregate level to help
		us understand trends and patterns. This information is not reviewed at an
		individual level. If you do not want your transaction details used in this
		manner you can disable your cookies. </p>

		<p>We intend to protect your personal information and to maintain its quality.
		We implement appropriate measures and processes, such as using encryption when
		transmitting certain sensitive information, to help us to keep your information
		secure and to maintain its quality. </p>
		
		<p>In some cases IP.com uses suppliers to collect, use, analyze and otherwise
		process information on its behalf. It is IP.com's practice to require such
		suppliers to handle information in a manner consistent with IP.com's policies. </p>
		
		<p>Circumstances may arise where, whether for strategic or other business
		reasons, IP.com decides to sell, buy, merge or otherwise re-organize businesses
		in some countries. Such a transaction may involve the disclosure of personal
		information to prospective or actual purchasers, or receiving it from sellers.
		It is IP.com's practice to seek appropriate protection for information in these
		types of transactions. </p>
		
		<p>We collect the information mentioned in the previous paragraphs through the
		use of various technologies, including one called "cookies." A cookie
		is a piece of data that a Web site can send to your browser, which may then be
		stored on your computer as an anonymous tag that identifies your computer but
		not you. Some IP.com pages use cookies, sent by IP.com or its third party
		vendors, or other technologies to better serve you when you return to the Web
		site. You can set your browser to notify you before you receive a cookie,
		giving you the chance to decide whether to accept it. You can also set your
		browser to turn off cookies. If you do so, however, some Web sites may not work
		properly. </p>
		
		<p>If you turn off cookies, other technologies will still detect visits to
		these pages, but the notices they generate cannot be associated with other
		non-identifiable cookie information and are disregarded. </p>
		
		<p>Please be aware that in certain circumstances, it is possible that personal
		information may be subject to disclosure pursuant to judicial or other
		government subpoenas, warrants, or orders. </p>
		
		<p>If you wish to obtain a copy of particular information you provided to
		IP.com or if you become aware the information is incorrect and you would like
		us to correct it <a href="http://ip.com/contact/">contact us</a>. </p>
		
		<p>Before IP.com is able to provide you with any information or correct any
		inaccuracies, however, we may ask you to verify your identity and to provide
		other details to help us to respond to your request. We will respond to your
		requests as quickly as possible. If you have a question about this statement, you
		can <a href="http://ip.com/contact/">contact us</a>. </p>
