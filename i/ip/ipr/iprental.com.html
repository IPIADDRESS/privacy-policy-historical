<h1 align="center">IPRental Safe   Harbor Privacy Policy</h1>
<h2><strong>European</strong><strong> Safe Harbor</strong><strong> Policy</strong></h2>
<p>IPRental (“IPRental”) strives to collect, use and disclose personal  information in a manner consistent with the laws of the countries in which it  does business. IPRental complies with the Safe Harbor Principles developed by  the U. S. Department of Commerce and the European Commission. This Safe Harbor  Policy sets forth the privacy principles that IPRental follows with respect to  transfer of personal information anywhere in the world, including transfers  from the European Union to the United States.<br>
  </p>
<h2><strong>Notice</strong></h2>
<p>This policy, as amended from time to time, covers  how IPRental and its agents treat personal information that IPRental collects  and receives in connection with your use of its website (“Site”). Personal  information is information about an identified or identifiable individual, like  your name, mailing address, country of residence, email address, phone and fax number,  credit card number, billing and shipping information, IP address, employer, job  title and department, and other data that can be tied to your name and is not  otherwise publicly available. This policy does not apply to the practices of  organizations that IPRental does not own or control, or to people that IPRental  does not employ or manage<strong>. &nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;<br>
  </p>
<p>IPRental collects personal information when you create your account, when  you use IPRental services, and when you visit IPRental pages. When you register  we ask for information such as your name, address, email address,&nbsp; zip code, phone number, and your intended use  of our site. Once you register with IPRental and sign in to our services, you  are not anonymous to us. &nbsp;You agree and  acknowledge that personal information collected by use through the Site or in  connection with the services may be transferred across national boundaries and  stored and processed in the United States. You also acknowledge that with  respect to certain activities, the collection, transfer, storage, and  processing of your personal information may be undertaken by trusted third  party vendors or agents of IPRental, such as credit card companies and web  analytic providers, to help facilitate certain functions of IPRental  activities. Such third parties are bound by contract with IPRental not to use  your personal information for their own purposes or provide it to any third  parties except as otherwise allowed under this policy.<br>
  </p>
<p>We use your personal information for general business purposes,&nbsp; in connection with the provision of services,  billing and collections. &nbsp;IPRental  automatically receives and records information on our server logs from your  browser, including your IP address and theIP addresses you use. IPRental does  not log browsing data or history correlated to your personal computer, does not  store cookies, or IP address or web sites you have visited. IPRental’s binary  application does not contain any Adware or Spyware. <br>
  </p>
<p>When you use the Site and its services, IPRental may also collect certain  information about your computer to facilitate, evaluate and verify your use of  the Site and the services offered. For example, we may log environmental  variables, such as browser type, operating system, CPU speed, referring or exit  web pages, click patterns, Session IDs ( a unique identifier assigned to the  browser in connection to the Site), and the Internet Protocol(IP) address of  your computer. IPRental also uses such information to measure traffic patterns  on the Site and usage of the services. &nbsp;IPRental  may use aggregate, non-identifying statistical data for improving the Site and  our services, providing more relevant experiences to our customers and for  statistical analysis. We do not match such information with personal  information, except as otherwise described in this Privacy Policy. <br>
  </p>
<p>IPRental does not rent, sell, share or otherwise release any personal  information. Except as otherwise provided in the Privacy Policy, we will keep  your personal information private and will not share it with third parties,  unless such disclosure is necessary to (a) comply with a court order or other  legal process; (b) protect our rights or property; or (c) enforce our End User License  Agreement. We will transfer information about you to an acquiring company if IPRental  is acquired by or merged with another company. <br>
  <br>
  We reserve the right to send you certain  communications relating to the IPRental service, such as service announcements,  administrative messages,&nbsp; and other  messages that are considered part of your IPRental account, without offering  you the opportunity to opt-out of receiving them. </p>
<h2><strong>Choice</strong>:</h2>
<p>IPRental only uses your personal information for its general business  purposes. You have the right to withhold the personal data required for  registration, and to change it. &nbsp;However,  &nbsp;in that event, IPRental cannot allow you  to use&nbsp; the Site or provide you services  without the personal information requested in the registration process. </p>
<p>  Please regularly review this Privacy Policy. If you have objections to it,  you should immediately discontinue use of the Site and the services enabled by  the Site and follow the procedure described in Section 6 of the End User  License Agreement. IPRental may change this Privacy Policy from time to time at  its sole discretion and will provide notice of all such changes through  indication in the Privacy Policy itself and in the footer of the web pages with  links to the Privacy Policy. If as a result of the changes to the Privacy  Policy you want to alter the way in which IPRental is allowed to use your  personal information, you can do so by following the instructions set forth in  Section 6 of the End User License Agreement.&nbsp;  You will be deemed to have been aware of, and will be subject to, the  changes in the Privacy Policy after such notice has been posted.</p>
<h2><strong>Data Integrity</strong><br>
</h2>
<p>IPRental will use personal information only in ways that are compatible with  the purposes for which it was collected or subsequently authorized. IPRental  will take reasonable steps to ensure that personal information is relevant to  its intended use, accurate, complete and current.<br>
  </p>
<h2><strong>Onward Transfer</strong><br>
  </h2>
<p>IPRental will comply with the notice and choice principles as described  above for all data which is disclosed or transferred to a third party (“agent”).</p>
<p>  IPRental will obtain assurances from its agent that they will safeguard  personal information consistently with this policy. IPRental will require that  its agents either (i) subscribe to the EU Safe Harbor Principles, the EU Data  Protection Directive or another adequacy finding; or (ii) enter into a written  agreement with IPRental requiring them to provide the same level of protection  as IPRental. <br>
</p>
<h2><strong>Security</strong><br>
  </h2>
<p>IPRental will take reasonable precautions to protect personal information in  its possession from loss, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure,  alteration and destruction. IPRental limits access to personal information to  those persons in the IPRental organization, or agents of IPRental, that have  specific business purposes for maintaining and processing such information and  data. Individuals who have been granted access to personal information are  aware of their responsibilities to protect the security, confidentiality and  integrity of the information. </p>
<p>  Personal information provided by you in connection with your use of the Site  and services is protected in several ways. You have access to the information  you provided upon registration only through use of a password and unique  customer ID selected by you. This password is encrypted.&nbsp; We recommend that you not divulge your  password to anyone. Also, your registration information resides on secure  servers to which only selected IPRental personnel and contractors have access  via password. IPRental encrypts your personal information as it is transferred  to IPRental and thereby strives to prevent unauthorized parties from viewing  such information.<br>
</p>
<h2><strong>Access</strong><br>
  </h2>
<p>IPRental will grant users reasonable access to personal information that it  holds about them and will take reasonable steps to permit users to correct,  amend, or delete information that is demonstrated to be inaccurate or  incomplete. IPRental agrees to process all reasonable requests for access  within a reasonable time period, but reserves the right to deny access or limit  access in cases where the burden or cost of providing access would be  disproportionate to the risks to the individual’s privacy or in the case of a  vexatious or fraudulent request.<br>
  </p>
<h2><strong>Enforcement</strong><br>
  </h2>
<p>If you believe that we have not complied with this Privacy Policy with  respect to your personal information, please write our IPRental Privacy Officer  at <a href="mailto:info@iprental.com">info@iprental.com</a>. Please describe in  as much detail as possible the ways in which you believe we violated our  Privacy Policy. We will investigate your complaint promptly and attempt to  resolve the complaints and disputes regarding use and disclosure of personal  information in accordance with the principles of this policy. For complaints  that cannot be resolved between IPRental and the complainant, complaints will  be submitted to the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) for mediation and  then, if necessary, to binding arbitration for final resolution. Information  about AAA services can be found at it website: <a href="http://www.adr.org">http://www.adr.org</a>.</p>
