<p>This privacy statement covers the site www.iperceptions.com. Because we wish to demonstrate our commitment to protecting our users’ privacy, we have agreed to disclose our information practices.</p>
<ul>
<li>What      personally identifiable information iPerceptions collects</li>
<li>What      personally identifiable information third parties collect through the web      site</li>
<li>What      organization collects the information</li>
<li>How      iPerceptions uses the information</li>
<li>With whom      iPerceptions may share user information</li>
<li>What choices      are available to users regarding collection, use and distribution of the      information</li>
<li>What types of      security procedures are in place to protect the loss, misuse or alteration      of information under iPerceptions’ control</li>

</ul>
<p>If users have questions or concerns regarding this statement, they should contact our privacy officer by email at marketing@iperceptions.com.</p>
<p>iPerceptions Inc. recognizes the importance of protecting the privacy of all respondents to our online studies. Your privacy is fundamental and essential to ensure the validity of our studies process. We are committed to upholding the principles of honesty and integrity with all respondents to our questionnaires. It is your opinion that is requested, not your identity. iPerceptions does not collect any information to be used to identify an individual respondent during the course of a study. If an incentive award requiring the collection of personal information is offered to complete a questionnaire, note that iPerceptions acts solely as an agent of the web site owner whose web site is being studied (the “Owner”). As the Owner’s agent, iPerceptions uses only the information necessary to deliver the incentive award. When offered, it is completely optional as to whether you elect to receive the incentive award or not. See below for details on Contact Information.</p>
<h3>Information Collected by iPerceptions</h3>
<h4>Studies administered by iPerceptions as an Agent</h4>
<p>The information provided by you on our questionnaire is compiled and aggregated to create generic profiles of the users of the web site being studied. Open-ended responses are compiled and reported as is. Our study process does not require us to know nor to report the identity of any individual respondent. In addition to the information provided by you, our study tracks user IP addresses, browser type and access time for demographic and web site administration purposes. This information does not contain anything that can identify respondents personally.</p>
<h4>Cookies</h4>
<p>iPerceptions uses non-persistent cookies only for the purpose of ensuring that you are not solicited to reply to our questionnaire more than once during the study period. See below for a definition and use of cookies.</p>
<h4>Contact Information</h4>
<p>In order to protect your anonymity and respect your privacy, our studies and their reports do not collect your name or personal contact information. If it is your wish to receive the award incentive, when offered, iPerceptions will provide the means for you to voluntarily supply sufficient information to allow the Owner or incentive award distributor to deliver it to you.</p>
<p>This contact information includes only the information needed to deliver the incentive award such as your e-mail address, or your name, telephone number and postal address. IT IS COMPLETELY OPTIONAL AS TO WHETHER YOU PROVIDE THIS INFORMATION OR NOT. On the close of a study, only the contact information supplied by you is forwarded to the Owner and/or incentive award distributor. No other information is supplied. Incentive awards are administered by, and are the sole responsibility of, the Owner. iPerceptions’s responsibility is limited to providing the Owner and/or the incentive award distributor with only the contact information as provided by you and collected during the course of a study. The contact information is stored on iPerception’s servers. It will not be provided to any other third party, nor will it be used by iPerceptions to contact you or for any other purpose.</p>
<h4>Studies on iPerceptions’ site (www.iperceptions.com)</h4>
<p>On occasion our site requests information from users via questionnaires. Participation in these questionnaires is completely voluntary and you therefore have a choice whether or not to participate and provide this information. Information requested may include contact information (such as company name, individual name, title and email address), and profiling information (such as industry and responsibilities). Study information will be used for purposes of developing profiles of visitors to our site.</p>
<h4>“Request for Info” &amp; “Feedback” Forms</h4>
<p>Any personal information collected when users submit request for information and/or feedback forms is for internal purposes only, will not be made public, or be sold to a third party. To fulfill requests for information, iPerceptions requires individual contact information in order to respond. To provide feedback, you may submit comments without disclosing any personally identifying information.</p>
<h4>General</h4>
<p>iPerceptions is not responsible for the privacy policies and content of web sites that are being studied, nor for web sites to which it may provide links. We encourage you to read the privacy statements of these sites as they will differ from ours. iPerceptions uses all reasonable precautions to keep secure any information disclosed during the questionnaire process as part of our secure network. This site has security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse or alteration of the information under our control.</p>
<h4>Cookies</h4>
<p>Cookies are commonly used by many web sites to facilitate site visits. A cookie is a data file that is transferred to your browser by a web server. Only the web server sending the cookie has access to it. Our studies require that your browser be set to accept cookies only to ensure that you are not solicited to reply to our questionnaire more than once while the current study is running. After that, it automatically expires and our web server can no longer access it. On initial setup, most web browsers are set to accept cookies. As well, you can set an option on most browsers for it to notify you when a cookie is being sent with the option of accepting or rejecting the cookie.</p>
<h4>Changes</h4>
<p>If iPerceptions decides to make changes our privacy policy, we will post these changes to the privacy statement on our HOME page and other places we deem appropriate (such as on studies) so that our users are aware of what information we collect and how we use it. We will use information in accordance with the privacy policy under which the information was collected. If, however, we are going to handle our studies in terms of collection and/or use of personal and contact information (if any) in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection, we will obtain your consent prior to this new use.</p>
<h4>Legal Disclaimer</h4>
<p>Though we make every effort to preserve user privacy, we may need to disclose personal information when required by law wherein we have a good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with an appropriate law enforcement investigation, current judicial proceeding, a court order or legal process served on our web site.</p>
<h4>Contact Us</h4>
<p>If you require further information or if we can be of any assistance with respect to privacy issues, updating your contact information, or providing information on the practices related to this site, please contact us at&nbsp;<a href="mailto:marketing@iperceptions.com">marketing@iperceptions.com</a></p>
