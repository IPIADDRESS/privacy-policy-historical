                        <br>
                        iPetitions collects information at different points on 
                        our website. The two main points at which we collect information 
                        are when new <b>members</b> join iPetitions and when outside 
                        users <b>sign</b> a petition powered by iPetitions. <br>
                        <br>
                        <b>Members:</b> When you become a member of iPetitions, 
                        you provide us with your name, email address, country, 
                        and zip code. Currently, we do not gather any demographic 
                        information. iPetitions is the sole owner of this information 
                        and we will not sell, share, or rent this information 
                        with any other company or individual in ways different 
                        from what is disclosed in this statement. From time to 
                        time, we may share your information with others on an 
                        aggregated basis. We will not share information in such 
                        a way that it can be linked to an individual. <br>
                        <br>
                        <b>Sign:</b> When you sign a petition powered by iPetitions, 
                        you will be asked for your name, and you may be asked 
                        for your email address as well as certain demographic 
                        information. Some of this information may be optional, 
                        but we encourage you to provide it as it will allow us 
                        to better customize your experience. The information you 
                        provide when you sign a petition is stored on our servers but 
                        is the exclusive property of
                        the petition host, who is 
                        a member of iPetitions and who has agreed to the terms 
                        of this privacy policy. As with the information you supply iPetitions, hosts will be asked not to sell, share, or 
                        rent this information with any other company or individual 
                        except in an aggregated form. There is one exception to 
                        this rule, however, and that is when the petition is presented 
                        to its designated recipient. At such time, the recipient 
                        will receive a disaggregated list of names with some or 
                        all of the information they provided when they signed 
                        the petition. This is because a petition is far more likely 
                        to be effective when its recipients receives a list of 
                        signatures rather than simply an aggregated number of 
                        signatures. No individual or organization other than the 
                        designated recipient will receive this disaggegated information. 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Please be aware that this applies only to petitions powered 
                        by iPetitions on iPetitions' servers (these petitions 
                        will have a URL of the form: http://www.ipetitions.com/petitionname.html).

                        <br>
                        <b>Exception:</b> iPetitions may disclose user or signer 
                        information when we have reason to believe that disclosing 
                        this information is necessary to identify, contact or 
                        bring legal action against someone who may be violating 
                        our Membership Agreement or may be causing injury or interference, 
                        intentionally or unintentionally, to iPetitions' rights

                        could be harmed by such activities. <br>

                        <br>
                        A cookie is a piece of data stored on the userâ€™s hard 
                        drive containing information about the user. Usage of 
                        a cookie is in no way linked to any personally identifiable 
                        information while on our site. Once the user closes their 
                        browser, the cookie simply terminates. For instance, by 
                        setting a cookie on our site, the user would not have 
                        to log in a password more than once, thereby saving time 
                        while on our site. If a user rejects the cookie, they 
                        may still use our site. The only drawback to this is that 
                        the user will be limited in some areas of our site. For 
                        example, the user will not be able to participate in any 
                        of our Sweepstakes, Contests or monthly Drawings that 
                        take place. Cookies can also enable us to track and target 
                        the interests of our users to enhance the experience on 
                        our site. <br>

                        <br>
                        This website takes every precaution to protect our usersâ€™ 
                        information. When users submit sensitive information via 
                        the website, your information is protected both online 
                        and off-line. <br>
                        <br>
                        When our registration/order form asks users to enter sensitive 
                        information (such as credit card number and/or social 
                        security number), that information is encrypted and is 
                        protected with the best encryption software in the industry 
                        - SSL. While on a secure page, such as our order form, 
                        the lock icon on the bottom of Web browsers such as Netscape 
                        Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, 
                        as opposed to un-locked, or open, when you are just â€˜surfingâ€™.

                        <br>
                        While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information 
                        online, we also do everything in our power to protect 
                        user-information off-line. All of our usersâ€™ information, 
                        not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is 
                        restricted in our offices. Only employees who need the 
                        information to perform a specific job (for example, our 
                        billing clerk or a customer service representative) are 
                        granted access to personally identifiable information. 
                        Furthermore, ALL employees are kept up-to-date on our 
                        security and privacy practices. Every quarter, as well 
                        as any time new policies are added, our employees are 
                        notified and/or reminded about the importance we place 
                        on privacy, and what they can do to ensure our customersâ€™

                        AND SERVICE UPDATES</b><br>
                        <br>
                        We send members site and service announcement updates. 
                        Members are not able to un-subscribe from service announcements, 
                        which contain important information about iPetitions. 
                        Signers, however, will only receive these announcements 
                        if they indicate their desire to do so when signing a 
                        petition. We communicate with the user to provide requested 
                        services and in regards to issues relating to their account 
                        via email or phone. <br>
