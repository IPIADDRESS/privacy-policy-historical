        At CORE Business Technologies, we understand that our customers are our most important
				asset, so we do everything we can to protect you and respect your privacy as you visit our site.
			To learn more	about how
		we keep your information safe and secure, read our privacy policy.        
        </p><p><strong>CORE Business Technologies Privacy Policy<br>
        </strong>1. Your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains our policies and
	    		practices regarding the collection, use, storage and disclosure of your personal information by
	    	CORE Business Technologies. We want you
	    			to feel secure when visiting our website and are committed to maintaining your privacy when
	    	doing	so. The	information below
		provides an overview of how we protect your privacy. </p>
	    <p>2. What personal information do we gather?
	    		In general, you may visit CORE Business Technologies’ website
	    	without providing us with any personal information. However, there are times when we
	    	may need information from you, which includes your Internet address so that we can track unique visits
	    		to our site
	    	for analytic purposes. Additionally, we may need  personal information such as your name and your
	    	postal and e-mail address in order to grant you access to protected and secured sites or provide you
	    		with the opportunity
	    	to register for an event, to fulfill your requests for information including white papers, download
	    	updates to our products or participate in an online survey. In other instances, we may ask you to provide
	    	us with
	    	information such as your product interests so that we can send you only the information that is useful
	    	to you, including articles, newsletters, product and service alerts, new product and service announcements
	    	and
	    	event invitations. When we collect this type of information, we will inform you as to why we are asking
	    	for information and how the information will be used. However, please note that providing any personal
	    		information is optional. When you receive your confirmation e-mail or when you receive any e-mail from the
	    		list
	    	server,
	    	you will be given instructions on how to remove yourself from the list.</p>
	    <p>3. How do we collect your personal
	    	information? We collect information directly through response or “contact
	    	us” forms on our website that you choose to complete. We may also collect information indirectly through
	    	the use of cookies. The cookies we use identify you only as a number. They are stored on your computer
	    	and may be used in subsequent visits to our site. </p>
	    <p>4. How do we use your personal information? Information
	    		we may collect is used to determine what is
	    		most effective about our website, to help us identify ways to improve it, to personalize the visit
	    	for you through the use of cookies, if you permit it, and to determine how we can tailor our website to
	    		make it	more
	    		effective. We may also use data for other purposes, which we would describe to you at the point
	    	we collect	the information (for example, if you are invited to register for an event).</p>
	    <p>5. Do we share your information
	    		with outside parties? We do not sell personal information and we share it only with our advisors,
	    	suppliers and selected partners and only to the extent necessary to facilitate
	    		a transaction or an event related to you. For example, we may need to share information in the case
	    		of an event where we need to provide our caterer with meal preference information. But again, before
	    		you submit any information, we will inform you of the reason we are asking you for specific information and
	    	the parties
	    		to whom such information may be disclosed, and it is up to you whether or not you want to provide
	    	it. You
	    		may separately agree to provide your personal information to third parties that provide content
	    	for	CORE Business Technologies, in order to access and/or use their products and/or services. If you agree
	    		to	provide such information
	    		to these third parties, then your personal information will be subject to their privacy policies.</p>
	    <p>In
	    	addition to the foregoing, the following are the additional instances where we may disclose your personal
	    	information to third parties:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>To investigate potentially fraudulent or questionable activities regarding customer accounts.</li>
				<li>In anticipation of and in the course of an actual or potential sale, reorganization, consolidation,
	    	merger or amalgamation of our business.</li>
				<li>When required or permitted by law.</li>
			</ul>
	    <p>The type of information we are legally required to disclose may relate
	    		to criminal investigations or government tax reporting requirements. In some instances such as a
	    	legal proceeding or court order,
	    		we may also be required to disclose certain information to authorities. Only the information specifically
	    		requested
	    		will be disclosed and we will take precautions to satisfy ourselves that the authorities that are
	    	making	the request have legitimate grounds to do so.</p>
	    <p>There are some situations where we are legally permitted to disclose
	    		personal information, such as employing
	    		reasonable and legal methods to enforce our rights or to investigate suspicion of illegal activities.</p>
	    <p>6.
	    	What about sensitive data? We do not typically collect sensitive personal data through this website.
	    	If we	do seek to collect such data, we will inform you as to our intended use of such sensitive data
	    	and ask you to consent to our storing and the proposed uses of such data. We may also collect some sensitive
	    	personal
	    	data incidentally. For instance, we may collect data incidentally when a user uploads his/her resume,
	    	because the resume may contain this information. By providing us with unsolicited sensitive personal
	    	data,	you consent
	    	to our using the data subject to applicable law as described in this Privacy Policy. The references
	    	to "sensitive
	    	personal data" apply to the various categories of personal data identified by the applicable data privacy
	    	laws as requiring special treatment, including in some circumstances the need to obtain explicit consent.
	    	CORE Business Technologies does not knowingly collect data from or market to children anywhere.</p>
	    <p>7. What
	    		about security? The security of your personal information is important to CORE Business Technologies
	    	and we take appropriate steps to maintain security of your personal information. The open nature of
	    		the Internet is such that data may flow over networks without security measures and may be accessed
	    		and used by people
	    		other than those for whom the data is intended. While this is out of our control, we aim to apply
	    	appropriate levels of security at all times. We use industry standard technologies and maintain current security
	    		standards to ensure that your personal information is protected against unauthorized access, disclosure,
	    		inappropriate alteration, or misuse. Electronic customer files are kept in a secured environment
	    	with restricted
	    		access.
	    		Paper-based files are stored in locked filing cabinets.</p>
	    <p>We manage our server environment appropriately
	    		and our firewall infrastructure is strictly adhered to.
	    		We routinely employ current technologies to ensure that the confidentiality and privacy of your
	    	information is not compromised. The security of your personal information is important to us and we will use
	    	all
	    		reasonable means to keep it as safe as possible.</p>
	    <p>8. Do we give you access to your information? You are entitled
	    		to know whether we hold information about
	    		you and, if we do, to have access to that information and require it to be corrected if it is inaccurate.
   		You can do this by contacting us via 4core@corebt.com or calling (401) 431-0700.</p>
	    <p>9. Updating this Privacy
	    		Policy. Any changes to our Privacy Policy and information handling practices will be acknowledged
	    	in this Privacy Policy in a timely manner. We may add, modify or remove portions
	    			of this Privacy Policy when we believe it is appropriate to do so. You may determine when we
	    	last	updated	it by referring
		to the modification date found at the bottom of this Privacy Policy.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  </p>
