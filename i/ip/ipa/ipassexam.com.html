What we collect and how this is used is as follows:</p><h3>Use of Cookies</h3><p>Cookies are information files that your web browser places on the hard drive of your computer when you visit a website. Cookies cannot damage user files, nor can they read information from a user's hard drive. Cookies are used to track visitor activities while at our site.</p><h4>Cookie law</h4><p>On the 26th of May 2012 it became <a href="http://ico.org.uk/for_organisations/privacy_and_electronic_communications/the_guide/cookies" target="_blank">European Union (EU) law</a> to inform you, as a user of this website, how we use cookies on this website.</p><h4>How this website uses cookies</h4><p>iTutor uses Cookies to determine the number of unique and returning visitors to our website. We do not store any personal information into cookies. Log data collected on web servers, both within our control and under the control of third party service providers, is used to identify IP addresses to analyze trends, administer the site, track visitor movement to, through and from the site, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use.</p><p>We use Google Analytics to evaluate and improve this website and services.

This number may either be the same or different each time. Each time your computer requests information from our website, we log your IP address on our server and may log operating systems and browser types for system administration and to report aggregate information.

This may involve using your name and subscription details on a database with other publishers' data for detection purposes.</p><h3>1.4 What else do we use personal information for?</h3><p>Other than for fulfilling any obligations to you (where these exist), on some occasions we use the information provided to produce anonymised aggregate statistics in relation to pages being accessed and the demographics of our users. We may also use it to monitor usage patterns on the website in order to improve navigation and design features to help you get information more easily. In order to help us develop the website and our services, we may provide such aggregate information to third parties. The statistics, however, will not include any information that can be used to identify any individual. We may contact you to notify you about changes to our service.</p><h2>2. How long do we keep the information we collect?</h2><p>We keep your personal information for as long as necessary to fulfil our obligations to you, protect our legal interests and undertake analysis of our website to assist you and future users.</p><h2>3.

How personal information is stored and protected</h2><p>Your personal data is stored in our databases or those of our contractors which is only available to the web administrators of iTutor Ltd. and our contractors and selected authorised people on a password protected basis (except where referred to in the final paragraph of Clause 1.3 herein). The data that we collect from you may be transferred to and stored at a destination outside of the European Economic Area ("EEA").

We also understand that our continued success as a publisher on the web relies on our ability to communicate with you in a secure manner. We adhere to the highest standards of decency, fairness, and integrity in our operations. We use several measures to authenticate your identity when you visit our site. We also take steps to protect your information as it travels the internet, and to make sure all information is as secure as possible against unauthorised access and use (for example, by hackers). We review our security measures regularly.</p><p>Despite our best efforts, and the best efforts of other firms, "perfect security" does not exist on the internet, or anywhere else. Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we will do our best to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee the security of your data transmitted to our site; any transmission is at your own risk. Once we have received your information, we will use strict procedures and security features to try to prevent unauthorised access.</p><h3>4.2 Authentication</h3><p>You should not share your username and password with other people.</p><h3>4.3 Email</h3><p>Any email between you and the iTutor Ltd is not encrypted. It will be stored securely within our corporate firewall (see below).</p><h3>4.4 Data within our walls</h3><p>The information we collect about people visiting the site is stored in secure environments that are not available to any other individual or party. We have mechanisms in place to protect data. One such mechanism is called a "firewall". A firewall is a barrier that allows only authorised traffic through. It safeguards our computer systems and your information. We also use system and application logs to track all access. We review these logs periodically and investigate any anomalies or discrepancies.</p><h2>5. Contact us</h2><p>Please contact us if any of the data we hold about you becomes inaccurate and if you have any queries or concerns about the data we are holding about you.
