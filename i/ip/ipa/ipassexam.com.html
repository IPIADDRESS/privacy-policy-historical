    <h1>Terms and Conditions</h1>

<p>This iPassExam website is owned by iTutor Ltd
Limited.</p>

<h2>Use of Our Website</h2>

<p>Please read the following Terms and Conditions, which relate to
information regarding general use of our websites and the terms and
conditions relating to purchases of subscriptions. By using our
websites, you are agreeing to these Terms and Conditions whether as
a registered user or subscriber. By using our site you are
indicating you accept these terms of use and that you agree to
abide by them. From time to time we may change these Terms and
Conditions, and will post revisions on this website. We recommend
that you read these Terms and Conditions prior to using our sites
and thereafter regularly review any changes and you are responsible
for doing so.</p>

<h2>Privacy</h2>

<p>Use of the data that you provide us, or which is collected by
use on our website, is governed by our <a href="#privacy-policy">Privacy Policy</a>. By using our site you
consent to such processing.</p>

<h2>Access to the iPassExam Website</h2>

<p>We try to ensure that website availability is uninterrupted and
that transmissions will be error-free. However, we cannot guarantee
that your access will not be suspended or restricted from time to
time, including to allow for repairs, maintenance or the
introduction of new facilities or services. We of course try to
limit the frequency and duration of any suspension or
restriction.</p>

<h2>Accounts and Passwords</h2>

<p>If you have registered or subscribed to use any service within
the iPassExam Website, any user identification code or password
is personal and non transferable and must be kept confidential and
used only by you (unless agreed in writing with the iTutor Ltd) for
the specified term of your subscription or registration period
(which may be terminated at the discretion of the iTutor Ltd). We
have the right to take action should this requirement be
breached.</p>

<h2>Our Products and Services</h2>

<p>iPassExam is an online revision website. A description of what is included in each
iPassExam subscribed service is contained on our website
including the period of each subscription. News Headlines, Blog and any
other service which are currently available without a subscription
are also indicated on the website.</p>

<p>The website has not been optimised for use via mobile devices
and users wishing to do so should be aware that they may not
experience full functionality of the site.</p>

<h2>Placing an Order and our Acceptance</h2>

<p>When you request an online purchase, the language that we offer
to you for the conclusion of this process will be English only.</p>

<p>When submitting your request to purchase any iPassExam
service, you will be asked to indicate which products that you wish
to subscribe to. You will then proceed to a page which requires
you to initiate an account (if you have not already done so). Should you be
paying online, you will proceed to a secure payment page and you will need to select your payment method. If
you are paying by cheque, postal order or international money
order, then details of your requirements are set out in the Order
Summary. In either case, whether you make the payment online or
whether you send a cheque, postal order or international money
order to the iTutor Ltd, when you submit these you are making an
offer to purchase the relevant iPassExam product or service,
which we may accept or decline. After you submit your offer, you
will receive confirmation that your payment was either successful
or unsuccessful.</p>

<p>For online payments, we may at that time allow you to have
temporary access online to the iPassExam service that you wish
to subscribe to, but this is a gesture of goodwill and does not
represent acceptance of your offer. Access will need to be made via
the user name and password supplied. Irrespective of an online
payment, our contract will not become binding until five working
days have elapsed after a successful payment is made online and
only if we do not contact you. This is in case any pricing errors
have occurred and if so we will contact you. For cheque, postal
order or international money orders our contract will become
binding upon receipt by the iTutor Ltd of clear funds and notice of
acceptance. Subject to the foregoing, delivery will be deemed to
have taken place once the log in details have been sent by us to
you.</p>

<p>Please note that if you wish to cancel any subscription that you
have purchased after our contract comes into effect, cancellation
shall be at our discretion and if accepted may be subject to a
cancellation charge. You hereby agree that no cancellation is
allowed after these services have started to be supplied. This does
not otherwise affect your statutory rights.</p>

<p>iPassExam services are supplied subject to availability and
remaining in current circulation. In the event that we are unable
to supply any iPassExam services for the agreed term, we will
inform you as soon as possible and provide you with a pro rata
refund in the event that you have paid for a period for which we
cannot comply. We will not however be liable to the full extent
permitted by law, for any direct or indirect loss caused as a
result of not being able to supply to you within the subscription
for all or any of the periods subscribed to.</p>

<h2>Prices and Payments</h2>

<p>The price that you pay for the iPassExam services you order
should be the standard pricing as indicated on the website. These
prices are inclusive of all taxes and delivery unless otherwise
indicated. They are valid for purchases during the calendar year
which they relate to. All subscribers are required to make payment
in pounds sterling. Should you be paying from an account outside of
the United Kingdom, the exchange rate will be calculated by your
bank.</p>

<p>We try to ensure that all of our prices on our website are
accurate, however errors may occur. If we discover any errors in
the prices of the services that you have ordered, we will inform
you as soon as possible and give you the option of recommencing
your order at the correct price or cancelling it. If you do not
respond to our contact, we will treat the order as cancelled. If
you order and we have already processed your payment, you will
receive a full refund.</p>

<p>Payments may be made through the methods specified on our Order
Summary section of our website. We take all reasonable precautions
to keep the details of your order and payment secure. Unless we are
negligent however, we cannot be liable for losses causes as a
result of unauthorised access to the information provided by
you.</p>

<div>
<h1 style="margin: 20px 0pt 0pt;"><a name="privacy-policy" id="privacy policy"></a>Privacy Policy</h1>

<h2>Your privacy</h2>

<p>Protecting your privacy is one of our top priorities. Please
take a few minutes to review this policy.</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<h3>Our privacy commitment</h3>

<p>This document sets out the basis for which The iTutor Ltd will process any personal
data we collect from you.</p>

<p>We will make every effort to protect your privacy by adopting a
consistently high level of site security and adhering to strict
company policies on how we store and use personal information. This
privacy policy has been developed in accordance with our legal
obligations and may be updated from time to time.</p>

<p>If we make any changes to our privacy policy, we will post the
revisions on our site.</p>

<h2>1. What information is being collected and how is it used?</h2>

<p>There are various sections of the website, for which we collect
different information. What we collect and how this is used is as
follows:</p>

<h3>1.1 Registered Users</h3>

<p>Access to content and services on our website requires either
registration alone or also with a subscription. You will know what
information is being collected when you complete required details
prior to submission (including which information is mandatory).
Where you submit a response on our forum for publication, your
chosen user name will be published. We will use data collected to
allow access to our website and fulfil any obligations to you
(where these exist).</p>

<p>We will also use your data to monitor for any unauthorised use
of our website, content or subscriptions to our content. We may
also disclose your indentity and contact details to any third party
claiming material posted by you is defamatory or violates their
intellectual property rights or right to privacy.</p>

<p>You will be gven an opportunity to opt in or out (as applicable)
from receiving marketing emails (and in other media) from iTutor Ltd and third parties.</p>

<h3>1.2 All users</h3>

<p>As you browse the website, we collect information about your use
of the site including but not limited to traffic data and location
data. Essentially this will normally be which pages you have
visited, how long you stay online and where you are located. We
will not be able to identify who you are from the information we
store, but we will be able to identify where you are located - (see
point 1.3 below).</p>

<h3>1.3 What else do we collect when you use our website?</h3>

<p>Each time you use the internet, an IP address is assigned to
your computer via the internet service provider. This number may
either be the same or different each time. Each time your computer
requests information from our website, we log your IP address on
our server and may log operating systems and browser types for
system administration and to report aggregate information. We may
use this in order to gather information about the website traffic
and usage.</p>

<p>Whether you are a registered user or not, our web server
collects certain information such as (a) IP address; (b) host names
(c) domain name (d) time and date information as requested (e) the
browser version and platform when it is requested, (f) a record of
which pages have been requested.</p>

<p>If you contact us, we may keep a record of that correspondence
and use it to contact you in response and/or to update our
records.</p>

<p>We may use all information to adhere to any legal requirements
to disclose to third parties, enforce our legal rights, and protect
against unauthorised access, use, activity and/or copying, either
personally or via third party contractors and advisors. This may
involve using your name and subscription details on a database with
other publishers data for detection purposes.</p>

<h3>1.4 What else do we use personal information for?</h3>

<p>Other than for fulfilling any obligations to you (where these
exist), on some occasions we use the information provided to
produce anonymised aggregate statistics in relation to pages being
accessed and the demographics of our users. We may also use it to
monitor usage patterns on the website in order to improve
navigation and design features to help you get information more
easily. In order to help us develop the website and our services,
we may provide such aggregate information to third parties. The
statistics however will not include any information that can be
used to identify any individual. We may contact you to notify you
about changes to our service.</p>

<h2>2. How long do we keep the information we collect?</h2>

<p>We keep your personal information for as long as necessary to
fulfil our obligations to you, protect our legal interests and
undertake analysis of our website to assist you and future
users.</p>

<h2>3. To whom will information be disclosed?</h2>

<p>Other than as expressly agreed by you or otherwise stated when
data is collected or within this policy, we will not diclose your
personal data to any third parties other than:</p>

<ol type="i">
<li>our owners (where applicable), Licensors, contractors and
advisors who must keep this data confidential;</li>

<li>as required to enforce our legal rights (including property,
safety, our customers or others);</li>

<li>fraud protection and credit risk reduction; and</li>

<li>where our company or its assets (to which your data relates)
are to be acquired by a new company, location data may be
shared.</li>
</ol>

<h2>4. How personal information is stored and protected</h2>

<p>Your personal data is stored in our databases or those of our
contractors which is only available to the web administrators of us
and our contractors and selected authorised people on a password
protected basis (except where referred to in the final paragraph of
Clause 1.3 herein). The data that we collect from you may be
transferred to and stored at a destination outside of the European
Economic Area ("EEA"). It may also be processed by staff
operating outside of the EEA who work for us or are of our
suppliers. Such staff may be engaged in among other things, hosting
the fulfilment of your order, processing of your payment details
and the provision of support services by submitting your personal
data, you agree to this transfer, storing or process. We will take
all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your data is treated
securely by us and our contractors and in accordance with this
privacy policy. Where we have given you (or where you have chosen)
a password which enables you to access certain parts of our site,
you are responsible for keeping this password confidential.</p>

<p>Please do not share your password(s) with anyone.</p>

<h3>4.1 Security</h3>

<p>We understand that the security of your information is important
to you. We also understand that our continued success as a
publisher on the web relies on our ability to communicate with you
in a secure manner. We adhere to the highest standards of decency,
fairness, and integrity in our operations. We use several measures
to authenticate your identity when you visit our site. We also take
steps to protect your information as it travels the internet, and
to make sure all information is as secure as possible against
unauthorised access and use (for example, by hackers). We review
our security measures regularly.</p>

<p>Despite our best efforts, and the best efforts of other firms,
"perfect security" does not exist on the internet, or
anywhere else. Unfortunately, the transmission of information via
the internet is not completely secure. Although we will do our best
to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee the security of
your data transmitted to our site; any transmission is at your own
risk. Once we have received your information, we will use struct
procedures and security features to try to prevent unauthorised
access.</p>

<h3>4.2 Authentication</h3>

<p>You should not share your user name and password with other
people.</p>

<h3>4.3 Email</h3>

<p>Any email between you and the iTutor Ltd is not encrypted. It
will be stored securely within our corporate firewall (see
below).</p>

<h3>4.4 Data within our walls</h3>

<p>The information we collect about people visiting the site is
stored in secure environments that are not available to any other
individual or party. We have mechanisms in place to protect data.
One such mechanism is called a "firewall". A firewall is
a barrier that allows only authorised traffic through. It
safeguards our computer systems and your information. We also use
system and application logs to track all access. We review these
logs periodically and investigate any anomalies or
discrepancies.</p>

<h2>5. Contact us</h2>

<p>Please contact us if any of the data we hold about you becomes
inaccurate and if you have any queries or concerns about the data
we are holding about you. Also we welcome your feedback about what
you like or don't like about our sites. Your feedback is stored
on a secure internal system that allows the appropriate person to
respond to you. Please contact us through our <a href="/contact">Contact us section</a>.</p>

<h2>6. Linking to external sites</h2>

<p>Occasionally, you will encounter links to other sites that are
not related to the iTutor Ltd. Please be aware that once you click
to one of these sites, you are subject to that site's privacy
policy and not to ours. You may wish to review the privacy policy
for each site you visit.</p>

<h2>7. Your consent</h2>

<p>By submitting your information, you consent to the use of that
information as set out in this policy. You should review this
policy regularly, to note any changes as to how we collect and use
personal information.</p>

<p>Thank you for reviewing this information.</p>

<p>If you have any questions, please send us an e-mail through our
