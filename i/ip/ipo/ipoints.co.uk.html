	<h1>Privacy policy</h1>
	<p>Maximiles are committed to our members' privacy and the following notes outline our information practices. If you feel we are not abiding by our policy or if you have any questions please contact <a href="mailto:contact.uk@bilendi.com">contact.uk@bilendi.com</a>.</p>

<h2>Personal Information</h2>
<p><strong>1.</strong> We collect basic personal information (Name, Address, Region, DOB, Gender, Marital Status, email address etc.) from you as part of our registration process to enable us set up your Maximiles account.</p>
<p><strong>2.</strong> In addition we collect information on your preferences when you complete our on-line questionnaire and our polls.</p>
<p><strong>3.</strong> We also collect information on your shopping &amp; online activities with our partners as part of allocating Maximiles to your account.</p>
<p><strong>4.</strong> From time to time we may also ask for additional personal information as part of a promotion/competition.</p>
<p><strong>5.</strong> Refer a Friend: If you provide us with information about another person, you confirm that they have appointed you to act for them, to consent to the processing of their personal data including sensitive personal data and that you have informed them of our identity and the purpose for which their personal data will be processed.</p>

<h2>Use of Information</h2>
<p><strong>1.</strong> By joining the Maximiles Programme you agree that we can communicate with you with suitable offers from Maximiles, its partners and clients, which may contain opportunities to earn and redeem points as well as to inform you of programme.</p>
<p><strong>2.</strong> By taking up the “Maximiles Panels” service you agree to receive invites to third party market research surveys via email.</p>
<p><strong>3.</strong> By taking up the “Maximail” service you agree to receive email communications from us containing advertising from our selected third party clients.</p>
<p><strong>4.</strong> If at any time you no longer wish to receive our newsletters or no longer adhere to the Maximail or Panels services or any other Maximiles service, or be contacted by us at all, please use the links provided at the bottom of each of the newsletters and promotional e-mails you receive, or edit your profile in the "My Account" section of our website.</p>
<p><strong>5.</strong> From time to time we may pass your postal, email address or telephone number on to selected third parties so that they can send you offers that may be of interest to you. You may opt-out of receiving all third party communications at any time by ticking the boxes provided on your Account section.</p>
<p><strong>6.</strong> The collection of data by Maximiles through registration on third party sites may lead to your data also being held by that third party site. For more information about the processing of your personal data by all our partners, we recommend you to consult their privacy policy available on their website. We are in no way responsible for their management of your personal data.</p>
<p><strong>7.</strong> You may at any time remove yourself from the Maximiles rewards programme in which case no additional communication will be sent from Maximiles to that particular account and after 30 days any Maximiles points in that account will be forfeited. Please email: <a href="mailto:contact.uk@bilendi.com">contact.uk@bilendi.com</a>.</p>
<p><strong>8.</strong> In order to credit your Maximiles account with Maximiles points gained from earning with our partners or clients, it may be necessary for our partners to transfer your data back to Maximiles so we can credit your account to accurately reflect your Maximiles points total. There may be times when the transfer of data will take place with a partner outside of the EEA. This is for contractual purposes only and again for us to be able to credit your account appropriately.</p>
<p><strong>9.</strong> We may collect personal data from other sources in order for us to hold a more accurate profile of the data subject.</p>
<p><strong>10.</strong> From time to time we will perform analysis on our member and transaction databases. The results of this analysis may be released to third parties, but only in aggregate form and will contain no personal information at all. We may also use transactional data to update your profile so that we can offer you similar products that maybe of interest to you based on this data.</p>
<p><strong>11.</strong> In accordance with the Data Protection Act, you have a right to access, rectify and delete nominative information concerning you. You can also object to the collection of your personal information for legitimate reasons. If at any time you wish to exercise your rights please send a request by registered letter with acknowledgment of receipt along with your username, your email address, your mailing address and your copy of ID to the address listed at the bottom of this page.
