			<div class="main">
            <br>
            <p>The personal privacy of Internet users is extremely
                            important to iPost and we recognize and support the
                            protection of clients' and consumers' privacy rights
                            as a fundamental principle of our business.</p>
                          <strong>Information Collection and Use</strong>
                          <p>iPost does not sell, share, or rent mailing lists.
                            We deliver messages only to those addresses supplied
                            to the iPost service by the organization or individual
                            who desires to send a message. That means that if
                            you receive a message from iPost, the sender of that
                            message knows that you are receiving it. iPost also
                            requires its clients to provide accurate information
                            that fully identifies the sender, and verifies that
                            information before accepting email addresses from
                            that sender. We will not sell, share, or rent this
                            information to others in ways different from what
                            is disclosed in this statement.</p>
                          <p>In the process of delivering email messages, iPost
                            recognizes any URLs that were clicked and records
                            some information supplied by your computer, such
                            as the type of browser, operating system and IP address.
                            We do not use "cookies" to identify users or to measure
                            mailing effectiveness. Information regarding activity
                            for email recipients is reported only to the mailing
                            originator, who owns or has a suitable license to
                            the list on which the recipient's email address originally
                            appeared.</p>
                          <p>Although more than one sender may independently
                            supply your address, your name, email address, zip
                            code or other identifying information, such information
                            given to us by one sender will not be revealed to
                            any other sender who uses our service. Should we
                            ever change our policy, you will be notified by email
                            and given the chance to remove yourself from our
                            lists before your information is disclosed.</p>
                          <p>Users of our website are notified on the website
                            when their information is being collected by any
                            outside parties. We do this so our users can make
                            an informed choice as to whether they should proceed
                            with services that require an outside party. At present,
                            no third parties collect information on our website.</p>
                          <strong>Unsolicited Commercial Email (UCE) Policy</strong>
                          <p>iPost contractually prohibits our clients from sending
                            email that fits the definition of unsolicited commercial
                            email or "spam." The term "spam" refers to emailing
                            a message to address(es) that have not asked to receive
                            it. iPost strictly enforces this policy. We insist
                            that our clients send messages with iPost only to
                            recipients who have subscribed, indicating that they
                            wish to receive mailings from our client. In addition,
                            every message sent using the iPost service provides
                            information about unsubscribing from (that is, choosing
                            not to receive) future mailings.</p>
                          <p>Our UCE policy is rigorously enforced. iPost may
                            terminate service or take any other action against
                            a client who violates this policy. We encourage recipients
                            and others to report violators. If you believe you
                            have received an email in violation of this policy,
                            please send a message to <a href="mailto:privacy@ipost.com">privacy@ipost.com</a>.</p>
                          <strong>Cookies</strong>
                          <p>A cookie is a small file stored on a web browser
                            user's hard drive containing information that is
                            placed there by a website. This information is often
                            used to track visits by the same web browser to the
                            same site, or to remember information between sessions
                            on the website for the convenience of the user.</p>

<p>iPost presently uses a third party web analytics system which uses
cookies on this website and the iPost Mailing Manager.  These cookies
are used only to identify the popularity of web pages and the path
visitors take through our site.  Visitor identity is not collected or used.</p>

<p>Clients of iPost may elect to use cookies on their
                            own websites, some portions of which may be hosted
                            on iPost servers. iPost is not responsible for the
                            use of such cookies and may have no information about
                            them. If you are concerned about the use of cookies
                            in your web browser, you may adjust the settings
                            of your web browser to selectively accept cookies
                            or reject them entirely.</p>
                          <p>The iPost Mailing Manager (iMM) website, a part
                            of the iPost service, also uses cookies to permit our
                            clients to more easily log in to the iMM from other
                            services. This use of cookies is optional on the
                            part of our clients.</p>
                          <strong>Log Files</strong>
                          <p>We may use IP addresses to analyze trends, administer
                            our service, track users' movement, and gather broad
                            demographic information for aggregate use.</p>
                          <strong>Tracking pixels</strong>
                          <p>Tracking pixels (also known as "web bugs") are small,
                            typically transparent images on a web page that have
                            special names which permit the loading of the web
                            page to be tracked by a web server. iPost does not
                            use tracking pixels on our web site. We do use tracking
                            pixels in HTML email we send to detect when the email
                            is opened. Some of our clients may use tracking pixels
                            on forms that we host on our web servers, and some
                            of those tracking pixels may be linked to tracking
                            services hosted by third parties. Please see our
                            clients' and the third parties' privacy policies
                            for information about such tracking pixels.</p>
                          <strong>Sharing</strong>
                          <p>We may share aggregated demographic information
                            with our partners. Shared aggregated information
                            is not linked to any information about any individual
                            person.</p>
                          <p>We may partner with another party to provide specific
                            services. When the user signs up for these services,
                            we may share names and other contact information
                            that is necessary for the third party to provide
                            these services. These parties are not allowed to
                            use personally identifiable information except for
                            the purpose of providing these services. Any such
                            partnership activity will also comply with this privacy
                            statement.</p>
                          <strong>Links</strong>
                          <p>This web site contains links to other sites. Please
                            be aware that iPost is not responsible for the privacy
                            practices of other sites. We encourage our users
                            to be aware of when they leave our site and to read
                            the privacy statements of each and every web site
                            that collects personally identifiable information.
                            This privacy statement applies solely to information
                            collected, and services provided, by our web site.</p>
                          <strong>Newsletter</strong>
                          <p>From time to time we may offer users the opportunity
                            to subscribe to one of our newsletters. If a user
                            wishes to subscribe to a newsletter, we ask for contact
                            information such as name and email address. We only
                            send our newsletters to people who ask to receive
                            them.</p>
                          <strong>Forms and Surveys</strong>
                          <p>From time to time we may request information from
                            users via forms or surveys. Participation in these
                            surveys or contests is completely voluntary and the
                            user therefore has a choice whether or not to disclose
                            this information. Information requested may include
                            contact information (such as name and email address),
                            and demographic information (such as zip code and
                            profession). Contact information will be used to
                            notify the user requesting a quote or other service.
                            Survey information will be used for purposes of monitoring
                            or improving this site and our services.</p>
                          <strong>Security</strong>
                          <p>This website (www.ipost.com) does not collect highly
                            sensitive information (such as credit card numbers
                            or Social Security numbers) from our users. For information
                            about security on our client-only service site, see
                            the iPost Mailing Manager ASP Site section below.</p>
                          <strong>Unsubscribing/Updating Personal Information</strong>
                          <p>If a user's personally identifiable information
                            changes (such as the zipcode), or if a user no longer
                            desires our service, we will endeavor to provide
                            a way to correct, update or remove that user's personal
                            data provided to us.</p>
                          <p>Every message the iPost service sends contains instructions
                            that allow you unsubscribe from messages sent via
                            iPost from the sender of that particular message.
                            iPost notifies our clients of unsubscribe requests,
                            and we permanently retain and respects such requests
                            in our own database.</p>
                          <p>To contact iPost to request removal from future
                            iPost email communications from any or all senders,
                            you can do one of the following: </p>

                            iPost clients with passwords. By using the ASP site,
                            clients are bound by rules and regulations found

                          <p>The iMM website takes every reasonable precaution

                            When users submit information via the website, that
                            information is protected both online and offline.
                            When the iMM site asks users to enter sensitive information
                            or displays sensitive information, that information
                            is encrypted and is protected with the standard SSL
                            security protocol. While on an SSL-secured page,
                            the lock icon on the bottom of Web browsers such
                            as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer
                            becomes locked.</p>
                          <p>While we use SSL encryption on the iMM site to protect
                            sensitive information online, we also take reasonable
                            measures to protect user information offline. All
                            of our users' information, not just the sensitive
                            information mentioned above, is restricted in our
                            offices. Only employees who need the information
                            to perform a specific job (for example, a billing
                            clerk or a customer service representative) are granted
                            access to personally identifiable information. Furthermore,
                            all employees are kept up-to-date on our security
                            and privacy practices. Every quarter, as well as
                            any time new policies are added, our employees are
                            notified and/or reminded about the importance we
                            place on privacy, and what they can do to ensure
                            our customers' information is protected.</p>
                          <p>If you have any questions about the security at
                            our website, you can send an email to <a href="mailto:privacy@ipost.com">privacy@ipost.com</a>.</p>
                          <strong>Notification of Changes</strong>
                          <p>If we materially change our privacy policy, we will
                            post a notice on our web site's homepage so our users
                            are always aware of what information we collect,
                            how we use it, and under circumstances, if any, we
                            disclose it. If at any point we decide to use personally
                            identifiable information in a manner different from
                            that stated at the time it was collected, we will
                            notify users via email. Users will have a choice
                            as to whether or not we use their information in
                            this different manner. We will use information in
                            accordance with the privacy policy under which the
                            information was collected.</p>
                          <p>You can review the most current version of the Privacy
                            Policy at any time by clicking the Privacy Policy
                            link on the iPost website. If you have any questions
