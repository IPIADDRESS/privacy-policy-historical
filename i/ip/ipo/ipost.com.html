<h2>iPost Privacy Policy</h2>
                        <p>The personal privacy of Internet users is extremely important 
                          to iPost and we recognize and support the protection 
                          of clients' and consumers' privacy rights as a fundamental 
                          principle of our business.</p>

                  <h3>Information Collection and Use</h3>

                  <p>iPost does not sell, share, or rent mailing lists. We deliver messages 
                    only to those addresses supplied to the iPost service by the 
                    organization or individual who desires to send a message. 
                    That means that if you receive a message from iPost, the sender 
                    of that message knows that you are receiving it. iPost also 
                    requires its clients to provide accurate information that 
                    fully identifies the sender, and verifies that information 
                    before accepting email addresses from that sender. We will 
                    not sell, share, or rent this information to others in ways 
                    different from what is disclosed in this statement.</p>

                  <p>In the process of delivering email messages, iPost recognizes 
                    any URLs that were clicked and records some information supplied 
                    by your computer, such as the type of browser, operating system 
                    and IP address. We do not use "cookies" to identify users 
                    or to measure mailing effectiveness. Information regarding 
                    activity for email recipients is reported only to the mailing 
                    originator, who owns or has a suitable license to the list 
                    on which the recipient's email address originally appeared.</p>

                  <p>Although more than one sender may independently supply your address, 
                    your name, email address, zip code or other identifying information, 
                    such information given to us by one sender will not be revealed 
                    to any other sender who uses our service. Should we ever change 
                    our policy, you will be notified by email and given the chance 
                    to remove yourself from our lists before your information 
                    is disclosed.</p>

                  <p>Users of our website are notified on the website when their information 
                    is being collected by any outside parties. We do this so our 
                    users can make an informed choice as to whether they should 
                    proceed with services that require an outside party. At present, 
                    no third parties collect information on our website.</p>

                  <h3>Unsolicited Commercial Email (UCE) Policy</h3>

                  <p>iPost contractually prohibits our clients from sending email
                    that  fits the definition of unsolicited commercial email
                    or "spam." 
                    The term "spam" refers to emailing a message to address(es)
                    that have not asked to receive it. iPost strictly enforces
                    this policy. We insist that our clients send messages with
                    iPost only to recipients who have subscribed, indicating
                    that they wish to receive mailings from our client. In addition,
                    every message sent using the iPost service provides information
                    about unsubscribing from (that is, choosing not to receive)
                    future mailings.</p>

                  <p>Our UCE policy is rigorously enforced. iPost may terminate service 
                    or take any other action against a client who violates this 
                    policy. We encourage recipients and others to report violators. 
                    If you believe you have received an email in violation of 
                    this policy, please send a message to <a href="mailto:privacy@ipost.com">privacy@ipost.com</a>.</p>

                  <h3>Cookies</h3>

                  <p>A cookie is a small file stored on a web browser user's hard 
                    drive containing information that is placed there by a website. 
                    This information is often used to track visits by the same 
                    web browser to the same site, or to remember information between 
                    sessions on the website for the convenience of the user.</p>

                  <p>iPost does not presently use cookies on this website.</p>
                  <p>Clients
                      of  iPost may elect to use cookies on their own websites,
                      some 
                      portions of which may be hosted on iPost servers. iPost
                    is not responsible for the use of such cookies and may have
                      no 
                      information about them. If you are concerned about the
                    use
                       of cookies in your web browser, you may adjust the settings
                      
                    of your web browser to selectively accept cookies or reject
                       them entirely.</p>
                  <p>The iPost Mailing Manager (iMM) website, a part of the iPost
                    service, uses cookies to permit our clients to more easily
                    log in to 
                    the iMM from other services. This use of cookies is optional
                    on the part of our clients.</p>
                  <h3>Log Files</h3>

                  <p>We may use IP addresses to analyze trends, administer our service, 
                    track users' movement, and gather broad demographic information 
                    for aggregate use.</p>

                  <h3>Tracking pixels</h3>

                  <p>Tracking pixels (also known as "web bugs") are
                  small, typically transparent images on a web page
                  that have special names which permit the loading of
                  the web page to be tracked by a web server.  iPost
                  does not use tracking pixels on our web site.  We do
                  use tracking pixels in HTML email we send to detect
                  when the email is opened.  Some of our clients may
                  use tracking pixels on forms that we host on our web
                  servers, and some of those tracking pixels may be
                  linked to tracking services hosted by third parties.
                  Please see our clients' and the third parties'
                  privacy policies for information about such tracking
                  pixels.</p>

                  <h3>Sharing</h3>

                  <p>We may share aggregated demographic information with our
                    partners. Shared aggregated information is not linked to
                    any information about any individual
                    person.</p>

                  <p>We may partner with another party to provide specific services. 
                    When the user signs up for these services, we may share names 
                    and other contact information that is necessary for the third 
                    party to provide these services. These parties are not allowed 
                    to use personally identifiable information except for the 
                    purpose of providing these services. Any such partnership 
                    activity will also comply with this privacy statement.</p>

                  <h3>Links</h3>

                  <p>This web site contains links to other sites. Please be aware
                    that  iPost is not responsible for the privacy practices
                    of other 
                    sites. We encourage our users to be aware of when they leave
                     our site and to read the privacy statements of each and
                    every 
                    web site that collects personally identifiable information.
                     This privacy statement applies solely to information collected,
                    and services provided,
                    by our web site.</p>

                  <h3>Newsletter</h3>

                  <p>From time to time we may offer users the opportunity to subscribe 
                    to one of our newsletters. If a user wishes to subscribe to 
                    a newsletter, we ask for contact information such as name 
                    and email address. We only send our newsletters to people 
                    who ask to receive them.</p>

                  <h3>Forms and Surveys</h3>

                  <p>From time to time we may request information from users
                    via forms or surveys. Participation in these surveys or contests
                    is completely voluntary and the user therefore has a choice
                    whether or not to disclose this information. Information
                    requested
                    may include contact information (such as name and email address),
                    and demographic information (such as zip code and profession).
                    Contact information will be used to notify the user requesting
                    a quote or other service. Survey information will be used
                    for purposes of monitoring or improving this site and our
                    services.</p>

                  <h3>Security</h3>

                  <p>This website (www.ipost.com) does not collect highly sensitive 
                    information (such as credit card numbers or Social Security 
                    numbers) from our users. For information about security on 
                    our client-only service site, see the iPost Mailing Manager 
                    ASP Site section below.</p>

                  <h3>Unsubscribing/Updating Personal Information</h3>

                  <p>If a user's personally identifiable information changes (such 
                    as the zipcode), or if a user no longer desires our service, 
                    we will endeavor to provide a way to correct, update or remove 
                    that user's personal data provided to us.</p>

                  <p>Every message the iPost service sends contains instructions
                     that allow you unsubscribe from messages sent via iPost
                    from the sender 
                    of that particular message. iPost notifies our clients of
                    unsubscribe requests, and we permanently retain and respects
                    such
                    requests in our own database.</p>

                  <p>To contact iPost to request removal from future iPost

                  <h3>iPost Mailing Manager (iMM) Site</h3>

                  <p>This site (www.ipost.com) contains a link to the iPost Mailing
                    Manager (iMM) site. The iMM site is not a consumer site,
                    and may only be accessed by iPost clients with passwords.
                    By using the ASP site, clients are bound by rules and regulations
                    found in their Service Agreement which includes content and
                    privacy regulations for any mailing performed with the iPost
                    service.</p>

                  <p>The iMM website takes every reasonable precaution
                     to protect our clients' and email recipients' information.
                    
                    When users submit information via the website, that information
                     is protected both online and offline. When the iMM site
                    asks 
                    users to enter sensitive information or displays sensitive
                     information, that information is encrypted and is protected
                    
                    with the standard SSL security protocol. While on an SSL-secured
                     page, the lock icon on the bottom of Web browsers such as
                    
                    Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes
                     locked.</p>

                  <p>While we use SSL encryption on the iMM site 
                    to protect sensitive information online, we also take reasonable
                     measures to protect user information offline. All of our
                    users' 
                    information, not just the sensitive information mentioned
                     above, is restricted in our offices. Only employees who
                    need 
                    the information to perform a specific job (for example, a
                     billing clerk or a customer service representative) are
                    granted 
                    access to personally identifiable information. Furthermore,
                     all employees are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy
                    
                    practices. Every quarter, as well as any time new policies
                     are added, our employees are notified and/or reminded about
                    
                    the importance we place on privacy, and what they can do
                    to  ensure our customers' information is protected.</p>

                  <p>If you have any questions about the security at our website, 
                    you can send an email to <a href="mailto:privacy@ipost.com">privacy@ipost.com</a>.</p>

                  <h3>Notification of Changes</h3>

                  <p>If we materially change our privacy policy, we will post
                    a notice on our web site's homepage so our users are always
                    aware
                    of
                    what information 
                    we collect, how we use it, and under circumstances, if any,
                     we disclose it. If at any point we decide to use personally
                    
                    identifiable information in a manner different from that
                    stated  at the time it was collected, we will notify users
                    via email. 
                    Users will have a choice as to whether or not we use their
                     information in this different manner. We will use information
                    
                    in accordance with the privacy policy under which the information
                     was collected.</p>
