	    <h2>iPost Privacy Policy</h2>

	        <p>The personal privacy of Internet users is extremely important to 
              iPost and we recognize and support the protection of clients' and 
              consumers' privacy rights as a fundamental principle of our business.</p>

	    <div class="sectionheader">Information Collection and Use</div>

	    <p>iPost does not sell, share, or rent mailing lists. We
	    deliver messages only to those addresses supplied to the
	    iPost service by the organization or individual who
	    desires to send a message. That means that if you receive
	    a message from iPost, the sender of that message knows
	    that you are receiving it. iPost also requires its clients
	    to provide accurate information that fully identifies the
	    sender, and verifies that information before accepting
	    email addresses from that sender. We will not sell,
	    share, or rent this information to others in ways
	    different from what is disclosed in this statement.</p>

	        <p>In the process of delivering email messages, iPost recognizes any 
              URLs that were clicked and records some information supplied by 
              your computer, such as the type of browser, operating system and 
              IP address. We do not use "cookies" to identify users or to measure 
              mailing effectiveness. Information regarding activity for email 
              recipients is reported only to the mailing originator, who owns 
              or has a suitable license to the list on which the recipient's email 
              address originally appeared.</p>

	        <p>Although more than one sender may independently supply your address, 
              your name, email address, zip code or other identifying information, 
              such information given to us by one sender will not be revealed 
              to any other sender who uses our service. Should we ever change 
              our policy, you will be notified by email and given the chance to 
              remove yourself from our lists before your information is disclosed.</p>
            <p>Users of our website are notified on the website when their information 
              is being collected by any outside parties. We do this so our users 
              can make an informed choice as to whether they should proceed with 
              services that require an outside party. At present, no third parties 
              collect information on our website.</p>

	    <div class="sectionheader">Unsolicited Commercial Email (UCE) Policy</div>

	        <p>iPost contractually prohibits our clients from sending email that fits 
              the definition of unsolicited commercial email or "spam." The term 
              "spam" refers to emailing a message to address(es) that have not 
              asked to receive it. iPost strictly enforces this policy. We insist 
              that our clients send messages with iPost only to recipients who 
              have opted-in, indicating that they wish to receive such mailings. 
              In addition, every message sent using the iPost service provides 
              information about opting out of (that is, choosing not to receive) 
              future mailings.</p>

	    <p>Our UCE policy is rigorously enforced.  iPost may
	    terminate service or take any other action against a
	    client who violates this policy. We encourage recipients
	    and others to report violators. If you believe you have
	    received an email in violation of this policy, please
	    send a message to
	    <a href="mailto:privacy@ipost.com">privacy@ipost.com</a>.</p>

	    <div class="sectionheader">Cookies</div>

	    <p>A cookie is a small file stored on a web browser
	    user's hard drive containing information that is placed
	    there by a website.  This information is often used to
	    track visits by the same web browser to the same site, or
	    to remember information between sessions on the website
	    for the convenience of the user.</p>

	    <p>iPost does not presently use cookies on our website.
	    However, advertisers and others may include information in
	    email we send that creates and makes use of cookies in
	    your web browser.  iPost has no information about or
	    control over the use of such cookies.  If you are
	    concerned about the use of cookies in your web browser,
	    you may adjust the settings of your web browser to
	    selectively accept cookies or reject them entirely.</p>

	    <div class="sectionheader">Log Files</div>

	        <p>We may use IP addresses to analyze trends, administer our service, 
              track users' movement, and gather broad demographic information 
              for aggregate use.</p>

	    <div class="sectionheader">Sharing</div>

	    <p>We may share aggregated demographic information with
	    our partners and advertisers. Shared aggregated
	    information is not linked to any personal information that
	    can identify any individual person.</p>

	    <p>We may partner with another party to provide specific
	    services. When the user signs up for these services, we
	    may share names and other contact information that is
	    necessary for the third party to provide these
	    services. These parties are not allowed to use personally
	    identifiable information except for the purpose of
	    providing these services.  Any such partnership activity
	    will also comply with this privacy statement.</p>

	    <div class="sectionheader">Links</div>

	    <p>This web site contains links to other sites. Please be
	    aware that iPost is not responsible for the privacy
	    practices of other sites. We encourage our users to be
	    aware of when they leave our site and to read the privacy
	    statements of each and every web site that collects
	    personally identifiable information. This privacy
	    statement applies solely to information collected by our
	    web site.</p>

	    <div class="sectionheader">Newsletter</div>

	    <p>From time to time we may offer users the opportunity to
	    subscribe to one of our newsletters. If a user wishes to
	    subscribe to a newsletter, we ask for contact information
	    such as name and email address.  We only send our
	    newsletters to people who ask to receive them.</p>

	    <div class="sectionheader">Forms, Surveys &amp; Contests</div>

	    <p>From time to time we may request information from users
	    via quote forms or surveys.  Participation in these
	    surveys or contests is completely voluntary and the user
	    therefore has a choice whether or not to disclose this
	    information. Information requested may include contact
	    information (such as name and email address), and
	    demographic information (such as zip code and
	    profession). Contact information will be used to notify
	    the user requesting a quote or other service. Survey
	    information will be used for purposes of monitoring or
	    improving this site and our services.</p>

	    <div class="sectionheader">Security</div>

	        <p>This website (www.ipost.com) does not collect highly sensitive 
              information (such as credit card numbers or Social Security numbers) 
              from our users. For information about security on our client-only 
              service site, see the iPost Mailing Manager ASP Site section below.</p>

	    <div class="sectionheader">Supplementation of Information</div>

	    <p>In order for this website to properly fulfill its
	    obligation to our customers, it may be necessary for us to
	    supplement the information we receive with information
	    from 3rd party sources. For example, in order for this
	    website to enhance its ability to tailor the site to an
	    individual's preference, we may combine information
	    about the purchasing habits of users with similar
	    information from our partners, Company Y &amp; Company Z,
	    to create a personalized user profile. When a user makes a
	    purchase from either of these two companies, the companies
	    collect and share that purchase information with us so we
	    can tailor the site to our users' preferences.</p>

	    <div class="sectionheader">Opt-out<o:p>/Updating Personal Information:</o:p></div>

	        <p>If a user's personally identifiable information changes (such as 
              the zipcode), or if a user no longer desires our service, we will 
              endeavor to provide a way to correct, update or remove that user's 
              personal data provided to us. </p>
            <p> Every message the iPost service sends contains instructions that 
              allow you to block messages sent via iPost from the sender of that 
              particular message. iPost notifies senders of opt-out requests, 
              and respects such requests in our own database.</p>

	    <p>To contact iPost to request removal from future iPost
	    email communications from any or all senders, you can do
	    one of the following: </p>

	    <p>
	      </p><ol>
	          <li>Send email to <a href="mailto:optout@ipost.com">optout@ipost.com</a>

	        <div class="sectionheader">iPost Mailing Manager ASP Site</div>

	        <p>This site (www.ipost.com) contains a link to the iPost Mailing 
              Manager Client ASP site. This site is not a consumer site, and may 
              only be accessed by iPost clients with passwords. By using the ASP 
              site, clients are bound by rules and regulations found in their 
              Service Agreement which includes content and privacy regulations 
              for any mailing performed with the iPost service.</p>

	        <p>The Mailing Manger ASP website takes every reasonable precaution 
              to protect our clients' and email recipients' information. When 
              users submit information via the website, that information is protected 
              both online and offline. When our ASP site asks users to enter sensitive 
              information or displays sensitive information, that information 
              is encrypted and is protected with the standard SSL security protocol. 
              While on an SSL-secured page, the lock icon on the bottom of Web 
              browsers such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer 
              becomes locked.</p>

	        <p>While we use SSL encryption on the iPost Mailing Manager ASP site 
              to protect sensitive information online, we also take reasonable 
              measures to protect user information offline. All of our users' 
              information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, 
              is restricted in our offices. Only employees who need the information 
              to perform a specific job (for example, our billing clerk or a customer 
              service representative) are granted access to personally identifiable 
              information. Furthermore, all employees are kept up-to-date on our 
              security and privacy practices. Every quarter, as well as any time 
              new policies are added, our employees are notified and/or reminded
