				<div class="post-entry">
					<p>The personal privacy of Internet users is extremely important  to iPost and we recognize and support the protection of clients’ and  consumers’ privacy rights as a fundamental principle of our business.</p>
<p><strong>Information Collection and Use</strong></p>
<p>iPost does not sell, share, or rent mailing lists. We deliver  messages only to those addresses supplied to the iPost service by the  organization or individual who desires to send a message. That means  that if you receive a message from iPost, the sender of that message  knows that you are receiving it. iPost also requires its clients to  provide accurate information that fully identifies the sender, and  verifies that information before accepting email addresses from that  sender. We will not sell, share, or rent this information to others in  ways different from what is disclosed in this statement.</p>
<p>In the process of delivering email messages, iPost recognizes any  URLs that were clicked and records some information supplied by your  computer, such as the type of browser, operating system and IP address.  We do not use “cookies” to identify users or to measure mailing  effectiveness. Information regarding activity for email recipients is  reported only to the mailing originator, who owns or has a suitable  license to the list on which the recipient’s email address originally  appeared.</p>
<p>Although more than one sender may independently supply your address,  your name, email address, zip code or other identifying information,  such information given to us by one sender will not be revealed to any  other sender who uses our service. Should we ever change our policy, you  will be notified by email and given the chance to remove yourself from  our lists before your information is disclosed.</p>
<p>Users of our website are notified on the website when their  information is being collected by any outside parties. We do this so our  users can make an informed choice as to whether they should proceed  with services that require an outside party. At present, no third  parties collect information on our website.</p>
<p><strong>Unsolicited Commercial Email (UCE) Policy</strong></p>
<p>iPost contractually prohibits our clients from sending email that  fits the definition of unsolicited commercial email or “spam.” The term  “spam” refers to emailing a message to address(es) that have not asked  to receive it. iPost strictly enforces this policy. We insist that our  clients send messages with iPost only to recipients who have subscribed,  indicating that they wish to receive mailings from our client. In  addition, every message sent using the iPost service provides  information about unsubscribing from (that is, choosing not to receive)  future mailings.</p>
<p>Our UCE policy is rigorously enforced. iPost may terminate service or  take any other action against a client who violates this policy. We  encourage recipients and others to report violators. If you believe you  have received an email in violation of this policy, please send a  message to<a href="mailto:privacy@ipost.com">privacy@ipost.com</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Cookies</strong></p>
<p>A cookie is a small file stored on a web browser user’s hard drive  containing information that is placed there by a website. This  information is often used to track visits by the same web browser to the  same site, or to remember information between sessions on the website  for the convenience of the user.</p>
<p>iPost presently uses a third party web analytics system which uses  cookies on this website and the iPost Mailing Manager. These cookies are  used only to identify the popularity of web pages and the path visitors  take through our site. Visitor identity is not collected or used.</p>
<p>Clients of iPost may elect to use cookies on their own websites, some  portions of which may be hosted on iPost servers. iPost is not  responsible for the use of such cookies and may have no information  about them. If you are concerned about the use of cookies in your web  browser, you may adjust the settings of your web browser to selectively  accept cookies or reject them entirely.</p>
<p>The iPost Mailing Manager (iMM) website, a part of the iPost service,  also uses cookies to permit our clients to more easily log in to the  iMM from other services. This use of cookies is optional on the part of  our clients.</p>
<p><strong>Log Files</strong></p>
<p>We may use IP addresses to analyze trends, administer our service,  track users’ movement, and gather broad demographic information for  aggregate use.</p>
<p><strong>Tracking pixels</strong></p>
<p>Tracking pixels (also known as “web bugs”) are small, typically  transparent images on a web page that have special names which permit  the loading of the web page to be tracked by a web server. iPost does  not use tracking pixels on our web site. We do use tracking pixels in  HTML email we send to detect when the email is opened. Some of our  clients may use tracking pixels on forms that we host on our web  servers, and some of those tracking pixels may be linked to tracking  services hosted by third parties. Please see our clients’ and the third  parties’ privacy policies for information about such tracking pixels.</p>
<p><strong>Sharing</strong></p>
<p>We may share aggregated demographic information with our partners.  Shared aggregated information is not linked to any information about any  individual person.</p>
<p>We may partner with another party to provide specific services. When  the user signs up for these services, we may share names and other  contact information that is necessary for the third party to provide  these services. These parties are not allowed to use personally  identifiable information except for the purpose of providing these  services. Any such partnership activity will also comply with this  privacy statement.</p>
<p><strong>Links</strong></p>
<p>This web site contains links to other sites. Please be aware that  iPost is not responsible for the privacy practices of other sites. We  encourage our users to be aware of when they leave our site and to read  the privacy statements of each and every web site that collects  personally identifiable information. This privacy statement applies  solely to information collected, and services provided, by our web site.</p>
<p><strong>Newsletter</strong></p>
<p>From time to time we may offer users the opportunity to subscribe to  one of our newsletters. If a user wishes to subscribe to a newsletter,  we ask for contact information such as name and email address. We only  send our newsletters to people who ask to receive them.</p>
<p><strong>Forms and Surveys</strong></p>
<p>From time to time we may request information from users via forms or  surveys. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely  voluntary and the user therefore has a choice whether or not to disclose  this information. Information requested may include contact information  (such as name and email address), and demographic information (such as  zip code and profession). Contact information will be used to notify the  user requesting a quote or other service. Survey information will be  used for purposes of monitoring or improving this site and our services.</p>
<p><strong>Security</strong></p>
<p>This website (<a href="http://www.ipost.com" title="www.ipost.com">www.ipost.com</a>)  does not collect highly sensitive information (such as credit card  numbers or Social Security numbers) from our users. For information  about security on our client-only service site, see the iPost Mailing  Manager ASP Site section below.</p>
<p><strong>Unsubscribing/Updating Personal Information</strong></p>
<p>If a user’s personally identifiable information changes (such as the  zipcode), or if a user no longer desires our service, we will endeavor  to provide a way to correct, update or remove that user’s personal data  provided to us.</p>
<p>Every message the iPost service sends contains instructions that  allow you unsubscribe from messages sent via iPost from the sender of  that particular message. iPost notifies our clients of unsubscribe  requests, and we permanently retain and respects such requests in our  own database.</p>
<p>To contact iPost to request removal from future iPost email  communications from any or all senders, you can do one of the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Send email to&nbsp;<a href="mailto:optout@ipost.com">optout@ipost.com</a>&nbsp;specifying the address that you wish to unsubscribe, or</li>
<li>Send mail to the US postal address:<br>iPost<br>Attn: iPost Optout<br>155 Bovet Road&nbsp;<br>Suite 310&nbsp;<br>San Mateo, CA 94402</li>
<li>Call one of the following numbers:<br>1-415-382-4000 (if you’re outside USA) or<br>1-866-418-4877 (if you’re within USA).</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>iPost Mailing Manager (iMM) Site</strong></p>
<p>This site (<a href="http://www.ipost.com" title="www.ipost.com">www.ipost.com</a>)  contains a link to the iPost Mailing Manager (iMM) site. The iMM site  is not a consumer site, and may only be accessed by iPost clients with  passwords. By using the ASP site, clients are bound by rules and  regulations found in their Service Agreement which includes content and  privacy regulations for any mailing performed with the iPost service.</p>
<p>The iMM website takes every reasonable precaution to protect our  clients’ and email recipients’ information. When users submit  information via the website, that information is protected both online  and offline. When the iMM site asks users to enter sensitive information  or displays sensitive information, that information is encrypted and is  protected with the standard SSL security protocol. While on an  SSL-secured page, the lock icon on the bottom of Web browsers such as  Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked.</p>
<p>While we use SSL encryption on the iMM site to protect sensitive  information online, we also take reasonable measures to protect user  information offline. All of our users’ information, not just the  sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted in our offices.  Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for  example, a billing clerk or a customer service representative) are  granted access to personally identifiable information. Furthermore, all  employees are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy practices.  Every quarter, as well as any time new policies are added, our employees  are notified and/or reminded about the importance we place on privacy,  and what they can do to ensure our customers’ information is protected.</p>
<p>If you have any questions about the security at our website, you can send an email to&nbsp;<a href="mailto:privacy@ipost.com">privacy@ipost.com</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Notification of Changes</strong></p>
<p>If we materially change our privacy policy, we will post a notice on  our web site’s homepage so our users are always aware of what  information we collect, how we use it, and under circumstances, if any,  we disclose it. If at any point we decide to use personally identifiable  information in a manner different from that stated at the time it was  collected, we will notify users via email. Users will have a choice as  to whether or not we use their information in this different manner. We  will use information in accordance with the privacy policy under which  the information was collected.</p>
<p>You can review the most current version of the Privacy Policy at any  time by clicking the Privacy Policy link on the iPost website. If you  have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact&nbsp;<a href="mailto:privacy@ipost.com">privacy@ipost.com</a>.</p>
