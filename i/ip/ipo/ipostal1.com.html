            <p>This Privacy Notice was posted on January10,2019. It is effective for all users.</p>

            <p>USZoom LLC is committed to your privacy. This privacy notice explains our collection, use, disclosure, retention and protection of your personal information.</p>

            <p>This  is  the  privacy  policy  ("POLICY",  “NOTICE”)  of  USZoom,  LLC,  a Delaware  limited  liability  corporation  ("USZOOM","OUR","WE","US").  The POLICY  applies  to  OUR  secure  hosted  digital  mailbox  applications  which require  registration  and  payment  and  may  include digital  mailboxservices (DMS), check processing, tools, or other mail and message related services that WE perform. The POLICY is applicable to all websites and services operated by USZOOM  including  but  not  limited  to:  iPostal1.com,  iWorkspaceMail.com, iCollegeMail.com,  iRVMail.com,  USAMAIL1.com  and  their  associated  apps collectively "THE SERVICES" or "HOSTED SERVICES".</p>

            <p>This  policy  governs  OUR  treatment  of  data  collected  from  users  ("USERS", "YOU", "YOUR") of THE SERVICES.</p>

            <p>WE take very seriously the job of providing high quality service and protecting YOUR  privacy. Therefore,  we endeavour to  reflect  the understandings  and standards found in the GDPR. The information below outlines the commitment WE have made to protect YOUR privacy. WE may amend this privacy notice at any time by posting the amended version on this site including the effective date of the amended version. WE will announce any material changes to this privacy notice through the USZoom.com website, iPostal1 website or app, and/or via email.</p>

            <h2>1. Scope:</h2>

            <p>This privacy notice applies to any of THE SERVICES offered by USZoom LLC, where this privacy notice is referenced, regardless of how YOU access or use them, including through mobile devices.</p>

            <p>This privacy notice also applies to the provision of USZoom LLC services through any USZoom LLC partner's website, application, service or tool where it is referenced and where YOUR listings and their content are published or advertised in accordance with the terms of this NOTICE.</p>

            <h2>2. Personal data:</h2>

            <p><strong>a) What is considered Personal Data?</strong></p>

            <p>Under GDPR, Personal Data is information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person. An identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person. GDPR does not consider Personal Data to include information that has been anonymised or aggregated so that it can no longer be used to identify a specific natural person, whether in combination with other information or otherwise.

            </p><p><strong>b) What is considered Special Category Data?</strong></p>

            <p>Special Category Data is Personal Data which the GDPR says is more sensitive, and as such needs more protection.</p>

            <p>This includes:</p>

            <ul style="list-style-type: disc;"><li>race;</li>
                <li>ethnic origin;</li>
                <li>politics;</li>
                <li>religion;</li>
                <li>trade union membership;</li>
                <li>genetics;</li>
                <li>biometrics (where used for ID purposes);</li>
                <li>health;</li>
                <li>sex life; or</li>
                <li>sexual orientation.</li></ul>

            <p>As YOUR DMS provider WE and YOUR Commercial Mail Receiving Agent (CMRA) of choice from within OUR network, may receive on YOUR behalf and
                collect both Personal Data and Special Category Data when YOU use OUR Services.</p>

            <h2>3. How and when do WE collect Personal Data?</h2>
