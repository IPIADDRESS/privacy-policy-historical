<p align="center"><em>Updated and effective from 12 April 2018</em></p>
<p align="center" style="text-align: left;"><span style="text-align: left;">The International Energy Agency of 31-35 rue de la Fédération, 75015 Paris, France (</span><strong style="text-align: left;">IEA</strong><span style="text-align: left;">), an autonomous agency within the framework of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (</span><strong style="text-align: left;">OECD</strong><span style="text-align: left;">), is committed to the protection of personal information.</span></p>
<p>This Privacy Policy explains what information the IEA may collect from you and how we may manage and use that information. We undertake to ensure that any personal information you provide is collected and used in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p><strong>1.&nbsp;</strong><strong>General</strong></p>
<p>The personal information that you submit to the IEA, for the purposes specified when you submitted such information, will be managed in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>By using the IEA websites and/or registering your details for a purchase or for acquiring other information, you agree to the processing of your personal information for such purposes and as outlined in this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>Registration on the IEA websites is optional. You can use www.iea.org and the IEA web store when you choose not to provide personal information. However, certain features of the website and webstore that require registration may be unavailable (for example, downloads, online purchases or e-mail alerts).</p>
<p><strong>2.&nbsp;</strong><strong>Collection of personal information </strong><span style="font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><em>Information the IEA <strong>collects automatically</strong> on the IEA websites</em></p>

The IEA will explain the specific purpose for which it requests your consent to collect and use your personal information, and the extent to which it will process your personal information for such purpose(s).&nbsp; If you give your consent, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time (see below).</p>
<p><strong>3.&nbsp;</strong><strong>Use of collected personal information</strong></p>
<p><em>Information the IEA collects automatically on the IEA websites</em></p>
<p>We use information that we have obtained automatically from the IEA websites in ways necessary to successfully provide, operate, maintain and optimise our website (which we also believe benefit our website visitors) including to enable smooth website traffic, for technical support (debugging any problems that arise) and to manage and enhance our website security.</p>
<p><em>Personal information you register on the IEA websites and IEA webstore</em></p>
<p>The personal information that you register on the IEA websites, including the IEA webstore, is necessary to fulfil our contract with you when you purchase or subscribe to IEA material.&nbsp; For example, we use it to process and complete your purchase of, or subscription to, the products that you requested, to maintain communication with you with respect to the status of your order, to send you the relevant items purchased or subscribed to and the related invoices and receipts, and to respond to any queries that you might have about the transaction.</p>
<p>We also use personal information that you have registered on the IEA websites and IEA webstore for the following customer service purposes:</p>
<ul>
<li>To allow you to obtain IEA products in a straightforward way and to provide you with personalised service, including so you won’t need to re-enter all of your details if you are a returning customer;</li>
<li>To allow the IEA to analyze your profile so as to personalise or otherwise improve our offering to you;</li>
<li>To send you e-mails confirming and managing your account such as to send you temporary passwords should you request one, perform updates on your information or notify you of data breaches;</li>
<li>To contact you for feedback (including via surveys) so that we may improve or develop our products, services or content; and</li>
<li>To respond to your email queries.</li>
</ul>
<p>Where you have given your express consent, we and/or our third party service providers will also use the information to provide you with relevant IEA email newsletters, notifications, updates.</p>
<p><em>General</em></p>
<p>Personal information you submitted to the IEA in other contexts will only be used for the specific and legitimate purpose(s) for which it was collected and as explained to you at the time of collection.</p>
<p><strong>4.&nbsp;</strong><strong>Management and security of collected personal information</strong></p>
<p>The IEA endeavours to collect and manage personal information in a responsible way, taking the necessary and appropriate technical and organisational measures to protect and safeguard your information against loss, theft, and misuse, as well as against unauthorised access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction. These measures are reviewed and updated where necessary.</p>
<p>Collected personal information will be used for the abovementioned purposes only and will not be further processed or distributed in a manner that is incompatible with this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>The number of staff that have access to and process personal information for the relevant purpose(s) is limited to the strict minimum. &nbsp;These staff are obligated to respect the privacy and confidentiality of such personal information.</p>
<p><strong>5.&nbsp;</strong><strong>Length of time we use and store your personal information</strong></p>
<p><em>Information the IEA collects automatically on the IEA websites</em></p>
<p>The automatically collected information on IEA websites is retained for a maximum period of two years but usually no more than 6 months.</p>
<p><em>Personal information you register on the IEA websites</em></p>
<p>The personal information you register on the IEA webstore is retained for a maximum period of three years, starting from the moment you register. This period is renewed for another three years anytime a purchase or download is made using the same registered user account. However, personal data of subscription users are kept until three years after the subscription expires.</p>
<p><em>General</em></p>
<p>Personal information collected in other contexts by the IEA will be kept only as long as required for the specified purpose at the time of collection.</p>
