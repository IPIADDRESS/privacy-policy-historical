      IENTRY, INC. PRIVACY POLICY</font></b><br>
      <font color="#000000" face="arial, helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br>
      Recognized by the industry for our commitment to safeguarding
        consumer privacy on our Web site, we operate under a strict set of
        privacy principles:
        </font></p><ul><font color="#000000" face="arial, helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
          <li>The only information the iEntry Network obtains about individual
            visitors to its Web site is information supplied voluntarily by
            visitors.
          </li><li>In cases when the iEntry Network may need personal information to
            provide visitors with services tailored especially for them, or to
            inform them about new features or services, visitors are asked
            explicitly for that information.
          </li><li>All identifiable information provided by members (name, email or
            home address) will not be disclosed to anyone unless members
            specifically request the iEntry Network to do so.
          </li><li>Only statistical information of our members as a group (usage
            habits, demographics) may be shared with any partner of the iEntry
            Network; no identifiable information will be shared at any time.
          </li><li>The iEntry Network employs strict security measures to safeguard
            online transactions; personal information is stored in a secured
            database and always sent via an encrypted Internet channel.
          </li><li><b>Delete/deactivate policy</b><br>
            Users may unsubscribe to any of our electronic newsletters at any
            time by following the instructions contained at the end of every
            newsletter.
          </li><li><b>E-newsletter Privacy Policy</b><br>
            iEntry maintains a strict "no-spam" policy. Your e-mail
            address will not be sold to any third party if you sign up for one
            of our e-newsletters. If you sign up for an e-mail newsletter at an
            iEntry site, you will receive only the e-mail newsletter you have
            requested and our weekly promotional newsletter eZined.  eZined
	    promotes our new newsletter offerings and you can unsubscribe from
            it at any time.  You will not be added to any other newsletter lists
	    without your permission.
          </li><li><b>Polling</b><br>
            Several iEntry sites offer interactive polls to users so they can
            easily share their opinions with other users and see what the iEntry
            audience thinks about important issues. iEntry uses a system to
            "tag" users after they have voted, so they can vote only
            once on a particular question. This tag is not correlated with
            information about individual users.
          </li><li><b>Surveys</b><br>
            Occasionally, iEntry conducts user surveys to better target our
            content to our audience. We sometimes share the aggregated
            demographic information in these surveys with our advertisers and
            partners. We never share any information about specific individuals
            with any third party.
          </li><li><b>Submission</b><br>
            Our site submission guidelines are simple and straightforward.
            Multiple submissions of the same site, site descriptions with
            embedded graphics and/or javascript, pornographic site submissions
            and sites promoting hatred, intolerance, or prejudice are not
            permitted and will be deleted during or after our filtering process.
            Spamming the directory is a waste of everyone's time. It entails
            considerable work on our part to remove duplicate listings and
            consequently delays the posting of legitimate submissions for a
            period of 4 to 5 weeks following the date of submission.</li>
