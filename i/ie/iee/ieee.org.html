      <p class="MsoNormal">This security and privacy policy (“Privacy
      Policy”) constitutes a part of the <u> <b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal"><a href="/about/documentation/copyright/legal.htm">Terms
      &amp; Conditions&nbsp;</a> </b></u>(“Terms and Conditions”) of the
      IEEE Web Site, which governs your use of this Site.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>The Terms and Conditions, including this Privacy Policy, may be
      amended by the IEEE at any time by posting the amended Terms and
      Conditions on this Site.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The
      Terms and Conditions were last amended on 21 December 2001.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">In
      addition to this Privacy Policy, certain IEEE services on or accessible
      from this Site have Supplemental Terms that will govern your use of such
      services. These also form a part of the Terms and Conditions and govern
      your use of such services.<br>
      </span></p>
      <p><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Arial Unicode MS&quot;">Credit Card Transactions</span></b></p>
      <p><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Arial Unicode MS&quot;">For
      your protection, we have taken a number of steps to maximize the security
      of financial transactions that are accepted on the IEEE Web Site. Credit
      Card processing is accomplished using secure processing services.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>Your entry of<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>credit card information is encrypted when transmitted in
      secure mode.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>If you are
      behind a firewall, the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) feature of your browser
      and the processing of the credit card may be blocked. In this case, you
      have the option of credit card processing without SSL by selecting the
      "Non-Secure" feature on the screen -- the choice is up to
      you.&nbsp;</span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">If for any reason, you still feel uncomfortable
      submitting your credit card over the Internet, you can mail your form to
      us.<br>
      &nbsp;</p>
      <p><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Arial Unicode MS&quot;">Using Encryption</span></b></p>
      <p><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Arial Unicode MS&quot;">In
      certain transactions you are given the option of running in a secure (SSL)
      mode or unsecure mode. In cases where a firewall is causing a situation
      that cannot be corrected, the use of the unsecure mode is given. The
      unsecure mode is used by you at your own risk.</span></p>
      <p><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Arial Unicode MS&quot;">In
      addition, there are constantly changing restrictions in the use of
      encryption software and schemes that are used in various countries. The
      use of appropriate software and encryption options are your
      responsibility, and the IEEE assumes no risk or liability in ensuring your
      compliance to local law.</span></p>
      <p><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Arial Unicode MS&quot;">REGARDLESS
      OF THE PRECAUTIONS TAKEN BY YOU OR BY THE IEEE, “PERFECT SECURITY”
      DOES NOT EXIST ON THE INTERNET. THE IEEE CANNOT ENSURE OR WARRANT THE
      SECURITY OF ANY INFORMATION YOU TRANSMIT TO THIS SITE OR THE IEEE, AND YOU
      TRANSMIT SUCH INFORMATION AT YOUR OWN RISK.<br>

      <p><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Arial Unicode MS&quot;">There
      are a number of areas in the IEEE Web Site where we ask for and collect
      information about you, including personally identifiable information.
      Where we do, it is in order to serve you better, or is necessary to
      accomplish the service you are requesting. Examples include membership
      information (which may include name, address, email, telephone number and
      educational and professional experience information), security
      identifiers, shipping information, and product purchase information stored
      in online shopping carts.</span></p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText" style="text-indent:0in"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:

      <p class="MsoBodyText" style="text-indent:0in"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:
&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Membership information is used both in the IEEE mailing
      lists (which also includes lists provided to technical and geographical
      units of the IEEE (for example, societies and sections)) and in the IEEE
      Membership Directory.</span></p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText" style="text-indent:0in"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:
&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">From time to time, to better serve our members and to
      supplement member dues, the IEEE mailing list, in part or as a whole, is
      released to other engineering and carefully selected third party
      organizations to provide you with information on technical products and
      services related to your profession, or that we otherwise believe is
      useful to our members.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In
      addition, the mailing lists may be used in connection with informing you
      about IEEE services, products, conferences, meetings and events. You may
      instruct us to not share information about you in the IEEE mailing lists
      with third parties by indicating this preference on your membership
      application when you join the IEEE, on your renewal form when you renew
      your membership, or by sending an email to us at <b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:

      <p><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Arial Unicode MS&quot;">Cookies
      are implemented in various parts of the IEEE Site, such as the Electronic
      Catalog. In most instances, the use of Cookies is discretionary by you,
      and declining Cookies will usually result only in loss of certain
      conveniences such as session continuity and re-authentication during
      current or future sessions. Various types of Persistent and Per-Session
      (Transient) Cookies may be used with any one service, and their
      implementations, behaviors, and effects will vary. Most IEEE sites using
      Cookies have specific statements on their use as part of their Frequently
      Asked Questions (“FAQ”) section. It is the policy of the IEEE that
      Cookies do not carry any of your personal information (name, email
      address, credit card, etc.) nor identification/password-type data that
      allows access to such personal information on IEEE servers. All personal,
      transaction, and security rights are housed on secure IEEE servers, and
      follow the policy described in the "<a href="#Info">Information We
      Collect From You and How We Use the Information</a>" section above.<br>

      <p><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Arial Unicode MS&quot;">All
      of the IEEE Web servers throughout the main network are registered through
      Verisign as secure servers using industry-standard certificate techniques.
      This enables all communication between our servers to be verified when
      services are requested between our computers.&nbsp;</span></p>
      <p><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Arial Unicode MS&quot;">All
      of the personal information collected from you on the Site, including
      names, addresses, are stored behind a "firewall," and defenses
      have been erected to seek to enhance the protection of your information
      from outside attack by hackers and curious visitors.<br>

      <p><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Arial Unicode MS&quot;">There
      is a common registration process that allows you to receive your
      "IEEE Web Account". The registration involves the use of your
      membership number, a registration PIN number, and your subsequent choice
      of a unique user name and password. See the <a href="/web/accounts/">IEEE
      Web Account Site</a> for more information on this service.&nbsp;</span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">The user name and password will be used to
      authenticate you when you enter privileged services that are offered by
      the IEEE. After authentication, the service being requested will be
      allowed based on your current status in the IEEE, Societies, or specific
      electronic services for which you have signed-up.<br>
