<p><strong>3. DO WE DISCLOSE OR SHARE YOUR INFORMATION?</strong></p>
<p>We will share your personal information with third parties only in the ways that are described in this Privacy Policy. <strong>We do not sell your personal information to, or share such personal information with, third parties for their promotional use or for marketing purposes.</strong></p>
<p>In order for us to provide you with our identity protection service and for the prevention and detection of fraud, we will share your personal information with third parties who perform services on our behalf. Depending on the service you have requested, we may share your name, e-mail address, national identifier or social security number (as applicable), income, account balances, payment history and credit history with credit bureaus. We will also share your billing information with a credit card processing company in order to bill you for goods and services. These companies are authorized to use your personal information only as necessary to provide these services to us.</p>
<p>In certain situations, CSID may be required to disclose personal data in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.</p>
<p>As may be required by law, we may also disclose your personal information, for example to comply with a subpoena, or similar legal process, when we believe in good faith that the disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud, or respond to a government request.</p>
<p>In addition, in the event of a merger, acquisition, or any form of sale of some or all of our assets to a third party, we may also disclose your personal information to the third parties concerned or their professional advisors. In the event of such a transaction, the personal information held by CSID will be among the assets transferred to the buyer.</p>
<p><strong>4. IS YOUR INFORMATION SECURE?</strong></p>
<p>We have appropriate physical, technical and organizational measures in place to protect your data when held by CSID that comply with relevant legal and best practice requirements. When you enter sensitive information (such as a credit card, social security number or login credentials) as part of the enrollment process, we encrypt the transmission of that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL).</p>
<p>When you submit information to CSID through the relevant portal or web site, you should be aware that your information is transmitted across the Internet and that no method of transmission over the Internet is 100% secure. Although we take reasonable security measures to protect your information when we receive it, you also need to ensure you take appropriate steps to protect your information.</p>
<p>We will obtain assurances from any agents we may use to help provide this service that they will safeguard personal information consistently with this Privacy Policy, which assurance will require the agent to provide the same level of protection as is required by the relevant Privacy Shield Principles and the EU Data Protection Directive.</p>
<p><strong>5. INFORMATION RELATED TO DATA COLLECTED FOR OUR CLIENTS</strong></p>
<p>In most cases, CSID resells its services through its third party commercial clients (“Clients”). Accordingly, CSID typically does not have a direct relationship with the individuals whose personal data it processes when CSID acts as a wholesaler of its services. If you are a customer of one of our Clients and would no longer like to be contacted by one of our Clients that resells our services, please contact the specific Client that you interact with directly. We may transfer your personal information to the applicable Client that resells our services and also to third parties who perform the services on our behalf or help us provide our services.</p>
<p>An individual who seeks access, or who seeks to correct, amend, or delete enrollment data should direct his or her query to CSID’s Client. If requested to edit enrollment data by our Client, we will respond within 30 days. In some cases, we will edit enrollment data on behalf of our Clients. When managing choice options on behalf of our Clients, we will also respond to any requests within 30 days. We will retain personal data we process on behalf of our Clients for as long as needed to provide services to our Client. CSID will retain this personal information for so long as necessary to comply with our legal and audit obligations, to resolve disputes and to enforce our agreements.</p>
<p><strong>6. WILL WE SEND YOU OFFERS OF OTHER CSID PRODUCTS AND SERVICES?</strong></p>
<p>Our range of identity protection products and services is constantly evolving to match the increasingly sophisticated market in which we operate. We will not send you details of other CSID products or services or those of any reputable third parties without your prior consent and you can change your mind at any time by contacting us. In the limited instances we send you promotional or other informational communications, you may opt-out of receiving them by following the instructions included in each communication, by e-mailing us at the e-mail address provided below or by contacting us through one of the methods listed below.</p>
<p><strong>7. ARE YOU VISITING OUR WEB SITE FROM A COUNTRY IN THE EUROPEAN UNION (E.U.)?</strong></p>
<p>CSID, based in the United States, maintains servers in both the United States and the United Kingdom. If you are visiting our web site from outside the United States, your personal information, in some rare instances, may be transferred to, stored, and/or processed in the United States. If your personal information enters our servers in the United States, CSID will protect your data in accordance with the Privacy Shield Principles outlined below.</p>
<p>The United States Department of Commerce and the European Commission have agreed on a set of data protection principles and frequently asked questions (the “Privacy Shield Principles”) to enable U.S. companies, such as CSID, to satisfy the requirement under European Union law that adequate protection be given to personal information transferred from the E.U. to the United States.</p>
<p>CSID complies with the U.S.–Swiss Safe Harbor framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal data from Switzerland. CSID has certified that it adheres to the Safe Harbor Privacy Principles of notice, choice, onward transfer, security, data integrity, access, and enforcement. To learn more about the Safe Harbor program, please visit <a href="http://www.export.gov/safeharbor/">http://www.export.gov/safeharbor/</a> and to view CSID’s certification, please visit <a href="https://safeharbor.export.gov/swisslist.aspx">https://safeharbor.export.gov/swisslist.aspx</a>.</p>
<p>CSID (and its wholly-owned subsidiary, IdentityTruth, Inc.) participates in and has certified its compliance with the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework.&nbsp; CSID is committed to subjecting all personal data received from European Union (EU) member countries, in reliance on the Privacy Shield Framework, to the Framework’s applicable Principles.&nbsp; To learn more about the Privacy Shield Framework, visit the U.S. Department of Commerce’s <a href="https://www.privacyshield.gov/list">Privacy Shield List</a>.</p>
<p>CSID is responsible for the processing of personal data it receives, under the Privacy Shield Framework, and subsequently transfers to a third party acting as an agent on its behalf.&nbsp; CSID complies with the Privacy Shield Principles for all onward transfers of personal data from the EU, including the onward transfer liability provisions.</p>
<p>With respect to personal data received or transferred pursuant to the Privacy Shield Framework, CSID is subject to the regulatory enforcement powers of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission.&nbsp; In certain situations, CSID may be required to disclose personal data in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.</p>
<p>If you have an unresolved privacy or data use concern that we have not addressed satisfactorily, please contact our U.S.-based third party dispute resolution provider (free of charge) at https://feedback-form.truste.com/watchdog/request.</p>
<p>Under certain conditions, more fully described on the <a href="https://www.privacyshield.gov/article?id=How-to-Submit-a-Complaint">Privacy Shield website</a>, you may invoke binding arbitration when other dispute resolution procedures have been exhausted.</p>
<p>Upon request CSID will provide you with information about whether we hold, or process on behalf of a third party, any of your personal information.&nbsp; To request this information please contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@csid.com">privacy@csid.com</a>.</p>

<p><strong>8. DO WE USE COOKIES?</strong></p>
<p>We, and the third parties we engage to perform analytics services, automatically collect certain general information when you access our web site, via Cookies, Log Files, Web Beacons, and other tracking technologies (the “Tracking Technologies”). We and the third parties we engage use these Tracking Technologies to administer and improve our web site and the content on it, including to track user movements around the web site, to gather usage information and statistics about how our web site is used, to permit users to log in or enroll in our services, to store user preferences, and to customize content. We do not use cookies for marketing or advertising purposes.</p>
<p>We may combine the information we have automatically collected from you with other information we collect about you. We do this to improve services we offer you, to improve, analytics, or web site functionality, and to develop new products and services. The following are some examples of information we may collect:</p>
<ul>
<li>CSID Web site pages you view</li>
<li>Emails that you open or forward</li>
<li>Links you click on</li>
<li>Forms you complete</li>
</ul>
<p>In connection with the web site, for example during the enrollment process or upon log into the web site portal, information about your computer, such as the device ID and other accompanying technical attributes and characteristics, may be accessed, retained and used by us or our service provider solely to analyze trends, track users’ movements on the web site, and to gather demographic information about the user base as a whole. If you access our web site through a mobile device, we also may collect information about your device, such as the device ID or another identifier as permitted by the manufacturer.</p>
<p>CSID and our clients have access to reports produced by these service providers that contain anonymized trends and statistics about website usage on CSID’s proprietary platforms. However, neither CSID nor any other third parties are able to tie any of the anonymized analytics data to your personal information. At no time will this information be provided or sold to any third party affiliates for advertising or marketing purposes. The use of cookies by our partners and the third parties we engage to perform analytics services is not covered by our Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>We, and the third parties we engage to perform analytics services, use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies. Specifically, we use session-based cookies in order to store language and other country specific preferences such as support contact information. CSID may also utilize cookies in order to track internal metrics of site usage. A session ID cookie expires when you close your browser. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period of time. Persistent cookies also enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our site. You can remove persistent cookies by following directions provided in your Internet browser’s “help” file. You can choose to accept or decline cookies. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. However, this may prevent you from taking full advantage of the web site.</p>
<p>As is true of most websites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. This information may include Internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and/or clickstream data. We do not link this automatically collected data to other information we collect about you.</p>
<p>Third parties with whom we partner to provide certain features on our website also use HTML5 to collect and store information. Various browsers may offer their own management tools for removing HTML5.</p>
<p><strong>9. LINKS TO OTHER WEB SITES</strong></p>
<p>Our web site may contain links to other web sites of interest. However, once you have used these links to leave our site, you should note that we do not have any control over that other web site. Therefore, we cannot be responsible for the protection and privacy of any information that you provide while visiting such sites and such sites are not governed by this Privacy Policy. You should exercise caution and look at the privacy statement applicable to the web site in question.</p>
<p><strong>10. SOCIAL MEDIA WIDGETS</strong></p>

<br><br><span style="color: #000000; font-size: 8pt; font-family: 'Open Sans';">You have numerous rights under the FCRA, including the right to dispute inaccurate information in your credit report(s).  Consumer reporting agencies are required to investigate and respond to your dispute, but are not obligated to change or remove accurate information that is reported in compliance with applicable law.  While this plan can provide you assistance in filing a dispute, the FCRA allows you to file a dispute for free with a consumer reporting agency without the assistance of a third party.</span>

<br><br><span style="color: #000000; font-size: 8pt; font-family: 'Open Sans';">*VantageScore 3.0, with scores ranging from 300 to 850, is a user-friendly credit score model developed by the three major nationwide credit reporting agencies, Experian®, TransUnion®, and Equifax®. VantageScore 3.0 is used by some but not all lenders. Higher scores represent a greater likelihood that you'll pay back your debts so you are viewed as being a lower credit risk to lenders. A lower score indicates to lenders that you may be a higher credit risk.</span>

<br><br><span style="color: #000000; font-size: 8pt; font-family: 'Open Sans';">There are three different major credit reporting agencies, Experian, TransUnion, and Equifax that maintain a record of your credit history known as your credit file. Credit scores are based on the information in your credit file at the time it is requested. Your credit file information can vary from agency to agency because some lenders report your credit history to only one or two of the agencies. So your credit scores can vary if the information they have on file for you is different. Since the information in your file can change over time, your credit scores also may be different from day-to-day. Different credit scoring models can also give a different assessment of the credit risk (risk of default) for the same consumer and same credit file.</span>

<br><br><span style="color: #000000; font-size: 8pt; font-family: 'Open Sans';">There are different credit scoring models which may be used by lenders and insurers. Your lender may not use VantageScore 3.0, so don't be surprised if your lender gives you a score that's different from your VantageScore. (And your VantageScore 3.0 may differ from your score under other types of VantageScores). Just remember that your associated risk level is often the same even if the number is not. For some consumers, however, the risk assessment of VantageScore 3.0 could vary, sometimes.</span>
