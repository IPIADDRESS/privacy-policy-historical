<h3>Subject: About IdleHearts and the Information We Collect.</h3>
<p><strong>IdleHearts does not send Spam or sell email addresses.</strong></p>

<h3>Information submitted by Members to IdleHearts</h3>
<p>IdleHearts  is an online social networking community that connects people through  networks of friends for communicating, sharing and making new friends and lovers.  To accomplish this, each IdleHearts Member creates his or her own  profile, which contains the personal information that the Member  chooses to include. This personal information includes such things as:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Name of the Member (depending on the options selected by the Member),</li>
  <li>Gender, age, martial status and other, similar personal information,</li>
  <li>Occupation,</li>
  <li>Schools attended or companies with whom the Member is associated,</li>
  <li>Location (e.g., city and state), and</li>
  <li>Photos or other shared content uploaded by the Member to his or her  profile, to the extent that it includes personal information.</li>
</ul>
<p>IdleHearts  also collects Member-submitted account information such as name and  email address to identify Members, send notifications related to the  use of the IdleHearts service and conduct market research and marketing  for IdleHearts's internal use only. You should also be aware that  Members may reveal other personal information while communicating on  other areas of the IdleHearts website, e.g., while participating in  discussions on <strong>IdleHearts Groups</strong> and/or posting information on  <strong>IdleHearts Blogs</strong>. This information, in turn, might be viewed by other Members or visitors to the IdleHearts website who are not Members.</p>

<h3>Subject:Use of Information Obtained by IdleHearts</h3>

<h3>Display of Members' Information</h3>
<p>Except  where a Member might choose to include a full name in his or her  profile, a Member's email address and full name will only be used in  the following circumstances:</p>
<ul>
  <li>When the Member invites a friend via email to become a IdleHearts Member,</li>
  <li>When the Member sends a request to another Member to add the other Member to his or her friend list,</li>
  <li>When we send notifications to the Member relating to his or her use of the IdleHearts service or IdleHearts website, and</li>
  <li>If  the Member so chooses, when we send regular notifications, weekly  updates, or other news regarding the IdleHearts service or the  IdleHearts website.</li>
</ul>
<p>Except when inviting or adding friends  or as otherwise expressly set forth herein, a Member's email address  will never be shared with or displayed to any other person. Members and  their friends, and other Members within their personal networks  (depending on the level of sharing a Member has chosen) communicate on  IdleHearts with each other through the IdleHearts service, without  disclosing email addresses.</p>

<h3>Use of Members' Information</h3><h3>
<p>We use information relating to each Member's server information, IP address, and browser-type to display targeted third party advertisements.</p>

</h3><h3>Sharing of the Information this Site Gathers/Tracks</h3>
<p>Except  as explained herein, or where you are expressly informed otherwise, we  do not sell, rent, share, trade or give away any of your personal  information unless required by law or for the protection of your  Membership. However, IdleHearts may share profile information and  aggregate usage information in a non-personally identifiable manner  with advertisers and other third parties in order to present to Members  and other users of the IdleHearts website more targeted advertising,  products and services; provided that, in such situations, we will never  disclose information that would personally identify you. As set forth  above, IdleHearts may (i) use your email address to conduct market  research for IdleHearts's internal use only; and/or (ii) use your email  address to market IdleHearts to you (e.g., new features and  applications, announcements, opportunities of interest). IdleHearts may  contract with a third party to conduct such research and marketing;  provided that such third party will be fully bound by an obligation of  confidentiality to IdleHearts and may not use any  personally-identifiable information provided by IdleHearts other than  as expressly instructed by IdleHearts and in strict compliance with the  terms of this Privacy Policy.</p>

<h3>Links</h3>
<p>The  IdleHearts Website contains links to other websites. This includes  links that are placed there by IdleHearts (such as in advertisements),  as well as by other IdleHearts Members. Please be aware that IdleHearts  is not responsible for the privacy practices of any other website. We  encourage all Members and other users of the IdleHearts website to be  aware of when they leave our website, and to read the privacy policies  of each and every website that collects personally identifiable  information. This privacy policy applies solely to information  collected by IdleHearts through the IdleHearts website.</p>

<h3>Use of Cookies</h3>
<p>A  cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user's computer for  record-keeping purposes. We use cookies on the IdleHearts website.  However, we do not and will not use cookies to collect private  information from any Member or other user of the IdleHearts website  which they did not intentionally submit to us other than as stated in  this Privacy Policy. We use both "session ID cookies" and "persistent  cookies." We use session ID cookies to make it easier for you to  navigate our site. A session ID cookie expires when you close you  browser. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended  period of time. Note also that Members may optionally use a cookie to  remember their email in order to automatically log in to our website.  You can remove persistent cookies by following directions provided in  your Internet browsers's "help" file; however, please note that, if you  reject cookies or disable cookies in your web browser, you may not be  able to use the IdleHearts website.</p>

<h3>Correcting/Updating or Removing Information</h3>
<p>REMEMBER  THAT YOU CAN CHANGE THE GROUP OF PEOPLE WHO MAY VIEW YOUR PROFILE AT  ANY TIME. YOU CAN CHANGE THESE PROFILE SHARING SETTINGS BY CLICKING THE  "SETTINGS" LINK IN THE TOP, RIGHT CORNER OF THE IDLEHEARTS HOMEPAGE.  ALSO, YOU CAN ALWAYS CHANGE THE PERSONAL INFORMATION YOU'VE SUBMITTED  TO THE IDLEHEARTS  WEBSITE, INCLUDING THE INFORMATION INCLUDED IN YOUR   PROFILE, BY CLICKING THE "EDIT PROFILE" LINK ON YOUR  IDLEHEARTS  PROFILE PAGE.</p>

<h3>Changes in Our Privacy Policy</h3>
<p>If  we change our privacy policy, we will post those changes on our web  site so Members and other users of the IdleHearts website are always  aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what  circumstances, if any, we disclose it. If we are going to use Members'  or other users' personally identifiable information in a manner  different from that stated at the time of collection, we will notify  those Members and users via email or by placing a prominent notice on  our website.</p>

<h3>Invite a Friend</h3>
<p>If a Member elects  to use our "Invite" feature to invite a friend to become a Member of  the IdleHearts service, we ask them for that friend's email address.  IdleHearts will automatically send the friend an email inviting them to  join the site. IdleHearts stores this email address for the purpose of:  (i) automatically adding the respondent to the “friends list” of the  Member sending the invitation; (ii) sending reminders of the invitation  and (iii) sending emails on recent updates by the Member on IdleHearts  to the Member's invited friend. IdleHearts will never sell these email  addresses or use them to send any other communication besides  invitations and invitation reminders. Any person who receives an  invitation may <a href="http://www.idlehearts.com/contact.php">contact IdleHearts</a> to request the removal of this information from our database.</p>

<h3>Security</h3>
<p>The  IdleHearts account of every Member is password-protected. IdleHearts  takes every precaution to protect the information of the Members, as  well as information collected from other users of the IdleHearts  website. We use industry standard measures to protect all information  that is stored on our servers and within our database. We limit the  access to this information to those employees who need access to  perform their job function such as our customer service personnel. If  you have any questions about the security at our website, please <a href="http://www.idlehearts.com/contact.php">contact us</a>.</p>

<h3>Email Choice/Opt-out</h3>
<p>Members  who no longer wish to receive our weekly email updates or other email  notifications may opt-out of receiving these communications by  following the instructions contained in the applicable email or by  logging-in and changing their settings in the "Account Settings"  section of the IdleHearts website. You can access this page by clicking  on the "Settings" link on the top right of your IdleHearts homepage.</p>

<h3>Third Party Advertising</h3>
<p>The  ads appearing on this Web site are delivered to Members by our Web  advertising partners. Our Web advertising partners may use cookies.  Doing this allows the ad network to recognize your computer each time  they send you an online advertisement. In this way, ad networks may  compile information about where you, or others who are using your  computer, saw their advertisements and determine which ads are clicked  on. This information allows an ad network to deliver targeted  advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you.  IdleHearts does not have access to or control of the cookies that may  be placed on the computer of any Member or other user of the IdleHearts  website by the third-party ad servers or ad networks. This privacy statement covers the use of cookies by IdleHearts only, and does not cover the use of cookies by any other party.</p>

<h3>Contacting IdleHearts</h3>
<p>If you have any questions about this privacy policy, IdleHearts's privacy practices, or your dealings with IdleHearts, please <a href="http://www.idlehearts.com/contact.php">contact us</a>.</p>
