      <p><a name="hsg"></a> <span class="headings">Herbal Safety Guidelines</span></p>
      <p><font color="#000000">Before using an herb you are unfamiliar with, find out
        its medicinal properties. Research it thoroughly and/or consult with an
        appropriately qualified practitioner or expert. If you are taking prescription
        drugs, or have a medical condition check with an appropriately qualified
        practitioner before using herbs medicinally. Herbs have shown overwhelming
        evidence that they work. Just because a small amount works well does NOT mean
        that more is better. As individuals we all have different constitutions,
        sensitivities, allergic reactions and possible health conditions. The following
        are merely guidelines. They include herbs offered on our websites. This list
        does not help with administering information on possible interactions and
        contraindications with prescription medicine. This needs to be discussed with
        your physician.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000000"><strong>Should I check with my doctor or healthcare
        provider before using a supplement?</strong><br>
        This is a good idea, especially for certain population groups. Dietary
        supplements may not be risk-free under certain circumstances. If you are
        pregnant, nursing a baby, or have a chronic medical condition, such as,
        diabetes, hypertension or heart disease, be sure to consult your doctor or
        pharmacist before purchasing or taking any supplement. While vitamin and
        mineral supplements are widely used and generally considered safe, you may
        wish to check with your doctor or pharmacist before taking these or any
        other dietary supplements. If you plan to use a dietary supplement in place
        of drugs or in combination with any drug, tell your health care provider
        first. Many supplements contain active ingredients that have strong
        biological effects and their safety is not always assured in all users. If
        you have certain health conditions and take these products, you may be
        placing yourself at risk.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000000"><strong>Some supplements may interact with
        prescription and over-the-counter medicines.</strong><br>
        Taking a combination of supplements or using these products together with
        medications (whether prescription or OTC drugs) could under certain
        circumstances produce adverse effects. Be alert to advisories about these
        products, whether taken alone or in combination. For example: Coumadin (a
        prescription medicine), ginkgo biloba (an herbal supplement), aspirin (an
        OTC drug) and vitamin E (a vitamin supplement) can each thin the blood, and
        taking any of these products together can increase the potential for
        internal bleeding.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000000"><strong>Some supplements can have unwated effects
        during surgery.</strong><br>
        It is important to fully inform your doctor about the vitamins, minerals,
        herbals or any other supplements you are taking, especially before elective
        surgery. You may be asked to stop taking these products at least 2-3 weeks
        ahead of the procedure to avoid potentially dangerous supplement/drug
        interactions -- such as changes in heart rate, blood pressure and increased
        bleeding - that could adversely affect the outcome of your surgery.</font></p>
