          <p><strong>About this Privacy Policy</strong></p>
          <p>This Privacy Policy describes information that we collect from you as part of   the normal operation of our service and what may happen to the information we   collect. </p>
          <p><strong>Application of this Privacy Policy</strong></p>
          <p>This Privacy Policy applies to  IdentityLookout and all websites (“Site” or “Sites”) owned and controlled by   RateSpecial,LLC. (“RateSpecial”, “we”, or “us”). Please note that this Privacy   Policy applies only to Sites owned and controlled by RateSpecial and not to   websites maintained by other companies to which we may link.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
          <p>By registering with us (i.e. through the submission of the information   requested, including your personally identifiable information) on this Site or   otherwise using or accessing this Site, you agree that the following terms and   conditions of this Privacy Policy shall govern our use and disclosure of your   personal information. If you do not agree with the terms and conditions of our   Privacy Policy, please do not complete any information request forms (i.e., do   not register) hosted on this site or otherwise use or access this Site. &nbsp;</p>
          <p>This Site is not directed at persons under the age of 18. Persons under the   age of 18 must not send any personal information to Ratespecial under any   circumstances, including but not limited to name, address or email address.</p>
          <p><strong>Your Privacy is Important to Us</strong></p>
          <p>Our Privacy Policy explains what information we obtain on the Site and how we   use the information you disclose to us, including how we may provide your   information to our Third Party Providers who have expressed a willingness to   provide you with the products and services associated with this Site, as well as   other products and/or services that we and they believe may be of interest to   you. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
          <p>By entering your contact information, you are authorizing us, or a Third   Party Provider, to contact you with exciting new offers and information, via   email and automated telephone messages, even if you are listed on a Do Not Call   Registry. Users may opt out of the Companies disclosure to such third parties by   following the instructions in the opt-out section of this privacy policy. We may   also disclose nonpublic personal information about you as permitted by law.   &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
          <p><strong>Who We Are</strong></p>
          <p>We are an online consumer service that introduces persons such as yourself to   certain of our Third Party Providers who have expressed a general willingness to   review your information and determine if they are willing to provide you with   the services or products that prompted you to visit our Site, as well as other   products and/or services that we and they believe may be of interest to you.</p>
          <p><strong>Information We Collect</strong></p>
          <p>The information that we collect includes personal information about you that   we or certain of our Third Party Providers consider necessary for performing a   preliminary evaluation of your qualifications to receive applicable products   and/or services. To the extent that you can order products or subscribe to a   service(s), the type of personally identifiable information that may be   collected may include: name; address; e-mail address; telephone number; fax   number; credit card information; information about your interests in and use of   various products, programs, and services; education level; educational   interests; home owner status; income; debt level; current mortgage; mortgage   rate and the like. To the extent that you are requested and you do submit   information about other people, such information will be limited recipient's   name, address, e - mail address, and telephone number. </p>
          <p><strong><u>Cookies</u></strong></p>
          <p>In addition to the personal information you provide to us, we collect certain   information online and offline arising out of your use of our Site, including   but not limited to the number and type of offers you have responded to and   completed. When you visit our Site, we automatically tracks certain non   personally identifiable information with respect to your behavior on the Site   through the cookie we place in your browser. This non personally identifiable   information may include the Internet address or URL that you just came from and   the URL to which you go next; your computer browser information; and your IP   address. We use this non personally identifiable information in conjunction with   some of the information that you provided to conduct internal research on users'   demographics and behavior and to better understand how to serve users of the   Site. The aforementioned information cannot, by itself, be used to gather any   personally identifiable information about you, but it will allow us to track the   overall effectiveness of our online advertising campaigns. Third parties may   also set cookies on or through the service to track Site usage and to track the   overall effectiveness of our online advertising campaigns.</p>
          <p>We use both session cookies, which terminate when a user closes his/her   browser, and persistent cookies, which remain on the user's computer until   manually deleted. You may decline our cookies if your Web browser software   permits, although this may prevent you from accessing certain features of the   Service. </p>
          <p><strong><u>Log Files</u></strong></p>
          <p>We track certain non personally identifiable information through server log   files. This includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet   service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp and   number of clicks to analyze trends and administer the Site, track user's   movement in the aggregate and gather broad demographic information for aggregate   use. We use your IP address at times to help identify you as you browse and to   gather broad technical and demographic information on who uses the Site. We do   not tie server log files to personally identifiable information.</p>
          <p><strong><u>Web Beacons</u></strong></p>
          <p>We may employ and certain Third Party Providers may employ a software   technology called clear gifs (also known as Web Beacons or Web Bugs). Clear gifs   help us better manage content through the service by informing us what content   and which campaigns are effective. Clear gifs are tiny graphics, about the size   of a period at the end of a sentence, with a unique identifier. Clear gifs are   similar in function to cookies and are used to track the online movements of Web   users. In addition, we and certain Third Party Providers may use clear gifs in   HTML-based emails. This allows us and the Third Party Provider to gauge the   effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of marketing   campaigns by showing how many emails the recipients have opened. We do not tie   clear gifs to personally identifiable information.</p>
          <p><strong>How We Use Your Information</strong></p>
          <p>We may perform a preliminary validation of any information that you submit to   Ratespecial and an evaluation of your qualifications for our Third Party   Providers’ products and services. For example, we may compare and review your   personal information for errors, omissions, and accuracy based upon past usage   and response; or compare your information against other publicly available   files; or validate some of the personal information to verify that the   information you submitted has a high probability of being valid information. </p>
          <p>Based upon your affirmative consent, as evidenced by your clicking on the   applicable acknowledgement box and/or your registration on a Site (i.e., your   submission of the requested information, including your personally identifiable   information), we may use the information you provide to attempt to match you   with providers of products and services (for example, using your zip code to   check for service providers whose service area covers your location) and/or we   may forward the information that you provided directly to certain of our Third   Party Providers. <strong>We may sell or transfer individual information to other   Third Parties for any legally permissible purpose, please see Sharing Your   Information.</strong></p>
          <p>We reserve the right to collect information about you and store it in   connection with other online or offline information we may possess or obtain   about you to create a general user profile. This profile may be created by   combining your information with other sources of information such as information   obtained from public databases, or from your browsing habits surrounding your   visit to this Site. </p>
          <p>From time to time, we may contact you via e-mail advertising, telephone   marketing, direct mail marketing, online banner advertising or other means to   inform you of additional opportunities to receive special offers for other   services and/or products that we believe may be of interest to you. By providing   your contact information when using the Service, you are entering into a   business relationship with Ratespecial and are further requesting, and expressly   consenting to, being contacted by Ratespecial and our Third Party Providers via   telephone, fax, email, surface mail or any other means, at any of your contact   numbers or addresses, even if you are listed on any federal, state or other   applicable "Do Not Call" list, in order that Ratespecial may provide the   services set forth on the Site or for other purposes reasonably related to your   service request and the business of Ratespecial, including marketing-related   emails. You are under no obligation to accept any service or product offered   through these communications. </p>
          <p>From time to time, we may send you certain transactional messages relating to   the Service, such as service announcements, administrative messages, etc.</p>
          <p>To the extent that we collect your credit card information, we will use the   information for verification purposes and/or for transmitting the information to   the specific Third Party Providers authorized by you for the purpose of   completing your requested transaction. Your credit card information will be   encrypted during transmission. In addition, by submitting your credit card   information to us, you authorize us to verify that your credit card account is   valid by charging, and thereafter immediately crediting, a small sum to the   card. Such verification may be conducted through a third-party and, in that   case, we would share your specific credit card information with this third-party   for verification purposes. Notwithstanding the foregoing, we reserve the right   to share with third-parties the fact that we have credit card information on   file for specific users. </p>
          <p>Certain sensitive information such as credit card numbers or other   information such as social security numbers and drivers licenses (“Financial   Information”) collected on the Site and the associated data are encrypted and   protected with SSL encryption software from the time it is captured by our   application to the time it is transmitted to our servers. For more information   on the encryption and protection of your information, please see How We Protect   Your Privacy.</p>
          <p>In the event we offer product and/or services where your credit card   information is required to process your requested transaction, we may store your   credit card information to facilitate your authorized transactions. </p>

          <p><strong>WE MAY USE INFORMATION THAT WE HAVE COLLECTED FOR ANY LEGALLY   PERMISSIBLE PURPOSE, INCLUDING SELLING OR TRANSFERRING SUCH INFORMATION AT ANY   TIME TO THIRD PARTIES FOR ANY LEGALLY PERMISSIBLE PURPOSE. </strong>For example,   we may share or sell your personal information with Third Party Providers so   that they can contact you and offer you products and/or services that may be of   interest to you.

          <p><strong>How We Protect Your Privacy</strong></p>
          <p>We protect your privacy in a number of ways. As an initial matter, any   Financial Information transmitted to our servers via a secure server is   encrypted using SSL technology. SSL is a protocol that transmits your   communications over the Internet in an encrypted form. The protocol ensures that   the information is sent, unchanged, only to the server you intended to send it   to.</p>
          <p>Once your Financial Information reaches our server, it is protected by a   firewall. In addition to encryption and firewall protections, our Third Party   Providers are required to operate in accordance with federal and state laws and   regulations, including regulations relating to CAN-SPAM and rules promulgated by   the FTC. If we learn that any of our Third Party Providers is breaching our   agreement, we will take corrective actions including, if necessary, terminating   our relationship with such Third Party Partner.</p>
          <p>We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal   information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it.   However, no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic   storage, is 100% secure. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially   acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its   absolute security or that all of your private communications and other personal   information will never be disclosed in ways not otherwise described in this   Privacy Policy. For example, third parties may unlawfully intercept personal   data or access our servers and obtain personal data. Therefore, although we use   industry standard practices to protect your privacy, we do not promise, nor   should you expect that your personal information would always remain   private.</p>
          <p>If you have any questions about security on our Web site, you can mail us at   the address indicated below in the Contact Us section.</p>
