    <h1>Intersections  Inc. Consumer Privacy Policy</h1>
    <h6>Protecting your identity and  personal information about you is at the core of our mission.</h6>
    <p>In fact‚ we have implemented a comprehensive information privacy and security  program — and we want you to be fully informed about this program‚ so please  take a moment to review the details below. </p>
    <h6>WHO WE ARE</h6>
    <p>Intersections is a leading provider of identity protection  services and financial information and education services for consumers. We are  also a provider of identity theft management and mitigation services to major financial institutions and other entities for their customers. <a href="http://www.intersections.com/" target="_blank" title="Learn more about Intersections">Learn more about us.</a></p>
    <h6>WHO DOES OUR PRIVACY POLICY APPLY TO?</h6>
    <p>Our privacy policy applies to both our online and offline consumer customers. This  policy also applies to both our existing and former consumer customers. In  addition‚ this policy applies to each consumer who visits one of our websites  or otherwise provides us with personal information‚ even if the consumer does  not buy our products or services.&nbsp;</p>
    <h6>WHAT  PERSONAL INFORMATION ABOUT YOU DO WE COLLECT?</h6>
    <p>The  types of personal information which we collect about you depend upon the  service or product which you purchase. We collect and retain information about  your transactions with us. In order to provide our services and products to  you‚ we may obtain from you‚ for example‚ your full name; your mailing address;  your email address; your phone numbers; your Social Security number; your  credit card information; or other account or payment information‚ as needed.  With your express authorization‚ we may also obtain your credit report from one  or more of the national credit bureaus. In addition‚ we may obtain information  about you from other third parties in connection with providing you with the  products or services that you request. For example‚ we may obtain information  about you from sources such as public record vendors‚ technology providers‚ the  Internet and other sources.</p>
    <h6>DO  WE COLLECT INFORMATION ABOUT YOUR VISIT TO OUR WEBSITES‚ INCLUDING USING  COOKIES AND OTHER TECHNOLOGIES?</h6>
    <p>Even  if you do not purchase one of our products or services‚ we retain‚ on a  long-term storage basis‚ personally identifiable information about you if you  volunteer information to us online‚ or you sign in online to one of our member  areas. Doing so permits us to understand and accommodate your online  preferences and manage your relationship with us.</p>
    <p>We  also use various technologies to collect and retain information about visits to  our websites. Cookies‚ for example‚ are small bits of computer code that we or  third parties with whom we have a relationship may install on your computer  when it accesses our websites. Cookies make your visit to our websites easier  and more convenient. We may use cookies for purposes such as to authenticate  users‚ provide tailored content‚ to facilitate the display of advertisements‚  or to determine whether a visitor is unique or whether the visitor has viewed  our site before. While most browsers are set to accept cookies by default‚ Web  browsers typically also have features that permit you to refuse cookies or to  alert you before accepting them. Your browser manufacturer has information on  changing the default setting for your specific browser. Please understand that  if you refuse to accept cookies from our websites‚ you may not be able to use  some portions of our websites.</p>
    <p>Our  websites also may use various technologies to collect non-personally  identifiable information when someone visits our websites. For example‚ as you  browse one of our websites we may collect information about your visit‚ but not  about you personally. Via Web server logs‚ for example‚ we may monitor  statistics such as: the number of people that visit our site‚ which page(s) are  visited on our site‚ from which domain our visitors come (e.g.‚ aol.com‚  hotmail.com‚ etc.)‚ and the type of Internet browsers people use to visit our  site (e.g.‚ Microsoft Internet Explorer‚ Safari (for Apple Computers)‚ Mozilla  Firefox‚ etc.). We also may use outsourcing programs to assist us in analyzing  this data to better tailor our websites.</p>
    <p>We  may use third-party advertising companies and advertising networks to serve ads  and collect information when you visit our website. These companies may use  information (not including your name‚ phone number or email address) about your  visits to this and other websites in order to provide advertisements on this  and other websites about goods and services that may be of interest to you. If  you would like more information about network advertising‚ and to know your  choices about not having this information used by these companies‚ please  visit: <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp" target="_blank">www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp</a>.</p>
    <p>Finally‚  Intersections’ websites may include links to websites operated by third parties.  We do not control the information‚ through cookies or otherwise‚ that those  third parties may obtain from you if you follow links to visit their websites‚  nor do we control their use and sharing of that information.</p>
    <h6>IF  YOU PURCHASE Mobile LockBox<sup>®</sup> WHAT INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT?</h6>
    <p>If  you purchase our Mobile LockBox<sup>®</sup> service‚ certain parts of that Mobile LockBox  are powered by our third-party service provider. Your Mobile LockBox may  contain data‚ which you select and provide‚ and which are embedded in documents‚  photos‚ account logins and other information that our service provider has  aggregated about your accounts and financial relationships‚ as authorized by  you.</p>
    <h6>DO  WE COLLECT INFORMATION FROM OR ABOUT CHILDREN?</h6>
    <p>None  of our products and services or websites are designed for use by minors under  the age of 18. If you are under 18 years old‚ please do not submit any personal  information to us.</p>
    <p>Parents  and guardians of minors are eligible to purchase our minor monitoring service.  You must provide us with proof‚ satisfactory to us‚ that you are‚ in fact‚ the  parent or legal guardian of the child in order to obtain information about a  child through this service. Except to provide the minor monitoring service to  enrolled customers‚ we do not intentionally obtain or retain information about  minors.</p>
    <p>If  you are participating in the minor monitoring service (kID Sure<sup>SM</sup>)‚ we do not  share information about your child for any purposes‚ including marketing‚  except as expressly authorized by you or as set forth below:</p>
    <ul class="base">
      <li>We may share information about your child with our service providers to fulfill the minor monitoring service. Our service providers are required to comply with Intersections’ privacy policy.</li>
      <li>We may share information about your child to protect against fraud or as otherwise permitted or required by law‚ including to protect our legal interests.</li>
    </ul>
    <h6>HOW  DO WE USE THE INFORMATION WHICH WE COLLECT ABOUT YOU?</h6>
    <p>We  use personal information about you to verify your identity and to protect  against fraud. We also use this information for our everyday business purposes‚  such as quality assurance and testing; to process your transactions; maintain  your account; respond to court orders and legal investigations; or interact  with our service providers. Further‚ we use your information to market our  products and services to you and for joint marketing with other companies. We  do not use your credit report information except as required or permitted by  law.</p>
    <h6>WHAT  INFORMATION ABOUT YOU DO WE SHARE?</h6>
    <p>We  do not share personally identifiable information about you with nonaffiliated  third parties‚ except as follows:</p>
    <ul class="base">
      <li>With our service providers that help us to provide our products and services to you</li>
      <li>In accordance with your express instructions or authorization</li>
      <li>For fraud prevention or as otherwise permitted or required by law </li>
    </ul>
    <p>We  may disclose certain of your information to financial institutions with which  we have a joint marketing agreement solely for use in connection with our  jointly offered products and services. A joint marketing agreement between  Intersections and a nonaffiliated company is an agreement under which  Intersections and our nonaffiliated marketing partner agree to market various  products or services to you.</p>
    <p>We  may share personal information with companies affiliated with Intersections in  cases where our affiliated company is providing services to Intersections. We  do not‚ however‚ share personal information about you with our affiliated  companies for their marketing purposes.</p>
    <h6>WHAT  INFORMATION DO WE SHARE WITH ITAC?</h6>
    <p>If  appropriate‚ we may offer you the opportunity to use the victim assistance  services provided by ITAC‚ the Identity Theft Assistance Center‚ a nonprofit  organization. If you accept‚ we may disclose personal information about you to  ITAC. That information‚ however‚ will not include credit report information.<br>
      Pursuant  to Intersections’ agreement with ITAC‚ ITAC may share information about you  with companies that are members of ITAC (see the list of ITAC members at <a href="http://www.identitytheftassistance.org" target="_blank">www.identitytheftassistance.org</a>)  and with other companies where fraud may have occurred. Our agreement governs  how ITAC maintains‚ uses and shares information that we provide them about you.  ITAC will store personal information about you in a database that ITAC members  may use to detect and prevent fraud. ITAC may use information about you in the  database for analysis‚ fraud prevention and detection‚ law enforcement purposes  or as otherwise permitted by law. ITAC may also share personal information  about you with the Federal Trade Commission and with law enforcement agencies.  ITAC will not sell personal information about you or use this information or  share this information with any third parties for marketing.</p>
    <h6>CAN  YOU OPT-OUT OF OUR SHARING OF PERSONAL ABOUT YOU?</h6>
    <p>Financial  companies‚ including Intersections‚ choose how they share your personal  information. Federal law gives you the right to limit some‚ but not all‚  sharing. We have already indicated the circumstances under which we share your  personal information. However‚ it is important for you to know that you may  elect for us not to have us contact you for marketing purposes. You may call us  or‚ if we send you an email primarily for a marketing purpose‚ you may follow  the instructions in the email to opt out of receiving further marketing  communications.</p>
    <h6>HOW  DO WE PROTECT PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION ABOUT YOU?</h6>
    <p>To  protect personal information about you from unauthorized access or use‚ we  permit access only to Intersections employees and our service provider  employees who have a need to know. In addition‚ we have implemented‚ and we  maintain‚ technical‚ administrative and physical security safeguards.</p>
    <h6>HOW  DO WE CHANGE OUR PRIVACY POLICY?</h6>
    <p>We  will not change our privacy policy unless those changes are first posted on our  websites. If the change permits or requires any expanded sharing of personal  information about you‚ we will send you a specific notice‚ either manually or  online.</p>
    <p>If  Intersections is acquired by another company or business‚ or merges with  another company or business‚ or enters into any similar business transaction‚  personal information about you may be transferred as a part of that  transaction. We will post a notice of that transaction on our websites and/or  send you a privacy notice‚ if required by law.</p>
    <h6>QUESTIONS  AND COMMENTS?</h6>
    <p>If  you have questions or comments about our privacy policy‚ please contact us at  the customer service number posted on our websites or provided in your  materials.</p>
