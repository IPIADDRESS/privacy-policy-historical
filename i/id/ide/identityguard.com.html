To help us accomplish this‚ we have implemented a comprehensive information privacy and security program.

</p>
<h2 style="padding-left: 0;">WHO DOES OUR PRIVACY POLICY APPLY TO?</h2>
<p>
  Our privacy policy applies to both our online and offline consumer customers.  This policy also applies to both our existing and former consumer customers.  In addition‚ this policy applies to each consumer who visits one of our websites or otherwise provides us with personal information‚ even if the consumer does not buy our products or services.
</p>
<h2 style="padding-left: 0;">WHAT PERSONAL INFORMATION ABOUT YOU DO WE COLLECT?</h2>

In order to provide our services and products to you‚ we may obtain from you‚ for example‚ your full name; your mailing address; your email address; your phone numbers; your Social Security number; your credit card information; or other account or payment information‚ as needed.  With your express authorization‚ we may also obtain your credit report from one or more of the national credit bureaus.

For example‚ we may obtain information about you from sources such as public record vendors‚ technology providers‚ the Internet and other sources.
</p>
<h2 style="padding-left: 0;">DO WE COLLECT INFORMATION ABOUT YOUR VISIT TO OUR WEBSITES‚ INCLUDING USING COOKIES AND OTHER TECHNOLOGIES? </h2>

  Even if you do not purchase one of our products or services‚ we retain‚ on a long-term storage basis‚ personally identifiable information about you if you volunteer information to us online‚ or you sign in online to one of our member areas.  Doing so permits us to understand and accommodate your online preferences and manage your relationship with us.
