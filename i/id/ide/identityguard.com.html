<h1>INTERSECTIONS INC. CONSUMER PRIVACY POLICY</h1>
<p>At Intersections Inc., protecting your identity and protecting personal information about you is at the very core of our mission.  To help us accomplish this, we have implemented a comprehensive information privacy and security program.  We want you to be fully informed about this program, and we hope that you will take a moment to review our privacy policy.</p>
<h2>WHO WE ARE</h2>
<p>Intersections is a leading provider of identity protection services and financial information and education services for consumers.  We are also a provider to major financial institutions and other entities of identity theft management and mitigation services for their consumer customers. <a target="_blank" href="http://www.intersections.com">  Learn more about us.  </a></p>
<h2>WHO DOES OUR PRIVACY POLICY APPLY TO?</h2>
<p>Our privacy policy applies to both our online and offline consumer customers.  This policy also applies to both our existing and former consumer customers.  In addition, this policy applies to each consumer who visits one of our websites or otherwise provides us with personal information, even if the consumer does not buy our products or services.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>WHAT PERSONAL INFORMATION ABOUT YOU DO WE COLLECT?</h2>
<p>The types of personal information which we collect about you depend upon the service or product which you purchase.  We collect and retain information about your transactions with us.  In order to provide our services and products to you, we may obtain from you, for example, your full name; your mailing address; your email address; your phone numbers; your Social Security number; your credit card information; or other account or payment information, as needed.  With your express authorization, we may also obtain your credit report from one or more of the national credit bureaus.  In addition, we may obtain information about you from other third parties in connection with providing you with the products or services that you request.  For example, we may obtain information about you from sources such as public record vendors, technology providers, the Internet and other sources.</p>
<h2>DO WE COLLECT INFORMATION ABOUT YOUR VISIT TO OUR WEBSITES, INCLUDING USING COOKIES AND OTHER TECHNOLOGIES?</h2>
<p>Even if you do not purchase one of our products or services, we retain, on a long-term storage basis, personally identifiable information about you if you volunteer information to us online, or you sign in online to one of our member areas.  Doing so permits us to understand and accommodate your online preferences and manage your relationship with us.</p>
<p>We also use various technologies to collect and retain information about visits to our websites.  Cookies, for example, are small bits of computer code that we or third parties with whom we have a relationship may install on your computer when it accesses our websites.  Cookies make your visit to our websites easier and more convenient.  We may use cookies for purposes such as to authenticate users, provide tailored content, to facilitate the display of advertisements, or to determine whether a visitor is unique or whether the visitor has viewed our site before.  While most browsers are set to accept cookies by default, Web browsers typically also have features that permit you to refuse cookies or to alert you before accepting them. Your browser manufacturer has information on changing the default setting for your specific browser.  Please understand that if you refuse to accept cookies from our websites, you may not be able to use some portions of our websites.</p>
<p>Our websites also may use various technologies to collect non-personally identifiable information when someone visits our websites. For example, as you browse one of our websites we may collect information about your visit, but not about you personally. Via Web server logs, for example, we may monitor statistics such as: the number of people that visit our site, which page(s) are visited on our site, from which domain our visitors come (e.g., aol.com, hotmail.com, etc.), and the type of Internet browsers people use to visit our site (e.g., Microsoft Internet Explorer, Safari (for Apple Computers), Mozilla Firefox, etc.). We also may use outsourcing programs to assist us in analyzing this data to better tailor our websites.</p>
<p>We may use third-party advertising companies and advertising networks to serve ads and collect information when you visit our website. These companies may use information (not including your name, phone number or email address) about your visits to this and other websites in order to provide advertisements on this and other websites about goods and services that may be of interest to you. If you would like more information about network advertising, and to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies, please visit: <a target="_blank" href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp">http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp</a>.</p>
<p>Finally, Intersections’ websites may include links to websites operated by third parties.  We do not control the information, through cookies or otherwise, that those third parties may obtain from you if you follow links to visit their websites, nor do we control their use and sharing of that information.</p>
<h2>IF YOU PURCHASE MOBILELOCKBOX<sup>®</sup> WHAT INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT?</h2>
<p>If you purchase our MOBILE LOCKBOX<sup>®</sup> service, certain parts of that MOBILE LOCKBOX are powered by our third-party service provider.  Your MOBILE LOCKBOX may contain data, which you select and provide, and which are embedded in documents, photos, account logins and other information that our service provider has aggregated about your accounts and financial relationships, as authorized by you.</p>
<h2>DO WE COLLECT INFORMATION FROM OR ABOUT CHILDREN?</h2>
<p>None of our products and services or websites are designed for use by minors under the age of 18.  If you are under 18 years old, please do not submit any personal information to us.</p>
<p>Parents and guardians of minors are eligible to purchase our minor monitoring service. You must provide us with proof, satisfactory to us, that you are, in fact, the parent or legal guardian of the child in order to obtain information about a child through this service.  Except to provide the minor monitoring service to enrolled customers, we do not intentionally obtain or retain information about minors.</p>
<p>If you are  participating in the minor monitoring service, we do not share information about your child for any purposes, including marketing, except as expressly authorized by you or as set forth below:</p>
<ul>
    <li>We may share information about your child with our service providers to fulfill the minor monitoring service.  Our service providers are required to comply with Intersections’ privacy policy.</li>
    <li>We may share information about your child to protect against fraud or as otherwise permitted or required by law, including to protect our legal interests.</li>
</ul>
<h2>HOW DO WE USE THE INFORMATION WHICH WE COLLECT ABOUT YOU?</h2>
<p>We use personal information about you to verify your identity and to protect against fraud.  We also use this information for our everyday business purposes, such as quality assurance and testing; to process your transactions; maintain your account; respond to court orders and legal investigations; or interact with our service providers.  Further, we use your information to market our products and services to you and for joint marketing with other companies.  We do not use your credit report information except as required or permitted by law.</p>
<h2>WHAT INFORMATION ABOUT YOU DO WE SHARE?</h2>
<p>We do not share personally identifiable information about you with nonaffiliated third parties, except as follows.</p>
<ul>
    <li>With our service providers that help us to provide our products and services to you</li>
    <li>In accordance with your express instructions or authorization</li>
    <li>For fraud prevention or as otherwise permitted or required by law</li>
</ul>
<p>We may disclose certain of your information to financial institutions with which we have a joint marketing agreement solely for use in connection with our jointly offered products and services.  A joint marketing agreement between Intersections and a nonaffiliated company is an agreement under which Intersections and our nonaffiliated marketing partner agree to market various products or services to you.</p>
<p>We may share personal information with companies affiliated with Intersections in cases where our affiliated company is providing services to Intersections.  We do not, however, share personal information about you with our affiliated companies for their marketing purposes.</p>
<h2>WHAT INFORMATION DO WE SHARE WITH ITAC?</h2>
<p>If appropriate, we may offer you the opportunity to use the victim assistance services provided by ITAC, the Identity Theft Assistance Center, a nonprofit organization.  If you accept, we may disclose personal information about you to ITAC.   That information, however, will not include credit report information.</p>
<p>Pursuant to Intersections’ agreement with ITAC, ITAC may share information about you with companies that are members of ITAC (see the list of ITAC members at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.identitytheftassistance.org">www.identitytheftassistance.org</a>) and with other companies where fraud may have occurred.  Our agreement governs how ITAC maintains, uses and shares information that we provide them about you.  ITAC will store personal information about you in a database that ITAC members may use to detect and prevent fraud.  ITAC may use information about you in the database for analysis, fraud prevention and detection, law enforcement purposes or as otherwise permitted by law.  ITAC may also share personal information about you with the Federal Trade Commission and with law enforcement agencies.  ITAC will not sell personal information about you or use this information or share this information with any third parties for marketing.</p>
<h2>CAN YOU OPT-OUT OF OUR SHARING OF PERSONAL ABOUT YOU?</h2>
<p>Financial companies, including Intersections, choose how they share your personal information.  Federal law gives you the right to limit some, but not all, sharing.  We have already indicated the circumstances under which we share your personal information.  However, it is important for you to know that you may elect for us not to have us contact you for marketing purposes. You may call us or, if we send you an email primarily for a marketing purpose, you may follow the instructions in the email to opt out of receiving further marketing communications.</p>
<h2>HOW DO WE PROTECT PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION ABOUT YOU?</h2>
<p>To protect personal information about you from unauthorized access or use, we permit access only to Intersections employees and our service provider employees who have a need to know.  In addition, we have implemented, and we maintain, technical, administrative and physical security safeguards.</p>
<h2>HOW DO WE CHANGE OUR PRIVACY POLICY?</h2>
<p>We will not change our privacy policy unless those changes are first posted on our websites.  If the change permits or requires any expanded sharing of personal information about you, we will send you a specific notice, either manually or online.</p>
<p>If Intersections is acquired by another company or business, or merges with another company or business, or enters into any similar business transaction, personal information about you may be transferred as a part of that transaction.  We will post a notice of that transaction on our websites and/or send you a privacy notice, if required by law.</p>
<h2>QUESTIONS AND COMMENTS?</h2>
<p>If you have questions or comments about our privacy policy, please contact us at the customer service number posted on our websites or provided in your materials.</p>
