<p>Cookies are tiny  text files that are stored on your computer, tablet or mobile phone when you  visit a website. <br>
  We may use cookies  and other interactive techniques to collect personal and non-personal  information about you. The cookies mean that our website platforms may remember  you to personalize the content and how you've used the site every time you come  back; understand what you like and use about our website; understand what you  do not like and do not use on our website; provide a more enjoyable, customized  service and experience, and help us develop and deliver better products and  services tailored to our customers’ interests and needs.<br>
  We may sometimes use  a persistent cookie to record details such as a unique user identity and  general registration details on your PC. This helps us recognize you on  subsequent visits to this website so that you don't have to re-enter your  registration details each time you visit us and allows us to carry out the  activities mentioned above.<br>
  During the usage  of our mobile apps platforms, we may collect and use Device Identifiers (unique  random number) called Advertising/Device ID typically assigned by the mobile  operating system software. Device Identifiers are typically used  to track your device uniquely by the mobile advertisement networks for sending  you marketing communications or advertisements. <br>

  Most of the mobile  operating systems allow users to reset the Advertising/Device ID by visiting  the Ads setting on their mobile devices to ‘limit tracking’ for the purpose of  opting out of behaviorally targeted advertisements.</p>

In addition, LBS can also help in law  enforcement and emergency services.<br>
