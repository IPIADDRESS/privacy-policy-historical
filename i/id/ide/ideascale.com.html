<article dir="ltr"><p class="intercom-align-left"><b>1. GENERAL INFORMATION</b>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="intercom-align-left">This privacy policy applies to the collection, use, and disclosure of information collected through <a href="http://www.ideascale.com/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">www.ideascale.com</a>, the IdeaScale services, and related products and services owned and operated by IdeaScale and its subsidiaries (the "Services"). The use of information collected through the Services shall be limited to the purpose of providing the Services for which IdeaScale customers have engaged IdeaScale. As used in this policy, the term "IdeaScale" collectively refers to IdeaScale, a California corporation, and its subsidiaries.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="intercom-align-left">IdeaScale strives to conform its privacy practices, policies and/or procedures with any and all applicable international, country specific, U.S. Federal, state and/or local laws, codes, regulations, and requirements and the industry codes, standards and regulations of various market and opinion research professional associations and/or organizations, including without limitation the ICC/ESOMAR International Code on Market and Social Research and the Code of Standards and Ethics for Survey Research of the Council of American Survey Research Organizations (CASRO). IdeaScale is committed to protecting the security and integrity of all personally identifiable information collected by or disclosed to IdeaScale. This privacy policy identifies the personally identifiable information that IdeaScale collects and how such information will be used and protected. For details regarding additional policies and procedures applied to personal information from European Union member countries and Switzerland, please see Section 16 below.</p>
<p class="intercom-align-left"><b>2. INFORMATION COLLECTION AND USE</b>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="intercom-align-left">IdeaScale provides its web-based Services to support innovation, facilitate dialogue, and to collect ideas and feedback for use by IdeaScale customers. The information you share with IdeaScale, as either an IdeaScale customer or an end user of an IdeaScale customer, is shared, via the internet, with a limited set of IdeaScale end users or the public at large, depending on the community for which you are registered and the preference of the customer that runs that community.</p>
<p class="intercom-align-left"><b>Registration Information</b> <br>In order to use the Services, you must first complete a registration form and create a username and password. During registration, you are required to give your name and email address. IdeaScale uses this information to contact you about the Services and to provide service-related notices as described in Section 3 below. These communications are used to give you a better understanding of the Services and to support your use of the Services. As always, you have the option not to receive these communications (see Section 5 below). Additionally, an IdeaScale customer may upload email addresses to the Services for the purpose of inviting the address owners to customer's IdeaScale community. IdeaScale will never share any email address, regardless of how it was collected, with any third party without the email address owner's explicit consent.</p>
<p class="intercom-align-left"><b>Billing Information</b> <br>If you purchase a service from IdeaScale, you must provide your contact information (such as name and billing address) and financial information (such as credit card number and expiration date). IdeaScale encrypts all credit card information. IdeaScale will use this information to contact you if there are any issues while processing the order. IdeaScale will also use this information to send you service-related communications as described in Section 3 below. These communications include email confirmations of billing transactions, account upgrades, and account cancellations.</p>
<p class="intercom-align-left"><b>Profile Information</b> <br>IdeaScale stores information that it collects through user input, cookies, log files, and user forms to create a user profile. Depending on your specific use of the Services, a profile may include the following: Registration Information - depending on how IdeaScale customers decide to use the Services, this may include, for example, any of the following: username, password, first name, last name, email address, zip codes, and phone number; and &nbsp;Preferences - profile selections, such as language preference, that determine the specific way you want IdeaScale Services delivered to you. Details from your profile may be used to contact you to provide tailored promotions and marketing offers about IdeaScale Services and to make service improvements (see Section 3 below). You may update your profile information at any time by clicking on your "Profile" link while logged into your account.</p>
<p class="intercom-align-left"><b>Interaction Information</b> &nbsp;<br>IdeaScale collects information about you and your use of the Services through tracking technologies such as cookies. See Sections 6 and 7 for full details.</p>
<p class="intercom-align-left"><b>Information Collected on behalf of IdeaScale Customers </b>&nbsp; <br>IdeaScale collects information under the direction of its customers and has no direct relationship with the individuals whose personal data it processes on behalf of its customers. IdeaScale may transfer personal information to companies that help it provide the Services. Transfers to subsequent third parties are covered by the service agreements between IdeaScale and its customers. IdeaScale retains personal data it processes on behalf of its customers for as long as needed to provide the Services to its customers. IdeaScale retains this personal information as necessary to comply with its legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce its agreements.</p>
<p class="intercom-align-left"><b>3. COMMUNICATIONS FROM IDEASCALE </b>&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p class="intercom-align-left"><b>Ongoing Communication and Service Updates</b> <br>IdeaScale occasionally sends its users information on service updates and enhancements, new offerings, and additional instructions on how best to use of the Services. These communications are designed to educate you about the Services. IdeaScale provides you the option not to receive these types of communications; please see Section 5 below for details.</p>
<p class="intercom-align-left"><b>Service-related Announcements</b> &nbsp; <br>IdeaScale sends service-related announcements when it is necessary to do so. For instance, if a service is temporarily suspended for maintenance, IdeaScale may inform you about the suspension with an email. Service-related emails are also sent to confirm billing transactions, account upgrades, and account cancellations. Generally, you may not opt-out of these communications, since they are necessary to provide the Services. If you do not want to receive service-related announcements, you have the option to cancel your account. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p class="intercom-align-left"><b>Customer Service</b> &nbsp; <br>At the commencement of your use of the Services, IdeaScale will send you an email to verify your username and password. Throughout your use of the Services, IdeaScale account management and/or support may use your contact information to answer your questions, to respond to service requests, and to provide account management services.</p>
<p class="intercom-align-left"><b>4. INFORMATION SHARING AND DISCLOSURE </b>&nbsp; &nbsp;<br><br>IdeaScale shares personally identifiable information with third parties only as follows:<br><br><b>To Provide Services from Third-Party Service Providers.</b> <br>IdeaScale uses third-party tools to aid its delivery of its Services to you. Such service providers are contractually bound to keep your information confidential and to use your information only as necessary to provide their services. Examples of such providers include administrative tool providers, data centers and chat support hosts.</p>
<p class="intercom-align-left"><b>To Process Credit Card Payments. </b><br>IdeaScale uses outside credit card processing companies to process your credit card payments. These companies do not retain, share, store or use personally identifiable information for any other purposes.</p>
<p class="intercom-align-left"><b>To Provide Requested Partner Services.</b> <br>If you specifically request a service from one of IdeaScale’s partnering companies, your personally identifiable information will be shared with the applicable partnering company. After such a request is made, the partnering company may contact you directly regarding your inquiry. Any service offered by a partnering company will be clearly indicated as a partner's service and not IdeaScale's, and any request must be initiated solely by the user.</p>
<p class="intercom-align-left"><b>To Provide Requested Materials.</b> <br>If you voluntarily submit your personally identifiable information when requesting informational materials from IdeaScale, this information will be shared with a third-party marketing automations tool, which IdeaScale uses to automate and target its messages to you.</p>
<p class="intercom-align-left"><b>To Comply with Law.</b> <br>IdeaScale reserves the right to disclose your personally identifiable information as required by law and when it believes that disclosure is necessary to protect its rights and/or to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process. This includes required disclosures by IdeaScale of a European Union individual's personal information in response to a lawful request by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.</p>
<p class="intercom-align-left"><b>To Continue Providing Services in the Event of a Merger or Acquisition.</b> <br>If IdeaScale is involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, you will be notified via email or a prominent notice within the Services of any change in ownership or uses of your personally identifiable information, as well as any choices you may have regarding your personally identifiable information.</p>
<p class="intercom-align-left"><b>To Advertise IdeaScale Services to Visitors of IdeaScale’s Marketing Pages.</b> <br>IdeaScale uses ad targeting cookies, only within its marketing pages, that collect IP addresses to advertise IdeaScale services to such visitors elsewhere on the Internet. See Section 7 to learn how to manage these cookies.</p>
<p class="intercom-align-left"><b>5. OPT-OUT</b> &nbsp; <br><br>If you no longer wish to receive communications about service updates, new offerings, or how best to use the Services, you may opt-out of receiving them by following the instructions that are included in each email. As noted in Section 3 above, if you do not want to receive service-related announcements (announcements that are necessary to provide the Services), your only option is to cancel your account.</p>
<p class="intercom-align-left"><b>6. TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES</b> &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p class="intercom-align-left">As is true of most web sites, IdeaScale gathers certain information automatically and stores it in log files. This information may include Internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, Internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and/or clickstream data. IdeaScale does not link this automatically collected data to other information collected about you. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p class="intercom-align-left">Technologies such as cookies, beacons, tags and scripts and similar tracking technologies are used by IdeaScale, IdeaScale affiliates, marketing partners, analytics providers and online customer support providers. These technologies are used to analyze trends, to administer the Services, to track activity in the Services, to gather demographic information about the user base, and to create reports regarding use for internal review. To manage cookies, see Section 7 below. &nbsp;</p>
<p class="intercom-align-left">For end users within the IdeaScale applications, your publicly available IP address is collected for the purpose determining the appropriate language in which to provide the Services. In non-United States jurisdictions an IP address may be classified as personal information or personal data under applicable laws; therefore, to the extent that IdeaScale collects IP addresses, IdeaScale will collect, use, maintain, secure and/or disclose IP addresses in accordance with applicable Laws. Additionally, and only for visitors to IdeaScale’s marketing pages, IP addresses are collected to advertise IdeaScale services to these visitors elsewhere on the Internet. See Section 7 to learn how to delete and control these cookies.</p>
<p class="intercom-align-left"><b>7. COOKIE POLICY</b> &nbsp;</p>
<p class="intercom-align-left">IdeaScale sometimes places small data files called cookies in your browser. This is a common practice for the functionality of many websites.</p>
<p class="intercom-align-left"><b>What are cookies?</b> &nbsp;<br>A cookie is a small text file that a website saves on your computer or mobile device when you visit a website.

A session cookie expires automatically when you close your browser. A persistent cookie will remain until it expires or you delete your cookies. Expiration dates are set in the cookies themselves; some may expire after a few minutes while others may expire after multiple years.</p>
<p class="intercom-align-left"><b>Why does IdeaScale use cookies?</b> &nbsp;<br>Cookies are used to authenticate users, to show the right information and prevent unauthorized parties from accessing your account.
