		    <p><font color="#0000FF" size="2"><strong>Information Collection and Use Information
		        Collection </strong></font></p>
		    <p><font size="2">Idera Corporation is the sole owner of the information
		        collected on www.idera.com. Idera.com collects information from our
		        users
		            at several different points on our Web site. </font></p>		    <p><font color="#0000FF" size="2"><strong>Registration</strong></font></p>
		    <p><font size="2">In order to use some components of this Web site, including,
		        but not limited to participation in a webinar, posting information
		        or code
		        on bulletin boards, and downloading trial software, a user must
		        first complete the registration form. During registration a user is
		        required
		        to give contact information (such as name and email address).
		        We use this information to contact the user about services on our site
		        for
		        which he has expressed interest. It is optional for the user
		        to provide demographic information (such as income level and gender),
		        and unique
		        identifiers (such as, username and password), but encouraged
		        so we can provide a more personalized experience on our site. </font></p>
		    <p><font color="#0000FF" size="2"><strong>Order</strong></font></p>
		    <p><font size="2">We request information from the user on our order
		          form. A user must provide contact information (such as name,
		        phone number, email,
		          and shipping address) and financial information (such as credit
		          card number, expiration date). This information is used for
		        billing purposes
		          and to fill customer’s orders. If we have trouble processing
		          an order, the information is used to contact the user.</font></p>		    <p><font color="#0000FF" size="2"><strong>Information Use </strong></font></p>
		    <p><font color="#0000FF" size="2">Profile </font><font size="2"><br>
		      We store information that we collect through cookies, log files,
		        clear gifs, and/or third parties to create a profile of our users.
		        A profile is stored information that we keep on individual users that
		        details their viewing preferences. Consequently, collected information
		        is tied to the users personally identifiable information to provide
		        offers and improve the content of the site for the user. This profile
		        is used to tailor a user’s visit to our Web site, and to direct pertinent
		        marketing promotions to them. We do not share your profile with other
		        third parties. </font></p>
		    <p><font color="#0000FF" size="2">Cookies </font><font size="2"><br>
		      A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user’s computer tied
		        to information about the user. Usage of a cookie is in no way linked
		        to any personally identifiable information while on our site. We use
		        both session ID cookies and persistent cookies. For the session ID
		        cookie, once users close the browser, the cookie simply terminates.
		        A persistent cookie is a small text file stored on the user’s hard
		        drive for an extended period of time. Persistent cookies can be removed
		        by following Internet browser help file directions. </font></p>
		    <p><font size="2">By setting a cookie on our site, users would not have to log in a password
		      more than once, thereby saving time while on our site. If users reject
		      the cookie, they may still use our site. However, that the user will
		      be limited in some areas of our site. Persistent cookies enable us to
		      track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience
		      on our site. See the “Profile” section. </font></p>
		    <p><font size="2">Currently, Idera does not endorse any third party use of cookies on
		      our site. </font></p>
		    <p><font color="#0000FF" size="2">Third Party Advertising</font></p>
		    <p><font size="2">Idera does not currently allow third party advertising
		        on idera.com. </font></p>
		    <p><font color="#0000FF" size="2">Log Files </font><font size="2"><br>
		      Like most standard Web site servers we use log files. This includes
		        internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider
		        (ISP), referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, and number
		        of clicks to analyze trends, administer the site, track user’s movement
		        in the aggregate, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate
		        use. IP addresses, etc. are not linked to personally identifiable information. </font></p>
		    <p><font color="#0000FF" size="2">Clear Gifs (Web Beacons/Web Bugs) </font><font size="2"><br>
  Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar
		        in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements
		        of Web users.Clear Gifs can "work with" existing cookies
		        on a computer if they are both from the same Web site or advertising
		        company. That means, for example, that if a person visited “www.companyX.com”,
		        which uses an advertising company's clear gif, the Web site [or
		        advertising company] would match the clear gif's identifier and
		        the advertising
		        company's cookie ID number, to show the past online behavior
		        for that computer. This collected information would then be given
		        to the advertising
		        company [or Web site]. </font></p>
		    <p><font size="2">In addition, clear gifs can be used in HTML-based emails to know which
		      emails have been opened by the recipients. This gauges the effectiveness
		      of certain communications and the effectiveness of marketing campaigns. </font></p>
		    <p><font size="2">Idera does not employ clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs) at this
		      time. However, to help us better manage content on our site by informing
		      us what content is effective, we may do so in the future. </font></p>
		    <p><font color="#0000FF" size="2">Communications from the Site </font></p>
		    <p><font color="#0000FF" size="2">Special Offers and Updates </font><font size="2"><br>
		      We send all new members a welcoming email to verify password and
		        username. Established members will occasionally receive information
		        on products, services, special deals, and a newsletter. Out of respect
		        for the privacy of our users we present the option to opt-out of these
		        types of communications. Please see the Choice and Opt-out sections. </font></p>
		    <p><font color="#0000FF" size="2">Service Announcements </font><font size="2"><br>
		      On rare occasions it is necessary to send out a strictly service
		        related announcement. For instance, if our service is temporarily suspended
		        for maintenance we might send users an email. Generally, users may
		        not opt-out of these communications, though they can deactivate their
		        account. However, these communications are not promotional in nature. </font></p>
		    <p><font color="#0000FF" size="2">Customer Service</font></p>
		    <p><font size="2">We communicate with users on a regular basis to provide
		        requested services and in regards to issues relating to their account
		        we reply
		        via email or phone, in accordance with the users wishes. </font></p>
		    <p><font color="#0000FF" size="2">Sharing </font></p>
		    <p><font color="#0000FF" size="2">Legal Disclaimer </font><font size="2"><br>
		      Though we make every effort to preserve user privacy, we may need
		        to disclose personal information when required by law wherein we have
		        a good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with a
		        current judicial proceeding, a court order or legal process served
		        on our Web site. </font></p>
		    <p><font size="2">Except as specifically disclosed, Idera does not share data on visitors
		      to idera.com with any third parties. </font></p>
		    <p><font color="#0000FF" size="2">Third Party Intermediaries </font><font size="2"><br>
		      Where a third party is used in the sale or implementation of Idera
		        products, we may use a third party for payment processing. These companies
		        do not retain, share, store or use personally identifiable information
		        for any secondary purposes.</font></p>
		    <p><font color="#0000FF" size="2">Service Providers </font></p>
		    <p><font size="2">Idera does not provide recognizable site visitor information to any
		      service providers at this time. Some elements of products or services
		      purchased from Idera may come from a third party vendor. In such a case,
		      the sharing of customer data will be clearly outlined in the license
		      agreement specific to that transaction. </font></p>
		    <p><font color="#0000FF" size="2">Business Transitions </font><font size="2"><br>
		      In the event Idera Corporation goes through a business transition,
		        such as a merger, being acquired by another company, or selling a portion
		        of its assets, users’ personal information will, in most instances,
		        be part of the assets transferred. Users will be notified via email
		        and prominent notice on our Web site for 30 days prior to a change
		        of ownership or control of their personal information. If as a result
		        of the business transition, the users’ personally identifiable information
		        will be used in a manner different from that stated at the time of
		        collection they will be given choice consistent with our notification
		        of changes section. </font></p>
		    <p><font color="#0000FF" size="2">Choice/Opt-out</font></p>
		    <p><font size="2">Users who no longer wish to receive our newsletter and
		        promotional communications may opt-out of receiving these communications
		        by replying
		          to unsubscribe in the subject line in the email or email us
		        at info@idea.com. We also offer an opt-out mechanism on the User Profile
		        pages. </font></p>		    <p><font color="#0000FF" size="2">Links</font><font size="2"> <br>
		      This Web site contains links to other sites. Please be aware that
		        we, Idera Corporation, are not responsible for the privacy practices
		        of such other sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave
		        our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every Web site
		        that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy statement
		        applies solely to information collected by this Web site.</font></p>
		    <p><font color="#0000FF" size="2">Surveys </font></p>
		    <p><font size="2">From time-to-time our site requests information from
		        users via surveys. Participation in these surveys is completely voluntary
		        and
		        the user therefore has a choice whether or not to disclose this
		        information. The requested information typically includes contact information
		        (such
		        as name and shipping address), and demographic information (such
		        as zip code). Survey information will be used for purposes of monitoring
		        or improving the use and satisfaction of this site. Users’ personally
		        identifiable information is not shared with third parties unless
		        we
		        give prior notice and choice. Though we may use an intermediary
		        to conduct these surveys or contests, they may not use users’ personally
		        identifiable information for any secondary purposes. </font></p>
		    <p><font color="#0000FF" size="2">Tell-A-Friend</font></p>
		    <p><font size="2">If a user elects to use our referral service for informing
		        a friend about our site, we ask them for the friend’s name and email
		        address.
		        Idera will automatically send the friend a one-time email inviting
		        them to visit the site and/or to download trial software. Idera
		        stores this information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time
		        email
		        and tracking the success of our referral program. The friend
		        will have the opportunity to request the removal of this information
		        from our
		        database as part of the initial one-time contact. </font></p>
		    <p><font color="#0000FF" size="2">Security </font></p>
		    <p><font size="2">This Web site takes every precaution to protect our users’
		        information. When users submit sensitive information via the Web site,
		        their information
		        is protected both online and off-line. </font></p>
		    <p><font size="2">When our registration/order form asks users to enter sensitive information
		      (such as credit card number), that information is encrypted and is protected
		      with the best encryption software in the industry - SSL. While on a secure
		      page, such as our order form, the lock icon on the bottom of Web browsers
		      such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked,
		      as opposed to un-locked, or open, when users are just ‘surfing’. </font></p>
		    <p><font size="2">While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online,
		      we also do everything in our power to protect user-information off-line.
		      All of our users’ information, not just the sensitive information mentioned
		      above, is restricted in our offices. Only employees who need the information
		      to perform a specific job (for example, our billing clerk or a customer
		      service representative) are granted access to personally identifiable
		      information. Furthermore, ALL employees are kept up-to-date on our security
		      and privacy practices. Any time new policies are added, our employees
		      are notified and/or reminded about the importance we place on privacy,
		      and what they can do to ensure our users’ information is protected. Finally,
		      the servers that store personally identifiable information are in a secure
		      environment in a locked facility. </font></p>
		    <p><font size="2">If users have any questions about the security at our Web site, users
		      can send an email to info@idera.com </font></p>
		    <p><font size="2">Correcting/Updating/Deleting/Deactivating Personal Information <br>
		      If a user’s personally identifiable information changes (such as
		        zip code, phone, email or postal address), or if a user no longer desires
		        our service, we provide a way to correct, update or delete/deactivate
		        users’ personally identifiable information. This can usually be done
		        at the User Profile page or by emailing our Customer Support at info@idera.com. </font></p>
		    <p><font color="#0000FF" size="2">Notification of Changes </font><font size="2"><br>
		      If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes
		        to this privacy statement, the homepage, and other places we deem appropriate
		        so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we
		        use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. We will
		        use information in accordance with the privacy policy under which the
		        information was collected.</font></p>
		    <p><font size="2">If, however, we are going to use users’ personally identifiable information
		      in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection we will
		      notify users via email. Users will have a choice as to whether or not
		      we use their information in this different manner. However, if users
		      have opted out of all communication with the site, or deleted/deactivated
		      their account, then they will not be contacted, nor will their personal
		      information be used in this new manner. In addition, if we make any material
		      changes in our privacy practices that do not affect user information
		      already stored in our database, we will post a prominent notice on our
		      Web site notifying users of the change. In some cases where we post a
		      notice we will also email users, who have opted to receive communications
		      from us, notifying them of the changes in our privacy practices. </font></p>
