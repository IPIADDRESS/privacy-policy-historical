The following describes our privacy practices that are specific to iDateAsia.com.<br><br>
              Welcome to iDateAsia.com ("iDateAsia" or the "Site"). Your privacy is important to us. As such, we provide this Policy explaining our online information practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected, processed, maintained and disposed by iDateAsia, including any services owned, operated or offered by or on behalf of iDateAsia, and by third-party service providers if applicable.<br><br>

We have developed this Policy to ensure that your privacy is protected while using iDateAsia. We reserve the right to change it at any time, and all changes are effective upon posting with notice to you.<br><br>
              Owing to the global nature of iDateAsia's business conducted over the internet, it is practically impossible for us to comply with all applicable laws / rules / regulations (and the like) as may be prescribed by individual country / region / city. We endeavor to adopt internationally recommended “Best Practices” whilst adhering to the Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance, laws of Hong Kong which you must agree to as the applicable law in case of dispute arising herefrom.<br><br>
              Operationally we are in compliance with, though not bound to do so, the general requirements imposed by the Data Protection Principles generally recommended by the US-EU US-Swiss Safe Harbor Frameworks, Organisation for Economic Cooperation &amp; Development, and by the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation. In particular, we carry out Privacy Compliance Assessment exercise periodically to ensure compliance in respect of notice, choice, onward transfer, security, data integrity, access and enforcement.<br><br>
              This Privacy Policy applies to your use of iDateAsia. In addition, where more detailed information is needed to explain our privacy practices, we post supplementary privacy policy to describe how iDateAsia processes personal information. Please review and agree to those Supplementary Privacy Policy.<br><br>
