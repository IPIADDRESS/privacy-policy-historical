    <p>We may also use information to ensure that Our Users are in compliance with our Terms. We
    do not retain any personal information beyond the time it is needed.</p>

    <h4>(c) Information we share</h4>
    <p>We do not share Your id.net account information with companies, organizations and
    individuals outside of the Company unless one of the following circumstances apply:</p>

    <h5>With Your consent</h5>
    <p>We will share Your id.net account information with companies, organizations and individuals
    outside of the Company when We have your consent to do so. We require opt-in consent for
    the sharing of any personal information.</p>

    <h5>For external processing</h5>
    <p>We provide personal information to Our affiliates or other trusted businesses or persons to
    process it for us, based on Our instructions and in compliance with Our Privacy Policy and
    any other appropriate confidentiality and security measures.</p>

    <h5>For legal reasons</h5>
    <p>We will share personal information with companies, organizations or individuals, outside the
    Company, if We have a good-faith belief that access, use, preservation or disclosure of the
    information is reasonably necessary to:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>meet any applicable law, regulation, legal process or enforceable governmental request
      (including legal requests from jurisdictions outside of Hong Kong)</li>
      <li>enforce applicable Terms of Service, including investigation of potential violations</li>

    </ul>

    <p>If the Company is involved in a merger, acquisition or asset sale, We will continue to ensure

    world. By providing Us with information We receive about You, You consent to this transfer.
    We will protect the privacy and security of this information according to Our Privacy Policy,
    regardless of where it is processed or stored.</p>

    <h3 id="section-III">III. Other websites</h3>
    <h4>(a) About id.net Website</h4>
    <p>Id.net Website lets You connect with other websites, involving games or social interaction for
    example, through the use of a login system. In this way, the Company helps You make Your
    experiences on the web more personalized.</p>

    <p>Reminder: the websites are created and maintained by other businesses and developers who
    are not part of the Company, so it is important You make sure to read their terms of service
    and privacy policies.</p>

    <h4>(b) Logging in to another website using id.net</h4>

    <p>The Company lets You log into third party websites using id.net identities created on Your
      id.net account. This means that You have the possibility to use the default id.net identities
      or create new ones to log in to third party websites. You can determine under which identity
      You want to access third party websites. When You log in using id.net, Your id.net account
      information will never be transferred to the third party website without Your consent (Section
      II (c)). In order for third party websites to uniquely identify Your account among other
      accounts, We send a unique identifier named ‘PID’ (personal identification). Your PID is
      different for each third party website so as to preserver your anonymity.</p>

      <p>Be aware that there is a probability that third party websites may require from You different
        information than the one in the fields you have chosen to fill for Your id.net identity. For
        instance, You may have filled in solely Your name and country but the third party website
        requires You to provide Your nickname as well. The extra information required may vary
        from one third party website to another. Once you do so, the extra information provided will
        be automatically added to the identity you have accessed that website with. As a result, all the
        websites linked to that identity will also benefit from that additional information. Nonetheless,
        You are able to view which third party website has access to which information You provided by
        going on the “Sites” section of Your id.net account.</p>

        <p>
          If You already have an account on a third party website, that website may also be able to let
          You connect and link it to one of Your id.net identities. Your information will be sent to Us
          when You use Your id.net identity to register or login to a third party website.
        </p>

    <h4>(c) Privacy Practices of Third Parties</h4>
    <p>This privacy statement only addresses the use and disclosure of information by the Company
    through Your interaction with the websites. Other websites that may be accessible from Our
    Website may have their own privacy statements and personal information collection, use and
    disclosure practices. For instance, some websites require an over eighteen (18) years of age
    access.</p>

    <p>We are not responsible for the privacy policies, practices or content of Third party websites.
    Please be advised that the practices described in this Privacy Policy do not apply to
    information gathered through other websites. When You leave the Website, the privacy
    policies and practices of that other website apply; We encourage You to be aware of
    those privacy policies and practices when You are on those other websites and submitting
    personally identifiable information. You are responsible for reviewing the privacy policies
    and practices of each and every site that You visit.</p>

    <h3 id="section-IV">IV. Cookies and similar technologies</h3>
    <p>
      It is possible that We may gather information regarding Your computer for Our services. This
      collection of data is used for statistical analysis about Our Website for use by Us.
    </p>
    <p>
      Any information shared will not identify who You are, but rather be mathematical data about
      Our visitors and their use on Our Website. The data does not give out any personal details.
      Cookies may be used to gather this general internet data. When used, cookies are downloaded
      to Your computer without prompting. The cookie file is stored on Your hard drive, where files
      are transferred to. This information helps Us improve Our Website and services to You. All
      computers can block cookies by activating proper browser settings
    </p>
    <p>
      Due to the communications standards on the Internet, when You visit the Website We
      automatically receive the URL of the site from which You came and the site to which You are
      going when You leave the Website. The Company also received the internet protocol (“IP”)
      address of Your computer (or the proxy server you use to access the World Wide Web), Your
      computer operating system and type of web browser You are using, email patterns. The link
      between Your IP address and Your personally identifiable information is not shared with third
      parties without Your permission.
    </p>

    <h3 id="section-V">V. Information Security</h3>
    <p>We work hard to protect the Website and Our users from unauthorized access to or
    unauthorized alteration, disclosure or destruction of information We hold.</p>

    <p>
      In particular:
      </p><ul>
        <li>We encrypt many of Our services using SSL</li>
        <li>We review Our information collection, storage and processing practices, including
        physical security measures, to guard against unauthorized access to systems.</li>
        <li>We restrict access to personal information to the Company’s employees, contractors
        and agents who need to know that information in order to process it for Us, and who
        are subject to strict contractual confidentiality obligations and may be disciplined or
        terminated if they fail to meet these obligations.</li>
      </ul>
    <p></p>

    <p>Data you provide Us with will be stored on secure servers. We take all reasonable steps to
    ensure the safety of the data transfer in agreement with this Policy. Transmission of data
    via the Internet is never completely secure, thus a guarantee of data sent electronically or
    transmitted cannot be given. Information offered is therefore at Your own risk.</p>

    <p>We use a reasonably secure method to destroy personal information.</p>

    <h3 id="section-VI">VI. Accessing and Correcting your personal information</h3>
    <p>You can access and change any personal information We store through you id.net account
    page.</p>
    <p>
    Correcting information from one of Your id.net identities, i.e. change what You have filled in,
    will automatically apply that correction on all the linked websites to that id.net identity.
