ID.me, Inc., the provider of the Service and Website (referred to as “us” or “we”), is committed to protecting the privacy of individuals who navigate to, or otherwise use the Service and/or Website (hereafter, “Users” or “you”). The Service and Website offer eligible Users who create an account with an electronic identification resource (or “ID.me Account”) that allows eligible Users to verify their status as a member of an affinity group create accounts with websites that use the ID.me Account and access certain exclusive benefits, including without limitation, deals, discounts, cash back rebates and employment and educational opportunities, offered by participating retailers, service providers, employers or benefits administrators (collectively, the “ID.me Service”). Once Users have created an ID.me Account, the ID.me Account serves as a portable, single digital identity that those Users can utilize to generate an account and pre-populate the account with the User’s information and, thereafter, access the goods, services, rewards and/or benefits of various participating websites (including retailers, service providers, employers, benefits administrators, etc.). Users are required to submit certain information to ID.me  as part of the verification process so that we may ascertain the User’s identity, group affiliation, and determine other eligibility standards for the User tied to the ID.me Service. However, Users may choose what specific information (personally identifiable information and other forms of information as described in greater detail below) is tied to their ID.me Account., and at any time may revoke ID.me’s access to such information In doing so, Users can control how much of that information is shared with other websites in relation to the ID.me Service. In certain cases the more information Users share the more rewards and benefits, such as deals, discounts, cash back rebates and employment and educational opportunities, the User may be eligible to receive, as further described in our <a href="https://www.id.me/terms">Terms of Service</a>. However, certain participating websites may require that Users provide certain, minimum levels of information and a User’s refusal to provide such may impact his or her eligibility for the subject good, service, or benefit offered.</p>

<p>To avoid any confusion, Users should understand that, while we own and operate the Service and Website and certain other websites (e.g., TroopSwap.com), we do not own or operate websites owned and operated by third parties who may avail themselves of the ID.me Service (collectively referred to hereafter as the “Third Party Websites.”) This Privacy Policy is intended to inform Users about our collection, use, storage, and disclosure, destruction and disposal of information that we collect or record in the course of providing the Website and the ID.me Service. Please note, we are not responsible for the privacy practices of Third Party Websites and they are under no obligation to comply with this Privacy Policy. Before visiting Third Party Websites, and before providing the User’s ID.me or any other information to any party that operates or advertises on Third Party Websites, Users should review the privacy policy and practices of that website to determine how information collected from Users will be handled. Please further note, depending on a User’s particular interaction with us (e.g., Users who solely navigate the Website versus Users who create an account and use the ID.me Service at Third Party Websites), different portions of this policy may apply to Users at different times.</p>

<p>Please read this Privacy Policy carefully. By accessing or using the Website, you acknowledge that you have read, understand, and agree to be bound to all the terms of this Privacy Policy and the Website’s Terms of Service. If you do not agree to these terms, exit this page and do not access or use the Service or Website.</p>

<h2>1. Changes to Privacy Policy</h2>

<p>If we decide to change this Privacy Policy, we will post those changes to this page so that you are aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. We reserve the right to modify this Privacy Policy at any time, so please review it frequently. If we make material changes to this policy, we will notify you here, by email, or by means of notice on our home page.</p>

<h2>2. Types of Information Collected and Uses of Collected Information</h2>

<p>We collect three types of information from and about Users: Personally Identifiable Information, Sensitive Information, and Non-Personally Identifiable Information.</p>

<h3>Personally Identifiable Information &amp; Sensitive Information</h3>

<p>We do not automatically collect any Personally Identifiable Information or Sensitive Information without your consent. When you create an account to obtain an ID.me Account and use the ID.me Service, you will be asked to provide certain Personally Identifiable Information and Sensitive Information so that we can verify your identity and attributes of your identity including, but not limited to, group affiliations (e.g., Military, First Responder, Student, Veteran, etc.), memberships, social media accounts, educational degrees, and professional certifications. Personally Identifiable Information is information that identifies a specific individual, including, without limitation, first and last name, mailing address, e-mail address (including, without limitation, .mil e-mail address), telephone number, social security number, and date of birth. In addition, you will be asked to provide certain additional information or documentation that we will use to verify your eligibility to receive discounts and benefits from organizations and registration authorities such as government agencies, telecommunications networks, credit card bureaus, financial institutions, or authoritative agents with access to your group affiliation credentials, military records (which may also contain Personally Identifiable Information), your spouse’s or immediate family member’s social security number, military affiliation(s), dates of active and reserve duty service, and information related to your accounts with financial institutions (“Sensitive Information”). The decision to share specific items of your Personally Identifiable Information and/or Sensitive Information with the ID.me Service (and, where applicable, with Third Party Websites in connection with your participation in the ID.me Cash Back Program and with certain aspects of the ID.me Service (including certain deals, cash back rewards, offers or opportunities offered by Third Party Websites which are conditioned upon certain eligibility requirements) is yours and yours alone. You can elect to provide all or only some of the information requested by the Website during the registration process. and at any time you may decide to remove some of the information that you previously provided However, if you decline to provide any of the above information, you may not be able to register for an ID.me Account or to access certain benefits of the ID.me Service (including certain deals, cash back rewards, offers or opportunities offered by Third Party Websites which are conditioned upon certain eligibility requirements). In addition to using your Personally Identifiable Information and Sensitive Information to provide the ID.me Service, we may also use this information to troubleshoot, resolve disputes, accomplish administrative tasks, contact you, enforce our agreements with you, including the Website’s Terms of Service and this Privacy Policy, comply with applicable law, and cooperate with law enforcement activities. In addition, we reserve the right to audit your eligibility (e.g., group affiliations such as active duty military or student status); to audit user accounts for fraud by, for example, verifying that purchases are delivered to registered user addresses; and to prevent duplicate ID.me Account’s from being created with the same information.</p>

<h3>Non-Personally Identifiable Information</h3>

<p>Non-Personally Identifiable Information is information that does not identify a specific User. This type of information may include things like the Uniform Resource Locator (“URL”) of the website you visited before coming to the Website, the URL of the website you visit after leaving the Website, the type of browser you are using, your Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, occupation, language, unique device identifier, approximately geographic location, and time zone. We, and/or our authorized third party service providers and advertisers, may automatically collect this information when you visit our Website through the use of electronic tools like Cookies and Web beacons or Pixel tags or location based capabilities on your mobile device, including those described in Items 4 and 8 of this Privacy Policy. We use Non-Personally Identifiable Information to troubleshoot, administer the Website, analyze trends, gather demographic information, comply with applicable law, and cooperate with law enforcement activities. We may also share this information with our authorized third party service providers and advertisers to measure the overall effectiveness of our online advertising, content, and programming. In certain limited instances, we may combine certain Non-Personally Identifiable Information with other identifiers in order to confirm your identity as part of the ID.me verification process. For example, we may combine an approximate geographic location obtained from a User’s mobile device and match it with address information the User voluntarily submitted to the Website in order to confirm the User’s identity and prevent fraudulent conduct. Notwithstanding, this information would still be considered Non-Personally Identifiable Information when it is taken alone or combined only with other non-identifying information (for example, the type of web browser used by the User).</p>

<p>In order to better serve members of America’s Armed Forces and other personnel covered by the Service  Members Civil Relief Act (SCRA) (50 U.S.C. App. 501 et. seq.)<sup>*</sup>, ID.me provides services to Financial Services companies and Third Party Websites in order to facilitate their compliance with the provisions of SCRA. By joining ID.me, you agree that ID.me may use your personal information in order to assist Financial Services companies and Third Party Websites to determine your eligibility or your family member’s eligibility for SCRA benefits and protections. ID.me may periodically use your personal information to confirm your SCRA eligibility or your family member’s eligibility at a later point in time to inform third parties of any changes to your SCRA eligibility status. Source of this information may include, but are not limited to, publically available websites, physical documentation, financial information, ID.me’s network or third parties that have a relationship with ID.me. </p>

<p><sup>*</sup>The scope of ID.me’s SCRA services includes all individuals protected by the SCRA (i.e. personnel serving in the Untied States Armed Forces, commissioned officers of the Public Health Service and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, U.S. citizens serving with the armed forces of nations allied with the United States, and, where applicable according to federal or state laws and regulations, dependents and family members of an individual protected under the SCRA.</p>

<h2>8. Data Tracking</h2>

<h3>Cookies</h3>

<p>To facilitate and customize your experience with the Website, we store cookies on your computer. A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a User’s computer for record-keeping purposes which contains information about that User. We use cookies to save you time while using the Website, remind us who you are, administer cash back rebates, and track and target user interests in order to provide a customized experience. Cookies also allow us to collect Non-Personally Identifiable Information from you, like which pages you visited and what links you clicked on. Use of this information helps us to create a more user-friendly experience for all visitors. In addition, we may use Third Party Advertising Companies to display advertisements on our Website. As part of their service, they may place separate cookies on your computer. We have no access to or control over these cookies.

Most browsers automatically accept cookies, but you may be able to modify your browser settings to decline cookies. Please note that if you decline or delete these cookies, some parts of the Website, including our Cash Back Program, may not work properly.</p>

<h3>Other Tracking Devices</h3>

<p>We may use other industry standard technologies like pixel tags and web beacons to track your use of our Website pages and promotions, or we may allow our Third Party Service Providers to use these devices on our behalf. Pixel tags and web beacons are tiny graphic images placed on certain pages on our Website, or in our emails that allow us to determine whether you have performed a specific action. When you access these pages or open or click an email, pixel tags and web beacons generate a Non-Personally Identifiable notice of that action. Pixel tags allow us to measure and improve our understanding of visitor traffic and behavior on our Website, as well as give us a way to measure our promotions and performance. We may also utilize pixel tags and web beacons provided by our Affiliates and/or Marketing Partners for the same purposes. The Website is not presently configured to respond to DNT or “do not track” signals from web browsers.</p>

<h2>9. Privacy Policies of Third Party Websites</h2>

<p>Minors under the age of 18 may not use the Website. We do not knowingly collect personal information from anyone under the age of 18, and no part of the Website is designed to attract anyone under the age of 18.

If the email addresses do not match, we ask you if you want to merge them and you must enter your ID.me password to validate that you control that account. If you are already logged into ID.me but not logged into Facebook, when you click on "Connect with Facebook" you will be prompted to enter your Facebook credentials or to "Sign up for Facebook."

Further, you can edit privacy settings for the reviews that appear on Facebook or disconnect this service by visiting the Facebook Application Settings page.</p>

<h3>Please Further Note</h3>

<p>If a User uses Facebook Connect, depending on the privacy settings that the User has set on his or her Facebook account, the User will be granting us access to the information accessible via that Facebook Account and we will access, make available and store (if applicable and as permitted by Facebook and authorized by the User via his or her Facebook account setting) that information so that it is available on and through the User’s Account on the Website. If there is information about the User’s "friends" or people with whom the User is associated via the Facebook account, the information we obtain about those "friends" or people with whom the User is associated, may also depend on the privacy settings such people have with Facebook.</p>
