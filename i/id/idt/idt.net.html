    <h3>
	<strong>IDT's Privacy Policy - Generally</strong></h3>
<p>
	IDT is committed to protecting your privacy and developing technology that gives you the most powerful and safe online experience. This IDT Privacy Policy applies to IDT's family of Web sites and governs data collection and usage at all IDT sites and services. Please read the complete IDT Privacy Policy below.<br>
	The purpose of the IDT Web sites' privacy policy is to inform you, as a welcome visitor to our Web sites, about the kinds of information we may gather about you when you visit our Web sites, how we may use that information, whether we disclose it to anyone, and your ability to correct the information. Finally, please note that this policy applies only to IDT Web sites and Web sites that carry the IDT Web sites' brand, and not to other companies' or organizations' Web sites to which we link. We have clearly marked IDT Web sites and these branded Web sites with our logo so you know where this policy applies.</p>
<h3>
	<strong>Information About All IDT Web sites' Visitors</strong></h3>
<p>
	IDT keeps track of the Web sites and pages our customers visit within the Web sites, in order to determine what sites and services are the most popular. This data is used to deliver customized content and advertising within IDT to customers whose behavior indicates that they are interested in a particular subject area. Our service automatically gathers certain usage information like the numbers and frequency of visitors to IDT Web sites and its areas. This is similar to the way television ratings tell the networks how many people tuned in to a program. We only use such data in the aggregate. This collective data helps us determine how much our customers use parts of the site, so we can improve our site to assure that it is as appealing as we can make it for as many of you as possible.</p>
<h3>
	<strong>Use of Cookies </strong></h3>
<p>
	Some IDT Web sites may use "cookies" to help you personalize your online experience. A cookie is a text file that is placed on your hard disk by a Web page server. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you, and can only be read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you.<br>
	One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to save you time. The purpose of a cookie is to tell the Web server that you have returned to a specific page. For example, if you personalize IDT's pages, or register with IDT sites or services, a cookie helps IDT to recall your specific information on subsequent visits. This simplifies the process of recording your personal information, such as billing addresses, shipping addresses, and so on. When you return to the same IDT Web site, the information you previously provided can be retrieved, so you can easily use the IDT features that you customized.<br>
	You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to fully experience the interactive features of the IDT services or Web sites you visit.</p>
<h3>
	<br>
	<strong>Use of Third Party Advertising </strong></h3>
<p>
	The majority of the advertisements you see on IDT Web sites are displayed by IDT. In addition, IDT also allows other companies, called third-party advertisers, to display advertisements while you are viewing content on IDT Web sites. These advertisement are selected based on what we believe will be of most interest to you.</p>
<h3>
	<strong>Information About You </strong></h3>
<p>
	Sometimes, we may specifically ask for information about you when you sign up to use a service or when you order a product. IDT does not sell, rent or lease its customer lists to third parties. We do, however, need certain information -- such as name, age, Internet address or screen name, billing address, type of computer, credit card number -- in order to provide that service or product to you. We may also use that information to let you know of additional products and services about which you might be interested. You can choose not to receive such information if you don't want to by letting us know on the registration screen when you sign up for the product or service. We may ask you for information about your interests so that both you and we can take advantage of the interactivity of the online medium, but you may always choose to respond or not. Additionally, we may provide you with an opportunity to be listed in a directory on one of our IDT- branded services -- these listings are also optional and you can make changes to or eliminate this information when you want to.<br>
	IDT does not associate sensitive data, such as your race, religion, or political affiliations, with personally identifiable information. IDT takes precautions to segregate any sensitive data you may provide on IDT sites and services that reference your race, religion, sexual orientation, ethnicity or political affiliations.</p>
<h3>
	<strong>Security of your Personal Information</strong></h3>
<p>
	IDT secures your personal information from unauthorized access, use or disclosure. IDT secures the personally identifiable information you provide on computer servers in a controlled, secure environment, protected from unauthorized access, use or disclosure. Personal information (such as a credit card number) is transmitted to other Web sites through the use of Secure Socket Layer (SSL) encrypted protection.</p>
<h3>
	<strong>Third Party Disclosure </strong></h3>
<p>
	We do not use or disclose information about your individual visits to IDT Web sites or information that you may give us, such as your name, address, email address or telephone number, to any outside companies. However, we may share with our Web site partners aggregated statistical "ratings" information about the use of IDT Web sites. IDT may share data with trusted partners to help us perform statistical analysis. All such third parties are prohibited from using your personal information except to provide these services to IDT, and they are required to maintain the confidentiality of your information.<br>
	IDT Web sites will never disclose your personal information without notice unless it is required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to:<br>
	(a) conform to the law or comply with legal process served on IDT or the site;<br>
	(b) protect and defend the rights or property of IDT, an IDT Web site; and,<br>
	(c) act under exigent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of IDT, its Web sites, or the public.</p>
