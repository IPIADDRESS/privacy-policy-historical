<p> </p>
<p>By using an IT World Canada Web site, you are accepting the terms of this Privacy Statement. Whenever you submit information via this site, you consent to the collection, use and disclosure of that information, personal or otherwise, as described in this Privacy Statement.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The Web site ITBusiness.ca provides news, news analysis and other information primarily intended to support those engaged professionally in the development, support, management and strategic application of Information and Information Technology (I&amp;IT) in a business environment.</p>
<p>IT World Canada does not charge a fee for visitors to access the site's content; instead, as with many Web sites, revenue is generated through advertising and sponsorships. Our advertisers and sponsors have a reasonable expectation that visitors to the site are genuine and meet certain minimum qualifications in the field we serve.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>PERSONALLY IDENTIFYING INFORMATION</b></p>
<p>We are committed to providing you with an Internet experience that respects and protects your personal privacy choices and concerns. Personally identifying information is collected by IT World Canada only when you specifically and knowingly provide it.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>COLLECTION AND USE OF PERSONALLY IDENTIFYING INFORMATION</b> Beyond the site registration described previously, IT World Canada collects and uses your personal information primarily for the purpose of providing you with the products and services you have requested from us, including the delivery of the publications Computing Canada, Computer Dealer News, EDGE, Direction Informatique and related content; delivery of electronic or direct-mailed newsletters; and, event registration confirmations, updates and other information related to IT World Canada products, events and seminars.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The information we collect is also used to communicate with you about your subscriptions and to provide you with information related to other IT World Canada and its sister IDG companies and the IDG Network publications and services.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>All e-mails sent to subscribers clearly identify the source of the e-mail as ITBusiness.ca, IT World Canada, its publications or IDG.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Subscribers may elect not to receive e-mail from third parties when e-mail information is collected, and in response to any e-mail received.</p>
<p>Subscribers may change their preferences at any time by e-mail to IT World Canada <a href="mailto:circulation@itworldcanada.com"><b><font color="red">circulation@itworldcanada.com</font></b></a> or by calling the circulation department at <b>(613) 475-3217. </b></p>
<p> </p>
<p> If you have indicated that you are interested in receiving offers or information from selected IT World Canada sponsors or advertisers, your personal information would also be used by IT World Canada to contact you or to send you e-mail materials and other mailings on their behalf.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Your personal information is never shared with third parties. The information submitted by them is fully screened by IT World Canada and must, in our judgement, be of value to the IT Community. However, you always have the option to tell us not to send offers for other products or services.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>If you enter a contest or participate in other promotional activities offered by IT World Canada, your personal information will be used to administer the promotion, including the use of your name and selected other information for the purposes of contacting, announcing and promoting the winners of the promotion.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>IT World Canada may also contact you from time to time to conduct research and surveys in our ongoing effort to improve our product and service offerings, or to invite your editorial comments for articles being developed for publication.</p>
<p>IT World Canada will not release your personal information to a third party without your authorization unless required to by law or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary in order to conform to the edicts of the law or to comply with a legal process serviced on our Web site.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>IT World Canada will only ask you to provide personal information that we need, when we need it. We will always explain why we need the information and what we intend to do with it.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>We will seek your prior consent to the collection, use and disclosure of personally identifying information and you can refuse such consent. You may also withdraw your consent at a later time by giving us reasonable notice.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>We will notify you in advance of any change in our intent for the use or disclosure of your personally identifying information.</p>
<p>Your personal information will not be used for any other purpose without your consent.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>DISCLOSURE</b></p>
<p>In order to effectively provide the products and services you have requested, IT World Canada may share your personal information with selected third parties who act on our behalf as suppliers or service providers. Examples include bonded mailing houses for processing and labelling items, including publications, prior to mailing; and, Canada Post and other distributors and carriers. We provide only the information required to perform the requested service. Information provided to third parties in these circumstances may only be used for the stated purpose. It is our practice to require third party suppliers to handle information in a manner consistent with IT World Canada's policies.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In addition, the information collected to service your subscriptions is made available -- on IT World Canada's premises only -- for review by the Canadian Circulation Audit Bureau (CCAB), the official auditing body for magazines. The auditors may also contact randomly selected subscribers in order to verify the publisher's circulation statements.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>SUPPLEMENTING INFORMATION</b></p>
<p>From time to time we may supplement information you give us via our Web site with information we acquire from other sources, such as information to validate your address, or company information available through sources such as business directories. This is to help us maintain consistency and accuracy of the information we collect and to help us provide a better service.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>NON-PERSONALLY IDENTIFYING INFORMATION COLLECTED AUTOMATICALLY</b></p>
<p>Our Web server logs information about visitors that is not personally identifiable.</p>
<p>Examples of this type of information include the type of Internet Browser you are using, the type of computer operating system you are using, and the domain name of the Web site from which you linked to our site or advertisement.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Also, when we collect personal data from you in a transaction, we may extract some information about that transaction in a non-identifiable format and combine it with other non-identifiable information. This information is used and analyzed only at an aggregate level to help us: understand trends and patterns; improve the content and design of the IT World Canada Web site; to enable our audit bureau to verify our claims of traffic to the site; and, to help advertisers and potential advertisers assess the suitability of the site for their advertising campaigns. This information is not reviewed at an individual level.</p>
