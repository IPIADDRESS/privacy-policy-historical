<p> </p>
<p>The Web site ITBusiness.ca provides news, news analysis and other information primarily intended to support those engaged professionally in the development, support, management and strategic application of Information and Information Technology (I&amp;IT) in a business environment.</p>
<p>IT World Canada does not charge a fee for visitors to access the site's content; instead, as with many Web sites, revenue is generated through advertising and sponsorships. Our advertisers and sponsors have a reasonable expectation that visitors to the site are genuine and meet certain minimum qualifications in the field we serve.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>PERSONALLY IDENTIFYING INFORMATION</b></p>
<p>We are committed to providing you with an Internet experience that respects and protects your personal privacy choices and concerns. Personally identifying information is collected by IT World Canada only when you specifically and knowingly provide it.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>COLLECTION AND USE OF PERSONALLY IDENTIFYING INFORMATION</b> Beyond the site registration described previously, IT World Canada collects and uses your personal information primarily for the purpose of providing you with the products and services you have requested from us, including the delivery of the publications Computing Canada, Computer Dealer News, EDGE, Direction Informatique and related content; delivery of electronic or direct-mailed newsletters; and, event registration confirmations, updates and other information related to IT World Canada products, events and seminars.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The information we collect is also used to communicate with you about your subscriptions and to provide you with information related to other IT World Canada and its sister IDG companies and the IDG Network publications and services.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>All e-mails sent to subscribers clearly identify the source of the e-mail as ITBusiness.ca, IT World Canada, its publications or IDG.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Subscribers may elect not to receive e-mail from third parties when e-mail information is collected, and in response to any e-mail received.</p>
<p>Subscribers may change their preferences at any time by e-mail to IT World Canada <a href="mailto:circulation@itworldcanada.com"><b><font color="red">circulation@itworldcanada.com</font></b></a> or by calling the circulation department at <b>(613) 475-3217. </b></p>
<p> </p>
<p> If you have indicated that you are interested in receiving offers or information from selected IT World Canada sponsors or advertisers, your personal information would also be used by IT World Canada to contact you or to send you e-mail materials and other mailings on their behalf.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Your personal information is never shared with third parties. The information submitted by them is fully screened by IT World Canada and must, in our judgement, be of value to the IT Community. However, you always have the option to tell us not to send offers for other products or services.</p>

<p><b>DISCLOSURE</b></p>
<p>In order to effectively provide the products and services you have requested, IT World Canada may share your personal information with selected third parties who act on our behalf as suppliers or service providers. Examples include bonded mailing houses for processing and labelling items, including publications, prior to mailing; and, Canada Post and other distributors and carriers.

<p><b>SUPPLEMENTING INFORMATION</b></p>
<p>From time to time we may supplement information you give us via our Web site with information we acquire from other sources, such as information to validate your address, or company information available through sources such as business directories.
