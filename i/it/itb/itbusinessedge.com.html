      <p>Protecting your privacy is a priority at IT Business 
        Edge. Please read this privacy policy to learn how we keep your personal 
        information confidential while using it to enhance the information and 
        services we provide you.</p>
      <p><b>1. Registration</b><br>
        When you register with IT Business Edge you supply some personal information, 
        including your e-mail address, required to begin your subscription(s) 
        to IT Business Edge weekly reports. Once you subscribe to a weekly report, 
        you can unsubscribe at any time by visiting this Web site.</p>
      <p><b>2. How is Collected Information Used?</b><br>
        We use the personal information you supply to provide you with valuable 
        information that is relevant to your professional interests. The information 
        you receive via e-mail in our weekly reports is customized according to 
        what you tell us about your top business priorities. Based on information you 
        share with us, we will also send you updates about white papers, research, 
        training materials, templates and software tools available to our members. 
        Many of these resources are free, and some are offered at special discounts 
        for IT Business Edge subscribers.</p>

      <div><b>3. Protecting Your Information</b><br>
        IT Business Edge never shares the personal information you provide us with anyone without 
        your permission. For example, some free content available to our subscribers, 
        such as white papers and research reports, requires that you share specific 
        personal information with the publisher or sponsor of that content. In 
        such instances, you are notified before you download or view the content 
        of the personal information required and of exactly who will receive 
        it. The specified third party will receive the personal information you specify at the time of the download as well as the name of the content you downloaded at that time, and may receive information regarding similar or related content you downloaded or viewed in the past. Also, some premium products we offer for sale, such as printed books or 
        CD-ROMS, are actually delivered by their publishers. By purchasing such 
        a product, you give us permission to share your address and other required 
        information with the publisher, with whom you begin a separate business 
        relationship. If you elect to receive them, IT Business Edge will also 
        send you special offers of various types from select partners. Each offer 
        is screened by the IT Business Edge staff to ensure its relevance and 
        is physically sent by us, not by the offering partner. The only way the 
        partner will receive any of your information is if you provide it while 
        responding to the offer. Finally, by subscribing to IT Business Edge you 
        implicitly give us permission to share your information with vendors who 
        are essential in the delivery of services and features included in your 
        subscription. For example, our Web-hosting and e-mail delivery vendors 
        may need to store your information on their servers while helping us send 
        you your weekly reports. However, these essential vendors will use your 
        personal information only as needed to deliver products and services which 
        you have requested or purchased from IT Business Edge.</div>
        <br>
      <p><b>4. Links to Third-Party Web Sites</b><br>
        IT Business Edge weekly reports contain links to third-party Web sites. 
        This privacy statement applies only to the IT Business Edge Web site and 
        information collected by IT Business Edge. It does not apply to any third-party 
        Web sites you access from our weekly reports or our Web site, and we are 
        not responsible for the privacy practices of these sites.</p>
      <p><b>5. Security</b><br>
        IT Business Edge employs several physical, electronic and procedural safeguards 
        to protect the personal information you provide us. Your IT Business Edge 
        account information can only be accessed using the correct password, and 
        the servers holding that information are protected by a firewall. IT Business 
        Edge also uses industry-standard SSL-encryption to ensure your personal 
        information is protected during data transmissions. And for the purpose 
        of business operations, access to your information is limited to authorized 
        employees who need it to perform their jobs or to provide you with requested 
        services and products.</p>
      <div><b>6. Cookies</b><br>
        A cookie is a small piece of computer code that lets Web servers "identify" 
        visitors. Each time you initiate a session on the IT Business Edge site, 
        our server uses a cookie to identify you as a subscriber and provide you 
        with appropriate access privileges. These cookies do not store any of 
        the personal information you have provided through the site; they are 
        simply identifiers. Most browsers automatically accept cookies, but you 
        can usually refuse cookies, or selectively accept cookies, by adjusting 
        the preferences in your browser. However, if you turn cookies off, some 
        features of our site will not be available to you and some Web pages may 
        not display properly. You can find information about how you can adjust 
        the cookie settings for common browsers at the following Web sites: </div>
       <div>Microsoft Internet Explorer – <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/info/cookies.htm" target="_blank">http://www.microsoft.com/info/cookies.htm</a><br>
        Mozilla Firefox – <a href="http://support.mozilla.com/en-US/kb/Options+window#Cookies" target="_blank">http://support.mozilla.com/en-US/kb/Options+window#Cookies</a></div>
        <br>
      <p><b>7. Web Beacons</b><br>
        IT Business Edge may use electronic images known as Web beacons, or clear 
        GIFs, to monitor the use of our Web site and e-mail reports. A Web beacon 
        is a graphic image, often transparent and usually no larger than 1 pixel 
        x 1 pixel, which works in combination with cookies to track usage of a 
        Web page or e-mail containing it. (To learn more about Web beacons, see 
        <a href="http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/W/Web_beacon.html" target="_blank">http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/W/Web_beacon.html</a>).</p>
                  
      <p><b>8. Redirected URLs</b><br>
        IT Business Edge uses redirected URLs to keep track of Web traffic 
        generated by links in our e-mail reports. Redirected URLs route subscribers 
        to Web sites after recording who they are and the links they click. This 
        information helps IT Business Edge further personalize the information 
        we provide subscribers by sending them special reports and exclusive offers 
        related to the topics that are most important to them. All subscribers 
        receive special reports as a benefit of signing up for IT Business Edge, 
        but only those who ask to receive special offers in their subscriber profiles 
        receive this exclusive benefit.</p>
      <p><b>9. Third-Party Advertisers</b><br>
        IT Business Edge does not use third-party advertising companies to provide 
        advertisements or allow third-party advertisers to track your browsing 
        activities on the IT Business Edge Web site at this time.</p>
      <p><b>10. Updating Your Personal Information</b><br>
        You may update your personal information at any time by visiting the IT 
        Business Edge Web site and editing your account profile.</p>
       
      <p><b>11. Policy Changes</b><br>
        If this privacy policy changes in any significant way, a notice will appear 
        on the IT Business Edge Web site and/or you will be notified by e-mail.</p>
      <p><b>12. Personal Information Displayed on the Knowledge Network</b><br>
If you participate in the Knowledge Network professional online community, you may enter specific information that will be visible to other users as part of your public profile, such as your Display Name, Biography and Expertise. In addition, your state and country of residence will be visible to other users of the Knowledge Network, as will links to your recent activities in the community.
