      <p>Protecting your privacy is a priority at IT Business 
        Edge. Please read this privacy policy to learn how we keep your personal 
        information confidential while using it to enhance the information and 
        services we provide you.</p>
      <p><b>1. Registration</b><br>
        When you register with IT Business Edge you supply some personal information, 
        including your e-mail address and other personal information, that is required to initiate your IT Business Edge membership and begin your subscription(s) 
        to IT Business Edge weekly e-mail reports. After you subscribe to a specific weekly report, 
        you can unsubscribe at any time by visiting this Web site. You can also  have yourself removed from all IT Business Edge newsletter and promotional mailing lists at any time by clicking on the appropriate link on the My Account page.</p>
      <p><b>2. How is Collected Information Used?</b><br>
        We use the personal information you supply to provide you with valuable 
        information and offers that are relevant to your professional interests. For example, you select the specific e-mail newsletters  you want to receive based on your individual business priorities. Based on information you 
        share with us about your business, such as its location, industry and size, we will also send you updates about editorial content, white papers, research, 
        training materials, templates and software tools that might meet your needs. 
        Many of these resources are free, and some are offered at special discounts 
        for IT Business Edge subscribers. Some sponsored content, such as white papers, webcasts, product information, and analyst or research reports, are provided at no charge in exchange for your willingness to share information about yourself with the sponsors who make the content available to IT Business Edge members.</p>      </td>

                  <p><b>3. Protecting Your Information</b><br>
  IT Business Edge is committed to protecting your personal information while delivering the high-value information and services you need.. We never share your information with any organization or individual in any manner other than those  stated in this Privacy Policy.   We will share your information only in the following ways. A) When you view or download white papers, research reports, webcasts and other sponsored content, the sponsor and/or provider of that content will receive the contact information you currently have on file for your IT Business Edge membership, along with the title of the content you are viewing or downloading at that time. The sponsor and/or provider of this content  may also receive your answers to specific  questions  asked at the time you access the sponsored content, as well as information regarding similar or related content you downloaded or viewed in the past.   If you do not want to share any information with the sponsors and/or providers of sponsored content, you should avoid viewing any sponsored content. B)  If you elect to receive  e-mail offers from our partners, IT Business Edge will  
                    send you such offers from time to time. Each offer 
                    is screened by the IT Business Edge staff to ensure its relevance and 
                    is delivered by us, not by the offering partner. In these instances, the only way the 
                    partner will receive any of your information is if you provide it while 
                    responding to the offer. You can opt out of receiving e-mail offers from partners at any time by unchecking the appropriate box at the bottom of the My Account page. C) By subscribing to IT Business Edge you 
                     give us permission to share your information with our vendors as required in the delivery of services,  features and offers provided as part of your 
                    membership. For example, our  e-mail delivery vendor 
                    may need to store your information on its servers while helping us send 
                    you weekly e-mail reports, and our charge  processing vendor would need to accept your credit card information in order to process payment for a product  purchased from IT Business Edge. These essential vendors will use your 
                    personal information only as needed to deliver products and services  from IT Business Edge. At all times,  IT Business Edge and the vendors with whom we work will employ industry-leading measures and technologies to protect your personal information.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p><b>4. Links to Third-Party Web Sites</b><br>
        IT Business Edge weekly reports contain links to third-party Web sites. 
        This privacy statement applies only to the IT Business Edge Web site and 
        information collected by IT Business Edge. It does not apply to any third-party 
        Web sites you access from our weekly reports or our Web site, and we are 
        not responsible for the privacy practices of these sites.</p>
      <p><b>5. Security</b><br>
        IT Business Edge employs several physical, electronic and procedural safeguards 
        to protect the personal information you provide us. Your IT Business Edge 
        account information can only be accessed using the correct password, and 
        the servers holding that information are protected by a firewall. IT Business 
        Edge also uses industry-standard SSL-encryption to ensure your personal 
        information is protected during data transmissions. And for the purpose 
        of business operations, access to your information is limited to authorized 
        employees who need it to perform their jobs or to provide you with requested 
        services and products.</p>
      <b>6. Cookies</b><br>
        A cookie is a small piece of computer code that lets Web servers "identify" 
        visitors. Each time you initiate a session on the IT Business Edge site, 
        our server uses a cookie to identify you as a subscriber and provide you 
        with appropriate access privileges. These cookies do not store any of 
        the personal information you have provided through the site; they are 
        simply identifiers. Most browsers automatically accept cookies, but you 
        can usually refuse cookies, or selectively accept cookies, by adjusting 
        the preferences in your browser. However, if you turn cookies off, some 
        features of our site will not be available to you and some Web pages may 
        not display properly. You can find information about how you can adjust 
        the cookie settings for common browsers at the following Web sites:
       <div>Microsoft Internet Explorer – <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/info/cookies.mspx" target="_blank">http://www.microsoft.com/info/cookies.mspx</a><br>
        Mozilla Firefox – <a href="http://support.mozilla.com/en-US/kb/Cookies?bl=n&amp;s=cookies#Cookie_settings" target="_blank">http://support.mozilla.com/en-US/kb/Cookies?bl=n&amp;s=cookies#Cookie_settings</a></div>
        <br>
      <p><b>7. Web Beacons</b><br>
        IT Business Edge may use electronic images known as Web beacons, or clear 
        GIFs, to monitor the use of our Web site and e-mail reports. A Web beacon 
        is a graphic image, often transparent and usually no larger than 1 pixel 
        x 1 pixel, which works in combination with cookies to track usage of a 
        Web page or e-mail containing it. (To learn more about Web beacons, see 
        <a href="http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/W/Web_beacon.html" target="_blank">http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/W/Web_beacon.html</a>).</p>
                  
      <p><b>8. Redirected URLs</b><br>
        IT Business Edge uses redirected URLs to keep track of Web traffic 
        generated by links in our e-mail reports. Redirected URLs route subscribers 
        to Web sites after recording who they are and the links they click. This 
        information helps IT Business Edge further personalize the information 
        we provide subscribers by sending them special reports and exclusive offers 
        related to the topics that are most important to them. All subscribers 
        receive special reports as a benefit of signing up for IT Business Edge, 
        but only those who ask to receive special offers in their subscriber profiles 
        receive this exclusive benefit.</p>
      <p><b>9. Third-Party Advertisers</b><br>
        IT Business Edge does not use third-party advertising companies to provide 
        advertisements or allow third-party advertisers to track your browsing 
        activities on the IT Business Edge Web site at this time.</p>
      <p><b>10. Updating Your Personal Information</b><br>
        You may update your personal information at any time by visiting the IT 
        Business Edge Web site and editing your account profile.</p>
       
      <p><b>11. Policy Changes</b><br>
        If this privacy policy changes in any significant way, a notice will appear 
        on the IT Business Edge Web site and/or you will be notified by e-mail.</p>
      <p><b>12. Personal Information Displayed on the Knowledge Network</b><br>
