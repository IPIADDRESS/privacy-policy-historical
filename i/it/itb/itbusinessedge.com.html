      <p class="CELLsectionbody"><span class="MedBody12ptBOLD">2. How is Collected 
        Information Used?</span><br>
        We use the personal information you supply to provide you with valuable

        IT Business Edge employs several physical, electronic and procedural safeguards 
        to protect the personal information you provide us. Your IT Business Edge 
        account information can only be accessed using the correct password, and

      <p class="CELLsectionbody"><span class="MedBody12ptBOLD">6. Cookies</span><br>
        A cookie is a small piece of computer code that lets Web servers "identify" 
        visitors. Each time you initiate a session on the IT Business Edge site, 
        our server uses a cookie to identify you as a subscriber and provide you 
        with appropriate access privileges. These cookies do not store any of 
        the personal information you have provided through the site; they are 
        simply identifiers. Most browsers automatically accept cookies, but you 
        can usually refuse cookies, or selectively accept cookies, by adjusting 
        the preferences in your browser. However, if you turn cookies off, some 
        features of our site will not be available to you and some Web pages may 
        not display properly. You can find information about how you can adjust 
        the cookie settings for common browsers at the following Web sites: <br>

        IT Business Edge may use electronic images known as Web beacons, or clear 
        GIFs, to monitor the use of our Web site and e-mail reports. A Web beacon 
        is a graphic image, often transparent and usually no larger than 1 pixel 
        x 1 pixel, which works in combination with cookies to track usage of a 
        Web page or e-mail containing it. (To learn more about Web beacons, see

      <p class="CELLsectionbody"><span class="MedBody12ptBOLD">8. Redirected URLs<br>
        </span>IT Business Edge uses redirected URLs to keep track of Web traffic 
        generated by links in our e-mail reports. Redirected URLs route subscribers 
        to Web sites after recording who they are and the links they click. This 
        information helps IT Business Edge further personalize the information 
        we provide subscribers by sending them special reports and exclusive offers 
        related to the topics that are most important to them. All subscribers 
        receive special reports as a benefit of signing up for IT Business Edge,

        receive this exclusive benefit.</p>
