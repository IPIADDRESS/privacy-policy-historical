              <br>

Most of the Online Community   Services are offered for free but you need a Universal mandatory registration to   surf ‘itimes' in detail. The information about the user as collected by TIL is:   (a) information supplied by users and (b) information automatically tracked   while navigation (Information). <br>
              <br>
              To avail certain sites / services on our   websites, users are required to provide certain information for the registration   process namely:- a) your name, b) email address, c) sex, d) age, e) PIN code   etc., and / or your occupation, interests, and the like. (All required   information is Service Dependent). The Information as supplied by the users   enables us to improve our sites and provide you the most user-friendly   experience. <br>
              <br>
              To improve the responsiveness of the sites for our users, we   may use "cookies", or similar electronic tools to collect information to assign   each visitor a unique, random number as a User Identification (User ID) to   understand the user's individual interests using the Identified Computer. Unless   you voluntarily identify yourself (through registration, for example), we will   have no way of knowing who you are, even if we assign a cookie to your computer.   The only personal information a cookie can contain is information you supply. A   cookie cannot read data off your hard drive. Our advertisers may also assign   their own cookies to your browser (if you click on their ads), a process that we   do not control. <br>
              <br>
              Our web servers automatically collect limited   information about your computer's connection to the Internet, including your IP   address, when you visit our site. (Your IP address is a number that lets   computers attached to the Internet know where to send you data -- such as the   web pages you view.) Your IP address does not identify you personally. We use   this information to deliver our web pages to you upon request, to tailor our   site to the interests of our users, to measure traffic within our site and let   advertisers know the geographic locations from where our visitors come. <br>
              <br>
              TIL includes links to other websites. Such sites are governed by their   respective privacy policies, which are beyond our control. Once you leave our   servers (you can tell where you are by checking the URL in the location bar on   your browser), use of any information you provide is governed by the privacy   policy of the operator of the site you are visiting. That policy may differ from   ours. If you can't find the privacy policy of any of these sites via a link from   the site's homepage, you should contact the site directly for more information. <br>
              <br>
              When we present information to our advertisers -- to help them   understand our audience and confirm the value of advertising on our website --   it is usually in the form of aggregated statistics on traffic to various pages   within our site. When you register with TIL, we contact you from time to time   about updation of your content to provide the users such features that we   believe may benefit you. <br>
              <br>
              All information gathered on TIL is securely   stored within the TIL controlled database. The database is stored on servers   secured behind a firewall; access to the servers is password-protected and is   strictly limited. However, as effective as our security measures are, no   security system is impenetrable. We cannot guarantee the security of our   database, nor can we guarantee that information you supply will not be   intercepted while being transmitted to us over the Internet. And, of course, any   information you include in a posting to the discussion areas is available to   anyone with Internet access. <br>
              <br>
              However the internet is an ever evolving   medium. We may change our privacy policy from time to time to incorporate   necessary future changes. Of course, our use of any information we gather will   always be consistent with the policy under which the information was collected,   regardless of what the new policy may be. <br>
