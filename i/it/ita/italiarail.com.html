                                    <p><strong>Personal Information</strong><br>
  At various locations on our websites, such as in our order forms (and potentially
    surveys and polls), we may request that you supply us with "personal
    information," such as your name, email address, mailing and shipping
    addresses, home or work telephone number, and/or credit card information.
    You will always know when we are collecting personal information, because
    we only collect personal information when you voluntarily submit it to us
    through our online forms and questionnaires. Although you do not have to
    provide us with any information to visit our websites, you may not be able
    to fully utilize all of the services on our websites if you choose not to
    provide certain information. If you do choose to give us personal information
    through our websites, we will collect and retain that information.</p>
                                    <p><strong>Non-Personal Information</strong><br>
  When you use our websites, we may also collect "non-personal information," which
  is information that, by itself, cannot be used to identify or contact you,
  such as demographic information (your age, gender, income, education, profession,
  zip code, etc.). Non-personal information may also include technical information,
  such as your IP address, the type of browser you are using, the websites you
  visit immediately before and immediately after you visit our websites, and
  other anonymous data involving your use of our websites. Non-personal information
  may also include information that you provide us through your use of our website.</p>
                                    <p><strong>Online Orders</strong><br>
  We collect personal information from you when you purchase products from our
    online order process. For example, we require you to provide your name, contact
    information, shipping and billing addresses, and a credit card number before
    we process your orders. We also collect information about your transactions
    with us. We may use the information that you provide to communicate with
    you about products purchased through our online service, to provide customer
    support in connection with those products.</p>
                                    <p><strong>Cookies</strong><br>
  We use "cookies" to enhance your visits to our websites. A cookie
  is a small amount of data that is sent to your browser from a web server and
  stored on your computer's hard drive. Cookies do not store personal information
  about you, unless you knowingly provide it. Cookies can store non-personal
  information, such as what websites, or pages your browser has accessed. We
  use cookies to store information and personalize your experience with our websites.
  For example, cookies allow our websites to recognize your browser as a previous
  visitor, and thus save and remember any preferences that may have been set
  while you were previously browsing our websites. Our cookies can also store
  information you have placed in a "shopping cart." <br>
  You do have control over cookies. Most browsers can be set to notify you when
  a cookie is being placed on your computer. Most browsers can also be set to
  refuse to accept cookies, although this may affect your Internet experience.
  You can also erase cookies that are already on your computer. For more information
  about working with cookies, you should consult your user manual, FAQ, or "help" function
  of your specific browser and operating system software.</p>

                                    <p><strong>Our Services and Websites</strong><br>
  We use your personal information to provide you any services that you may request
    or require, to communicate with you, to allow you to make purchases. We use
    aggregated non-personal information about our users to understand our website's
    demographics, such as the geographic distribution of our users, the age ranges
    of our users, or a combination of these or other demographics. We use the
    non-personal information we collect to analyze how our websites are being
    used, and to improve the content of our websites, online product offerings,
    and promotional efforts.</p>
                                    <p><strong>Email Communications</strong><br>
  If you send us an email with questions or comments, we may use your personal
    information to respond to your questions or comments, and we may save your
    questions or comments for future reference. However, aside from our reply
    to such an email, it is not our standard practice to send you email unless
    you request a particular service that involves email communications or in
    order to provide customer support in connection with those products. There
    may be times when you will have the opportunity to subscribe to an email
    list or electronic newsletter that will send information about our websites
    to your email address. However, we will provide you with the option to change
    your preferences and opt-out of receiving those communications.</p>
                                    <p><strong>Online Service</strong><br>
  If you make a purchase through our online ordering service, we may use the
    information you provide to send you important announcements and updates regarding
    our website or online service. In those instances, we will provide you with
    the option to change your preferences and opt-out of receiving those communications.</p>
                                    <p>When you provide us with your personal

                                      our online ordering, we only use this information
                                      to process your online order and credit
                                      card number. We also use your address and
                                      billing information to bill you and provide
                                      associated support.</p>

                                      and our statistical analyses to third parties.
                                      This aggregate information does not include

    websites.</p>
                                    <p><strong>Service Providers</strong><br>
  We sometimes engage unaffiliated businesses to assist us in providing you certain
    services. For example, we may hire a shipping company to help us deliver
    our products or services to you. We may also use third parties to process
    online transactions and credit card payments In those instances, we may need
    to share your personal information with them. We require these companies
    to use your personal information only to provide the particular product or
    service and do not authorize them to use your personal information for any
    other reason.</p>
                                    <p><strong>Other Disclosures</strong><br>
  We may disclose personal information when we are required or requested to do
    so by law, court order or other government or law enforcement authority or
    regulatory agency; to enforce or apply our rights and agreements; or when
    we believe in good faith that disclosing this information is necessary or
    advisable, including, for example, to protect the rights, property, or safety
    of ItaliaRail.com, our users, or others. This includes exchanging information
    with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk
    reduction.</p>

                                    <p>The security of your personal information
                                      is important to us. We maintain physical,

                                      secure your personal information. However, "perfect
                                      security" does not exist on the Internet,
                                      and there is always some risk in transmitting
                                      information electronically. This website
                                      takes every precaution to protect our users’ information.

                                      as credit card number), that information
