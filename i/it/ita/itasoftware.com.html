        statement discloses the privacy practices for our Web site <a href="http://www.itasoftware.com">www.itasoftware.com</a>. 
        If you have questions or concerns regarding this statement, you should

      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Overview</b></font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">ITA Software 
        respects your privacy. The purpose of this section of our Web site is 
        to inform you of our privacy policies and practices. In this policy you 
        will find out what information we collect (both information that we ask 
        you for and information that we collect automatically), what we will and 
        will not use it for, what steps you can take to correct or update information, 
        safeguards we employ to protect confidential information, and your ability 
        to "opt-out" of certain collection policies and practices.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>The Information 
        We Collect</b></font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>Information 
        we ask you for:</i> If you use our site only to search for fares, but 
        not for purchasing tickets, we will ask you if you wish to create a user 
        name and password or to log in as a "guest". (You do not need 
        to create a user name or password in order to use our site.) If you log 
        in as a "guest", no information will be collected other than 
        your domain name and/or IP address (discussed below). If you create a 
        user name and password - which does not require you to give us your email 
        address - we will also give you the option to create a "user profile". 
        This profile, which is entirely optional, contains your mailing and email 
        addresses and fax, and also allows you to specify a seat preference to 
        be used in searching. (We may expand the scope of the user profile to 
        allow you to include more information that may assist you in searching 
        and/or booking, such as a default origin airport or a preferred carrier, 
        demographic information or frequent flyer numbers.) We do not gather this 
        more personal information without your knowledge and active permission 
        and participation.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">If you use 
        our site for purchasing tickets, we will also ask you for credit card 
        information (including billing address and other information required 
        to process your credit card transaction). </font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>Information 
        we collect automatically:</i> When you log on to our Web site, either 
        with a password or as a guest, we will log your domain name and/or Internet 
        Provider (IP) address for systems administration purposes. We do not link 
        domain names or IP addresses to anything personally identifiable. This 
        means that a user's session will be tracked, but the user will be anonymous. 
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Our system 
        will also automatically record the searches that you perform. We collect 
        aggregate information site-wide on the searches done at our site, so as 
        to be able to make our software operate more efficiently.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We will also 
        place a "cookie" in your browser (discussed below). If for some 
        reason you would rather not take advantage of the benefits made possible 
        with cookies, most browsers allow you to reject cookies or to choose which 
        cookies to accept. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Use of 
        Information</b></font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">ITA Software 
        uses non-personal aggregate, or summary, information regarding the use 
        made of our site (i.e., what searches are being performed most frequently 
        or at what times) in order to improve the performance of its software. 
        If you give us information in your user profile, we may use this information 
        in an aggregated or summary fashion - such as to determine whether our 
        users are concentrated in certain geographical areas, or whether a large 
        number of new users at one time may be related to a article about us in 
        a local newspaper. We may also share this non-personal aggregated information 
        with partners or other third parties, or we may combine it with data from 
        third parties (such as airline industry information about airport use), 
        to improve the quality or efficiency of our products. No such combining 
        will be done for marketing purposes. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We may use 
        the user profile information at an individual user level to contact you 
        ourselves (for example, to inform you about a security concern relating 
        to our Web site), to improve the booking process for you (for example, 
        by automatically including your frequent flyer number in booking records) 
        or to tailor the site to suit your preferences. We do not sell individual 
        user names, email addresses or other individual user information to third 
        parties and will not so in the future. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">If you purchase 
        a ticket from us and give us additional information, including credit 
        card information, we will pass this information along to the entity (currently 
        Worldspan) through which we process booking. We do not retain this credit 
        card information and will not use it for any purpose without your consent. 
        We will use your email address to confirm reservations and purchases of 
        tickets. We will use the email address, as well as other contact information 
        if appropriate, for customer service if necessary.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We use IP 
        addresses to analyze trends, administer our Web site, track user's movement, 
        and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses 
        are not linked to personally identifiable information. Additionally, for 
        systems administration, detecting usage patterns and troubleshooting purposes, 
        our Web servers automatically log standard access information including 
        browser type, access times/open mail. While information like this may 
        be shared with third parties in aggregate form, individually identifiable 
        information related to this data will never be shared with third parties 
        without your explicit permission. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In addition 
        to the circumstances described above, we may disclose individual user 
        information if required by law or court order, if requested by a government 
        or law enforcement authority, or if we believe in good faith belief that 
        disclosure is otherwise necessary or advisable (such as, for example, 
        if we reasonably believe that disclosure of the information is necessary 
        to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be 
        causing interference with our business or our intellectual property rights, 
        intentionally or otherwise, or if we believe a third party could be harmed).</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Cookies</b></font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A cookie 
        is a small data file that certain Web sites write to your hard drive when 
        you visit them. A cookie cannot read data off your hard disk or read cookie 
        files created by other sites. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Cookies are 
        files that your Web browser places on your computer's hard drive. A cookie 
        file can contain information such as a user ID that the site uses to track 
        the pages you've visited. ITA Software creates and then uses these cookie 
        files to track your clicks as you go through the ITA Software Web site. 
        Cookies can also be used to tell us whether you have visited our site 
        previously, and to help to save and retrieve passwords used on the site 
        and other preferences, saving you from having to re-enter this information 
        upon every visit to the Web site. Cookies cannot be used by ITA Software 
        to retrieve any personal information about you unless you have previously 
        purchased from or registered with ITA Software. ITA Software does not 
        and cannot use cookies to retrieve personal information about you from 
        your computer unless such information was knowingly and willingly provided 
        by you. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">You can refuse 
        cookies by turning them off in your browser. You do not need to have cookies 
        turned on to use the ITA Software site.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Links</b></font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Our Web site 
        may contain links to other sites. Please be aware that ITA Software has 
        no control over and is not responsible for the privacy practices of such 
        other sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site 
        and to read the privacy statements of each and every Web site that collects 
        personally identifiable information. This privacy statement applies solely 
        to information collected by our Web site. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Correcting/Updating 
        Personal Information</b></font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">If your personally 
        identifiable information (such as your email address) changes, or if you 
        no longer wish us to have this information on file, we will endeavor to 
        provide a way to correct, update or remove your personal data provided 
        to us. This can usually be done by editing your user profile at the site. 
        You can also send us e-mail at comments@itasoftware.com.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">E-mail Links</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We use e-mail 
        links located on the "contact us" page to allow you to contact 
        us directly with any questions or comments you may have. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We read every 
        message sent in and try to reply promptly to every one. This information 
        is used to respond directly to your questions or comments. We may also 
        file your comments to improve the site and program, or review and discard 
        the information. Your personal information is never shared with an outside 
        party. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Safeguards</b></font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">If you use 
        our software to purchase a ticket from the ITA Software web site, and 
        you provide us with credit card information in order to process your transaction, 
        this information will be transmitted using SSL (Secure Socket Layer) encryption. 
        SSL is a proven coding system that lets your browser automatically encrypt 
        data before you send it to us. When you are on a secure page, such as 
        our credit card information page, the lock icon on the bottom of Web browsers 
        such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, 
        as opposed to un-locked, or open, when you are just 'surfing'. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Currently, 
        other information that you may give us, such as user profile information, 
        is not transmitted using any encryption technology.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Choice/Opt-out</b></font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Because ITA 
        Software does not use any information collected at our site for purposes 
        not directly related to our site, we do not give our users the 
        opportunity to 'opt-out' of having their information used. The only personal 
        information retained by ITA Software is the user profile of any user who 
        chooses to create one. If you create a user profile at our site and subsequently 
        decide that you do not want us to have any of the information contained 
        in your profile, you can effectively 'opt-out' by editing the profile 
        and deleting the information. Since we do not retain historical information 
        about user profiles, deleting your profile information will have the effect 
        of 'opting-out' of any use of your personal information.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Notice 
        of Changes</b></font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We will take 
        commercially reasonable measures to obtain written or active e-mail consent 
        from you if ITA Software is going to be using information collected from 
        you in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection. 
        We will also post the changes in our privacy statement 30 days prior to 
        a change. </font></p>
