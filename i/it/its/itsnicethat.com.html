<p>We use…<br>
The information below explains what cookies we use on It’s Nice That, why we use them and where they come from. We also state in the table whether a cookie is a “persistent” or “session” cookie. The difference is that:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Persistent cookies remain on your device between browsing sessions. They are activated each time you visit the website that created that particular cookie. For example, where a “persistent cookie” is used on a website to remember your log-in details, you will not need to enter those details each time you visit that website.</li>
	<li>Session cookies allow website operators to link the actions of a user during a browser session. A browser session starts when you open the browser window and finishes when you close the browser window. Session cookies are created temporarily. Once you close the browser, all session cookies are deleted.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some of the cookies listed below are those set by It’s Nice That. However, we also have cookies on It’s Nice That that are set by third parties.
