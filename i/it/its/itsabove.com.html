<br>
CHILDREN'S PRIVACY<br>
<br>
Some portions of the Itsabove.com Web site may be used by children under the age 
of 13. Itsabove.com is strongly committed to protecting the safety and privacy 
of children who visit our Web site.<br>
<br>
Itsabove.com has a system in place to effectively screen its users to ensure 
compliance with this Privacy Policy and the Children's Online Privacy Protection 
Act of 1998 (COPPA). COPPA and its accompanying regulations establish United 
States federal law that protects the privacy of children using the Internet.<br>
<br>
Our site and services may collect information Itsabove.com children under 13, 
including e-mail forum participation and chat rooms. Use of such activities 
requires initial registration by the participant. Children under 13 who wish to 
register are asked to have a parent or legal guardian do so for them. The parent 
must provide a credit card number for verification that he/she is an adult. Upon 
verification, the parent can choose in which activities he or she would like the 
child to participate. Parents can change the selected activities at any time.<br>
<br>
Only after verifying age in accordance with Federal standards, do we collect and 
maintain the name, date of birth and email address of children who register. 
With proper proof of identification (including name and credit card 
verification), parents can review their child's personal information, ask to 
have it deleted and refuse to allow any further collection or use of their 
child's information.<br>
<br>
We use cookies to check the age of registered users who enter chat rooms. We do 
not knowingly permit users under 13 into chat rooms unless their parents have 
consented to their participation.<br>
<br>
Itsabove.com.com includes many topical areas that all users may access. When a 
parent provides verifiable consent to allow his or her child to use chat and 
forums and to receive newsletters or other materials where a child may provide 
personally identifiable information, the child will also have access to those 
relevant services throughout the Itsabove.com site, including areas that may not 
be directed toward children. In particular, if you allow your child to 
participate in chat or forums, your child will have access to all chat and forum 
areas on Itsabove.com.com. Many chat areas are not monitored and private chat is 
permitted. Chat areas may contain information or language unsuitable for young 
children and visitors of all ages may participate. If you authorize your child 
to participate in these features, we encourage you to monitor their use closely. 
We also allow guests to participate in chat and forum areas at Itsabove.com.com 
but use techniques to prevent unregistered children under 13 from participating 
in areas unsuitable for them. Parents can change these options at any time.<br>
<br>
Except as authorized under COPPA, Itsabove.com.com will NOT:<br>
<br>
collect online contact information from a user under 13 without prior verifiable 
parental consent, which includes an opportunity for the parent to prevent use of 
the information and participation in the activity. When we do not obtain prior 
verifiable parental consent, online contact information will be used only to 
directly respond to the child's request and will not be used to contact the 
child for other purposes.<br>
collect personally identifiable offline contact information from users under 13 
without prior verifiable parental consent.<br>
distribute to third parties any personally identifiable information collected 
from children known to be under 13.<br>
give the ability to children to participate in forums or chat rooms without 
prior verifiable parental consent.<br>
entice a child under 13 by the prospect of a special game, prize or other 
activity, to divulge more information than is needed to participate in such 
activity.<br>
We will also place prominent notice wherever personally identifiable information 
is collected requesting the child to ask a parent for permission to proceed.<br>
<br>
CHANGES IN CORPORATE STRUCTURE<br>
<br>
In developing our business, we might sell certain assets or the company, or 
parts of it, may be sold, merged or otherwise transferred. In such transactions, 
user information, whether personally identifiable or otherwise, may be one of 
the transferred assets.<br>
<br>

Our Web site and the servers that make this site available worldwide are located 
in the United States. All matters relating to these sites are governed by the 
laws of the State of Georgia&nbsp; in the United States. Any information you 
provide will be transferred to the United States. By visiting our sites and 
submitting information, you authorize this transfer.<br>
<br>
CHANGES TO OUR PRIVACY POLICY<br>
<br>

highest protection for our users and to comply with a changing environment. We 
recommend that you check the policy when you visit our site to be sure you are 
aware of and understand our current policy. If we make material changes to this
