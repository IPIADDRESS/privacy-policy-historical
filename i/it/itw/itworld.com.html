<p><strong>Ad Serving Technology</strong> </p>
<p>ITworld.com has contracted with DoubleClick to serve all advertising on http://www.itworld.com, both on the Web site and through our email newsletters. When DoubleClick serves ads to the user, it uses cookies to track certain types of non-personally identifiable information: for example, a user's IP address, browser version or type, operating system, service provider, and local time. In addition, ITworld.com uses clear GIFs, or pixel tags, provided by DoubleClick to allow the browser's cookie to be recognized when the browser visits ITworld.com.</p>
<p>Information collected and shared through this technology is not personally identifiable (i.e., it does not include your name, address, telephone number, or email address). DoubleClick does share non-personally identifiable information, such as user profiles based on clickstream profile data, with ITworld.com, but strictly in aggregate form.</p> 
<p>For more details about the information DoubleClick collects and the opportunity to opt out of such data collection, please visit: <a href="http://www.doubleclick.net/privacy_policy/">www.doubleclick.net/privacy_policy/</a>.</p>

<p><strong>IP Addresses</strong></p> 
<p>Our Web server automatically records a visitor's domain and IP address. We use the IP address to identify server problems and administer our Web site, and to analyze click-stream data to better understand user behavior.</p>
<p><strong>What are cookies and how does ITworld.com use them?</strong> </p>
<p>Cookies are small files containing information that a Web site uses to track a visit. Both persistent and session cookies are used by ITworld.com. A persistent cookie remains on the user's hard drive for authentication purposes, while a session cookie is temporary and is only used to complete a registration process. (Please refer to your browser's Help function for further information on controlling and setting cookies.) ITworld.com requires session cookies to complete any registration processes we host.</p> 
<p>ITworld.com uses persistent cookies to link visitors to registration information that allows the system to confirm a user's identity and access level on the site. ITworld.com also uses that information to track service selections, deliver specific content, and save passwords to eliminate logging in each time a user visits the site. A password is encrypted within the persistent cookie and cannot be accessed by outside parties. A visitor may choose to reject a persistent cookie and use their login password each time they visit and/or select a service that requires authentication. Not all areas of our site require authentication.</p> 
<p>We use an outside serving company, DoubleClick, to display ads on our site. Those ads may contain cookies. While we use cookies in other parts of our Web site, cookies received with banner ads are collected by DoubleClick and are not accessible to ITworld.com.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>What information does ITworld.com collect?</strong> </p>

<p>ITworld.com collects optional data supplied by visitors through registration, surveys, sweepstakes, and contests, as well as information gathered from visitors via our server log. That information lets us better tailor our content to user interests and help our advertisers better understand the audience they are reaching. Our site is completely free and is supported by paid advertisements and sponsorships. Therefore, it is critical that we identify our audience. We are firmly committed to identifying whether site content is created by an editorial contributor, a user, or a vendor. </p>
<p><strong>How is our registration data used?</strong></p>
<p>ITworld.com offers optional services that require registration. ITworld.com provides some of those services directly; others are provided on behalf of vendor companies or by ITworld.com's partners.
Customer contact information that is collected on behalf of ITworld.com is used to send relevant information about our company and promotional material from some of our partners. This information is sent only to users who opt to receive it and is delivered by ITworld.com. In addition, users may opt out of receiving future mailings. (See the choice/opt-out section below.) </p>
<p>Personal information is also used to contact users for the administration of prizes and rewards or to respond to customer service requests. This data also enables ITworld.com to tailor visitors' experiences -- to show them content they might be interested in and display it according to their preferences. Unique identifiers, such as passwords, are collected to verify the user's identity and for use as account numbers in our database.</p>
<p>Information shared with or collected at partner sites is used to provide those services to users. Partner sites may only communicate with ITworld.com customers about services that the customers select. For example, if a customer requests to be notified when information on a selected topic becomes available, the partner site may contact them. However, customers always have the option to discontinue services. </p>
<p>ITworld.com also acts as a service provider to produce and host vendor webcasts and white papers for various companies. These services are clearly labeled as "vendor," and all data collected during these registrations belongs to those clients. The specific data collected is determined by that client, and varies from program to program. This data is governed by the individual vendor's privacy policy, and may be used by the vendor for follow-up purposes.</p>
<p>The following outlines each area of the ITworld.com site where data is collected:</p>

The permission obtained during the registration process applies only to ITworld.com's use of this data. </p><p>

If, however, we are going to use users' personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection we will take reasonable steps to notify users by email. Users will have a choice as to whether or not we use their information in this different manner. However, if users have opted out of all communication with the site, or deleted/deactivated their account, then they will not be contacted, nor will their personal information be used in this new manner.</p>
