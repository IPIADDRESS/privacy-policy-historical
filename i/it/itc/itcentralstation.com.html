<p>This Privacy and Cookie Policy was last updated on November 11, 2016.</p>

<p>IT Central Station Ltd. (“IT Central Station”, “we”, or “us”) takes the privacy and protection of personal
  information very seriously. By visiting our Site, registering as a Member, or using the Services, you acknowledge
  and accept the practices and policies outlined in this privacy and cookie policy (“Privacy Policy”). Unless otherwise defined
  herein, capitalized terms shall have the meanings assigned to such terms in the IT Central Station Terms of Use,
  which can be found <a href="tos">here</a> and which incorporate this Privacy Policy by reference.
  This Privacy Policy describes IT Central Station's practices with respect to Personal Information that we collect
  when you use the Services.
</p>

<p>“Personal Information” is information that is personally identifiable such as names, addresses, e-mail addresses,
  or phone numbers, as well as other non-public information that is associated with the foregoing. We collect and use
  Personal Information as described in this Privacy Policy from the Users of our Services.
</p>

<p>BY USING THE SERVICES OR SUBMITTING PERSONAL INFORMATION THROUGH THE SERVICES, YOU EXPRESSLY CONSENT TO THE
  PROCESSING AND USE OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION ACCORDING TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY.
</p>

<p>YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION MAY BE PROCESSED IN THE COUNTRY WHERE IT WAS COLLECTED AS WELL AS OTHER COUNTRIES
  (INCLUDING THE UNITED STATES) WHERE LAWS REGARDING PROCESSING OF PERSONAL INFORMATION MAY BE LESS STRINGENT THAN
  THE LAWS IN YOUR COUNTRY.
</p>

<p class="section-title"><b>Personal Information We Collect</b></p>

<p>We collect the following Personal Information that you submit to us voluntarily.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Depending on how you interact with IT Central Station, the personal information we collect from you
  may vary. For example, to create an account we may ask only for a company email address. In other circumstances, such
  as when you complete a form related to a particular service offering, we may ask you to provide other information,
  which may include your name, phone number, job title, and/or employer name.
  After registering you may provide us with additional information about your employment and professional experience.
  If you register with our LinkedIn™ log-in mechanism, we may collect the information as indicated in the LinkedIn log-in screen
  during the registration process and as detailed in this privacy policy.

</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">When you contribute posts and reviews, participate in our surveys (either directly, or through
  third party service providers), or provide any other Content to the Services through other means, we will collect
  all the information you provide. If you exchange messages with others through the Site, we may store these messages
  in order to deliver them and allow you to manage them.
</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">In connection with reviews, posts, and surveys, IT Central Station (and/or its third party service
  providers) may collect a wide variety of product- and vendor-related information on an optional basis.
  Please be aware that while some pieces of information that you provide to us would not be sufficient to identify you
  when seen by another User without any context, the combination of different pieces of information that you have
  provided for viewing by other Users, or any contextual information, may allow other Users to identify you.
</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">When you contact us by sending us an e-mail or when you use any of our contact forms,
  we will collect any information that is contained in (and/or attached to) your e-mail or text message, or that you
  enter into such forms.
</p>

<p class="section-title"><b>Personal Information Collected Via Technology</b></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">When you use IT Central Station, your device is automatically providing information to us so we can
  respond and customize our response to you. The type of information we collect by automated means may vary, but
  generally includes technical information about your computer, such as your IP address or other device identifier.
  The information we collect also may include usage information and statistics about your interaction with IT Central
  Station. That information may include the URLs of our web pages that you visited, URLs of referring and exiting pages,
  page views, time spent on a page, number of clicks, platform type, location data, and other information about how you
  used IT Central Station. We do not currently respond to 'do not track' signals and similar settings or mechanisms.
  When you use IT Central Station, we try to provide a customized experience.

</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">
  Automated means of data collection include the following:
</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">
  <b>Web Browser.</b> When you visit an IT Central Station website, your browser automatically sends us your Internet
  protocol ("IP") address so that the web pages you request can be sent to your computer or device. We use your IP
  address to determine additional information, such as your company name, whether the computer or device has ever been used to visit IT
  Central Station before, which IT Central Station features were used the most often, and how much time was spent on a
  page.
</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">
  <b>Web Beacons and Log Files.</b> We use "web beacons" (also known as Internet tags, pixel tags, tracking pixels,
  and clear GIFs) on our websites. These web beacons allow us and third parties to collect information such as the IP
  address of the device, the URL of the web page, the time the page was viewed, the type of browser used, and any
  additional information in cookies that may have been set by the third party. The information is typically collected
  in log files, which generally track traffic on our websites. The information is used for analytical purposes and to
  manage technical issues that may arise. We do not attempt to identify individual users through this information.
</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">
  <b>Location Data. </b> If you access IT Central Station using a mobile device, we will collect your physical location
  if you have enabled this feature. Even if you are not using a mobile device, information about your general location
  may be discernable from your device's IP address or the URLs we receive.
</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">
  <b>Cookies.</b> We also collect information using cookies to help us identify you when you visit IT Central Station
  and we may share cookies with third-party advertisers or advertising networks to serve you relevant, targeted ads.
  For more information on cookies and similar tracking mechanisms, how we use them, and how you can control them,
  please see the section below entitled&nbsp;Cookie Policy and Ad Choices.
</p>
<p class="section-title"><b>Cookie Policy and Ad Choices</b></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">IT Central Station stores a small text file called a “Cookie” on your computer to store your
  login information (if any) and your personal preferences for the Services. IT Central Station may use both session
  Cookies (which expire once you close your web browser) and persistent Cookies (which stay on your computer until you
  delete them). While you will still be able to use the Services if you disable Cookies in your browser, certain parts
  of the Services may not function as effectively. After you register and enable Cookies, we may associate this
  information with Personal Information that we have collected from you.
</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">
  We work with third parties, such as Google Analytics and Facebook, to provide analytics services that may use the
  Cookies set on your device to serve advertisements, measure the performance of advertising, and track traffic to IT
  Central Station generally. In addition, we have implemented&nbsp;<a href="https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/2799357?hl=en">
  Google Analytics Demographics and Interest Reporting</a>,
  which categorizes cookie information so that we and third-party service providers may better deliver content and/or
  advertisements that are relevant and useful to you on IT Central Station and various websites across the internet.
  You may opt out of tracking by Google Analytics and Google Analytics Demographics and Interest Reporting services
  by visiting&nbsp;<a href="https://www.google.com/settings/u/0/ads/authenticated">Google Ads Settings</a>&nbsp;or by downloading
  the&nbsp;<a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout">Google Analytics Opt-Out Browser Add-on</a>. If you do not want
  Facebook to use information based on your IT Central Station activity for the purpose of showing you ads, you may opt
  out <a href="https://www.facebook.com/help/568137493302217">here</a>.
</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">
  You may also be able to disable placement of some (but not all) Cookies by setting your browser to decline cookies,
  though this may worsen your user experience. If you delete your browser cookies, your opt-out cookie will also be
  deleted. Additionally, if you change computers or web browsers, you will need to opt out again. A useful resource for
  information about deleting and controlling cookies can be found at&nbsp;<a href="http://www.aboutcookies.org/">
  AboutCookies.org.</a>
</p>

<p class="section-title"><b>Use of Information We Collect</b></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">In general, information (including Personal Information) you submit to us, or to third parties
  that support us in collecting information, as well as information we collect about you via technology,
  is used by us to provide you and other Users with the Services, to
  respond to requests that you make, to improve our Services, and to operate, maintain, and improve the features,
  functionality, performance, and support of the Services.
</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">We may also use your Personal Information to provide you with notifications related to your use of
  the Services, such as electronic newsletters or promotional e-mails.
</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">We use cookies and log file information to (a) collect or store personal information,
  (b) to provide custom, personalized content and information; (c) to monitor the use of our Site;
  (d) to monitor aggregate metrics such as total number of visitors; and (e) to track your use of our Site; and
  (f) to customize advertisements on our Site and retargeting advertisements on 3<sup>rd</sup> party websites.
</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">In order to use certain services on our Site, such as downloading reports, you may be asked to
  provide Personal Information (e.g. your name, email address, employer name, or phone number).
  We may share your information, browsing behavior, and information we collect about you
  with a limited number of our advertisers and partners.
  The webpage will state the maximum number of 3<sup>rd</sup> parties (typically 1-3) with which your information will be shared.
</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">
  In addition, we may share with our advertisers your company size and employer name.
  However, we will not share with our advertisers your name, email address, phone number, or job title without your consent.
</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">If you choose to use our service to tell a friend about our site, we will ask you for your friend's email address.
  We will automatically send your friend a one-time email inviting him or her to visit the site.
  We store this information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email and ensuring multiple invitations are not sent.
  Your friend may contact us at <a href="mailto:info@itcentralstation.com">info@itcentralstation.com</a> to request that we remove this information from our database.
</p>

<p class="section-title"><b>Public Postings</b></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">One of the purposes of the Services is for Members to share product- and vendor-related information
  with other Users. Therefore, you should assume that any information that you post including any Personal Information
  you may choose to provide (but excluding your email address and phone number) will be made available to other Users
  of the Services. If you post Content on our site (e.g. product review, question, answer), it may be made available
  on 3<sup>rd</sup> party websites and included within materials distributed by our partners, but such Content will
  not include your email address, phone number, full name, or employer name. We may provide you with the ability to
  anonymously post certain comments, in which case we will not include your contact information
  (i.e., name, username, email address, or your employer) on the Site in connection with such comments.
  However, you should know that our internal records may associate your contact information with such comments.
</p>

<p class="section-title"><b>Feedback</b></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">If you provide feedback about the Services to us, we may use and disclose such feedback for any
  purpose, provided we do not associate such feedback with your Personal Information. We will collect all information
  contained in such feedback and will treat the Personal Information in it in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
</p>

<p class="section-title"><b>Disclosure of Personal Information</b></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Except as otherwise stated in this Privacy Policy (and in this section in particular),
  we do not disclose to or share your Personal Information (e.g. full name, e-mail address, or phone number)
  with third parties, unless you ask or authorize us to do so.
</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">We may provide your Personal Information to third party service providers and suppliers who work on
  our behalf or with us to provide you with some of the services and features of the Services and to help us communicate
  with our Users. However, these service providers and suppliers do not have any independent right to use this
  information except to help us provide the Services.
</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">We may share some or all of your Personal Information with any parent company, subsidiaries, joint
  ventures, or other companies under common control (collectively, “Affiliates”), in which case we will require our
  Affiliates to honor this Privacy Policy.
</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">In the event IT Central Station goes through a business transition such as a merger, acquisition
  by another company, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, your Personal Information will likely be among the
  assets transferred. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of IT Central Station or
  its assets may continue to use your Personal Information as set forth in this Privacy Policy.
</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">We may (and you authorize us to) disclose information we have collected from and about you
  (including Personal Information) if we believe in good faith that such disclosure is necessary to (a) comply with
  relevant laws or to respond to subpoenas or warrants served on us;
  (b) to enforce our IT Central Station Terms of Use and Privacy Policy;
  or (c) to protect and defend the rights or property of us, the users of our Services, or third parties.
</p>

<p class="section-title"><b>Choices Regarding Personal Information</b></p>

  editing your account information from within My Account.

  communications you will be required to click an "Unsubscribe" link in these emails and confirm the email
  address for which you would like to unsubscribe.
</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">We may send you service-related announcements (such as, but not limited to, notice that you have
  won any of our sweepstakes, or that we have changed our Services or our Terms of Use or Privacy Policy) when we
  believe it is necessary to do so.
