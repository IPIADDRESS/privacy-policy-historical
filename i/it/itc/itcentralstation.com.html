<p>This Privacy and Cookies Policy was last updated on January 20, 2019.</p>

<p class="section-title"><b>I. Overview</b></p>

<p>IT Central Station Ltd. (“<b>IT Central Station</b>”, “<b>we</b>”, “<b>our</b>”, or “<b>us</b>”) takes the privacy and protection of
  personal information seriously. By visiting our Site, registering as a Member, or using the Services, you
  acknowledge and accept the practices and policies outlined in this Privacy and Cookies Policy (the
  “<b>Privacy Policy</b>”). Unless otherwise defined herein, capitalized terms shall have the meanings assigned
  to such terms in the IT Central Station Terms of Use, which can be found <a href="tos">here</a> and which incorporate this
  Privacy Policy by reference. This Privacy Policy describes IT Central Station's practices with respect to
  Personal Information that we collect when you visit our Site or use the Services.
</p>

<p>“<b>Personal Information</b>” is information that is personally identifiable such as names, addresses, e-mail
  addresses, or phone numbers, as well as other non-public information that is associated with the
  foregoing. In some regions, an individuals’ internet protocol address (“<b>IP address</b>”) may be considered
  Personal Information. We collect and use Personal Information as described in this Privacy Policy from
  visitors to our Site and Users of our Services.
</p>

<p>IT Central Station complies with the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework as set forth by the
  U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information
  transferred from the European Union to the United States.  IT Central Station has certified to the
  Department of Commerce that it adheres to the Privacy Shield Principles.
  To learn more about the Privacy Shield program, and to view our certification,
  please visit <a target="_blank" href="https://www.privacyshield.gov/">https://www.privacyshield.gov/</a>
</p>

<p>IT Central Station is subject to the regulatory enforcement powers of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission.
  IT Central Station may be required to disclose personal data in response to lawful requests by public authorities,
  including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.
</p>

<p>IT Central Station is responsible for the processing of personal data it receives,
  under each Privacy Shield Framework, and for the subsequent transfers of such personal data
  to any third party acting as an agent on IT Central Stations’s behalf. IT Central Station will be liable
  under the Privacy Shield Principles if its agent processes such personal information in a manner
  inconsistent with the Privacy Shield Principles, unless IT Central Station proves
  that it is not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.
</p>

<p>Under certain conditions, as more fully described on the Privacy Shield website on
  <a href="https://www.privacyshield.gov/article?id=How-to-Submit-a-Complaint" target="_blank">this page</a>, you may be entitled to invoke binding arbitration when other dispute resolution procedures have been exhausted.
</p>

<p>BY VISITING OUR SITE, USING THE SERVICES, OR SUBMITTING PERSONAL INFORMATION
  THROUGH THE SERVICES, YOU EXPRESSLY CONSENT TO THE PROCESSING AND USE OF
  YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION ACCORDING TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY, INCLUDING THE
  COLLECTION, USE, DISCLOSURE, STORAGE, TRANSFER AND PROCESSING OF YOUR
  PERSONAL INFORMATION AS DESCRIBED HEREIN. YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION MAY BE
  PROCESSED IN THE COUNTRY WHERE IT WAS COLLECTED AS WELL AS IN OTHER COUNTRIES
  (INCLUDING THE UNITED STATES) WHERE LAWS REGARDING THE PROCESSING OF PERSONAL
  INFORMATION MAY BE LESS STRINGENT THAN THE LAWS IN YOUR COUNTRY.
</p>

<p><b>IF YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH OUR PRIVACY POLICY, PLEASE DO NOT USE OUR SITE OR
  BECOME A REGISTERED MEMBER.</b>
</p>

<p class="section-title"><b>II. Personal Information We Collect</b></p>

<p>IT Central Station is committed to data minimization. As such, we collect only the information which is
  necessary to facilitate the purposes and uses reflected in this Privacy Policy.</p>

<p>
  Depending on how you interact with IT Central Station, the Personal Information we collect from you may
  vary. For example, to create an account we may ask only for a company email address. In other
  circumstances, such as when you complete a form related to a particular service offering, we may ask
  you to provide other information, which may include your name, phone number, job title, and/or employer
  name. After registering, you may provide us with additional information about your employment and
  professional experience. If you register with our LinkedIn™ log-in mechanism, we may collect your LinkedIn profile picture.
  We may also collect other information as indicated in the LinkedIn log-in screen during the registration process and
  as detailed in this Privacy Policy.
</p>

<p>
  When you contribute posts and reviews, participate in our surveys (either directly, or through third party
  service providers), or provide any other Content to the Services through other means, we will collect all
  the information you provide. If you exchange messages with others through the Site, we may store these
  messages to deliver them and to allow you to manage them.
</p>

<p>
  Please be aware that while some pieces of information that you provide to us would not be sufficient to
  identify you when seen by another User without any context, the combination of different pieces of
  information that you provide for viewing by other Users, or any contextual information, may allow other
  Users to identify you.
</p>

<p>
  When you contact us by sending us an e-mail or when you use any of our contact forms, we will collect
  any information that is contained in (and/or attached to) your e-mail or text message, or that you enter
  into such forms.
</p>

<p class="section-title"><b>III. Personal Information Collected Via Technology</b></p>

<p>
  When you visit our Site or use our Services, your device is automatically providing information to us to
  enable us to respond and customize our response to you. The type of information we collect by
  automated means may vary, but generally includes technical information about your computer, such as
  your IP address or other device identifier. The information we collect also may include usage information
  and statistics about your interaction with IT Central Station. That information may include the URLs of our
  web pages that you visit, URLs of referring and exiting pages, page views, time spent on a page, number
  of clicks, platform type, location data, and other information about how you used our Site. We collect this
  information to help us provide a customized experience.
  We may display this information so that Users can learn more about other Users.
  We do not currently respond to 'do not track' signals and similar settings or mechanisms.
</p>

<p>Automated means of data collection include the following:</p>

<ul>

  <li>
    <p>
      <b>Web Browser.</b> When you visit an IT Central Station website, your browser automatically sends
      us your Internet protocol ("IP") address so that the web pages you request can be sent to your
      computer or device. We use your IP address to determine additional information, such as your
      employer name, whether the computer or device has ever been used to visit IT Central Station
      before, which IT Central Station features were used the most often, and how much time was
      spent on a page.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <b>Web Beacons and Log Files.</b> We use "web beacons" (also known as Internet tags, pixel tags,
      tracking pixels, and clear GIFs) on our Site. These web beacons allow us and third parties to
      collect information such as the IP address of the device, the URL of the web page, the time the
      page was viewed, the type of browser used, and any additional information in cookies that may
      have been set by the third party. The information is typically collected in log files, which generally
      track traffic on our Site. The information is used for analytical purposes and to manage technical
      issues that may arise. We do not attempt to identify individual users through this information.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <b>Location Data.</b> We may determine your location from your device's IP address or from the URLs we receive.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <b>Cookies.</b> We also collect information using cookies to help us identify you when you visit our
      Site, and we may share cookies with third-party advertisers or advertising networks to provide
      you with relevant, targeted ads. For more information on cookies and similar tracking
      mechanisms, how we use them, and how you can control them, please see the next section
      below entitled “Cookies Policy and Ad Choices”.
    </p>
  </li>

</ul>

<p class="section-title"><b>IV. Cookie Policy and Ad Choices</b></p>

<p>
  IT Central Station stores a small text file called a “Cookie” on your computer to store your login
  information (if any) and your personal preferences for the Services. IT Central Station may use both
  session Cookies (which expire once you close your web browser) and persistent Cookies (which stay on
  your computer until you delete them). While you will still be able to use the Services if you disable
  Cookies in your browser, certain parts of the Services may not function as effectively. After you register
  and enable Cookies, we may associate this information with Personal Information that we have collected
  from you.
</p>

<p>
  We work with third parties, such as Google and Facebook, to provide analytics services that may use the
  Cookies set on your device to provide advertisements, measure the performance of advertising, and track
  traffic to IT Central Station generally. In addition, we have implemented
  <a href="https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/2799357?hl=en" target="_blank">Google Analytics Demographics
  and Interest Reporting</a>, which categorizes cookie information so that we and third-party service providers
  may better deliver content and/or advertisements that are relevant and useful to you on our Site and
  various websites across the internet. You may opt out of tracking by Google Analytics and Google
  Analytics Demographics and Interest Reporting services by visiting
  <a href="https://www.google.com/settings/u/0/ads/authenticated" target="_blank">Google Ads Settings</a> or by
  downloading the <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout" target="_blank">Google Analytics Opt-Out Browser Add-on</a>.
  If you do not want Facebook to use information based on your IT Central Station activity for the purpose of showing you ads,
  you may opt out <a href="https://www.facebook.com/help/568137493302217" target="_blank">here</a>.
</p>

<p>
  You may also be able to disable placement of some (but not all) Cookies by setting your browser to
  decline cookies, though this may degrade your user experience. Additionally, if you change computers or
  web browsers, you will need to opt out again. A useful resource for information about deleting and
  controlling cookies can be found at <a href="http://www.aboutcookies.org/" target="_blank">AboutCookies.org.</a>
  Although our Site does not currently respond to 'do not track' browser headers, you can limit tracking
  through these third-party programs and by taking the other steps discussed above.
</p>

<p class="section-title"><b>V. Use of Information We Collect</b></p>

<p>
  In general, information (including Personal Information) you submit to us, or to third parties that support
  us in collecting information, as well as information we collect about you via technology, are used by us to
  provide you and other Users with the Services, to respond to requests that you make, to improve our
  Services, and to operate, maintain, and improve the features, functionality, performance, and support of the Services.
  We may share your username, employer company size, employer industry, job title, photo, and browsing behavior with other Users.
  We do not display your email address or phone number on the Site. We do not reveal your company name to other Users
  unless you visit the My Profile page and choose to display it.
</p>

<p>
  We may also use your Personal Information to provide you with notifications related to your use of the
  Services, such as electronic newsletters or promotional e-mails.
</p>

<p>
  We use cookies and log file information to (a) collect or store personal information; (b) provide custom,
  personalized content and information; (c) monitor the use of our Site; (d) monitor aggregate metrics such
  as total number of visitors; (e) track your use of our Site; and (f) customize advertisements on our Site
  and retargeting advertisements on third party websites.
</p>

<p>
  To use certain services on our Site, such as downloading reports, you may be asked to provide Personal
  Information (e.g. your name, email address, employer name, or phone number). We may share your
  company size, employer name, browsing behavior, and other information we collect about you with our
  partners, sponsors, and advertisers (“<b>Partners</b>”). See our list of Partners
  <a href="http://go.itcentralstation.com/sponsors-partners/" target="_blank">here</a>.
</p>

<p>
  <b>By sharing your information with us, you agree that (a) IT Central Station may share your name,
    email address, phone number, and job title with its Partners, and (b) IT Central Station and its
    Partners may contact you by way of email, telephone, mail, or other means of communication to
    provide you with access to Content, surveys, direct marketing, and promotional materials in
    connection with your activity on the Site.</b>
</p>

<p>
  If you do not want this information shared, you may opt out of our sharing this information with our
  Partners by contacting us at the email address set forth in the section entitled “Opting Out” below. In
  addition, you may contact a Partner directly if you have any questions about such Partner’s use of your
  information or if you would like to cease receiving communications from a specific Partner.
</p>

<p>
  Our website includes social media features such as the "Share This" button for Twitter and LinkedIn.
  These features may set a cookie to enable the feature to function properly. Social media features and widgets are either
  hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our Site. Your interactions with each of these features are
  governed by the privacy policy of the company providing the feature.
</p>

<p class="section-title"><b>VI. Our Partners and Other Websites</b></p>

<p>
  Our Partners may include tracking technologies (e.g. cookies or web beacons) within pages on our Site.
  This is in order for our Partners to set and read their own cookies when you browse information about
  their companies. These tracking technologies are not subject to the control of IT Central Station.
</p>

<p>
  Similarly, our Services may contain links to other websites that are not owned or controlled by IT Central
  Station. The provision of such links is for your convenience and does not signify our endorsement of such
  websites or their location or their content. We have no control over, do not review, and are not
  responsible for the privacy policies of or content displayed on such other websites. Please be aware that
  the terms of our Privacy Policy do not apply to any outside websites.
</p>

<p class="section-title"><b>VII. Public Postings</b></p>

<p>
  One of the purposes of the Services is for Members to share product- and vendor-related information with
  other Users. Therefore, you should assume that any information that you post, including any Personal
  Information you may choose to provide (but excluding your email address and phone number), will be
  made available to other Users of the Services. If you post Content on our site (e.g. product review,
  question, answer, etc.), such Content may be made available on third party websites and may be
  included within materials distributed by our Partners, but such Content will not include your email
  address, phone number, full name, or employer name. We may provide you with the ability to
  anonymously post certain comments, in which case we will not include your contact information (i.e.,
  name, username, email address, or your employer) on the Site in connection with such comments.
  However, you should know that our internal records may associate your contact information with such
  comments.
</p>

<p class="section-title"><b>VIII. Legal Basis for the Processing of Personal Information</b></p>

<p>
  IT Central Station relies on both consent and legitimate business interests for processing Personal Information.
</p>

<p>
  For example, IT Central Station may process Personal Information with a User’s consent when a User
  agrees that we may process information that the User inputs into our Site or that we collect via our Site.
</p>

<p>
  On other occasions, even in the absence of explicit consent, IT Central Station may process Personal
  Information pursuant to specific purposes which further our legitimate interests, provided that our
  legitimate interests are not overridden by the User’s reasonable expectations of privacy. For example, IT
  Central Station may process Personal Information pursuant to legitimate business purposes to respond to
  User inquiries, to fulfill User requests, to send Users relevant marketing information and offers, to provide
  Users with more relevant ads and content, to complete transactions, to provide customer service, to send
  administrative information, and to personalize Users’ experiences with the Site.
</p>

<p>
  In addition, IT Central Station may process Personal Information where IT Central Station is required by
  law to do so.
</p>

<p class="section-title"><b>IX. Feedback</b></p>

<p>
  If you provide feedback about the Services to us, we may use and disclose such feedback for any
  purpose, provided we do not associate such feedback with your Personal Information. We will collect all
  information contained in such feedback and treat the Personal Information in it in accordance with this
  Privacy Policy.
</p>

<p class="section-title"><b>X. Disclosure of Personal Information to Service Providers</b></p>

<p>
  Except as otherwise stated in this Privacy Policy, we do not disclose to or share your Personal
  Information (e.g. full name, e-mail address, or phone number) with third parties, unless you ask or
  authorize us to do so.
</p>

<p>
  In addition to providing your Personal Information to our Partners, we provide your Personal Information
  to third party service providers and suppliers who work on our behalf or with us to provide you with some
  of the services and features of the Services and to help us communicate with our Users (“<b>Service
  Providers</b>”). Our Service Providers, however, do not have any independent right to use your Personal
  Information for their own purposes not connected to IT Central Station. IT Central Station will always
  attempt to limit the information we provide to what is reasonably sufficient for our Service Partners to
  carry out their responsibilities to IT Central Station.
</p>

<p>
  We may share some or all of your Personal Information with any parent company, subsidiary, joint
  venture, or other company under common control (collectively, “<b>Affiliates</b>”), in which case we will require
  our Affiliates to honor this Privacy Policy.
</p>

<p>
  In the event IT Central Station goes through a business transition such as a merger, acquisition by
  another company, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, your Personal Information will likely be among
  the assets transferred. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of IT
  Central Station or its assets may continue to use your Personal Information as set forth in this Privacy
  Policy.
</p>

<p>
  We may (and you authorize us to) disclose information we have collected from and about you (including
  Personal Information) if we believe in good faith that such disclosure is necessary to (a) comply with
  relevant laws or to respond to subpoenas or warrants served on us; (b) enforce our IT Central Station
  Terms of Use and Privacy Policy; or (c) protect and defend our rights or property, or the rights and
  property of the users of our Services or third parties.
</p>

<p class="section-title"><b>XI. Opting Out</b></p>

<p>
  If you wish to exercise any of your rights in relation to your Personal Information, including exercising your
  opt-out rights, please send us an email to <a href="mailto:privacy@itcentralstation.com">privacy@itcentralstation.com</a>.
</p>

<p>
  You may access, modify, or delete your Personal Information by logging into the service and visiting the
  My Profile page.
</p>

<p>
  We may send newsletters or promotional communications to our users. To unsubscribe to these
  communications, you will be required to click an "Unsubscribe" link in these emails and confirm the email
  address for which you would like to unsubscribe.
</p>

<p>
  We may send you service-related announcements (such as, but not limited to, a notice that we have
  changed our Services or our Terms of Use or Privacy Policy) when we believe it is necessary to do so.
</p>

<p>
  You may request that your Account be terminated and that your Personal Information be deleted by
  sending an email to <a href="mailto:privacy@itcentralstation.com">privacy@itcentralstation.com</a>. Any termination of your account may involve deletion
  of your Account information from our live databases and all the information and data stored for such
  Account in the Services. IT Central Station will not have any liability whatsoever to you for any termination
  of your Account or the related deletion of your information.
</p>

<p>
  You may request a copy of the Personal Information we store about you by sending an email to
  <a href="mailto:privacy@itcentralstation.com">privacy@itcentralstation.com</a>. You may also request that IT Central Station transfer your information or
  provide you with copies of your information to enable the transfer of your information to a third party.
</p>

<p>
  When we delete Personal Information that we have collected from or about you, it will be deleted from our
  active databases but may remain in our archives. Although IT Central Station may deactivate a User’s
  registration pursuant to their request, it may continue to retain the User’s information for legitimate
  business purposes as set forth above.
</p>

<p>
  We process the Personal Information of potential Partners for certain legitimate business purposes
  related to their request to receive information about our business-to-business services or to schedule a
  demonstration of our online, media, marketing, or data services products or programs. In the event that
  potential Partners do not wish to receive further marketing or sales emails from IT Central Station, they
  may opt-out of receiving additional emails by way of following the unsubscribe mechanism provided at the
  bottom of emails sent by IT Central Station.
</p>

<p class="section-title"><b>XII. Privacy of Minors</b></p>

<p>

  In particular, our security systems include authenticated access to internal databases, audits of processes
  and procedures, reviews of overall web security, and the use of restrictions of access to Personal
  Information in our possession. Additionally, we use encryption (e.g. HTTPS) to protect data transmitted to
  and from our Site.
