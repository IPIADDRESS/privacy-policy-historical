<p>This Privacy Policy was last updated on November 27, 2013.</p>

<p>IT Central Station Ltd. (“IT Central Station”, “we”, or “us”) takes the privacy and protection of personal
  information very seriously. By visiting the Site, registering as a Member, or using the Services, you acknowledge
  and accept the practices and policies outlined in this privacy policy (“Privacy Policy”). Unless otherwise defined
  herein, capitalized terms shall have the meanings assigned to such terms in the IT Central Station Terms of Use,
  which can be found <a href="tos">here</a> and which incorporate this Privacy Policy by reference.
  This Privacy Policy describes IT Central Station's practices with respect to Personal Information that we collect
  when you use the Services.
</p>

<p>“Personal Information” is information that is personally identifiable such as names, addresses, e-mail addresses,
  or phone numbers, as well as other non-public information that is associated with the foregoing. We collect and use
  Personal Information as described in this Privacy Policy from the Users of our Services.
</p>

<p>BY USING THE SERVICES OR SUBMITTING PERSONAL INFORMATION THROUGH THE SERVICES, YOU EXPRESSLY CONSENT TO THE
  PROCESSING AND USE OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION ACCORDING TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY.
</p>

<p>YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION MAY BE PROCESSED IN THE COUNTRY WHERE IT WAS COLLECTED AS WELL AS OTHER COUNTRIES
  (INCLUDING THE UNITED STATES) WHERE LAWS REGARDING PROCESSING OF PERSONAL INFORMATION MAY BE LESS STRINGENT THAN
  THE LAWS IN YOUR COUNTRY.
</p>

<p class="section-title"><b>Personal Information We Collect</b></p>

<p>We collect the following Personal Information that you submit to us voluntarily.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Our Member registration process to create an Account requires you to provide us with your e-mail
  address, products used, projects, and password of your choice. After registering you can provide us with additional
  information about you employment and professional experience. If you register with our LinkedIn registration
  mechanism, we may collect the information as indicated in the LinkedIn authentication screen during the registration
  process.
</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">When you contribute posts and reviews, participate in our surveys (either directly, or through
  third party service providers), or provide any other Content to the Services through other means, we will collect
  all the information you provide. If you exchange messages with others through the Site, we may store these messages
  in order to deliver them and allow you to manage them.
</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">In connection with reviews, posts, and surveys, IT Central Station (and/or its third party service
  providers) may collect a wide variety of product- and vendor-related information on an optional basis.
  Please be aware that while some pieces of information that you provide to us would not be sufficient to identify you
  when seen by another User without any context, the combination of different pieces of information that you have
  provided for viewing by other Users, or any contextual information, may allow other Users to identify you.
</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">When you contact us by sending us an e-mail or when you use any of our contact forms, 
  we will collect any information that is contained in (and/or attached to) your e-mail, text message, or that you
  enter into such forms.
</p>

<p class="section-title"><b>Personal Information Collected Via Technology</b></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">As you use the Services, certain information may also be collected passively, including your
  Internet protocol (IP) address and the browser that you use to visit the Site. IT Central Station also stores a
  small text file called a “Cookie” on your computer to store your login information (if any) and your personal
  preferences for the Services.
  IT Central Station may use both session Cookies which expire once you close your web browser)
  and persistent Cookies (which stay on your computer until you delete them). While you will still be able to use the
  Services if you disable Cookies in your browser, certain parts of the Services may not function as effectively.
  After you register and enable Cookies, we may associate this information with Personal Information that we have
  collected from you.
</p>

<p class="section-title"><b>Use of Information We Collect</b></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">In general, information (including Personal Information) you submit to us, or to third parties
  that support us in collecting information, is used by us to provide you and other Users with the Services, to
  respond to requests that you make, to improve our Services, and to operate, maintain, and improve the features,
  functionality, performance, and support of the Services.
</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">We may also use your Personal Information to provide you with notifications related to your use of
  the Services, such as electronic newsletters or promotional e-mails.
</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">We use cookies and log file information to (a) collect or store personal information, 
  (b) to provide custom, personalized content and information; (c) to monitor the use of our Site;
  (d) to monitor aggregate metrics such as total number of visitors; and (e) to track your use of our Site.
</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">We may create anonymized information from Personal Information by excluding information that makes
  the information personally identifiable to you. We may use this anonymized information for internal purposes, such
  as analyzing usage patterns so that we may enhance the Services, and we also reserve the right to use and disclose
  such anonymized information at our discretion.
</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">If you choose to use our service to tell a friend about our site, we will ask you for your friend's email address. 
  We will automatically send your friend a one-time email inviting him or her to visit the site.
  We store this information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email and ensuring multiple invitations are not sent.
  Your friend may contact us at <a href="mailto:info@itcentralstation.com">info@itcentralstation.com</a> to request that we remove this information from our database.
</p>

<p class="section-title"><b>Public Postings</b></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">One of the purposes of the Services is for Members to share product- and vendor-related information
  with other Users. Therefore, you should assume that any information (including any Personal Information you may
  choose to provide, but excluding your registration information) that you post will be made available to other Users
  of the Services.
  We may provide you the ability to anonymously post certain comments, in which case we will not include your contact
  information (i.e., name, username, email address, or postal address) on the Site in connection with such comments.
  However, you should know that our internal records may associate your contact information with such comments.
</p>

<p class="section-title"><b>Feedback</b></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">If you provide feedback about the Services to us, we may use and disclose such feedback for any
  purpose, provided we do not associate such feedback with your Personal Information. We will collect any information
  contained in such feedback and will treat the Personal Information in it in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
</p>

<p class="section-title"><b>Disclosure of Personal Information</b></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Except as otherwise stated in this Privacy Policy, we do not disclose to or share your Personal
  Information with third parties, unless you ask or authorize us to do so.
</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">We may provide your Personal Information to third party service providers and suppliers who work on
  behalf of or with us to provide you with some of the services and features of the Services and to help us communicate
  with our Users. However, these service providers and suppliers do not have any independent right to use this
  information except to help us provide the Services.
</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">We may share some or all of your Personal Information with any parent company, subsidiaries, joint
  ventures, or other companies under a common control (collectively, “Affiliates”), in which case we will require our
  Affiliates to honor this Privacy Policy.
</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">In the event IT Central Station goes through a business transition such as a merger, acquisition
  by another company, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, your Personal Information will likely be among the
  assets transferred. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of IT Central Station or
  its assets may continue to use your Personal Information as set forth in this Privacy Policy.
</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">We may (and you authorize us to) disclose information we have collected from and about you
  (including Personal Information) if we believe in good faith that such disclosure is necessary to (a) comply with
  relevant laws or to respond to subpoenas or warrants served on us;
  (b) to enforce our IT Central Station Terms of Use and Privacy Policy;
  or (c) to protect and defend the rights or property of us, the users of our Services, or third parties.

  won any of our sweepstakes, or that we have changed our Services or our Terms of Use or Privacy Policy) when we
  believe it is necessary to do so.
