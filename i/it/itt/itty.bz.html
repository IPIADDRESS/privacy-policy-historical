<h2>technology</h2>

<p>Itty.bz uses a feature of Internet browsers called a

<p>Cookies are used to improve the experience web users have when they

greater accuracy the composition of the audience they reach. Cookies
are also used to control the delivery of a series of ads to a web

of which we will try to clarify. Cookies and web beacons do not tell
