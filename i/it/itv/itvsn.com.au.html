</ul>

</ul>
<i>Sensitive personal information</i>
<ul>
<li><strong>(AUS) Please note that we do not seek to collect from you health information or other sensitive information as defined by Australian Law.</strong> However, if unsolicited personal information provided by you also includes health information or other sensitive information as defined by Australian Law, you consent to us holding, using or disclosing such health information or other sensitive personal information consistently with your reason for disclosing it (for example, resolving a customer complaint).</li>
<li><strong>(NZ)</strong> We will apply the same principles as above to the same kinds of personal information of New Zealand residents.</li>
</ul>
<i>Partial identification in commercial communications</i>
<ul>
<li>Sometimes in the course of our commercial communications (e.g. communication of written testimonials, product conversations, product-related tweets or similar), we may partially identify an individual by reference to part of that individual’s name and an area (e.g. suburb, region or state). To the extent that such information might identify you as an individual, you nevertheless consent to us holding, using or disclosing your personal information in that way.</li>
