<td>Understanding our audience and use of our products and services:</td>
<td>We have a legitimate interest in analysing and understanding how people are using and responding to our products and services at an individual and household or broader level. <br><br>For example, we collect and analyse data about how you are using our products and services and we (or our authorised third parties) may contact you from time to time to ask you to participate in surveys or research projects to help us understand use of and improve our services.<br><br>If you use a product or service we may combine information we collect from that product and service with information we collect from our other products and services, with information from surveys and research and with information which is available publicly or from other reputable sources (which include other broadcasters or trusted providers (such as Konica Minolta Marketing Services Limited and the advertising technology provider The Addressable Platform Limited)). We work with trusted third parties (including advertising clients and research providers) to understand the effectiveness of advertising (for example, what actions result from viewing advertising).<br><br>We apply modelling techniques to the information we hold to model our audiences based on certain attributes, understand our viewers better and to analyse use across all of our products and services.<br><br>We also collect information and insights information from use and interactions with pages or accounts we operate on third party platforms (for example, Facebook Fan Pages) for this purpose and also to administer those pages or accounts. In relation to such insights data, both we and the third party platform are controllers of any insights data relating to that page or account. For Facebook fan pages we are required to enter into a contract with Facebook to reflect joint controllership. You can download this contract here: http://www.facebook.com/legal/terms/page_controller_addendum. It contains further details and explanations on the joint controllership with Facebook in the context of fan page insights.

<td>Making your user experience more relevant to you including recommendations &amp; editorial content personalisation:</td>
<td>We have a legitimate interest in tailoring your user experience to you and making it easier for you to find the shows and content that you enjoy. We therefore use information we hold about you in order to recognise you across our different services, recommend content to you or personalise your experience. For example, we may use this information to help make your sign-in experience quicker and easier and if you watch a lot of drama then we might recommend the next big new drama series to you.<br><br>If you have adjusted the ‘Personalisation’ settings in the ‘Manage Account’ section of our website, your user experience won’t be personalised. We may still recommend content to you but our recommendations won’t be as relevant for you.

<td>Managing serving of our advertising:</td>
<td> Some of our products and services are funded by the sale of advertising and are free for viewers to use. We and our advertisers have a legitimate interest in serving and measuring our advertising efficiently. This is to ensure that our viewers have a good user experience, (for example don’t see the same advertising over and over again) and to allow our advertisers to reach more viewers and know when ads have been served.<br><br>
If you download any of our apps on a mobile device with a Google Android or Apple iOS operating system then you will be given an advertising identifier by that operating system. We use and pass this identifier to permitted third parties for frequency capping to limit repetitive advertising, for analytics purposes, or to enable us to serve you advertisements of particular relevance to you. You can reset your advertising ID at any time using the settings on your mobile device.

<td>Making advertising on our products and services more relevant to you:</td>
<td>Some of our products and services are funded by the sale of advertising and are free for viewers to use. We therefore have a legitimate interest in using information we hold about you to help us sell our advertising on a more personalised basis and to show you adverts that we think you’ll be interested in or which are more relevant to you. For example, if you live in Leeds then we would be more likely to show an ad for an event in Yorkshire - and less likely to see an ad for an event in London.<br><br>We also pass an identifier relating to you and data about you to The Addressable Platform Limited (an advertising technology provider which is part of the ITV group) and to our trusted third party partners (such as Amobee Inc and GroupM UK Limited (who also work with Finecast Limited)) to enable them to match against other data they may legally hold and use that combined information to serve ads of particular relevance to you. 
<br><br>You can choose not to receive adverts on our products and services that are tailored using information about you by adjusting the ‘Personalisation’ settings in the ‘Manage Account’ section of the ITV Hub website. You’ll still see adverts, but they will be generic (which includes advertising served against content being watched) and less relevant to you.

<tr>
<td>Making advertising and marketing on other services more relevant to you:</td>
<td>Our advertising clients run campaigns across more than one service. We and our advertisers have a legitimate interest in making sure that you don’t see repetitive or less relevant advertising across both our platforms and those run by third parties. We therefore share limited data with third parties to enable a match where you have also already shared your data with that party in the course of using their service; and (where there is a match) additional data to enable the third party and us to make advertising more relevant to you.<br><br>We also work with third party advertisers and platforms (such as Facebook and Google) to advertise our products and services to the most relevant audiences. This can involve the provision of protected ID data (for example, an email address which is converted into a stream of numbers or letters (aka hashed) to help make it more secure) to match the data we hold about you with the data they hold on their platform and provide you with relevant advertising (subject to your ad permissions on the relevant platform). <br><br>If you have adjusted the ‘Personalisation’ settings in the ‘Manage Account’ section of the ITV Hub website, you may still see adverts and marketing from us on other services, but it won’t use this data. Advertising on other services may still be based on cookie data however unless you have chosen to disable your cookies on the relevant device.

<td>Geo-blocking:</td>
<td>Some of our content is only available in certain parts of the world. This is due to a range of legal and regulatory issues, and we have a legitimate interest in complying with these restrictions. To ensure we only show you content when you’re in the appropriate territories we detect the IP address of your device to work out your location.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Main channel region:</td>
<td>We have a legitimate interest in complying with our obligations to Ofcom and STV with respect to certain ITV main channel programming in STV’s broadcast regions. We therefore use your postcode or other location data to ensure that we only play out content for you in accordance with those obligations.
</td>

<tr>
<td>Storing payment details for repeat purchases:</td>
<td>If you purchase or subscribe to an event or service online then we have a legitimate interest to store your payment details to enable you to make repeat purchases without having to re-enter your details again. For example ITV Box Office stores payment details to enable Sky customers to make repeat purchases via their remote control.

<td>Direct Marketing:</td>
<td>Subject to your direct marketing preferences, we have a legitimate interest in sending you marketing communications that we think will be the most relevant to you (and which will include our own or third party data).

For more details on direct marketing, see below.<br><br>If you have adjusted the ‘Personalisation’ settings in the ‘Manage Account’ section of our website, we will still send you direct marketing communications (subject to your preferences) but they won’t be as relevant for you.
