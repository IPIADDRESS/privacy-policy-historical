We may therefore need to collect location data from you (e.g. by determining your location from your IP address or by accessing GPS functionality on your device) or we may request you provide your location to us (e.g. by providing your postcode). This is necessary for us to ensure you are within a region for which our Services are available and/or so that we can “geo-block” or regionalise our Services to prevent you from accessing them from outside the United Kingdom or where applicable from within a region where our Services are not available. This may involve the use of cookies or equivalent devices (see section "Cookies and other such devices" below). <br><br><strong>Marketing Communications <br><br></strong>Where and only where we have your consent or are otherwise permitted to do so, we will: <br><br>- send you and keep you updated with information by email, telephone (including SMS), mail or other methods of communication about existing and new services and special offers from us; <br><br>- send you information by email, telephone (including SMS), mail or other methods of communication about related products or services of selected third parties that may be of interest to you; and<br><br>- pass your details to selected third parties so that they may send you information by email, telephone (including SMS), mail or other methods of communication about products or services that may be of interest to you.<br><br>To opt-out of receiving marketing communications from us, you can use the facility contained in any such communication or you can email us at the email address set out in ‘Contact Details’ below or write to us by mail to the address below stating that you do not wish to receive further communications from us. <br><br>To opt-out of receiving any such communications from a selected third party, you will need to contact the applicable third party.

We do not provide your personal information to advertisers but advertisers and ad serving companies may assume that you meet the targeting criteria for that ad, for example men aged 18-30. <br><br>We do not pass or sell your personal information to third parties for any other purpose than as set out in this privacy policy. Unless you have given us your consent to pass your details to a third party, any marketing referred to in the section entitled "Marketing Communications" is conducted by us on behalf of third parties and they do not have any access to your data. <br><br>Always think carefully before disclosing your personal information or other information to other users or otherwise making your personal information publicly available. It is important that you are aware that any of your personal information or other information which you disclose to another user may then be disclosed by that user. We have no responsibility or control over the contents of communications made between users of our Services. <br><br><strong>Third party service providers based outside of the United Kingdom</strong> <br><br>We use certain third party companies to perform some functions of the Services on our behalf (for example sending e-mails to you or analysing data that is collected from the Services). <br><br>These third party companies have access to personal information needed to perform these functions, but they are not allowed to use it for any other purpose.<br><br>Some of these third party companies are either located and/or have servers which are located outside the European Economic Area. Where we share personal information with such companies, we will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance with this privacy policy, however please note that the data protection and other laws of such countries may not be as comprehensive as those in the European Economic Area.<br><br><strong>Changes to our business<br></strong><br>If we decide to change or re-organise the structure of our business, we may need to pass your personal information to one of our group companies so that we can continue to effectively deliver the Services to you. <br><br>Also, if we become involved in a merger, acquisition or other transaction involving the sale of some or all of our or our group companies’ assets, user information (including the personal information collected from you through your use of the Services), may be included in the assets which are transferred to the new owner. <br><br>If any such event occurs, your personal information will remain subject to this Privacy Policy.<br><br><strong>Security and how do we protect your information?</strong> <br><br>We endeavour to take all reasonable steps to protect your personal information. Where possible we use industry-standard technology to allow for the encryption of sensitive information. <br><br><strong>Changes to our privacy policy</strong> <br><br>This privacy policy was last updated on 2 February 2011. <br><br><strong>Contact details<br></strong><br>You can email us with any questions, queries or complaints at <a href="mailto:itv.comsupport@itv.com">itv.comsupport@itv.com</a><br>“<strong>ITV</strong>” is ITV Consumer Limited.
