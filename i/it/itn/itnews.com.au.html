<p><strong>B) Analysis and Development of New Products and Services.</strong> We perform statistical, demographic and marketing analyses of users of the nextmedia Services, and their subscribing, purchasing, browsing and reading patterns, so we can analyse or predict our users’ preferences for product and services development purposes, to determine our promotional campaign effectiveness so we can adapt our campaign to the needs and interests of our users, and to generally inform advertisers about the nature of our subscriber base. We use this information for analytical purposes, including analysis to improve customer relationships, to support strategic business decisions and our marketing tactics and to measure and track our brand health. We will engage in these activities to manage our contractual relationship with you, to comply with a legal obligation, or because we have a legitimate interest in doing so.</p>
<p><strong>C) Customising Your Experience.</strong> We use the information that we have to better understand you and customise certain features of nextmedia Services to provide you with an enhanced experience including to show you offerings, promotions or products that may be of interest to you, based on the demographic information, type of device you are using to access the nextmedia Services, your usage of the nextmedia Services and your browsing and reading history. We will provide personalised services because we have a legitimate interest.</p>
<p><strong>D) Email Newsletters and Other Marketing Activities as well as Facilitating Social Sharing.</strong> nextmedia will send you email newsletters or promotional emails about services offered by nextmedia and its advertisers. To opt out of these emails, please see the section labelled “<a href="#optout">How do I opt out of receiving emails and promotions?</a>“. We will use the information we have about you to advertise our services to you on our Services but also on other platforms. If you choose to use social-sharing functionalities, we will use your information to facilitate such action, and such action — along with any information you share — will be covered by the social-media platform’s privacy policy. We will engage in these activities with your consent or where we have a legitimate interest.</p>
<p><strong>E) Administrative Purposes.</strong> We and our service providers use the information we have about you for the following legitimate business purposes:</p>
<ul>
<li>For auditing purposes, to verify that our internal processes function as intended and comply with legal, regulatory and contractual requirements;</li>
<li>For fraud and security monitoring purposes, including, for example, to detect and prevent cyberattacks; and</li>
<li>To understand and assess satisfaction with our Services or our customer care team.</li>
</ul>
<p>We engage in these activities to manage our contractual relationship with you, to comply with a legal obligation, or because we have a legitimate interest.</p>
<p><strong>F) Allowing you to participate in Competitions, Promotions and Special Offers.</strong> Some of these promotions have additional rules containing information about how we will use and disclose your personal information. We use this information to manage our contractual relationship with you.</p>
<p><strong>G) Aggregating and/or Anonymising Personal Information.</strong> We aggregate and/or anonymise personal information so that it will no longer be considered personally identifying. We do so periodically to generate other data for our use, which we may use and disclose for any purpose.</p>
<p><strong>H) User Generated Content and Public Activities.</strong> When you share or recommend links to content on a social-media platform (such as Facebook, Google+ and Twitter), that action and any information you share will be covered by that platform’s privacy policy. Any information you disclose in your public activities, along with your screen name or ID, or any image or photo, becomes public.</p>
<h1>3. With Whom Do We Share The Personal Information We Gather?</h1>
<p><strong>A) Sharing Within nextmedia.</strong> We share your personal information with our affiliates for the purposes listed in this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p><strong>B) Sharing With Service Providers.</strong> We contract with other companies, agents or contractors (“service providers”) to provide services on our behalf. These services are, for example, credit-card, payment and billing processing, fulfillment of subscriptions, orders and prizes, information technology and related infrastructure provision, customer service, ad serving, shipping, email distribution, lead generation, list processing and analytics, research surveys, interviews, event management and analysis, or promotions management. In the course of performing these services, our service providers have access to your information including your personal information.</p>
<p><strong>C) Sharing With Other Third-Parties.</strong> We will not knowingly sell, rent, swap or authorise any third-party other than in the ordinary course of business with our service providers and clients to use your details without your permission. Nothing in this Privacy Policy is intended to restrict our use or sharing of aggregated or de-identified information in any way.</p>
<p>i. We may share personal information, such as name, email, company and title, about attendees to our live events and conferences with sponsors; if we do, we will notify you when you provide us the information.</p>
<p>ii. We may also share personal information to third-party sponsors of competitions, promotions and special offers and will let you know at the point of collection of your information if we do.</p>
<p>iii. We may use a third-party payment service to process payments made through the nextmedia Services. If you wish to make a payment through the nextmedia Services, your personal information will be collected by such third-party and not by us, and will be subject to the third-party’s privacy policy, rather than this Privacy Policy. We have no control over, and are not responsible for, this third-party’s collection, use and disclosure of your personal information.</p>
<p>iv. We share in aggregate results from research surveys or events with advertisers and clients.</p>
<p>v. We have a legitimate interest in disclosing or transferring your personal information to a third-party in the event of any reorganisation, merger, sale, joint venture, assignment, transfer or other disposition of all or any portion of our business, assets or stock (including in connection with any bankruptcy or similar proceedings). Such third-parties may include, for example, an acquiring entity and its advisors.</p>
<p><strong>D) Compliance With Legal Process.</strong> We may access, preserve and disclose personal information if we are required to do so by law or we have a good faith belief that such action is necessary to (1) comply with the law or with legal process; (2) protect and defend our rights and property; (3) protect against misuse or unauthorised use of nextmedia Services; (4) protect the personal safety or property of our users or the public (among other things, this means that if you provide false information or attempt to pose as someone else, information about you may be disclosed as part of any investigation into your actions); and (5) cooperate with public and government authorities (which may be outside your country of residence).</p>
<p><strong>E) By Using nextmedia Services, You May Elect to Disclose Personal Information.</strong></p>
<p>i. Public Activities: see above for more details on such activities. Public activities may be included in our RSS feeds, APIs and other distribution formats. As a result, your public activities may appear on other websites, blogs, or feeds.</p>
<p>ii. Through Your Social Sharing Activity: When you connect your nextmedia Services account with your social media account, you will share information with your friends associated with your social media account, with other users, and with your social media account provider. By doing so, you authorise us to facilitate this sharing of information, and you understand that the use of shared information will be governed by the social media provider’s privacy policy.</p>
<h1>4. Other Information Collected Using Technology</h1>
<p>Other information does not specifically identify you and are collected through technology. It includes tracking information collected by us as well as third-parties.</p>
<p>We use various internet technologies to manage, and track the use of, the nextmedia Services. We use and disclose this information for any purpose, except where we are required to do otherwise under applicable law. Information that we collect using these technologies is combined with personal information about you. If we combine information with personal information, we will treat the combined information as personal information.</p>
<p><strong>A) Device Information.</strong> We collect information about the computer, mobile device or other device you use to access the nextmedia Services, such as Internet protocol (IP) addresses (the region or general location where your computer or device is accessing the Internet), geolocation information, unique device identifiers, browser type, browser language and other transactional information.</p>
<p><strong>B) Cookies, Beacons, Local Storage and Other Similar Technologies.</strong> We use “cookies,” Web beacons, tags and scripts, and other similar technologies including local storage objects such as HTML5. These technologies allow us to manage access to and use of the nextmedia Services, recognise you and provide personalisation, and help us understand how people use the nextmedia Services. You will not be able to access certain areas of our websites, if your computer does not accept cookies from us. Because there is no accepted standard on how to respond to “do not track” browser-based signals, we do not respond to such signals. For more detailed information about our use of cookies and local storage, see the Cookie Policy <a href="https://www.nextmedia.com.au/cookie-policy/">here</a>.</p>
<p>We transmit website usage information to third-parties in order to show you advertising for nextmedia and affiliated brands when you visit other sites. For more information about our third-party ad servers, or to learn about your choices about not having this information used to target ads to you, please click <a href="https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a> (for Google).</p>
<p><strong>C) Analytics, Log Files and Reading History.</strong> We gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. This information includes IP address, browser type, operating system and other usage information about the use of nextmedia Services, including a history of the pages you view.</p>
<p>We automatically combine this collected log-information with other information we collect about you. We do this to improve services we offer you, including customised recommendations, advertising to improve marketing, and to track access and use of nextmedia Services across the devices that you use to access us.</p>
<p>One of the analytics service providers we use is Google Analytics. To learn more about how Google use data, visit <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy/partners" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://policies.google.com/privacy/partners</a>.

<h1>5. Third-Party Advertising</h1>
<p>Some of the services and advertisements included in nextmedia Services, are delivered or served by third-party companies, which may collect information about your use of nextmedia Services.</p>
<p>These companies place or recognise cookies, pixel tags, web beacons or other technology to track certain information about nextmedia Services website users. For example, in the course of serving certain advertisements, an advertiser may place or recognise a unique cookie on your browser in order to collect certain information about your use of nextmedia Services. For another example, an advertiser or ad server may also be able to collect your device’s unique identifier in the course of serving an ad. In many cases, this information could be used to show you ads on other websites based on your interests.</p>
<p>We do not have access to, nor control over, these third-parties’ use of cookies or other tracking technologies or how they may be used.</p>
<p>For example, we use Google to serve advertisements on nextmedia Services, which use the Google Ad Manager cookie, and in some cases, a unique device identifier, to show you ads based on your visit to our sites and other sites on the Internet. You may opt out of the use of the Google Ad Manager cookie by visiting the Google ad and content network privacy policy. If you would like more information about this practice, and to learn how to opt out of it in desktop and mobile browsers on the particular device on which you are accessing this Privacy Policy, please visit <a href="http://www.youronlinechoices.com.au/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">http://www.youronlinechoices.com.au/</a>. You may also view more information <a href="https://www.nextmedia.com.au/cookie-policy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p>
<p>Your access to our websites should not be affected if you do not accept cookies served by third-parties.<br>
