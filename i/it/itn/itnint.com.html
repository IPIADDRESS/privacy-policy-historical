We take this matter seriously and have instituted many policies and procedures to insure that your privacy rights as stated herein are not violated. The following outlines our privacy policy and details the measures we have taken to safeguard and protect your privacy.

This policy came into effect on the 6 of April 1999, and was last updated on the 25th September 2012.
<br><br>
          <span class="style31"><strong>Collection and Use of Information</strong></span><br><br>

No other third parties, either on our behalf or for themselves, will collect any Personally Identified Information through this website. Any information we collect from you is used solely by us to return requested information. However, if you provide us with your e-mail or postal mailing address on-line, you may receive periodic mailings from us with information on new products and services or upcoming events.

<br><br>
          We may use your information to contact you directly with information, including marketing information in relation to upcoming ITN International or industry events, meetings, conferences, products, or services which we believe could be of interest to you or your organization and to get your views in relation to the products or services which we provide –to invite individuals to attend seminars/training events, or to participate in other meetings or events held by us or third parties in order to view or test our products and services.  We may contact you by any means of communication for which you have given us contact details, including e-mail, telephone, and mail.
