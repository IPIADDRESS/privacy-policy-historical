<h2>IBS Self Help Group Respects Your Privacy</h2>
<b>Publication Date: December 1, 2001</b>
<p>IBS Self Help Group ("IBS Group") respects your privacy. That's why
we have created this Privacy Statement to explain how and why we collect certain
information online, and how we use that information. This statement also
explains how you can prevent collection of certain information about yourself,
if you choose. Please take a few moments to read our Privacy Statement. This
statement applies to both information we collect from visitors to the IBSGroup.org
Web site, as well as information we collect or have access to when on our
message boards.</p>
<h3>Right to Change Policy</h3>
<p>As IBS Group is constantly innovating and enhancing the bulletin board and
services it provides to its users, this Privacy Statement will also continue to
change to match the bulletin board and services we make available. As such, we
reserve the right to change this statement to match the bulletin board and
services we provide. If we make any material change to this statement, we will
change the date at the top of this statement to reflect the effective date of
the change. When you visit our site or use our bulletin board and services, we
encourage you to check the date of this Privacy Statement to ensure you are
aware of any updates.</p>
<p>However, regardless of how this Privacy Statement may change or evolve over
time, IBS Group will not collect or maintain your private and personally
identifiable information without your consent. Further, if you consent to give
us your personal information, we will keep it confidential and will not sell,
license or disclose your personal information to any third party without your
consent, unless we are compelled to do so under the law or to comply with a
court order.</p>

<h3>Types of Information We Collect</h3>
<p>Generally, you are free to browse the IBSGroup.org site without submitting
any personal information. We do not collect any of your personal information
(such as a name, address or e-mail address) when you visit the IBS Group site,
unless you register or have registered to use one of our services, complete one
of our evaluations, or otherwise agree to submit to us such information. As part
of such processes, you have the opportunity to decline further promotional
materials or other notifications from us regarding special offers and
information from IBS Group. Types of information collected on specific services
on the IBSGroup.org site are described in more detail below.</p>
<h3>Registration on Our Site</h3>
<p>IBS Group requires users who want to participate in the IBS Group support
message boards to register. In order to register, you must provide us with a
username (which does not have to be your real name), password and a valid e-mail
address. This allows us to protect our community from abusive postings and
provides a verifiable point of contact should legal questions arise. At any
time, you have the ability to keep your e-mail address hidden from other users
by selecting that option within your user profile.</p>
<p>When you register, you have the option of providing some additional
information such as occupation, interests, and homepage URL. This optional
information is made available to other bulletin or message board users to foster
a sense of community. If you have any concerns about providing this information,
simply leave the fields blank and your registration will still be processed.</p>
<p>IF YOU ARE UNDER 13 YEARS OF AGE you are allowed to participate in the IBS Group
support forums.</p>
<h3>Bulletin Board Newsletter Subscription</h3>
<p>IBS Group offers an option to subscribe to a periodic newsletter regarding
our organization's activities, promotions, product announcements and news items.
The only piece of information required is the user's e-mail address, which is
only used to distribute the requested newsletter. You can
"unsubscribe" to the newsletter at any time by e-mailing <a href="mailto:ibs@ibsgroup.org?subject=NEWSLETTER UNSUBSCRIBE">ibs@ibsgroup.org</a>
with the subject line "NEWSLETTER UNSUBSCRIBE."</p>
<h3>Cookies</h3>
<p>IBS Group uses browser cookies to facilitate your experience with our
bulletin board, services and sponsors. These cookies are small sections of code
that our server sends to your browser which it can then store on your hard
drive. If you choose to accept these cookies, they enable us, or our sponsors,
to recognize that your browser has previously visited and used our site,
bulletin board or services and, based on your browser's previous visits, assist
us with tailoring the information and content, banners and promotions you view.
These cookies also enable us to recognize when you access and use IBS Group's
bulletin board. An example of the customization allowed by the use of such
cookies is to retain your username and password as part of the bulletin board
forums on our site so you don't have to re-enter them each time you visit. These
cookies do not collect, store or maintain your private, personally identifiable
information. You do not have to accept these cookies to visit or use the IBS Group
site or our bulletin board and services, and you can choose to refuse our
cookie, delete our cookie from your hard drive or turn off the IBS Group cookie
at any time by updating your user profile preferences.</p>
<h3>Donations and/or Credit Card Information</h3>
<p>IBS Group strives to maintain strict security for your private information.
Our online donations are Paypal enabled, providing a secure means of making a
donation. We do not maintain any credit card information at IBS Group, which
means that you have to provide it each time you make a donation, but also means
that your information is controlled by you alone.</p>
<h3>Technical Support</h3>
<p>Any personal information you provide to us in the course of obtaining
technical support, or asking other questions about IBS Group will be used only
for the purposes for which it was submitted. We may store the information, but
we will not use it for any other purposes or disclose it to any third parties.</p>
<h3>Use and Disclosure of Your Information</h3>
<p>IBS Group uses the personal information it collects from registration forms
you fill out on our site to:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Allow users to access and use our bulletin board and/or services;
  </li><li>Supply users with installation instructions, download, access or use
    information, and technical support information;
  </li><li>Provide users of our bulletin board and/or services on our site with
    information about special offers and promotions; and
  </li><li>Improve our bulletin board and services by using statistical analysis and
    evaluation of user data.</li>
</ol>
<p>We use the anonymous information we collect from the other methods described
above, such as cookie information, to collect broad demographic information
about user trends, count the number of users of our bulletin board and/or
services, to provide advertising services and to continue to enhance and improve
our bulletin board and services.</p>
<p>We do not and will not disclose your private, personally identifiable
information to any third party for any purpose without your prior consent.
However, IBS Group reserves the right to disclose your personal information if
required to do so by law, or in the good faith belief that such action is
reasonably necessary to comply with legal process, respond to claims, or to
protect the rights, property or safety of our company, its employees, customers,
or the public.</p>
<p>All reasonable care is taken by our staff in handling your personal
information to ensure its security both offline and online. It is our policy to
destroy server access and any personal information provided during the technical
support process upon completion of the technical support incident.</p>

<h3>Postings on Bulletin Boards</h3>
<p>It is important for you to remain aware that when you provide personal
information (e.g., last name, address, phone number) in a posting on any message
board, that information is available to any other person or user having access
and use of that message board, and may be used by someone in a manner unintended
by you. For that reason, we discourage you from offering any personally
identifying information within a posting to any message board.</p>
