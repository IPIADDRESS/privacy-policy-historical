        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="section">
        <h3 id="cookies-and-related-technologies">5. Cookies and Related Technologies</h3>
        <p>
          When you use our Services, we may collect certain information by automated or electronic means, using technologies such as cookies, pixel tags and web beacons, browser analysis tools, and web server logs. As you use our Services, your browser and devices communicate with servers operated by us, our business partners and services providers to coordinate and record the interactivity and fill your requests for services and information.
        </p>
        <p>
          The information from cookies and related technology is stored in web server logs and also in web cookies kept on your computers or mobile devices, which are then transmitted back to our Services by your computers or mobile devices. These servers are operated and the cookies managed by us, our business partners or our service providers.
        </p>
        <p>
          For example, when you access our Services, Ibotta and our service providers may place cookies on your computers or mobile devices. These cookies may include means for tracking your Transaction Information with a Merchant and may include tracking technology from third-party affiliate-network operators. Cookies allow us to recognize you when you return, and track and target your interests in order to provide a customized experience. They also help us provide a customized experience and help us to detect certain kinds of fraud. A <strong>"cookie"</strong> is a small amount of information that a web server sends to your browser that stores information about your account, your preferences, and your use of the Services. Some cookies contain serial numbers that allow us to connect your activity with the Services with other information we store about you in your profile or as related to your other interactions with the Services.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some cookies are temporary, whereas others may be configured to last longer. <strong>"Session"</strong> cookies are temporary cookies used for various reasons, such as to manage page views. Your browser usually erases Session cookies once you exit your browser. <strong>"Persistent"</strong> cookies are more permanent cookies that are stored on your computers or mobile devices even beyond when you exit your browser. We use Persistent cookies for a number of purposes, such as retrieving certain information you have previously provided (such as your user id if you asked to be remembered), and storing your preferences.
        </p>
        <p>
          Pixel tags and web beacons are tiny graphic images placed on website pages or in our emails that allow us to determine whether you have performed specific actions. When you access these pages or open email messages, the pixel tags and web beacons generate a notice of that action to us, or our service providers. These tools allow us to measure response to our communications and improve our web pages and promotions.
        </p>
        <p>
          We collect many different types of information from cookies and other technologies. For example, we may collect information from the devices you use to access our Services, your operating system type or mobile device model, browser type, domain, and other system settings, as well as the language your system uses and the country and time zone of your device. Browsers routinely send these types of information to web servers. Our server logs also record the Internet Protocol ("IP") addresses of the devices you use to interact with the Services. An IP address is a unique identifier that devices use to identify and communicate with each other on the Internet. We may also collect information about the website you were visiting before you came to our Services and the website you visit after you leave our Services, if this information is supplied to us by your browser.
        </p>
        <p>
          In many cases, the information we collect using cookies and other tools is used in non-identifiable ways, without any reference to Personal Information. For example, we use information we collect about users to optimize our Services and understand its traffic and usage patterns. In other cases, we associate the information we collect using cookies and related technologies with Personal Information. In that case, this Privacy Policy governs how we use that information.
        </p>
        <p>
          Additionally, if you have visited our mobile website or activated one of our mobile-device applications, and if the settings on your location-aware device allow us to receive Location Information, we will collect that automatically. If we associate Location Information with other Personal Information, this Privacy Policy governs how we would use that information too.
        </p>
        <p>
          We also use third party services, such as Google Analytics, to help us understand how visitors interact with our website and to help improve our user experience.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="section">
        <h3 id="your-choices">6. Your Choices</h3>
        <p>
          We think that you benefit from a more personalized experience when we know more about you and the kinds of offers you like. However, you can limit the information you provide to Ibotta, and you can limit the communications that Ibotta sends to you.
        </p>
        <h4>Email</h4>
        <p>
          You can manage your email preferences by logging into Ibotta’s mobile application and going to the Notifications section under Settings. You may also manage your email preferences by clicking “unsubscribe” on any email communication we send you. You may choose to subscribe to some types of messages, and may choose to unsubscribe from others.
        </p>
        <h4>Cookies</h4>
        <p>
          You may manage how your browser handles cookies and related technologies by adjusting its privacy and security settings. Browsers are different, so refer to instructions related to your browser to learn about cookie-related and other privacy and security settings that may be available. Please note that if you disable cookies, you may be unable to access some customized features of our Services. You can opt-out of being targeted by certain third party advertising companies online at <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/consumer/opt_out.asp">www.networkadvertising.org/consumer/opt_out.asp</a>.
        </p>
        <h4>Mobile</h4>
        <p>
          Some of the features of the Service may enable Ibotta to access and collect information about your current or past location in order to personalize the Service for you and provide other features of the Services (“Location-based Features"). In order to use Location-based Features, you must give Ibotta permission to use your geo-location through your device. Ibotta may access your geo-location using a variety of means, including GPS, IP address, or cell tower location. You will have the opportunity to opt-out of using Location-Based Features by going to Settings and turning off the “Nearby Store Alerts” feature.  If you choose not to allow Ibotta to use your location information or disable Ibotta’s Location-based Features on your device under settings, you will not be able to utilize certain features of the Service.
        </p>
        <p>
          Alternatively, you may adjust the settings on your mobile device to prevent the sharing of Location Information. You may also manage how your mobile device or mobile browser handles cookies and related technologies by adjusting your mobile device privacy and security settings. Please refer to instructions provided by your mobile service provider or the manufacturer of your device to learn how to adjust your mobile device and mobile browser settings. Please note that if you disable the sharing of Location Information, you may be unable to access some features of our Services that are designed for mobile devices.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Personal Information collected by our Services via a mobile device may also include the following: (i) periodic collection of your location and time of day; (ii) the names of the other applications on your mobile device and, if you use an Android-based mobile device, how you use them (e.g., frequency and duration of use); (iii) information about your mobile device (e.g., make, model, operating system, and other similar information, but not phone number); and (iv) information about your use of features, functions, or clicks on notifications or content. In addition to the other uses of your Personal Information described in this Privacy Policy, Ibotta may use and process Personal Information we collect via a mobile device to: (a) send notifications when you arrive at or leave places; and (b) infer the location of the places you visit most often, determine your frequency at these locations, and send notifications when you arrive at or leave those places.
        </p>
        <h4>Connecting through Social Networks</h4>
        <p>
          You may manage the sharing of certain Personal Information when you register with us through a social media platform or application, such as through Facebook Connect.

        <p>
          Protecting the privacy of young children is especially important. For that reason, we do not allow children under 13 to use the Service or knowingly collect or maintain personally identifiable information from persons under 13 years-of-age, and no part of the Service is directed to persons under 13. If you are under 13 years-of-age, then please do not use or access Service at any time or in any manner. If we learn that personally identifiable information has been collected on the Service from persons under the age of 13 and without verifiable parental consent, then we will take the appropriate steps to delete this information. If you are a parent or guardian and discover that your child under the age of 13 has obtained an account on the Service, then you may alert us at <a href="mailto:support@ibotta.com">support@ibotta.com</a> and request that we delete that child’s personally identifiable information from our systems.

Therefore, we cannot and do not guarantee that information you post on the Service will not be viewed by unauthorized persons.

        <p>
          Please revisit this page periodically to stay aware of any changes to this Privacy Policy, which may be revised periodically at our sole discretion, as provided in Section 3 of the Ibotta Terms of Use. If we modify the Privacy Policy, we will make it available through the Service, and indicate the date of the latest revision. In the event that the modifications materially alter your rights or obligations hereunder, we will make reasonable efforts to notify you of the change. For example, we may send a message to your e-mail address, if we have one on file, or generate a pop-up or similar notification when you access the Service for the first time after such material changes are made. Our amended Privacy Policy will automatically take effect 30 days after it is made available through the Service, except that (i) we generally only use your personally identifiable information in the manner described in the Privacy Policy in effect when we received that information and (ii) if you do not agree with any changes to the Privacy Policy, you may terminate your account and stop using the Service. Your continued use of the Service after the revised Privacy Policy has become effective indicates that you have read, understood and agreed to the current version of the Privacy Policy.
