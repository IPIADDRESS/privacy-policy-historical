                    <p class="u-textLarger u-textLightWeight">
                        The International Baccalaureate Organization, a Swiss foundation, with a registered address at Route des Morillons 15, 1218 Le Grand-Saconnex, Geneva, Switzerland and/or its affiliates (the “IB” or “we” or “us”) owns and operates several websites, including www.ibo.org. The IB is committed to protecting the privacy of students, parents, educators and others who use our websites services and products (the “Services”). The IB operates on a global basis and is subject to a variety of legal requirements which affect how we treat your personal data and information and respect your privacy. This Privacy Policy describes how your personal data and information may be collected through the IB’s Services and how it is used, disclosed and transferred.
                    </p>
                <div class="u-cf">
                    <p><b>For users based in the United States of America</b>: By accessing or using this website or any of our Services, you are accepting the practices and policies outlined in this Privacy Policy.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Your use of any of the Services is governed by the <a href="/terms-and-conditions/">Terms and Conditions</a>, which includes this <a href="/terms-and-conditions/privacy-policy/">Privacy Policy</a>. If you do not agree with any aspect of these documents or any of the Terms and Conditions, please do not access this website or use the Services.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you are not of legal age to form a binding contract (in many jurisdictions, this age is 18, but you should check the age applicable to yours), you may only use the Services and disclose information to us with your parent’s (or guardian’s) express consent. Please review this Privacy Policy with your parent or guardian.</p>
<p>This Privacy Policy does not apply to websites, offerings or practices of companies that the IB does not own or control.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5>I. COLLECTION OF PERSONAL DATA</h5>
<p>“Personal data” is any data or information that personally identifies a person or that, together with any other available data, makes any person identifiable to another.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some of the IB’s Services do not require any personal data from you.&nbsp; However, in many cases, the IB may require personal data directly from you when accessing and/or using the Services. &nbsp;It is voluntary and up to you whether to provide the personal data requested by us. We will indicate whether the information we have requested is required.&nbsp; However, if you do choose not to give us certain information, you may be unable to access or use certain features or areas of our websites and Services or we may be unable to provide certain Services to you.</p>
<p>The type of personal data you will be asked to provide depends on the type of Service you use. Personal data may include, without limitation, your name, address, email address, phone numbers, exam/assessment results, language proficiency, date of birth, education records, and free and reduced-cost lunch eligibility status. In some cases, the IB may collect financial information, such as bank details and credit card information, as well as travel information (including passport or contact information for next of kin).</p>
<p>The IB may also collect sensitive personal data such as gender, race/ethnic origin, information related to criminal convictions, medical or other information regarding disabilities or other conditions requiring assessment accommodations. Sensitive personal data will not be collected unless it is for a legitimate purpose and unless you have given express and unambiguous consent.</p>
<h6><b>Special Considerations for Children or Students who are Minors</b></h6>
<p>The IB has special concerns about the privacy of all IB students or children who access our website, but in particular those who are under the age of 13 or who are over the age of 13 but are minors, i.e. under the age of majority (in many jurisdictions, this age is 18). Because the age of majority and consent can vary depending on a student user’s country of residence, the IB has adopted this age (18) as a uniform requirement. In other words, consent from both the student and parent or legal guardian may be required in order for users under 18 years of age to use some of the IB’s Services.</p>
<p>With respect to children <b>under the age of 13: </b>We do not knowingly collect, maintain or use personal data from anyone under the age of 13 through the Services. If you are under the age of 13, you are not allowed to subscribe to any of the Services or to create an account without the permission of your parent, guardian or teacher. Please do not submit any <strong>pe</strong><b>rsonal data or information about yourself to us.&nbsp;</b>If a child whom we know to be under age 13 sends personal data or information to us online through the Services, we will only use that information to respond directly to that child, notify his or her parents, or seek parental consent.</p>
<p>With respect to <b>children age 13 or older but under 18: </b>For these users of certain Services, the IB may also require 1) additional affirmative, opt-in consent of the users and 2) parental consent if the users of those Services are under the age of 18. Parents/guardians may be asked to provide consent by email, text message or any other method permitted under local applicable law for their children to use the Services. Any personal data we collect from parents giving parental consent will be treated the same as personal data collected from any other user of the IB’s Services and in accordance with this privacy policy.</p>
<h6><b>Special Considerations for Personal Data Provided by IB Teachers, Coordinators, School Administrators and Other Third Parties</b></h6>
<p>For some Services, IB coordinators, teachers and school administrators may submit personal data about IB students to the IB’s Services (e.g. registration for IB diploma programme exams on the IBIS Service). For such Services, the IB does not have a direct relationship with the individuals (e.g. students) whose personal data may be processed in connection with providing the Services. In these circumstances, the IB coordinators, teachers, and/or school administrators are responsible for ensuring that any such sharing or transfer of personal data to the IB is done accordance with applicable local law and without violating any privacy or data protection rights of any individuals, including, without limitation, providing appropriate notice to the individuals and obtaining any required consents. IB acknowledges that personal data and information provided to it by employees or agents of schools for certain Services may be protected under local applicable laws.</p>
<p><b>As a parent</b>, you should consult your school's policy for more information about the ability of IB coordinators, teachers and school administrators to provide personal data or consent on behalf of parents and students.</p>
<p><b>As an IB coordinator, teacher or school administrator</b>, you hereby confirm that you have authority to consent and/or provide personal data on behalf of your students and/or student’s parents (as the case may be) to the IB. If you submit personal data of anyone other than yourself to the IB’s Services, you represent and warrant to the IB, by using the Services, that you have authority to do so and have done so in accordance with all data protection and privacy laws applicable to you and without violating the individual’s privacy or data protection rights. This includes any requirements to notify individuals about the purposes, uses, transfers and sharing of their personal data by the IB as described in this Privacy Policy and to obtain consent from the person (and/or their legal guardian). In addition, when using certain Services, you may be required separately to affirmatively confirm your authority to the IB.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

You may withdraw your consent at any time (for example, for us to send you marketing communications) by contacting the IB at <a href="mailto:privacy@ibo.org">privacy@ibo.org</a>. The IB also processes your personal data where this is necessary for the performance of a contract with you or where it is necessary for the IB’s legitimate interests of operating, protecting and improving the Services.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Accuracy of Personal Data – Self Reported</b></p>
<p>By using the Services, you agree to provide accurate, complete and up-to-date personal data. Each user of the Services is solely responsible for the personal data he or she provides and agrees that he or she conforms to all local data protection laws where required by applicable law.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5>III. THIRD PARTIES, DISCLOSURE and CROSS-BORDER TRANSFERS</h5>
<p>The IB will not share or transfer your personal data other than as described in the Privacy Policy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The IB has databases in different countries and your personal data may be used and processed by IB staff, affiliates or contractors in any of the countries in which they are located, including without limitation, the United States. They are obligated to treat your personal data in accordance with IB’s internal global data protection policy.</p>
<p>In addition, as part of operating the Services, the IB may transfer your personal data to third-parties who provide business-related services to the IB (such as providers of cloud hosting solutions; event management services; client relationship management services; travel booking services; expense and payment processing services; registry service providers; assessment service providers, such as examiners, moderators, eMarking service providers; and on-line course providers). In addition, your personal data and information may be transferred to synchronize and update between and among these systems in order to provide the Services more efficiently and effectively. &nbsp;Accordingly, your personal data may be transferred to, and further processed by and among, these third-party service providers in connection with their performance of such functions. However, these third parties may not use it for other purposes and have contractual arrangements with the IB that address the privacy and security of such information.</p>
<p>These parties, as well as the IB, may process your personal data outside Switzerland, the UK and the European Economic Area, including, without limitation, Argentina, Australia, Canada, Singapore, and the United States. These countries may have different privacy laws, which, in some cases the European or local Data Protection Authorities, may consider to be less adequate or protective, than the privacy laws in your home country. &nbsp;The IB will ensure, when required by applicable law, that adequate safeguards are in place to protect your personal data where it is transferred to territories outside the European Economic Area, Switzerland or the UK.&nbsp; If we share your personal data with third party service providers, we contractually oblige them to comply with applicable data protection laws and to implement adequate safeguards to protect your personal data in accordance with the relevant governing legislation.</p>
<p>Your personal data will not be sold, rented or otherwise made available to third-party marketers or advertisers under any circumstances.&nbsp; IB will not engage in any targeted advertising based on any personal data or information of students acquired because of IB’s Services.</p>
<p>The IB may disclose personal data if it believes, in good faith, that such disclosure is necessary to comply with applicable law, regulatory investigation or inquiries (including economic sanction regulations), to enforce or apply the Terms and Conditions, or to protect the property, rights, or safety of the IB, users of Services, or other third parties.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5>IV. DATA SECURITY AND STORAGE</h5>
<p>To ensure the security and confidentiality of personal data that we collect online, we use strong, industry standard security controls throughout our infrastructure and continually monitor the security status of our systems. In the course of handling your personal data, we implement and maintain reasonable security procedures and practices, including organizational and technical measures that are appropriate to the nature of the personal data and information and protect it from unauthorized access, destruction, use, modification and disclosure.&nbsp; We also take measures reasonably designed to ensure the secure transmission of information from your computer to our servers. &nbsp;Although the IB endeavors to provide a safe environment, please be aware that no security measures are absolute and no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed secure.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
