                        The International Baccalaureate Organization, a Swiss foundation, with a registered address at Route des Morillons 15, 1218 Le Grand-Saconnex, Geneva, Switzerland on behalf of itself and/or via its affiliates or branches worldwide (the “IB” or “we” or “us”) owns and operates several websites, including www.ibo.org.
                    </p>
                <div class="u-cf">
                    <p>The IB is committed to protecting the privacy of students, parents, educators and others who use our websites services and products (the “Services”). The IB operates on a global basis and is subject to a variety of legal requirements which affect how we treat your personal data and information and respect your privacy. This Privacy Policy describes how your personal data and information may be collected through the IB’s Services and how it is used, disclosed and transferred.</p>
<p>By accessing or using this website or any of our Services you are accepting the practices and policies outlined in this Privacy Policy.&nbsp; Also, your use of any of the Services is governed by the <a href="/terms-and-conditions/">Terms and Conditions</a>, which includes this <a href="/terms-and-conditions/privacy-policy/">Privacy Policy</a>. If you do not agree with any aspect of these documents or any of the Terms and Conditions, please do not access this website or use the Services.</p>
<p>&nbsp;If you are not of legal age to form a binding contract (in many jurisdictions, this age is 18, but you should check the age applicable to yours), you may only use the Services and disclose information to us with your parent’s (or guardian’s) express consent. Please review this Privacy Policy with your parent or guardian.</p>
<p>This Privacy Policy does not apply to websites, offerings or practices of companies that the IB does not own or control.</p>
<h2>I. COLLECTION OF PERSONAL DATA</h2>
<p>“Personal data” is any data or information that personally identifies a person or that, together with any other available data, makes any person identifiable to another.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some of the IB’s Services do not require any personal data from you.&nbsp; However, in many cases, the IB may require personal data directly from you when accessing and/or using the Services. &nbsp;It is voluntary and up to you whether to provide the personal data requested by us.&nbsp; However, if you do not choose to give us that information, you may be unable to access or use certain features or areas of our websites and Services.</p>
<p>&nbsp;The type of personal data you will be asked to provide depends on the type of Service you use. Personal data may include, without limitation, your name, address, email address, phone numbers, exam/assessment results, language proficiency, date of birth, education records, free and reduced-cost lunch eligibility status. In some cases, the IB may collect financial information, such as bank details and credit card information, as well as travel information (including passport or contact information for next of kin).</p>
<p>&nbsp;The IB may also collect sensitive personal data such as gender, race/ethnic origin, medical or other information regarding disabilities or other conditions requiring assessment accommodations. Sensitive personal data will not be collected unless it is for a legitimate purpose.</p>
<h3>Special Considerations for Children or Students who are Minors</h3>
<p>The IB has special concerns about the privacy of all IB students or children who access our website, but in particular those who are under the age of 13 or who are over the age of 13 but are minors, i.e. under the age of majority (in many jurisdictions, this age is 18). Because the age of majority and consent can vary depending on a student user’s country of residence, the IB has adopted this age (18) as a uniform requirement. In other words, consent from both the student and parent or legal guardian may be required in order for users under 18 years of age to use some of the IB’s Services. Also, we abide by laws designed to protect children.</p>
<p>With respect to children <b>under the age of 13: </b>We do not knowingly collect, maintain or use personal data from anyone under the age of 13 through the Services.&nbsp; If you are under the age of 13, you are not allowed to subscribe to any of the Services or to create an account without the permission of your parent, guardian or teacher.&nbsp; Please do not submit any pe<b>rsonal data or information about yourself to us.</b>If a child whom we know to be under age 13 sends personal data or information to us online through the Services, we will only use that information to respond directly to that child, notify parents, or seek parental consent.</p>
<p>With respect to <b>children age 13 or older but under 18: </b>these users of the IB’s Services consent to the collection of their personal data by the IB’s Services by their use of the Services. In addition, for certain Services, the IB may also require 1) additional affirmative, opt-in consent of the users and 2) parental consent if the users of those Services are under the age of 18. Parents/guardians may be asked to provide consent by email, text message or any other method permitted under local applicable law for their children to use the following Services: Services TBD. Complete instructions will be specified in the actual request for consent sent to parents/guardians by the IB. The personal data we collect from parents giving parental consent will be treated the same as personal data collected from any other user of the IB’s Services and in accordance with this privacy policy. Parents are strongly encouraged to participate in their children's online activities and monitor their children's use of emails and engagement in other electronic communication.</p>
<h3>Special Considerations for Personal Data Provided by IB Teachers, Coordinators, School Administrators and Other Third Parties</h3>
<p>For some Services, IB coordinators, teachers and school administrators may submit personal data about IB students to the IB’s Services (e.g. registration for IB diploma programme exams on the IBIS Service). For such Services, the IB does not have a direct relationship with the individuals (e.g. students) whose personal data may be processed in connection with providing the Services. In these circumstances, the IB coordinators, teachers, and/or school administrators are responsible for ensuring that any such sharing or transfer of personal data to the IB is done accordance with applicable local law and without violating any privacy or data protection rights of any individuals, including, without limitation, providing appropriate notice to the individuals and obtaining any required consents.&nbsp; IB acknowledges that personal data and information provided to it by employees or agents of schools for certain Services may be protected under local applicable laws.</p>
<p><b>As a parent</b>, you should consult your school's policy for more information about the ability of IB coordinators, teachers and school administrators to provide personal data or consent on behalf of parents and students.</p>
<p><b>&nbsp;As an IB coordinator, teacher or school administrator</b>, you hereby confirm that you have authority to consent and/or provide personal data on behalf of your students and/or student’s parents (as the case may be) to the IB.</p>

This includes any requirements to notify individuals about the purposes, uses, transfers and sharing of their personal data by the IB as described in this Privacy Policy and to obtain consent from the person (and/or their legal guardian).
