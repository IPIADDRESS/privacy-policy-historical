              is necessary, others are left to the customer’s discretion. 
              However, failure to provide required information may lead to an 
              inability to process orders or use particular site features. We 
              do not share your customer contact information with third parties 
              for promotional purposes. </p>
            <p><br>
              <span class="subheading">Processing</span><br>
              In order to efficiently process and ship customer orders, it may 
              be necessary to share client information with intermediaries such 
              as product manufacturers and shipping/postal services. The information 
              is used strictly for these purposes. E-mails are also used to send 
              information about the ability or inability to process orders, shipping 
              details and general correspondence to the customer.</p>
            <p><br>
              <span class="subheading">Security</span><br>
              Security measures are in place to protect the loss, misuse, and 
              alteration of the information under our control. User information 
              collected while registering is collected on secure servers. When 
              purchases are made on our website, shoppers are transferred to a 
              secure server using SSL technology (“Secure Sockets Layer”)

              their credit card. We do not have access to your credit card information,

              When inquiries are made by law enforcement agencies IBPS reserves 
              the right to use discretionary measures in providing such agencies 
              with specific customer information. This is information pertaining 
              to fraud or other criminal activity that may result in liability 
              to the customer or IBPS.<br>

              by the company depending on specific client account activity. For 
              security, data stored in databases is backed up and so complete 
              removal according to customer requests should not be expected. However 
              a client can have personal information removed from active databases.<br>
