				<p>At IBPS your privacy
              is of the utmost concern to us. That is why we are dedicated to
              caring for your personal information and are firmly committed to
              assigning it the highest level of security and confidentiality.
              The following describes details on information gathering on this
              site and our use of your information.</p>

            <h4 class="subheading">Personally Identifiable Information</h4>

			<p>
              IBPS collects shopping specific customer information in an attempt
              to provide the best on-line shopping experience. The company collects
              information such as the name, address and phone number of the customer.
              Also included are information used for billing and shipping of customer
              purchases. These and other necessary personal information are collected
              on forms when voluntarily submitted to us on the site and are used
              for customer processing. While some of the information collected
              is necessary, others are left to the customer’s discretion.
              However, failure to provide required information may lead to an
              inability to process orders or use particular site features. We
              do not share your customer contact information with third parties
              for promotional purposes. </p>

              <h4 class="subheading">Processing</h4>
              <p>
              In order to efficiently process and ship customer orders, it may
              be necessary to share client information with intermediaries such
              as product manufacturers and shipping/postal services. The information
              is used strictly for these purposes. E-mails are also used to send
              information about the ability or inability to process orders, shipping
              details and general correspondence to the customer.</p>


              <h4 class="subheading">Security</h4>
              <p>

              Security measures are in place to protect the loss, misuse, and
              alteration of the information under our control. User information
              collected while registering is collected on secure servers. When
              purchases are made on our website, shoppers are transferred to a
              secure server using SSL technology (“Secure Sockets Layer”)
              supported by most major browsers to complete the transaction with
              their credit card. We do not have access to your credit card information,
              nor do we store it on our computers.<br>
            </p>

            <h4 class="subheading">Purposes of law</h4><p>
              When inquiries are made by law enforcement agencies IBPS reserves
              the right to use discretionary measures in providing such agencies
              with specific customer information. This is information pertaining
              to fraud or other criminal activity that may result in liability
              to the customer or IBPS.</p>

             <h4 class="subheading"> Accessing and Updating Your Information</h4>
              <p>
              IBPS customers have the right to personally edit and update their
              on site information. Simply by logging on to their account profile
              a customer can edit name, contact or other information. Information
              dealing with past purchases cannot be deleted but will be deactivated
              by the company depending on specific client account activity. For
              security, data stored in databases is backed up and so complete
              removal according to customer requests should not be expected. However
              a client can have personal information removed from active databases.

            </p>
            <h4 class="subheading">Privacy Policy Changes</h4>
            <p>
              At IBPS we reserve the right to make changes at any time as needed
              to our privacy policy and these changes will go into effect immediately
              upon being posted on the site. Any specific deviation from this
              will be posted on the site. For further information regarding our
              privacy policy, you may contact us at privacy@kalahare.com.
