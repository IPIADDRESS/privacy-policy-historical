	<b>Privacy Policy</b><br>
	<b>Last Updated:</b> November 3, 2007</p>
<p>
	This policy informs you of the policies of Salem Communications Corporation and its subsidiary entities (collectively, "Salem"), including without limitation the Salem and radio stations concerning the collection, use and disclosure of personal information from this Salem-related website. Because we may gather certain types of information about our users, we want to help you understand the terms and conditions surrounding the collection and use of that information. At Salem we understand your privacy is important to you. Even though we may need to collect information about you to provide you with some of our products and services, you may not want us to disclose that information to others. Accordingly, what follows is a description of how we gather and use information about you (collectively "Your Information").</p>
<p>
	<b>Please note that by visiting this website, you consent to the collection of Your Information by Salem as set forth in this Privacy Policy.</b></p>
<p>
	<b>1. Will Salem Disclose the Information It Collects to Outside Parties?</b><br>
	Generally, Salem does not sell, trade, or rent your personal information to others. However, Salem may provide aggregate statistics about our customers, traffic patterns, and related site information to third-party vendors. Generally, these statistics will include no personally identifying information. However, Salem may release Your Information when we believe, in good faith, that such release is reasonably necessary to (i) comply with the law; (ii) protect the rights, property or safety of Salem, our users, or others; (iii) enforce or apply the Terms of Use applicable to this website; or (iv) enforce contest, sweepstakes, promotions, and/or game rules. Also, we may give some or all of Your Information to third-party vendors who assist us in fulfilling some of the functions of this Website. Finally, we may provide Your Information to third parties if you authorize us to.</p>
<p>
	<b>2. What Information Do We Collect? How Do We Use It?</b></p>
<p>
	<b>Registration Data</b><br>
	Registration data is voluntary information provided directly by you in order to receive optional access to certain services or site areas. This data may include personally identifiable information such as your name, age, email address, zip code, or telephone number. In addition, registration data may include preference information such as usernames, passwords, desired newsletters, etc. Here are some of the ways we might use that information:</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		To deliver services that you request or purchase such as newsletters, offers, message boards, forums, and other items</li>
	<li>
		To help us create and deliver the content that is most relevant to you</li>

The choice is yours -- you don't have to answer surveys, but if you do, please understand that Salem may use the information you provide and that we may share it with third parties. If we're asking for optional information, we may mark it with an asterisk (*) or otherwise notify you so that you can skip that portion if you want. Here are some ways we might use that information:</p>

<p>
	<b>Contests and Sweepstakes</b><br>
	From time to time Salem runs voluntary contests and sweepstakes in which we ask for personally identifiable information such as your name, age, email address, or telephone number. That's so we can determine if you're eligible for the contest and to let you know if you win. Sometimes we request additional information such as your gender, marital status and income level.

<p>
	<b>Special Offers</b><br>
	<br>
	From time-to-time, Salem and its affiliated entities are able to provide you with special offers of products and services. When providing these offers, we need to gather personally identifiable information from you such as your name, age, email address and telephone number. Your acceptance of these offers is completely voluntary, but if you do not correctly enter the required information, you may not receive the product or service offered.

</ul>
<p>
	<b>Online Commerce Services</b><br>
	This website may offer shopping and other online commerce services, which may be offered by Salem or by a firm that operates a store under contract with us. If our website offers such services, you will use a customer order form to request information, products, and services. The order form will ask you to give us contact information (like name or email address), financial information (like account or credit card numbers), and demographic information (like zip code or age).<br>
	We will use the financial information that you provide to bill you for products and services. By giving our site your credit card and related personal information, you are authorizing our store to give that information to the merchant and credit card company in order to confirm and fulfill your order.<br>
	We will use contact information from the order form to fulfill your orders. We may also use contact data to get in touch with you when necessary. We will not otherwise use or distribute your financial information without your prior approval.</p>
<p>
	<b>Confirmed Opt-in</b><br>
	Salem acquires no personal or registration data about our users except what you explicitly and voluntarily provide (i.e., opt-in). We reserve the right to use this information specifically for the purposes related to your registration in addition to any other purpose set forth in this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>
	<b>If You Contact Us</b><br>
	We use return email addresses to answer the email we receive from you. Unless you tell us otherwise, we will not use your address for any other purpose.</p>
<p>
	<b>Feedback Data</b><br>
	Feedback data is voluntary information (such as success stories) provided directly by you for the purposes of assessing the products or services provided through Salem Web Network sites. &nbsp;There are areas on Salem Web Network owned sites which allow you to submit feedback. Any feedback you submit in these areas becomes the property of Salem Web Network, and we reserve the right to use this information for the purposes of marketing, quality control, or to contact you for further information.</p>
<p>
	<b>Usage (Log) Data</b><br>
	Salem also gathers and analyzes Usage or Log Data including your IP (internet protocol) address assigned by your ISP (internet service provider), and the type of operating system you are using on your computer, and the type of web browser you are using to view our Website. Salem management uses Usage or Log Data to help diagnose problems with and optimize performance of the server. This information also allows us to evaluate user traffic patters into, out from, and within our Website. These uses, however, do not allow us to connect your IP address with your personal identity.</p>
<p>
	<b>What About "Cookies"?</b><br>
	"Cookies" are small pieces of information that your Web browser stores on your computer's hard drive. From time to time our Website may place cookies on your computer's hard drive that enable our systems to recognize your browser and to provide you with certain features. Use of cookies also provides information about your Web usage, which helps us compile demographic and statistical information about visitors who are utilizing our Website. Our cookies may contain personally identifying information. Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually change your browser to prevent that.</p>
<p>
	<b>Correcting and Updating</b><br>

	<b>Public Forums</b><br>
	This site may make chat rooms, forums, message boards, and/or news groups available to its users. Any information you disclose in these areas becomes public information and you should exercise caution when deciding to disclose your personal information. We cannot safeguard the privacy of any such information you choose to disclose online in this manner and you should do so carefully and at your own risk. Please refer to <a href="http://l.salemweb.net/communitytermsofservice">http://l.salemweb.net/communitytermsofservice</a> for additional information about the terms of service applicable to Salem's public forums.</p>
<p>
	<b>Sale of Our Company</b><br>
	Salem may include any information we collect through this website in our customer information database. This database is considered an asset owned by Salem. As in any business venture, the sale of Salem is always a possibility, either as an entire corporate entity or through an asset sale that may include our customer information database. Should another entity ever purchase or acquire Salem or its assets, all information contained in our customer information database will be considered a transferred asset and become the property of the purchasing or acquiring entity.</p>
<p>
	<b>Links to Other Sites</b><br>
	When you visit Salem, you may be linked to other outside sites. This includes links to sites operated by advertisers, sponsors, and partners that may use Salem's logo as part of an agreement with Salem. These other sites may send their own cookies to users, collect data, or solicit personal information. These other sites may be developed by people over whom Salem exercises no control and, as such, are not subject to the Salem Privacy Policy. Salem is not responsible for the privacy policies of these other sites, nor for the use of any information that these sites may collect.</p>
<p>
	<b>Information Sharing With Third Parties</b><br>
	From time to time we may enter into a special relationship with another company that is not owned by Salem to provide additional features at this website. These special relationships may include "powered by" partners, business partners, sponsors, and co-branded sites (referred to here as "co-branded pages"). You should look for a specific privacy statement on any such co-branded page. Any personal information that you provide when signing up at one of those co-branded pages may be shared with our third party partner. You should also check our partner's website for information regarding its privacy policies.<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, the nature of some features of our site may require that we share personal information about you with persons or companies outside of the Salem corporate enterprise. For example, this may occur at a feature that enables you, via our site, to ask questions of persons or entities that are not part of the Salem enterprise. By responding to those features of the site, whether by email or direct entry of information on our website, you are consenting to our transferring that information to such persons or entities.</p>
<p>
	<b>Children's Privacy</b><br>
	Because the safety of children is very important to us, Salem will not knowingly accept personal information from children under the age of 13 without first obtaining written parental consent. A parent can give such consent by filling out and signing the <a href="http://www.crosswalk.com/parental-consent-form.html">Salem Parental Consent Form</a> and returning it to us at the contact point listed below. If a parent wishes to refuse to permit collection or use of their child's information by Salem, that parent should contact us to request deletion of their child's account.<br>
	If you have any questions or comments regarding children's privacy at Salem or if you would like to submit a signed Parental Consent Form, please contact:</p>
