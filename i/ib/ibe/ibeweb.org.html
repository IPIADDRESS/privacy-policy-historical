<p class="header">Privacy Policy</p>

<p>Thank you for visiting our website. This policy establishes how we will handle information we learn about you from your visit to our site. Please be assured that the privacy of our visitors is of utmost importance to us. We collect no personal information about you when you visit our site unless you choose to specifically provide that information to us. The only information that we do collect about you, again unless you specifically provide it, is the following: </p>

<ul>
<li>Your IP address (for security purposes) </li>
<li>The internet domain (e.g. yourisp.com) through which you have connected (for security and trends purposes) </li>
<li>The type of browser and operating system used to access our site (to assist us in improving page design)   </li>
<li>The date and time of your visit (for trends) </li>
<li>The pages you visit (for trends) </li>
<li>If you arrived from an outside link, the location of that link (for trends) </li>
</ul>

<p>The trend data collected is not specifically tied to you as a user, but goes into a general database that tells us, for example, how many times a given page was visited in a month.</p>

<p>A Word About Cookies: Unless you request to be automatically logged in when you return, we do not set cookies for your session. If you do request this service, the only information stored in the cookie is a number which identifies you to the IBE website. We do not use the cookie to track you as you move about the site. Additionally, some of our pages contain advertising, and our advertising agent may set a cookie so that you are not shown the same ad banner repeatedly.</p>

<p>Some of our web pages contain links to websites, which are not part of the IBE site. Please be aware that when you follow a link to another site, we have no control over that site and you are then subject to the privacy policies of the new site. IBE is providing these links only as a convenience. The presence of these links on any IBE website is not intended to imply IBE endorsement of that site, but to provide a convenient link to relevant sites, which are managed by other organizations, companies, or individuals.</p>

<p>If you provide us with an email address, either by sending us an email or through an online form, you will not be added to a "spam" list. We will only use your email address for purposes within the context for which it was provided.</p>

<p>We work to protect the security of your information during transmission by using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software, which encrypts information you input. We reveal only the last five digits of your credit card numbers when confirming an order. Of course, we securely transmit the entire credit card number to the appropriate credit card agency during order processing. It is important for you to protect against unauthorized access to your password and to your computer. Do not make them available to others, and we do not recommend using the automatic log in feature if you are using a shared computer.</p>

<p>We will not share any personally identifying information you give us with any government agency, private organization, or the public, without your consent or as required by law. When we collect personal information from you on behalf of another client (e.g. you register for a meeting or reserve housing), by supplying that information you are giving us your express consent to share that information with that client and its agents.</p>
