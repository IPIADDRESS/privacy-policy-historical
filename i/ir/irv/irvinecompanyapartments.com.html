In either case, non-personal information does not personally identify the individual to whom the information or data collected relates.</p>

(“Google”) and the operators of other websites or applications that run on mobile devices and tablets (“applications”) that you have visited, some of which partner with Irvine or with a display network utilized by Irvine, and may share information as permitted in such third party’s privacy policy. Non-personal information may also be obtained from inferences based upon the sites you visit, third party data, information you share on other websites, social media platforms and applications, or demographics derived from profiles you create, such as a Google profile.</p>
<p><strong>i. Cookies and other “Collection Technology”</strong></p>
<p>Non-personal information may be collected in a variety of ways, but Collection Technology is often used. “Collection Technology” refers to cookies, web beacons, pixels, gifs, tags and other technologies that collect information in similar ways. Collection Technology such as a cookie may store a piece of data on your browser or device, while other forms of Collection Technology may identify your browser or device and/or collect information through other means. When you visit the Websites or another website or application where an Irvine ad appears, your browser or device may be exposed to Collection Technology and Collection Technology may be stored on your browser or device, which may provide Irvine with non-personal information about you.</p>
<p>You may delete and/or refuse the use of certain Collection Technologies by selecting the appropriate settings on your browser. You may use the Websites even if you choose to refuse or delete such Collection Technologies; however please note that this may affect your ability to use the full functionality of the Websites.</p>
<p><strong>ii. Google Analytics</strong></p>
<p>The Websites use Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google. Google Analytics uses Collection Technology to collect and store anonymous information about you, which may include the non-personal information described above.

The Websites use these features of Google Analytics:</p>
<p>(a) “Demographics and Interest Reporting” to analyze information regarding the interests and demographics of users of the Websites. Irvine uses such non-personal information in the same manner as Irvine uses other non-personal information as described below.</p>
<p>(b) “Remarketing with Google Analytics” to place ads on other sites directed to people who have visited the Websites.</p>
<p>(c) “Google Display Network Impression Reporting” to report how people’s interactions with Irvine ads relate to their visits to the Websites.</p>

<h3>12. Third Party Postings</h3>
<p>From time to time certain third parties, such as homebuilders with whom Irvine may have a business relationship, may post information on our Websites. Irvine is not responsible for the content of these postings, or for ensuring that the third parties comply with this Privacy Policy.</p>
<h3>13. Changes To This Privacy Policy</h3>
<p>The Privacy Policy may be revised from time to time as we add new features and services, as laws change, and as industry privacy and security best practices evolve. We display an effective date on the upper left corner of the Privacy Policy (“Last Revised Date”) for you to know when there has been a change. Accordingly, you should check the Privacy Policy on a regular basis for the most current privacy practices. Each time you access, use or browse the Websites, you signify your acceptance of the then-current changes to the Privacy Policy applying to your personal information collected by us on and from the effective date of such changes.</p>
<p>Any changes in the Privacy Policy will take effect upon posting and apply only to information collected from you on and after the Last Revised Date, unless we provide notice or have other communications with you.</p>

Those who choose to access the Websites from locations outside of the United States do so on their own initiative, and are responsible for compliance with local laws if and to the extent local laws are applicable, including without limitation, all applicable laws, rules and regulations regarding the transmission of data exported from the United States or the country in which you reside. Irvine may limit a Website’s availability, in whole or in part, to any person, geographic area or jurisdiction, at any time in its sole discretion.</p>
