</p><p>
<b>6.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Description</b>.  If indicated by an IronClad Assurance® inspection certification icon in an Equipment listing, a general condition inspection ("<b>Inspection</b>") of the Equipment was performed by or on behalf of IronPlanet.  Based on the Inspection, an inspection report ("<b>Inspection Report</b>") was generated that includes ratings, comments, and photos of the various components of the Equipment.  IronPlanet Inspections and the Inspection Reports are solely for the purpose of reporting on the visible condition of the Equipment's major systems and attachments on the day of the Inspection and do not include load testing or digging/lifting.  IronPlanet Inspections are <u>NOT intended</u> to detect latent or hidden defects or conditions that could only be found by dismantling the Equipment or use of diagnostic equipment or techniques.  In no event shall IronPlanet be liable for not identifying those or any other defects.  The Inspection Report may not be displayed, published, sold, reproduced, disseminated or otherwise used by you without the prior written approval from IronPlanet. 
</p><p>
<b>6.2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;IronClad Assurance Dispute Claims</b>.  Under the IronClad Assurance inspection certification program, if you discover that a piece of Equipment purchased by you is not substantially in the condition as represented in the Inspection Report,  and Constructive Receipt (as defined below) of the Equipment has not occurred, you may submit a written dispute claim ("<b>Dispute Claim</b>") to IronPlanet.  To be considered, the Dispute Claim must be in writing and delivered to IronPlanet as specified herein.    
</p><p>
<b>6.3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Constructive Receipt</b>.  For purposes of the Buyer Terms, "<b>Constructive Receipt</b>" of Equipment occurs at the first occurrence of any of the following:

<li><b>Passage of Time</b> - Ten (10) business days after the conclusion of the Auction.  
</li><li><b>Self-Transported Equipment (e.g., vehicles or self-transported items)</b> - At the time the Equipment leaves the point of pick-up at the Seller's location for Equipment.  You are encouraged to examine the Equipment thoroughly prior to removing it from the location.  
</li><li><b>Transported via Common Carrier</b> - Twenty-four (24) hours after delivery of the Equipment to (a) the Buyer's designated location within the United States or Canada for Equipment sold from the United States or Canada or (b) to the Buyer's designated location within the European Union member states, Switzerland and Norway for Equipment sold from such countries.  (If the expiration of the 24-hour period falls on a Saturday, Sunday or a public Holiday, Constructive Receipt on the basis of the passing of this milestone shall not occur until the sooner of (i) the first non-weekend day or (ii) the first non-public Holiday).  
</li><li><b>Export</b> - Twenty-four (24) hours after delivery of the Equipment to the relevant port of export, if the purchased Equipment is to be delivered outside the country where the Equipment is located, subject to the Common Carrier provisions  above for Equipment located in the United States and Canada.

</li><li>Following the closing of the Auction, Ownership of the Equipment shall not have been transferred to another buyer.  
</li><li>The Equipment must be available for immediate re-inspection by IronPlanet upon request.

</li><li>Until a Dispute Claim is resolved, the Equipment may not be used, rented or leased and no changes to the condition of Equipment such as repairs or disassembly may be made.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, Buyer may move the Equipment around the lot, load/unload the Equipment, and operate the Equipment to verify the reported inspection condition after receipt of the Equipment; provided however that such operation does not result in the use of the Equipment for more than the lesser of (i) five (5) hours or (ii) ten (10) odometer miles from what is reported in the Inspection Report.    
</li><li>IronPlanet shall not be responsible for Dispute Claims filed due to changes in Equipment condition as a result of exposure to the elements, including damage that occurs during transportation.

<b><i>The Key Seller Points above provide an overview of our terms and conditions for participating as a seller in IronPlanet's online auction marketplace and are subject to the complete Seller Terms and Conditions below.   
</i></b>
</p><p>
<b>SELLER TERMS AND CONDITIONS</b>
</p><p>
These Seller Terms and Conditions, including the commissions and fees detailed in <a href="#schedule1">Schedule 1</a>, ("<b>Seller Terms</b>") govern (i) the sale of equipment or other items ("<b>Equipment</b>") through direct contact with Buyers, IronPlanet-operated websites (e.g., www.ironplanet.com, eu.IronPlanet.com and www.truckplanet.com), and any third party online auction (each a "<b>Site</b>") and (ii) the provision of related services by IronPlanet.  These Seller Terms are incorporated by reference into any separate agreement for the listing of Equipment on the Site (such as IronPlanet's form of Auction Listing Agreement, Auction Services Agreement, or Preferred Provider Agreement, each a "<b>Listing Agreement</b>") entered into between you ("<b>Seller</b> or "<b>you</b>") and IronPlanet.  The auction services provided by IronPlanet include Featured Auctions, the Daily Marketplace, and auctions promoted through other channels, including third party auctions sites (together, the "<b>Auction(s)</b>").  Unless otherwise noted in a Listing Agreement, if you are a Seller located within the European Union, Norway and Switzerland, you are contracting with IronPlanet Limited, an entity organized under the laws of Ireland.  For Sellers in Canada, you are contracting with Entreprises IronPlanet Canada, a corporation organized under the laws of the Province of Alberta.  In the United States and for all other Sellers, you are contracting with IronPlanet, Inc., a Delaware corporation.
</p><p>

Prior to the commencement of any Auction Period (as defined below), you must have entered into a signed Listing Agreement with IronPlanet.  In the event of a conflict between the Seller Terms and the Listing Agreement, the Listing Agreement shall control.  The Seller Terms, together with the Listing Agreement (together, the "<b>Agreement</b>"), contain the entire agreement of the parties with respect to the sale of Equipment by IronPlanet and supersede all previous communications, representations, understandings and agreements, either oral or written, between us.  These Seller Terms supersede and replace the terms in any Seller purchase order or other ordering document and the terms and conditions of such documents shall be of no force or effect.
</p><p>

IronPlanet may, in its sole discretion, modify, add or remove any portion of these Seller Terms, in whole or in part, from time to time with or without notice to you, by posting such changes on the Site, which you agree is sufficient notice to you.  Once posted such changes shall come into full force and effect.  However, no changes shall apply retroactively to Equipment already listed in an Auction at the time of posting.  In addition to other forms of acceptance, use of the Site constitutes acceptance of these Seller Terms, and your continued use of the Site for the sale of Equipment after such changes are posted constitutes your agreement to such changed Seller Terms.  As a California-based company that operates an online auction service and marketplace, IronPlanet, Inc. has a bond (#70259768) on file with the Secretary of State of California.    
</p><p>

The Seller Terms were last revised on April 12, 2013.

<b>1.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Authorization</b>.  You hereby authorize IronPlanet to sell Equipment, and IronPlanet hereby accepts the authorization and agrees to act as specified in these Seller Terms. You agree that IronPlanet may use your name, trademark, logos, service marks and other designations ("<b>Marks</b>") to list you as a reference customer and to advertise, promote and market the Equipment and the Auction, including but not limited to advertising, promotions, and similar public disclosures, and on the Site.  You hereby grant to IronPlanet, and represent and warrant that you have a right to grant, a non-exclusive, worldwide license to use, publicly display and perform, reproduce, and distribute the Marks, solely as permitted in these Seller Terms, including, but not limited to, distributing e-mails to potential Buyers that incorporate Marks.
</p><p>
<b>1.2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Offer to Sell</b>.  You acknowledge and agree that with each Equipment Listing you are extending an irrevocable offer to sell the Equipment (i) to the highest bidder who meets or exceeds the opening bid ("<b>Opening Bid</b>") with respect to a Featured Auction or third party auction with an opening bid, or (ii) to the highest bidder who meets or exceeds the reserve price ("<b>Reserve Price</b>") for Daily Marketplace Auctions or third party auctions where a Reserve Price is set.
</p><p>
<b>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;OWNERSHIP CERTIFICATION, VERIFICATION AND LIEN SEARCHES</b>.  At the time of listing Equipment, you are responsible to make full representation and disclosure in writing to IronPlanet of all liens, adverse claims and other title encumbrances and third party interests that may exist on or pertain to your Equipment.  Further, you unconditionally authorize IronPlanet to contact and verify with your creditors all outstanding encumbrance balances that may affect or compromise the assignment of the Equipment to a new Buyer. You covenant that you will, at all times at your own cost and expense, warrant and defend such title to such Equipment on behalf of such Buyer, its successors and assigns, against the claims and demands of all persons. You will cause to be promptly and duly taken, executed, acknowledged or delivered all such further acts, conveyances, documents and assurances as the Buyer may reasonably request in order to evidence and confirm such title and its conveyance.
</p><p>
<b>2.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lien Removal by IronPlanet</b>.  If you fail to remove any lien, encumbrance or adverse claim on or to any Equipment sold or fail to perform or comply with any other of its obligations under these Seller Terms, IronPlanet will remove such lien, encumbrance or adverse claim using the Seller net proceeds.  If your net proceeds from the Auction are insufficient to discharge creditor claims on the Equipment, you are fully responsible for paying the outstanding debt balance immediately.  In addition, you shall pay IronPlanet upon demand all of IronPlanet's expenses incurred in connection with any removal of any liens or the performance thereof, as the case may be, together with interest thereon at the rate of 10% per annum compounded daily.  No such payment or performance by IronPlanet shall be deemed to waive breach by you, or relieve you, of your creditor obligations. 
</p><p>
<b>2.2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Title and Lien Searches by IronPlanet</b>.  In its sole discretion, IronPlanet may independently carry out title and lien searches to investigate the existence of filed financing statements (such as UCC financing statements for Equipment in the United States) on the Equipment that may compromise assignment of the Equipment to a new Buyer. IronPlanet may charge the Seller an Ownership Verification and Lien Search Fee. 
</p><p>
<b>2.3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;IRS and SBA Liens</b>.  If the Internal Revenue Service, the Small Business Administration or any other governmental entity holds and lien or encumbrance on the Equipment, then Seller shall be responsible for the payment of any independent equipment appraisals and documentation fees required to release such liens.   Seller acknowledges and agrees, and hereby authorizes, that IronPlanet may, in is discretion, pay for such appraisals and documentation fees and deduct the same from amounts due Seller.  If amounts due Seller are insufficient to pay such amounts, Seller agrees to promptly pay IronPlanet such amounts upon receipt of IronPlanet's invoice for the same. 
</p><p>

"<b>Auction Period</b>" means the period from the date of the Listing Agreement until the earlier of (i) the date such Equipment is sold on the Site or (ii) the date you withdraw the Equipment from the Site.  The Auction Period shall be no less than eight (8) weeks.  Removal of Equipment Listings during the Auction Period may be subject to additional fees as provided in these Seller Terms.  
</p><p>
<b>3.2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Listing Details</b>.  Any information you provide related to the Equipment ("<b>Listing Details</b>") must be complete and accurate. You shall be solely liable for any inaccuracies, errors or omissions in the Listing Details provided or omitted by you.  Any brand name or other indication of origin or manufacture included with the Listing Details must be completely accurate and not capable of misleading any Buyer. Listing Details compiled for the Site shall not be used for any purpose other than the publication of the applicable Equipment Listing on the Site.  Listing Details on the Site may not include links to, or description of, other items that you may have for sale. For Auctions with IronPlanet Limited, it is the Seller's obligation to provide a valid CE Certificate to ensure the necessary measures are taken to certify the item as required under the Machinery Directive 98/37/EC (as amended) and other applicable legislation. All costs of certifying and upgrading imported equipment will be the responsibility of Buyer. Please contact the manufacturer, dealer, or their authorized representative within the EU for details. You may not list goods that are illegal to use or possess under any applicable law, rule or regulation.  IronPlanet reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to (i) refuse to list any piece of Equipment at any time; (ii) to withdraw any Equipment Listing from the Site; or (iii) cancel any transaction that it deems to be suspicious or fraudulent and report the same to applicable authorities. 
</p><p>
<b>3.3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Changes to Listing Details.</b>  If at any time prior to the opening time of an Auction ("<b>Auction Opening Time</b>") the Equipment is altered or modified in any way which might affect the accuracy of the Listing Details, then (i) you shall provide prompt notice to IronPlanet; and (ii) if the Equipment was inspected previously by IronPlanet, you must have the Equipment re-inspected and pay IronPlanet a Re-Inspection Fee.  If the Equipment was not inspected, you must supply updated Listing Details to IronPlanet and pay IronPlanet an additional Listing Fee. 
</p><p>
<b>3.4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Restrictions on Use of Equipment</b>.  From the time of Equipment Listing and until the Buyer removes the Equipment from your location, you may not operate, lease, rent, modify, use or allow the Equipment to be altered in any way which might affect the accuracy of the Listing Details.

</p><p>
<b>3.5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Equipment Inspections</b>.  For Equipment that is to be inspected and to be identified with IronPlanet's IronClad Assurance icon, you agree to permit IronPlanet and/or its authorized representatives to test and inspect each piece of Equipment prior to listing at a time and place specified in the Listing Agreement or as otherwise mutually agreed.  Upon inspection, IronPlanet shall produce an inspection report ("<b>Inspection Report</b>") for each piece of Equipment, which may include ratings, comments, and photos of the various components.  The data and information from the Inspection Report will be included as part of the Listing Details for the Equipment.  IronPlanet inspections and the Inspections Reports are solely for the purpose of reporting on the visible condition of the Equipment's major systems and attachments on the day of the inspection and do not include load testing or digging/lifting.  IronPlanet inspections are NOT intended to detect latent or hidden defects or conditions that could only be found in connection with the physical dismantling of the Equipment or the use of diagnostic equipment or techniques.  In no event shall IronPlanet be liable for not identifying those or any other defects. 
</p><p>
<b>3.5.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inspection Process</b>.  If required you agree to provide certain support functions to IronPlanet during the inspection of the Equipment, including without limitation providing an Equipment operator and supplying proper safety equipment and procedures for IronPlanet to inspect the Equipment.  During the inspection process, an IronPlanet inspector will either (i) observe the operation of the Equipment by a qualified operator provided by the Seller or (ii) in the absence of such an operator, operate the Equipment as necessary to conduct the inspection.  IronPlanet reserves the right to refuse to inspect any piece of Equipment for any reason. 
</p><p>
<b>3.5.2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ownership of Inspection Report</b>. The Inspection Report is the sole and exclusive property of IronPlanet.  Except as expressly stated, nothing in these Seller Terms shall be deemed to grant to any other party, by implication, estoppel or otherwise, license rights, ownership rights or any other intellectual property rights in the Inspection Report.  You cannot use the Inspection Report for any other purpose without the prior written approval from IronPlanet. 
</p><p>
<b>3.5.3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maintenance of Equipment Following Inspection</b>.  Failure of you to properly maintain the Equipment between the date of inspection and the date of sale will void the inspection.  If you alter or perform repairs or other maintenance to the Equipment after the inspection, another inspection will be required and you will be subject to a Re-inspection Fee.   
</p><p>
<b>3.5.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Post Sale Re-inspection</b>.  IronPlanet reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to re-inspect any Equipment after the Auction Closing time at its cost. 
</p><p>
<b>3.6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Delivery of Title and Documentation</b>.  Two (2) weeks prior to any Auction Opening Time, you shall deliver to IronPlanet documents evidencing your title to the Equipment, including, as applicable, the original Department of Motor Vehicles title (for the United States), any vehicle registration documents, manufacturer certificate of origin and any and all other documents required under your local law to transfer and register title and/or ownership of the Equipment to any Buyer.  Prior to delivery to IronPlanet, you shall properly endorse title documents in compliance with the applicable local law requirements. You shall either endorse such documents or execute a power of attorney in favor of IronPlanet permitting IronPlanet to execute any such documents on your behalf and authorizing IronPlanet/the Buyer to complete any registration formalities on your behalf.  
</p><p>
<b>3.7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Relisting</b>.  If the Equipment has not been inspected and is not sold prior to the closing time, you may withdraw your Equipment Listing and re-list the Equipment in any Auction without additional charge.

<b>3.8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Equipment Availability; Delay and Default Fees</b>.  Seller agrees to have the Equipment available for transportation, complete with ignition key, to the Buyer no later than one (1) business day after the conclusion of the Auction.  If, for any reason, after IronPlanet has notified you of receipt of payment from the Buyer, you either do not have the Equipment in a "ready" condition for transport at such time or you delay the release of your Equipment to the Buyer, then in addition to any other rights and remedies IronPlanet may have, you agree to pay a Post-Closing Delay Fee.  If for any reason you fail to release the Equipment to the Buyer after an Auction has closed, in addition to any other rights or remedies IronPlanet may have, you agree to pay Seller Default Fee.

</p><p>
<b>3.9.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Specific Performance</b>.  In addition to any other remedies set forth herein, if you cancel an Auction and withdraw the Equipment within two (2) weeks prior to the Auction Opening Time or if you fail to have the equipment available for transportation no later than one (1) business day (pursuant to Paragraph 3.8), you hereby acknowledge and agree that (i) the damages to IronPlanet's business reputation, brand and customer are significant and irreparable, (ii) an adequate remedy at law for such breach is inadequate, and (iii) IronPlanet may seek enforcement of this Agreement by means of specific performance or injunction, without any requirement to post a bond or other security. 
</p><p>
<b>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;LIABILITY FOR EQUIPMENT</b>.  The responsibility and risk of loss for Equipment shall be and remain with you (and not IronPlanet) until the earlier of:  (i) the removal of the Equipment from the posted Equipment location by Buyer or Buyer's designated transportation provider or (ii) receipt by you of all proceeds from the sale of Equipment.  Thereafter, the Equipment shall be and remain at the risk of Buyer or Buyer's designated transportation provider (and not IronPlanet). 
</p><p>
<b>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NO PRICE MANIPULATION OR SHILL BIDDING</b>
</p><p>
<b>5.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Price Manipulation</b>.  You may not manipulate, directly or indirectly, the price of Equipment by any means, including but not limited to, using secondary accounts and aliases, colluding with third parties or bidding on your own Equipment.  If you fail to comply with this restriction, in addition to any other rights or remedies IronPlanet may have, IronPlanet may withdraw the Equipment from Auction and you will be barred from future use of the Site.
</p><p>
<b>5.2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shill Bidding Disqualification</b>.  If IronPlanet determines that a Seller or someone associated with a Seller, directly or indirectly through a third party, has bid on that seller's own item in an effort to artificially raise the price at which the Equipment will ultimately sell, ("<b>shill bidding</b>"), IronPlanet will ban the seller from future use of the IronPlanet Site and cancel any involved transaction(s), and the Seller will be charged a Shill Bidding Fee. 
</p><p>
<b>5.3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Opening Bid and Scheduling</b>.  IronPlanet shall set the Opening Bid for the Equipment.  IronPlanet shall control the schedule for Auction Opening Time for Featured Auctions.  You have the option of scheduling the Auction Opening Time for Equipment in the Daily Marketplace.  All Equipment in the Daily Marketplace will be scheduled to run for seven (7) consecutive days, unless the Daily Marketplace closing time falls on the day of an IronPlanet Featured Auction, in which case the Equipment listing will be scheduled to run for eight (8) consecutive days.   
</p><p>
<b>5.4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reserve Price</b>.  You may not set a Reserve Price for Equipment in the Featured Auction.  You may set a Reserve Price for Equipment in the Daily Marketplace.  You have the option of lowering your Reserve Price once during an auction.  However, you may NOT add a Reserve Price after the time of Equipment Listing.
</p><p>
<b>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;FEES AND PAYMENT</b>.
</p><p>
<b>6.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fees</b>.  The fees and conditions for the applicable Auction type are set forth in <a href="#schedule1">Schedule 1</a> and incorporated herein by reference.  IronPlanet may change its fees from time to time, in its sole discretion, with or without notice to you, but no such change shall apply retroactively to Equipment already listed for an Auction at the time of such change.  It is your responsibility to check all applicable fees prior to submitting an Equipment Listing.  By submitting an Equipment Listing, you acknowledge that you have reviewed and accepted all fees as detailed in <a href="#schedule1">Schedule 1</a>.
</p><p>
<b>6.2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Payment of Proceeds</b>.  No monies shall be payable to Seller for any part of the Equipment until paid by the Buyer.  Once received by IronPlanet from Buyer, any monies due to the Seller, net of any fees and charges due IronPlanet, shall be disbursed within fifteen (15) business days after the date of sale.  Payments by IronPlanet shall be paid in the listing currency and shall be made by either electronic wire transfer or check (subject to additional fees for overnight courier).  If any charges are imposed as provided in these Seller Terms, whether as specified herein or as a result of additional services provided by IronPlanet at the request and authorization of Seller, IronPlanet reserves the right, and you hereby consent that IronPlanet may, offset any such charges from amounts due you and invoice you for the remainder, with the invoice to be paid within fifteen (15) days following the date of the invoice.   
</p><p>
<b>6.3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Taxes; VAT</b>.  You shall be responsible for the payment of any tax or duty that is your responsibility as a seller of the Equipment. The remainder of this Section shall apply for Auctions through IronPlanet Limited.  All bids and offers must be net of any VAT imposed with respect to the sale or purchase transaction. Buyers are liable for all such taxes for all purchases. IronPlanet will remit taxes to the Buyer upon receipt of either a valid exemption certificate or bill of lading. Accordingly, the amount of the successful bid in respect of any item of Equipment shall be exclusive of VAT and the price payable by the successful Buyer shall be increased by the VAT chargeable in respect of the supply of the Equipment to the Buyer. Similarly, all fees and other amounts payable to IronPlanet howsoever arising pursuant to these Seller Terms are calculated without regard to VAT so the amount payable by the user shall be increased by the amount of VAT which may be chargeable in respect of the relevant supply. In order to participate in the Services, each Seller who would otherwise be entitled to raise a VAT invoice addressed to IronPlanet in respect of the sale of Equipment at an Auction agrees not to raise such an invoice and instead to accept a VAT invoice raised by IronPlanet on its behalf in relation to Equipment sold at Auction (i.e. a self-billed invoice). IronPlanet shall promptly raise an appropriate 'self-billing' invoice after an item of Equipment is sold at Auction. Each Seller shall enter their VAT registration number on becoming a registered user and shall immediately notify IronPlanet if that number ceases to be valid for any reason. You shall indemnify IronPlanet and its Affiliates (and the officers, directors, agents and employees thereof) against any tax, cost or expense relating to your failure to satisfy any VAT chargeable in relation to a transaction. For the avoidance of doubt, it is your responsibility to satisfy yourself that any VAT charges or related obligations have been met in relation to a transaction.  For the purposes of these Seller Terms, "VAT" means value added tax as provided for in the Value Added Tax Acts 1972-2008 and legislation supplemental thereto or in any primary or secondary legislation promulgated by the European Union or any official body or agency thereof and any tax similar or equivalent to value added tax imposed in any country other than the Republic of Ireland and any similar or turnover tax which replaces or is introduced in addition to any of the same.   
</p><p>
<b>6.4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No Guarantee on Proceeds</b>.  You acknowledge that despite IronPlanet's best efforts, Buyers may fail to perform or pay on a timely basis and that IronPlanet shall not have any liability to you for any act or omission of Buyers.  Further, there is no guarantee as to the gross proceeds that may be realized from the sale of Equipment through the Site.
</p><p>
<b>7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SELLER OPTIONS AFTER BUYER DEFAULT</b>.  If the Buyer does not make payments in accordance with the payment schedule set forth in the Buyer Terms and Conditions, the Buyer is considered in default ("<b>Buyer Default</b>").  In the event of a Buyer Default, you may elect any one of the following options after IronPlanet notifies you of such Buyer Default.
</p><p>
<b>7.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Offer Equipment</b> to Second Highest Bidder at Second Highest Bid Price.  If there was more than one bidder for the defaulted Equipment, you may elect to offer the Equipment to the second highest bidder in the auction at the maximum bid amount entered by the second highest bidder.  By electing to extend an offer for the Equipment to the second highest bidder, you acknowledge and agree that you are extending an irrevocable offer to sell the Equipment if your offer is accepted.  The second highest bidder will have one (1) business day to decide whether to accept the winner's position for the Auction.  If the second highest bidder accepts the winner's position, your Equipment will be sold and you will receive proceeds based on that second bidder's highest bid, less any applicable commissions and fees, in accordance with the terms and conditions of these Seller Terms;
</p><p>
<b>7.2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Re-list the Equipment for Subsequent Auction</b>.  You may elect to list the Equipment in one subsequent Auction within the next thirty (30) days without incurring an additional Listing Fee. All other terms and conditions of these Seller Terms continue to be enforced for any such re-listing; or
</p><p>
<b>7.3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Withdraw the Equipment from Auction</b>.  You may elect, without penalty, to withdraw the Equipment from Auction.
</p><p>
<b>8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES</b>. As Seller, you represent and warrant that: (i) the Equipment is in a safe condition and free of hazardous materials; (ii) all Listing Details you provide and all answers to questions from IronPlanet shall be truthful, accurate and complete, and shall accurately represent the condition of the Equipment until removed from your location by the Buyer;  (iii) no Equipment you list on the Site shall be fraudulent, stolen or counterfeit; (iv) you are duly authorized to enter into these Seller Terms and you have the legal right in your jurisdiction to list the Equipment for sale and to sell such Equipment; (v) you are solvent and have not made any assignment, proposal or other proceeding for the benefit of your creditors; and (vi) you own all right, title and interest in and to the Equipment and the Equipment is free and clear of all liens or other encumbrances, except as otherwise disclosed by you to IronPlanet in writing.   
</p><p>
<b>9.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;INDEMNIFICATION</b>.  You agree to indemnify and hold harmless IronPlanet, its affiliated companies and their respective officers, directors, employees, agents, successors and assigns from and against any and all claims, suits, proceedings, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees and costs, including costs and fees of experts), losses, liabilities, and damages, actual and consequential, of every kind and nature, arising out of or relating to the Equipment, or the auction or sale thereof, including but not limited to, breach of your representations, warranties and covenants set forth in these Seller Terms.  If a third party brings a claim, suit or proceeding against IronPlanet arising out of or relating to the Equipment, including without limitation its condition, or the auction or sale thereof, you will provide IronPlanet with full information and cooperation in connection.  You agree that if a Buyer takes legal action against you arising from, but not limited to, your representations, warranties and covenants listed above, IronPlanet may support such action by providing the Buyer with any relevant documentation or information.  IronPlanet shall promptly notify you in writing of any threatened or actual claim or suit and reasonably cooperate with you to facilitate the settlement or defense thereof.  You shall have sole control of the defense or settlement of any claim or suit, provided that IronPlanet, at its option and expense, may participate and appear on an equal footing with you and you shall not settle any claim or suit against without the written consent of indemnified parties, with such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed.
</p><p>
<b>10.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DISCLAIMER; LIMITATION OF LIABILITY </b>

<b>10.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Disclaimer</b>.
