CIÉ may share customer information across CIÉ-owned business entities and companies working on our behalf.</p>
<p>CIÉ contracts with third-party service providers and suppliers to deliver complete products and services.

<h3>Your Choices</h3>
<p>CIÉ gives you the choice of receiving a variety of information that complements our products and services. You can subscribe to receive certain product and service specific information and CIÉ-wide marketing communications. CIÉ-wide communications may include new product information, special offers, or an invitation to participate in market research. We give you a choice regarding delivery of CIÉ-wide communications by postal mail, e-mail and telephone. We will make every effort to honour your preferences. This option does not apply to communications for the purpose of administering order completion.</p>
<h3>Your Privacy Preference and Opting Out</h3>
<p>Examples of unrelated uses include sending communications about special offers, product information, and marketing messages. You can, however, choose to receive these types of communications by following the instructions at the time of entering your personal data ("opt-in").</p>
<p>To opt-out of receiving communications you have expressly requested (such as e-mail newsletters, software updates, etc.), use any of the following methods:</p>
<ul>
<li>Select the e-mail "opt-out" or "unsubscribe" link, or follow the opt-out instructions included in each subscription communication</li>
<li>Return to the Web page(s) where you originally registered your preferences and follow the opt-out instructions</li>

<h3><br>Access To and Accuracy of your Information</h3>
<p>CIÉ strives to keep your personal information accurate. We have implemented technology, management processes and policies to maintain customer data accuracy. We will provide you with access to your information, including making reasonable effort to provide you with online access and the opportunity to change your information.

Certain areas of CIÉ websites may limit access to specific individuals through the use of passwords and other personal identifiers.</p>
<h3>Keeping your Information Secure</h3>
<p>CIÉ is committed to protecting the information you provide. To prevent unauthorized access or disclosure, to maintain data accuracy, and to ensure the appropriate use of the information, CIÉ has in place appropriate physical and managerial procedures to safeguard the information we collect.</p>
<p>When you purchase travel tickets online or access your personal profile you can do so through a secure server. The use of Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology means that all personal information, such as your credit/debit card number, will be encrypted as it travels from your computer to the CIÉ Online Booking Engine. When received, the information is decrypted and processed in the same way as a normal card transaction by telephone. This security measure is working when you see either the symbol of an unbroken key or closed lock (depending on your browser) on the bottom of your browser window.</p>
<p>If your browser supports SSL, and if you entered our site via our secure server access, then transmission of any sensitive data will be protected. If your browser does not support SSL, we recommend that you upgrade to the latest version of any browser to enhance the security of further transactions, otherwise the transmission of your personal data may not be protected and CIÉ disclaims any responsibility in this regard.</p>
<h3>Changes to this Statement</h3>
<p>If there are updates to the terms of CIÉ's Privacy Statement, we will post those changes and update the revision date in this document, so you will always know what information we collect online, how we use it, and what choices you have.</p>
<h3>Contacting Us</h3>
<p>CIÉ values your opinions. If you have comments or questions about our Privacy Policy, please send them to the CIÉ Webmaster or write to us at the following address:</p>

<p><strong>Revision: October 2004</strong></p>
<p>1. A URL (Uniform Resource Locator) is the global address of documents and other resources on the World Wide Web. For example, <a href="http://www.CIE.ie">http://www.CIE.ie</a> is the URL for CIÉ's home page.</p>
<p>2. An IP address is an identifier for a computer or device on a Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) network, such as the World Wide Web. Networks use the TCP/IP protocol to route information based on the IP address of the destination. In other words, an IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you are surfing the Web, allowing Web servers to locate and identify your computer. Computers require IP addresses in order for users to communicate on the Internet, browse and shop.</p>

<h2><a id="Iarnród Éireann Irish Rail Official Apps"></a>Iarnród Éireann Irish Rail Official Apps</h2>
<p>Our Apps use certain phone features to enhance user experience. Below we have provided a summary of the device features the apps may use and the reasoning why we use them.&nbsp; <br><br>At all times if you no longer wish for the app to use any of the features below, please go to you Apple device settings or Android Permissions Manager to amend access.</p>
<p><strong>Storage</strong> - The permission is needed to be able to move the app to the SD card. The app needs to be able to read and write its own data afterwards. This is an Android feature allows the smartphone owner to free up as much internal / device memory as possible or help them if they change to a new handset.<br><br><strong>Network Communication - </strong>This is necessary because the app needs to connect with our servers when queries are run which returns results to the smartphone on real-time and static train information. We are using live data because it is not possible to operate an offline version given the nature of the rail environment. There is also a check whether an internet connection is available.<br><br><strong>Your Location</strong> - The app features an option to show stations nearby using Maps &amp; Geo-tagging, so we need to know where the user is for this to work. Raw coordinates are sent to our servers to get a list of stations in the vicinity. The position is only used once and is not stored permanently.<br><br><strong>Your personal information - </strong>This permission allows the app to read and write data to the device's calendar. The user can save trips to his calendar, so we need to be able to store the events. We use the reading permission to get a list of all calendars available as there may be more than one, so the user can choose which calendar the trip will be saved in. We do not read or manipulate any existing calendar entries.<br><br>This permission allows the user to place shortcuts on the device's home screen so the they have quick access to certain queries. This saves the user having to re-enter an origin and destination for every journey.</p>

<p><strong>15.</strong> Each of the provisions of these Terms is severable and if any provision is held by any court or other competent authority to be illegal, void or unenforceable in whole or in part, the legality, validity and enforceability of the remaining provisions shall not be affected or impaired thereby.</p>
<p><strong>16.</strong> These Terms shall be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of Ireland and you submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of Ireland.</p>
