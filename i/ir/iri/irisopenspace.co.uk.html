<p></p>
<p>
	We may collect and process the following data about you:
</p>
<p>

<p>
	</p><h2>IP addresses and cookies</h2>
<p></p>
<p>
	We may collect information about your computer, including where available your IP address, operating system and browser type, for system administration and
	to report aggregate information to our advertisers. This is statistical data about our users' browsing actions and patterns, and does not identify any
	individual.
</p>
<p>
	For the same reason, we may obtain information about your general internet usage by using a cookie file which is stored on the hard drive of your computer.
	Cookies contain information that is transferred to your computer's hard drive. They help us to improve our Websites and to deliver a better and more
	personalised service. They enable us:
</p>
<p>
	· To estimate our audience size and usage pattern.
</p>
<p>
	· To store information about your preferences, and so allow us to customise our Websites according to your individual interests.
</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		To speed up your searches.
	</li>
</ul>
<p>
	· To recognise you when you return to our Websites.
</p>
<p>
	We may also use cookies to collect data about your use of our Websites, to remember choices you make, to provide more enhanced personal features and to
	assist you to navigate certain areas of our Website. If you wish to use social sharing features in relation to items on our Websites, you may also need to
	consent to the use of certain third party cookies required by the relevant social networking websites.
</p>
<p>
	You may refuse to accept cookies by activating the setting on your browser which allows you to refuse the setting of cookies. However, if you select this
	setting you may be unable to access certain parts of our Websites. Unless you have adjusted your browser setting so that it will refuse cookies, our system
	will issue cookies when you log on to our Websites.
</p>
<p>
	Please note that our advertisers or other third parties who publish information on our Websites may also use cookies, over which we have no control.
</p>
<p>
To learn more about the cookies we use and to manage your choices in relation to their use, please see our Cookies Policy <a href="/Home/CookiePolicy">here</a>.
</p>
<p>
	</p><h2>Where we store your personal data</h2>
<p></p>
<p>
	The data that we collect from you may be transferred to, and stored at, a destination outside the European Economic Area ("EEA"). It may also be processed
	by staff, operating outside the EEA who work for us or for one of our suppliers. Such staff maybe engaged in, among other things, the fulfilment of your
	order, the processing of your payment details and the provision of support services. By submitting your personal data, you agree to this transfer, storing
	or processing.
</p>
<p>
	All information you provide to us is stored on our secure servers. Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password which enables you to
	access certain parts of our Websites, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to share a password with anyone.
</p>
<p>
	Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we will do our best to protect your personal data, we
	cannot guarantee the security of your data transmitted to our Websites; any transmission is at your own risk. Once we have received your information, we
	will use strict procedures and security features to try to prevent unauthorised access.
</p>
<p>
	</p><h2>Uses made of the information</h2>
<p></p>
<p>
	We use information held about you in the following ways:
</p>
<p>
	· To ensure that content from our Websites is presented in the most effective manner for you and for your computer.
</p>
<p>
	· To provide you with information, products or services that you request from us or which we feel may interest you, where you have consented to be
	contacted for such purposes.
</p>
<p>
	· To carry out our obligations arising from any contracts entered into between you and us.
</p>
<p>
	· To allow you to participate in interactive features of our service, when you choose to do so.
</p>
<p>
	· To allow you to participate in our competitions and promotions, when you choose to do so.
</p>
<p>
	· To notify you about changes to our service.
</p>
<p>
	<br>
	If you are an existing customer, we will only contact you by electronic means (e-mail or SMS) with information about goods and services similar to those
	which were the subject of a previous sale to you.
</p>
<p>
	If you are a new customer, and where we permit selected third parties to use your data, we (or they) will contact you by electronic means only if you have
	consented to this.
</p>
<p>
	</p><h2>Your rights</h2>
<p></p>
<p>
	You have the right to ask us not to process your personal data for marketing purposes. We will usually inform you (before collecting your data) if we
	intend to use your data for such purposes. You can exercise your right to prevent such processing by writing to Data Controller, IRIS Software Group
	Limited, Riding Court House, Riding Court Road, Datchet SL3 9JT.
</p>
<p>
	</p><h2>Disclosure of your information</h2>
<p></p>
<p>
	We may disclose your personal information to any member of our group, which means our subsidiaries, our ultimate holding company and its subsidiaries, as
	defined in section 736 of the UK Companies Act 2006.
</p>
<p>
	In the event that we sell or buy any business or assets we may disclose your personal data to the prospective seller or buyer of such business or assets.
</p>
<p>
	In the event that substantially all of our assets are acquired by a third party purchaser, the personal data of our customers will be one of the
	transferred assets.
</p>
<p>
	We may disclose your personal information to third parties if we are under a duty to disclose or share your personal data in order to comply with any legal
	obligation, or in order to enforce or apply our terms of use and other agreements; or to protect our rights, property, or safety (or that of our customers
	and others). This includes exchanging information with other companies and organisations for the purposes of fraud protection and credit risk reduction.
</p>
<p>
	</p><h2>Changes to our privacy policy</h2>
