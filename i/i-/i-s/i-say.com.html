	<h2>Ipsos Privacy Statement</h2>
	<p><em>Last revised November 2004</em></p>
	<p style="float: right; padding:0 0 10px 10px;"> <a href="http://www.truste.org/ivalidate.php?url=www.i-say.com&amp;sealid=101"><img src="/i/clickseal-nobox-aliased2white.gif" width="91" height="73" border="0"></a></p>
	<p>The purpose of this Privacy Statement is to inform you about the practices and procedures of Ipsos  (as follows, “we” or “us”) in handling Personal Information and to inform you about the Personal Information we collect about you when you participate in one of our surveys. It explains how we use and disclose that information, the choices you have regarding such use and disclosure, and how you may correct that information.</p>
	<p>Ipsos-Insight is a licensee of the TRUSTe Privacy Program. TRUSTe is an independent, non-profit organization whose mission is to build users' trust and confidence in the Internet by promoting the use of fair information practices. This privacy statement covers the site www.i-say.com. Because this website wants to demonstrate its commitment to your privacy, it has agreed to disclose its information practices and have its privacy practices reviewed for compliance by TRUSTe.</p>
	<p>If you have any questions or comments regarding this statement, you should first contact Ipsos-Insight Member Services at Ipsos, Member Services, 100 Charles Lindbergh Blvd., Uniondale, NY, 11553, USA - 1-866-893-1188 or by email at questions@i-say.com. If you do not receive acknowledgement of your inquiry or your inquiry has not been satisfactorily addressed, you should then contact TRUSTe at http://www.truste.org/consumers/watchdog_compliant.php. TRUSTe will then serve as a liaison with the Web site to resolve your concerns. </p>
	<p>We are proud to demonstrate our commitment to your privacy.  From time to time, we may make changes to this Privacy Statement. The Privacy Statement is current as of the “last revised” date which appears at the top of this page. We will treat Personal Information in a manner consistent with the Privacy Statement under which it was collected and our Privacy Policy, unless we have your consent to treat it differently. This Privacy Statement applies to any information we collect or receive about you, from any source. </p>

		<li id="1"><p><strong>1. What is Personal Information?</strong></p> 
		<p>Personal Information is any information that is identifiable with you. This information may include but is not limited to your name, age, gender, mailing address, phone numbers, email address, identification numbers and, in certain circumstances, your opinions and individual preferences. Personal Information, however, does not include (i) your name, business title or business address and business telephone number, fax and email in your capacity as an employee of an organization; and (ii) depending on the jurisdiction, publicly available information. However, if in your capacity as an employee of an organization you participate in one of our surveys, your responses will be treated as Personal Information.</p>
		</li>
		<li id="2"><p><strong>2. How do we collect your Personal Information?</strong></p>
		<p>We will always collect your Personal Information by fair and lawful means (for example, when you respond to one of our surveys). We collect your Personal Information where we have obtained your consent to do so or as otherwise permitted by law. </p>
		<p>We may use a third party agent to host surveys to collect personal information. That information is delivered to Ipsos directly. Contractual agreements between Ipsos and third party vendors ensure that your personal information will not be shared with anyone and will not be used for any other purpose. </p>
		</li>
		<li id="3"><p><strong>3. How do we use your Personal Information?</strong> </p>
		<p>We identify the purposes for which we use your Personal Information at the time we collect such information from you and obtain your consent, in any case, prior to such use. One of the primary purposes for which we collect your Personal Information is to conduct social and market research through conducting surveys. We may also use your Personal Information as otherwise permitted by law. If you provide us with sensitive personal information such as health or financial information, we will obtain your express consent for the collection, use and disclosure of sensitive personal information. </p>
		</li>
		<li id="4"><p><strong>4. To whom do we provide your Personal Information?</strong> </p>
		<p>We identify to whom, and for what purposes, we disclose your Personal Information, at the time we collect such information from you and obtain your consent to such disclosure. For example, we may disclose your Personal Information:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>to a client of Ipsos  for the client’s purposes of conducting further research;</li>
			<li>a third party engaged by Ipsos  to perform functions on its behalf; </li>
			<li>such other disclosures of Personal Information to such persons for which you provide your consent; and </li>
			<li>as otherwise permitted by law. </li>
		</ul>
		<p>We reserve the right to disclose your personal indentifiable information as required by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on our Web site. <br>
		return to top</p>
		</li>
		<li id="5"><p><strong>5. When and how do we obtain your consent?</strong> </p>
		<p>We obtain your consent prior to collecting, and in any case, prior to using or disclosing your Personal Information for any purpose. You may provide your consent to us either orally or in writing. For example, when you respond to a survey, you provide your consent to allow us to use your Personal Information for the purposes of conducting social and market research and, in certain circumstances, to disclose your Personal Information to our clients. From time to time, we may collect, use or disclose your Personal Information based on your consent and as permitted by law. If you provide us with sensitive Personal Information such as health or financial information, we will obtain your express consent for the collection, use and disclosure of such sensitive personal information. </p>
		</li>
		<li id="6"><p><strong>6. How do we ensure the privacy of your Personal Information when dealing with our affiliates and other third parties?</strong></p>
		<p>We ensure that all our affiliates and other third parties which are engaged to perform services on our behalf and are provided with Personal Information are required by contract to, observe the intent of this Privacy Statement and our Privacy Policy and practices or are governed by the same Privacy Policy. For example - large volume mailing providers and online collection providers </p>
		</li>
		<li id="7"><p><strong>7. How long will we use, disclose or retain your Personal Information?</strong></p>
		<p>We will use, disclose or retain your Personal Identifiable Information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes for which it was collected and as permitted or required by law. We have established minimum and maximum retention periods and procedures for maintaining and destroying your Personal Information.</p>
		</li>
		<li id="8"><p><strong>8. How can you review your Personal Information that we have collected, used or disclosed?</strong></p>
		<p>We will make available to you any specific Personal Information on you in our custody or control, that we have collected, used or disclosed, upon your written request, to the extent permitted by law. We will make such information available to you in a form that is generally understandable, including explaining any abbreviations or codes.</p>
		</li>
		<li id="9"><p><strong>9. How do you know that the Personal Information we have on you is accurate?</strong></p>
		<p>We will ensure that your Personal Information is kept as accurate, complete and up-to-date as possible. When we collect Personal Information from you, we rely on you for its accuracy.</p>
		</li>
		<li id="10"><p><strong>10. What if the Personal Information we have on you is inaccurate?</strong></p>
		<p>You can at any time, demonstrate in writing the accuracy or completeness of the Personal Information we have on you. If you successfully demonstrate that the Personal Information we have on you is inaccurate or incomplete, we will amend the Personal Information as required. Where appropriate, we will transmit the amended information to third parties having access to your Personal Information.</p>
		</li>
		<li id="11"><p><strong>11. How fast will we respond to your written requests?</strong></p>
		<p>We will attempt to respond to each of your written requests not later than thirty (30) days after receipt of such requests. We will advise you in writing if we cannot meet your requests within this time limit.</p>
		</li>
		<li id="12"><p><strong>12. Are there any costs to you for requesting information on your Personal Information or on our Privacy Policy or practices?</strong></p>
		<p>We will not assess any costs to you for access to your Personal Information or on our Privacy Policy or practices without first providing you with an estimate of the approximate costs, if any. You may withdraw your requests for access to information by notifying us within the thirty-day notice period disclosed on the estimate.</p>
		</li>
		<li id="13"><p><strong> 13. How do we know that it is really you requesting your Personal Information?</strong></p>
		<p>We may request that you provide sufficient identification to permit access to the existence, use or disclosure of your Personal Information. Any such information shall be used only for this purpose.</p>
		</li>
		<li id="14"><p><strong>14. What safeguards have we implemented to protect your Personal Information?</strong></p>
		<p>We have implemented physical, organizational, contractual and technological security measures to protect your Personal Information from loss or theft, unauthorized access, disclosure, copying, use or modification. The only employees, who are granted access to your Personal Information, are those with a business ‘need-to-know’ or whose duties reasonably require such information.</p>
		</li>
		<li id="15"><p><strong>15. How do you contact us regarding access to your Personal Information or our Privacy Policy and practices?</strong></p>
		<p>All comments, questions, concerns or complaints regarding your Personal Information or our Privacy Policy and practices, should be forwarded to our Privacy Officer as follows.</p>

	<p>You may submit changes to your Name, Mailing Address, e-Mail Address, Telephone Number online at www.i-say.com, by e-mail at questions@i-say.com, by telephone 1-866-893-1188 or by writing to us at Ipsos,
	Member Services,
	100 Charles Lindbergh Blvd.
	Uniondale, NY, 11553, USA</p>
	<p>We will inform you when you make an inquiry or lodge challenges or complaints of the relevant procedures.</p>

	<p><strong>Notification of Changes</strong></p>
	<p> If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes to this privacy statement and other places we deem appropriate so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. We will use information in accordance with the privacy policy under which the information was collected. </p>
	<p>If, however, we are going to use users' personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection we will notify users via email. Users will have a choice as to whether or not we use their information in this different manner. However, if users have opted out of all communication with the site, or deleted/deactivated their account, then they will not be contacted, nor will their personal information be used in this new manner. In addition, if we make any material changes in our privacy practices that do not affect user information already stored in our database, we will post a prominent notice on our web site notifying users of the change. In some cases where we post a notice we will also email users, who have opted to receive communications from us, notifying them of the changes in our privacy practices.</p>

	<p><strong>Log Files </strong></p>
	<p> As is true of most Web sites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. This information includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data. </p>
	<p> We use this information, which does not identify individual users, to analyze trends, to administer the site, to track users’ movements around the site and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. </p>
	<p> We do not link this automatically-collected data to personally identifiable information. </p>
	<p>We use a third-party tracking service called Itracks that uses cookies  to track non-personally identifiable information about visitors to our site in the aggregate, to capture number of clicks by recruitment source in order to compensate vendors.</p>

	<p><strong>Cookies </strong></p>
	<p>A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user’s computer for record-keeping purposes. We use cookies on this site. We do not link the information we store in cookies to any personally identifiable information you submit while on our site.</p>
	<p>We use session cookies to make it easier for you to navigate our site. A session ID cookie expires when you close you browser. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period of time. You can remove persistent cookies by following directions provided in your Internet browser’s “help” file. </p>
	<p> This privacy statement covers the use of cookies by www.i-say.com only and does not cover the use of cookies by any third parties.</p>

	<p><strong> Surveys or Contests </strong></p>
	<p> From time-to-time we may provide you the opportunity to participate in contests or surveys. If you participate, we will request certain personally identifiable information from you. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and you therefore have a choice whether or not to disclose this information. The requested information typically includes contact information (such as name and shipping address), and demographic information (such as zip code). </p>
	<p> We use this information to... <em>describe fully how the data collected is to be used, e.g., to notify contest winners and award prizes.</em></p>
	<p> We will not share the personally identifiable information you provide through a contest or survey with other third parties unless we give you prior notice and choice. </p>
