                by changing your Email Preferences, clicking the unsubscribe link in an email communication,

                For services in the United States, by creating an account on NameJet and providing your telephone number, 
                you agree that this action constitutes a purchase, inquiry and/or application for purposes of telemarketing laws. 
                Regardless of the fact that your telephone and/or cell number may be listed with the Federal Do-Not-Call Registry 
                or your local State Do-Not-Call list, you are providing your express written consent to receive future information 
                (including telemarketing) about products and services from us and/or our affiliates, and you hereby agree

                We monitor use of the Websites and we use the information we collect, including personal data, to pursue our legitimate 
                interest in protecting you, others, NameJet, its business and the Websites by: 
                <ul style="list-style-type:disc;padding-left:25px">

                We further release account and other personal information when we believe release is required to comply with federal

                safety of NameJet, our users, or others. This includes potentially exchanging information with other companies,

		<dd>
            In order to pursue our legitimate interest in improving our Services and Websites, 
            we also may use personal information to conduct research and analysis.  
            We do this to (a) better understand how people interact with our Websites and use our Services, 
            (b) make improvement to the Services and Websites, (c) identify domain name inventory of interest to customers, 
            (d) identify what features would be useful to our customers, (e) provide communications about Services which 
            we think will be of interest to our customers, and (f) further determine the effectiveness of promotional campaigns and advertising. 
		</dd>

        <dt>To Provide Required Information to ICANN.</dt>
		<dd>
            When you purchase or otherwise obtain a domain via NameJet, your domain purchase will be fulfilled by one of our partner registrars. 
            These registrars are required by the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers ("ICANN"), 
            the organization that assumes responsibility for domain name allocation, to collect and use your personal information 
            during the domain name registration process. This information includes your full name, mailing address, phone number, 
            email address, and, where provided, your facsimile number. ICANN then requires all registrars to make your full name, 
            mailing address, phone number, email address, and, where provided, your facsimile number, as well as the creation 
            and expiration dates of your domain name registration and the name server information associated with your domain name, 
            to the public via an interactive Web page and a "port 43" WHOIS service. For the purposes of this Privacy Policy 
            we will refer to this information as your "WHOIS Information."  Each of our partner registrars may handle this responsibility 
            differently, as some may choose to mask your personally identifiable information as they feel is necessary, 
            including but not limited to, masking data published to Port 43 or the WHOIS database. 
            Please be sure to review the Registrar Agreements and Privacy Policies for all our partner registrars, 
            which you have agreed to via our Terms of Use, in order to be aware of how each partner registrar will handle 
            and use your information. Also, please note that we do not control how members of the public may use the WHOIS Information.

    </dl>

	<h3>Information Security</h3>
	<p>
		The information we receive from or about you is stored on systems designed to prevent the loss, disclosure, or destruction 
        of that information. We follow generally accepted standards to store and protect the personal data we collect, both during transmission 
        and once received and stored, including utilization of encryption where appropriate. 
        Specifically, we often protect the security of your information during transmission by using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software, 
        which encrypts information you input and the information we may send to our agents. NameJet has gone to great lengths to ensure 
        your information is securely obtained. For example, we encrypt your credit card number before it is stored in our database. 
        However, no method of transmission over the Internet or method of electronic storage is completely secure and 
        we cannot guarantee its absolute security. You can further help to ensure your security by taking a few simple precautions. 
        For instance, it is important to protect against unauthorized access to your computer and your NameJet account username and password, 
        and to be sure to sign off when you are finished using a shared computer.
	</p>
	
	<h3>Retention Policy</h3>
	<p>
		We retain personal information for as long as necessary to provide the Services you have requested and 
        thereafter for a variety of legitimate legal or business purposes. These might include retention periods 
        that are (a) mandated by law, contract or similar obligations applicable to our business operations; 
        (b) needed for preserving, resolving, defending or enforcing our legal and/or contractual rights; or 
        (c) necessary to maintain adequate and accurate business and financial records.
	</p>

	<h3>Information Access</h3>
	<p>
		You have certain rights to your personal information, including but not limited to the following: 
        </p><ul style="list-style-type:disc;padding-left:25px">
            <li>To access a copy of your personal data;</li>
            <li>To correct, erase or restrict our processing of your personal data;</li>
            <li>To transfer the information you have provided under contract or consent to another organization; and</li>
            <li>To stop processing your information, by withdrawing your consent or objecting to our legitimate interests.</li>
        </ul>
	<p></p>
    <p>
        Your rights in relation to your personal information are limited in some situations. 
        For example, if we have a legal requirement or a compelling legitimate ground we may continue to process your information. 
        We will provide you with clarification regarding whether there are limits or exemptions that apply to any data request that you make.
        To access, view, update or delete your available personal information, or to otherwise update your account preferences, 
        please log into your account for such access and/or submit a ticket via the account. Please note, 
        however, that no information will be provided without verification. Also, if you make a request to delete or change your personal 
        information and that data is necessary for the products or services you have purchased, the request will be honored only to the 
        extent it is no longer necessary for any Services purchased or required for our legitimate business purposes or legal or contractual 
        record-keeping obligations.  
    </p>
    <p>
        You have the right to make a complaint if you feel your personal information has been mishandled. 
        We encourage you to come to us in the first instance but, to the extent that this right applies to you, 
        you are entitled to complain directly to the relevant supervisory authority. This can be the supervisory authority 
        where you reside or work, or where you believe a breach has taken place.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you are unable for any reason to access your NameJet account please contact us 
        via our contact information found <a href="/Pages/Contact.aspx">here</a>.

	<h3>Links</h3>
    <p>
        The Websites provided by NameJet contain links to other websites. Please be aware that we are not responsible 
        for the privacy practices of such other websites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our Website 
        and to read the privacy statements of each and every website that collects personally identifiable information. 
        This Privacy Policy applies solely to information collected by this Website.
    </p>

	<h3>Age Restrictions &amp; Children</h3>
    <p>
        You must be at least eighteen years old to register online or purchase or otherwise use our Services. 
        If you are under 18, you may use our Services only with involvement of a parent or guardian.

    </p>

	<h3>Conditions of Use, Notices, and Revisions</h3>
    <p>
        If you choose to visit our Website, create a NameJet account, and/or utilize our Services, any dispute over privacy 
        related to the same is subject to this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Use, including limitations on damages, 
        arbitration of disputes, and application of the law of the Commonwealth of Virginia. 
        If you have any concern about privacy at NameJet, please send us your concern using our contact information found <a href="/Pages/Contact.aspx">here</a>  
        or submit a ticket via your NameJet account, and we will investigate and address it as necessary. Our business changes 
        constantly – so we reserve the right to modify this Privacy Policy at any time. If we decide to change our Privacy Policy, 
        we will post those changes to this Privacy Policy, by email, and/or by means of a notice on our home page of our Website prior 
        to the implementation of the changes. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Also, as we continue to develop our business, we might sell or buy businesses or their assets. In such transactions, 
        customer information generally is one of the transferred business assets. Also, if NameJet, or substantially all of its assets, 
        were ever to be acquired, customer information would most likely be one of the transferred assets.
    </p>
