				<p>The security of your information is important to Newswire, and we have implemented administrative, technical, and physical safeguards designed to protect personal information against theft or misuse.

				<ul class="bullets">
					<li>With our subsidiaries and affiliates, including any future subsidiaries or affiliates;</li>
					<li>With our service providers and sub-contractors to the extent reasonably necessary to enable us provide our Services (e.g., we use a third-party platform for email and cannot communicate with you without disclosing your email address to our third-party email provider);</li>

				<p><em class="h3">Cookies &amp; Other Tracking Mechanisms</em></p>

				<p>We may use cookies, beacons and similar technologies, now or in the future, to support the functionality or track usage of our Services. This provides a better experience when you use our Services and allows us to improve our Services.</p>

				<ul class="bullets">
					<li><strong>Browser Cookies</strong>. A browser cookie is a small file placed on the hard drive of your computer. That cookie then communicates with servers, ours or those of other companies that we authorize to collect data for us, and allows recognition of your device. You may use the tools available on your computer or other device to set your browser to refuse or disable all or some browser cookies, or to alert you when cookies are being sent. However, if you refuse or disable all browser cookies, you may be unable to access certain parts of our Websites or use certain features or functionality of our Services.</li>
					<li><strong>Web Beacons</strong>. Our Services may contain small electronic files known as web beacons (also referred to as clear GIFs, pixel tags, tracking pixels and single-pixel GIFs) that permit us to, for example, count users who have visited those pages or opened an e-mail and for other website-related statistics. Web beacons in email marketing campaigns, press releases or other types of communications or content allow us to track your responses and your interests in our content, offerings and web pages. We may use web beacons and/or other tracking technologies to collect information about you when you interact with our Services, e-mails, press releases or other types of communications or content, including information about your browsing and purchasing behavior.</li>
					<li><strong>Analytics Services</strong>. We or our affiliates also use web analytics services, which currently include but are not limited to Google Analytics.

				</ul>

				<p><em class="h3">Ways to Control your Data</em></p>

				<ul class="bullets">

You may, however, continue to receive these emails relating to your account or our Services, if appropriate, even if you unsubscribe from our optional communications.</li>
					<li><strong>Opting out of telemarketing</strong>. Where required by law, you will be contacted via telemarketing only with your consent. You may opt out of our direct telemarketing contacts by requesting us to remove you from our direct telemarketing list. Please note that opting out from our direct telemarketing contacts does not limit us from contacting you for other purposes, including those contacts that are reasonably necessary to provide you with our Services. If you decide to opt out of our direct telemarketing contacts, allow a reasonable time for us to process your request and do not hesitate to contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@newswire.com"><code>privacy@newswire.com</code></a>, if you encounter any problems with your request.</li>

				</ul>

				<p><em class="h3">Personal Information Received from the EU/EEA and/or Switzerland</em></p>

				<p>Personal information is transferred to Newswire in the US from the EU under one of the following scenarios:</p>

				<ul class="bullets">
					<li><strong>Processor</strong>: Newswire is a provider of software, services and tools intended to help customers manage all aspects of their marketing and PR campaigns. Newswire does not own or control any of the information it processes on behalf of its customer. All such information is owned and controlled by Newswire’s customer. In this capacity, Newswire receives information transferred from the EU to the US merely as a processor on behalf of its customer, although such information may not be required by Newswire.</li>
					<li><strong>Data Controller</strong>: Newswire also provides information products designed to help customers research and plan their campaigns more effectively. In this function, Newswire acts as a data controller of the personal information contained in these products and processes this personal information as described in this Policy in the US, a country that does not have the same level of protection for personal data as the EEA or Switzerland. Newswire maintains a media database containing personal information on EU media contacts, and such individuals can have such information removed from our database. This information does not include sensitive information such as data about race, sexual orientation, or religion. This information is transferred to the US on the basis of consent, or European Commission-approved standard contractual clauses, and may be further transferred to our customers and to third party service providers located in Asia, Latin America and the Middle East, which do not have the same level of protection for personal data as the EEA or Switzerland, for the purposes described in this Policy.</li>
				</ul>

				<p><em class="h3">Changes to Our Privacy Policy</em></p>

				<p>We may change this Privacy Policy from time to time to align with changes to our business practices and/or changes to our legal requirements. We will post the updated Privacy Policy on this page, and will indicate that the updates have been made by changing the effective date first written above. We urge you to check back periodically to see whether there have been updates to our Privacy Policy.</p>

				<p>Your continued use of the Services or communication with us about the Services after the updated Privacy Policy has been posted (or any other indication of your consent) will constitute your acceptance of the updated Privacy Policy.</p>

				<p>Please note that we may condition your continued access to our Services on your consent to changes to this Privacy Policy.</p>
