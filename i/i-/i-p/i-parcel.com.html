        <h3>Effective 11-12-2010</h3>
        This Statement describes how i-Parcel, LLC and its clients collects, uses, and discloses certain personally identifiable information that it receives in the United States from the European Union ("EU Personal Data"). In particular, i-Parcel recognizes that the European Union has established strict protections regarding the handling of EU Personal Data, and i-Parcel therefore has elected to adhere to the US-EU Safe Harbor Privacy Principles (the "Safe Harbor") with respect to such EU Personal Data that it receives in the United States. For further background and information about the Safe Harbor, and to see i-Parcel, LLC’s representation on the Safe Harbor List, please refer to the U.S. Department of Commerce's website at <a href="http://www.export.gov/safeharbor" target="_blank">www.export.gov/safeharbor</a>.
        <br>
        <h3>Categories of Individual Data Subjects</h3>
        In general, i-Parcel may obtain EU Personal Data in the United States about several different types of individuals, including direct customers and customers of i-parcel’s ecommerce merchant customers,. i-parcel’s practices with respect to each of these types of individual data subjects are described below.
        <br>
        <h3>DIRECT CUSTOMERS</h3>
        <p>i-Parcel generally collects, uses, and discloses information about direct customers located in the EU or Switzerland in accordance with the Website Privacy Policy at <a href="http://www.i-parcel.com/privacy.aspx" target="_blank">www.i-parcel.com/privacy.aspx</a>.  If you become a direct customer we will collect your name, company name, shipping address, phone number and email address.  We use this information to contact you about the services in which you have expressed interest, provide you with your login details, allow you to create invoices and shipments for your clients, to send you service related emails, and to allow you to track your packages until such time as they are de3livered to you.
        You have the ability to upload shipment files to make it easier for you to create your shipments.  These are stored on our site for your own personal use.  They must remain on our site in order for us to satisfy record keeping requirements of U.S. Transportation Security Administration, Office of Foreign Assets Control and other American and foreign regulatory and compliance organizations.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>CUSTOMERS OF I-PARCEL’S ECOMMERCE MERCHANT CUSTOMERS</h3>
        <p>i-Parcel may obtain various types of EU Personal Data about of our clients.  Such data may include their names, company names, shipping addresses, phone numbers, email addresses and complete descriptions of the goods ordered from i-parcel’s clients.  I-Parcel may use these types of EU Personal Data for business purposes, including to deliver or provide products or services; to establish or maintain client and business relationships; to provide access to Internet-based and e-commerce activities; to perform accounting functions, to satisfy exporting, importing and other legal requirements of American and foreign regulatory and compliance obligations; and to conduct other activities  as necessary or appropriate in connection with the servicing and development of the business relationship.
        Employees and agents of our clients, business partners, and suppliers may contact us if any of their EU Personal Data changes, or if they would like to access and correct EU Personal Data that we maintain about them.

        <p>We obtain information about end users of our clients who we have placed on a Prohibited Parties List.  This list has company names and addresses of end users whom we will not deliver to.  This information is used for no other purposes.</p>
