    <h2>LOGISTICS AND CROSS BORDER ISSUES ARE VITAL COMPONENTS OF INTERNATIONAL REVENUES FOR ONLINE AND CATALOG MERCHANTS.</h2>
    <p><a href="https://safeharbor.export.gov/list.aspx" target="_blank">We self-certify compliance with</a><br><a href="http://www.export.gov/safeharbor" target="_blank"><img src="/assets/images/safeharbor.png" width="200" height="82" alt="" border="0"></a>
    </p><h3>Effective 3-22-2013</h3>
    <p>This Statement describes how i-parcel, LLC and its clients collects, uses, and discloses certain personally identifiable information that it receives in the United States from the European Union ("EU Personal Data"). i-parcel complies with the U.S. – E.U. Safe Harbor framework and the U.S. - Swiss Safe Harbor framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal data from European Union member countries and Switzerland. i-parcel has certified that it adheres to the Safe Harbor Privacy Principles of notice, choice, onward transfer, security, data integrity, access, and enforcement. To learn more about the Safe Harbor program, and to view i-parcel’s certification, please visit <a href="http://www.export.gov/safeharbor" target="_blank">www.export.gov/safeharbor</a>.</p>
    <h3>Categories of Individual Data Subjects</h3>
    <p>In general, i-parcel may obtain EU Personal Data in the United States about several different types of Individuals, including direct customers and customers of i-parcel’s ecommerce merchant customers. I-parcel’s practices with respect to each of these types of individual data subjects are described below.</p>
    <h3>DIRECT CUSTOMERS</h3>
    <p>i-parcel generally collects, uses, and discloses information about direct customers located in the EU or Switzerland in accordance with the Website Privacy Policy at <a href="http://www.i-parcel.com/privacy.aspx">www.i-parcel.com/privacy.aspx</a>. If you become a direct customer we will collect your name, company name, shipping address, phone number and email address. We use this information to contact you about the services in which you have expressed interest, provide you with your login details, allow you to create invoices and shipments for your clients, to send you service related emails, and to allow you to track your packages until such time as they are delivered to you. You have the ability to upload shipment files to make it easier for you to create your shipments. These are stored on our site for your own personal use. They must remain on our site in order for us to satisfy record keeping requirements of U.S. Transportation Security Administration, Office of Foreign Assets Control and other American and foreign regulatory and compliance organizations.</p>
    <h3>CUSTOMERS OF I-PARCEL’S ECOMMERCE MERCHANT CUSTOMERS</h3>
    <p>i-parcel may obtain various types of EU Personal Data about our clients. Such data may include their names, company names, shipping addresses, phone numbers, email addresses and complete descriptions of the goods ordered from i-parcel’s clients. i-parcel may use these types of EU Personal Data for business purposes, including to deliver or provide products or services; to establish or maintain client and business relationships; to provide access to Internet-based and e-commerce activities; to perform accounting functions, to satisfy exporting, importing and other legal requirements of American and foreign regulatory and compliance obligations; and to conduct other activities as necessary or appropriate in connection with the servicing and development of the business relationship. Employees and agents of our clients, business partners, and suppliers may contact us if any of their EU Personal Data changes, or if they would like to access and correct EU Personal Data that we maintain about them. However, clients should contact the original ecommerce merchant where i-parcel’s transaction originated to access and correct their own data. In any event, such persons can also contact us by sending an email to <a href="mailto:privacy@i-parcel.com">privacy@i-parcel.com</a>, or by using the information at the end of this privacy statement. Also, to the extent that any of these individuals receive marketing communications from XYZ, and wish to unsubscribe or otherwise stop receiving such communications, they can contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@i-parcel.com">privacy@i-parcel.com</a>.
    </p><p>If you wish to track your shipment we will ask for the tracking number and your email address if you wished to be notified about your tracking information.</p>
    <p>We obtain information about end users of our clients who we have placed on a Prohibited Parties List. This list has company names and addresses of end users whom we will not deliver to. This information is used for no other purposes.</p>
    <h3>Clients</h3>
    <p>i-parcel provides a wide variety of services and solutions to our business clients ("Clients") that facilitate services including air carriage, customs clearance and delivery for individuals ("Data Subjects"). In some instances, i-parcel may obtain access to EU Personal Data about such Data Subjects in the course of providing the services and solutions. In other specific instances, i-parcel may also obtain access to data about our Clients' end users in the course of providing support services to the Clients ("End Users"). Such data may include names, addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, full description of products being transported, and other information, depending on the particular Client and application at issue.</p>
    <p>Wherever we obtain access to EU Personal Data about Data Subjects or End Users, we are acting as a mere data processor on behalf of our Clients, and we therefore conduct such activities strictly in accordance with their instructions and pursuant to our contractual arrangements with them. If you are an End User with an existing relationship with one of our Clients, you should refer to the Client's website to understand the privacy practices that apply to EU Personal Data that we may maintain about you. Moreover, if you would like to access and review your EU Personal Data, you should contact our Client with any such requests. We will cooperate as appropriate with requests from our Clients to assist with such responses.</p>
    <h3>Other Necessary Disclosures</h3>
    <p>We will share your personal information with third parties only in the ways that are described in this privacy policy. We do not sell your personal information to third parties. i-parcel may disclose EU Personal Data to business partners and subcontractors as necessary in connection with the performance of requested customs clearance or delivery partners, or as otherwise appropriate in connection with a legitimate business need. i-parcel may also disclose EU Personal Data as necessary in connection with the sale or transfer of all or part of the business.
