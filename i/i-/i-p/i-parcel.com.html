    <p>This Statement describes how i-parcel, LLC and its clients collects, uses, and discloses certain personally identifiable information that it receives in the United States from the European Union ("EU Personal Data"). i-parcel complies with the U.S. – E.U. Safe Harbor framework and the U.S. - Swiss Safe Harbor framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal data from European Union member countries and Switzerland. i-parcel has certified that it adheres to the Safe Harbor Privacy Principles of notice, choice, onward transfer, security, data integrity, access, and enforcement.

    <h3>Categories of Individual Data Subjects</h3>
    <p>In general, i-parcel may obtain EU Personal Data in the United States about several different types of Individuals, including direct customers and customers of i-parcel’s ecommerce merchant customers. I-parcel’s practices with respect to each of these types of individual data subjects are described below.</p>
    <h3>DIRECT CUSTOMERS</h3>
    <p>i-parcel generally collects, uses, and discloses information about direct customers located in the EU or Switzerland in accordance with the Website Privacy Policy at <a href="http://www.i-parcel.com/privacy.aspx">www.i-parcel.com/privacy.aspx</a>. If you become a direct customer we will collect your name, company name, shipping address, phone number and email address. We use this information to contact you about the services in which you have expressed interest, provide you with your login details, allow you to create invoices and shipments for your clients, to send you service related emails, and to allow you to track your packages until such time as they are delivered to you. You have the ability to upload shipment files to make it easier for you to create your shipments. These are stored on our site for your own personal use. They must remain on our site in order for us to satisfy record keeping requirements of U.S. Transportation Security Administration, Office of Foreign Assets Control and other American and foreign regulatory and compliance organizations.</p>

    <p>i-parcel may obtain various types of EU Personal Data about our clients. Such data may include their names, company names, shipping addresses, phone numbers, email addresses and complete descriptions of the goods ordered from i-parcel’s clients. i-parcel may use these types of EU Personal Data for business purposes, including to deliver or provide products or services; to establish or maintain client and business relationships; to provide access to Internet-based and e-commerce activities; to perform accounting functions, to satisfy exporting, importing and other legal requirements of American and foreign regulatory and compliance obligations; and to conduct other activities as necessary or appropriate in connection with the servicing and development of the business relationship. Employees and agents of our clients, business partners, and suppliers may contact us if any of their EU Personal Data changes, or if they would like to access and correct EU Personal Data that we maintain about them. However, clients should contact the original ecommerce merchant where i-parcel’s transaction originated to access and correct their own data.

    <h3>Clients</h3>
    <p>i-parcel provides a wide variety of services and solutions to our business clients ("Clients") that facilitate services including air carriage, customs clearance and delivery for individuals ("Data Subjects"). In some instances, i-parcel may obtain access to EU Personal Data about such Data Subjects in the course of providing the services and solutions.

Such data may include names, addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, full description of products being transported, and other information, depending on the particular Client and application at issue.</p>
    <p>Wherever we obtain access to EU Personal Data about Data Subjects or End Users, we are acting as a mere data processor on behalf of our Clients, and we therefore conduct such activities strictly in accordance with their instructions and pursuant to our contractual arrangements with them.

In these situations, i-parcel will require the recipient of the data to protect the data in accordance with the relevant principles in the Safe Harbor, or otherwise take steps to ensure that the EU Personal Data is appropriately protected. i-parcel may also disclose EU Personal Data where required or permitted by law, or where i-parcel believes that such disclosures are appropriate in connection with a law enforcement request.</p>
