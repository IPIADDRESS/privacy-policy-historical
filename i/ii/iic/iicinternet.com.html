          <ul>
            <li>We don’t ask you for personal information unless we truly need it. <br>
              We don’t share your personal information with anyone except to comply with the law, develop our products, or protect our rights.<br>
              We don’t store personal information on our servers unless required for the on-going operation of one of our services.<br>
              When you store files on our servers we don't look at them, search through them or police them in any way.<br>
            </li>
            </ul>
          <p><strong>Privacy Policy:</strong></p>
<p>If you have questions about deleting or correcting your personal data please contact our support team.</p>
          <p>Website Visitors<br>
            Like most website operators, IIC Internet collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. IIC Internet’s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how IIC Internet’s visitors use its website. From time to time, IIC Internet may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.          </p>
          <p>Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information<br>
            We request that customer's provide Personally-Identifying Information when they sign up for your service. This information is stored in a database and is used to contact customers for billing as well as other notices about the service. You can use alias information if you would like and you do not need to provide any information that you do not want to provide to be a customer, however you should insure that we can contact you if needed to protect the data stored on our service.          </p>
          <p>Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information<br>
            IIC Internet discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on IIC Internet’s behalf or to provide services available at IIC Internet’s websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using IIC Internet’s websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. IIC Internet will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, IIC Internet discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or when IIC Internet believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of IIC Internet, third parties or the public at large. If you are a registered user of an IIC Internet website and have supplied your email address, IIC Internet may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what’s going on with IIC Internet and our products. We primarily use our various product blogs to communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. IIC Internet takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.</p>
          <p>Cookies<br>
            A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor’s computer, and that the visitor’s browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. IIC Internet uses cookies to help IIC Internet identify and track visitors, their usage of IIC Internet website, and their website access preferences. IIC Internet visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using IIC Internet’s websites, with the drawback that certain features of IIC Internet’s websites may not function properly without the aid of cookies.</p>
          <p>Business Transfers<br>
            If IIC Internet, or substantially all of its assets, were acquired, or in the unlikely event that IIC Internet goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of IIC Internet may continue to use your personal information as set forth in this policy.          </p>
          <p>Privacy Policy Changes<br>
            Although most changes are likely to be minor, IIC Internet may change its Privacy Policy from time to time, and in IIC Internet’s sole discretion. IIC Internet encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to its Privacy Policy. Your continued use of this site after any change in this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such change.          </p>
