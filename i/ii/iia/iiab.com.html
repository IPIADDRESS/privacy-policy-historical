In the event of any inconsistency  between the provisions of this Website Privacy Notice and those other  specific and additional provisions, the specific and additional  provisions will prevail.<br>
    <br>

<p><strong>2. Cookies</strong><br>
    <br>
  We may set and access cookies on  your computer. 'Cookies' are small identifiers sent from a web server and stored on your computer's hard drive, similar to a license plate,  that help us to recognize you if you visit our website again. Also our  website use cookies to track how you found our website. Cookies are not  designed to be used to get data from your hard drive, your email or any  other personal information about you.

  We use a number of mechanisms to  protect the security and integrity of your personal information.  Unfortunately, no data transmission over the internet can be guaranteed  as completely secure.
