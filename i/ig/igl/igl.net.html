<p><span style="font-family:Arial">
Welcome to CasesLadder.com (the .Site.) an interactive website specializing in Internet gaming ladders, leagues and tournaments (the .Services.). The Site is owned and operated by Case.s Ladder (the .Network.). Cases Ladder developed this privacy policy to demonstrate its firm commitment to protecting your privacy and personal information and to inform you on how this information is handled. This privacy policy applies only to transactions and activities you engage in, and data gathered, on the Site.  Please review this privacy policy  from time to time as it may be modified without notice. Each time you visit the Site or provide the Network with information, by doing so you are agreeing to the terms of this privacy policy at that time.  
<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><strong><span style="font-family:Arial">1. Collection of Information. </span></strong><span style="font-family:Arial"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><strong><span style="font-family:Arial">1.1 Survey Information.</span></strong><span style="font-family:Arial"><br>
The Network collects information from individuals when such individuals
voluntarily complete surveys, order forms, send an email through the
the Site's referral engine technology or submit information via online forms
which may or may not be accompanied by a pre-checked or non-pre-checked
checkbox indicating that such individuals consent to receiving marketing
communications from the Site or registration pages either online or offline, or by means of online or offline
surveys, order forms, or registration pages operated by third parties (each, a
"Survey"). (As used herein, "online" means using the Internet,
including the websites and related technologies, and "offline" means
by methods other than online, including in person, via postal mail, telephones,
and other similar means.) In the Surveys, the Network or a third party may ask
individuals to provide various information which may include
their name, email address, street address, zip code, telephone numbers, birth
date, gender, salary range, education level, marital status, occupation,
employment information, personal and online interests, and such other
information as may be requested from time to time (collectively, "Survey
Information"). Completing the Surveys is completely voluntary, and
individuals are under no obligation to provide Survey Information to the
Network or any third party, but individuals may receive incentives from the
Network or a third party in exchange for providing Survey Information to the
Network. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><strong><span style="font-family:Arial">1.2 Other Information. </span></strong><span style="font-family:Arial"><br>
Other occasions when the Network obtains information from individuals include
when such individuals (1) make a claim for a prize or seek to redeem an
incentive offered by the Network or a third party, (2) request assistance
through the Network's customer service department, and (3) voluntarily
subscribe to a Network service or newsletter (collectively, "Other
Information"). <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><strong><span style="font-family:Arial">1.3 Cookies, Web beacons, and Other
Information Collected Using Technology. </span></strong><span style="font-family:
Arial"><br>
</span></p><p><strong><span style="font-family:Arial">(a) Case's Ladder uses "cookies" to enable you to sign in to the Site and to help personalize your online experience. A cookie is a small text file that is placed on your hard disk by a Web page server. Cookies contain information that can later be read by the domain server that issued you the cookie. Case's Ladder uses cookies to store your preferences and enhance your online experience. You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser to decline cookies.  If you choose to decline cookies, you may not have access to certain areas of the Site that depend on cookies. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. .<o:p></o:p></span></strong></p><strong>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><strong><span style="font-family:
Arial">(b) Third Party Cookies.</span></strong><strong><span style="font-family:
Arial;font-weight:normal;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold"><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span></span></strong><span style="font-family:
Arial">The Network sends to your web browser many of the advertisements you see when you
use the Site. However, it also allow other companies, called
third-party ad servers or ad networks, to serve advertisements within the Site's web
pages. Because your web browser must request these advertising banners from the
ad network Web site, these companies can send their own cookies to your cookie
file, just as if you had requested a web page from the site. Please note that
if an advertiser asks the Network to show an advertisement to a certain audience (for
example, men ages 18-34) or audience segment (for example, men ages 13-24 who
have viewed sports content) and you respond to that ad, the advertiser or
ad-server may conclude that you fit the description of the audience they are
trying to reach.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="content-text1"><span style="mso-ansi-font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:black">As always remember, the Network only authorize certain
third-party ad servers to employ anonymous cookies for ad delivery and
anonymous targeting.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The third-party ad
servers do not collect, nor does the Network give them access, to any personally
identifying information about you. If you want to prevent a third-party ad server from sending and reading cookies on your computer, you must visit each ad network.s web site individual and opt out (if they offer this capability.)<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span></span></span><span style="color:black"><o:p></o:p></span></span></p>

<p><strong><span style="font-family:Arial">(c) Web beacons.</span></strong><span style="font-family:Arial"> Web beacons are graphic images, often transparent
and no larger than 1 pixel x 1 pixel, that are placed on a Web site or in an
e-mail. Web beacons are used to monitor the behavior of the user visiting the
Web site or opening the e-mail. When the HTML code for the Web beacon points to
a site to retrieve the image, it simultaneously can pass along information such
as the IP address of the computer that retrieved the image, the time the Web
beacon was viewed and for how long, the type of browser that retrieved the
image and previously set cookie values. The Network, or third parties acting on
the its behalf, may utilize Web beacons on Web pages or in email for any
legally permissible purpose. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><strong><span style="font-family:Arial">(d) General Behavior Tracking.</span></strong><span style="font-family:Arial"> The Network may track online behaviors
("Behaviors") through its own technologies, including its desktop
software products, in order to increase the effectiveness of the advertisements
it delivers. Examples of such behaviors may include advertisement responses,
websites that individuals visit, and products that individuals purchase. Individuals
can prevent the tracking of Behaviors by globally unsubscribing from the
Network's marketing materials. The Network
reserves the right to use such technologies for any purpose permitted by law. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><strong><span style="font-family:Arial">(e) Information Automatically
Collected. </span></strong><span style="font-family:Arial">For site
maintenance, optimization, security and other legally permissible purposes, the
Network's servers (or third party servers) may collect certain information
about website visitors automatically. Such information may include such visitors'
IP address, browser type, date, time and duration of visit and particular pages
viewed, and such other information as is permitted by law. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><strong><span style="font-family:Arial">(f) New Technology.</span></strong><span style="font-family:Arial"> The use of technology on the Internet is rapidly
evolving, as is the Network's use of new technology. As previously stated,
Network reserves the right to change this policy at any time without any
additional notice to the user. As a result, the Network strongly encourages
individuals to revisit this privacy policy from time to time for any updates
regarding its use of technology. Use of any Network website constitutes
acknowledgement and acceptance of the Network's Privacy Policy and the
Network's right to modify such Privacy Policy without additional notice. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><strong><span style="font-family:Arial">1.4 Outside Information.</span></strong><span style="font-family:Arial"> The Network may receive information about
individuals from a third party or from other sources of information outside of

about individuals. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><strong><span style="font-family:Arial">1.6 No Information Collected from
Children. </span></strong><span style="font-family:Arial">The Network will
never knowingly or intentionally collect any personal information about
children under the age of 13. If the Network obtains actual knowledge that it
has collected personal information about a child under the age of 13, that
information will be immediately deleted from its database. Because it does not
knowingly or intentionally collect such information, to the best of the
Network's knowledge and belief, the Network has no such information to use or
to disclose to a third party. The Network has designed this policy in order to
comply with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><strong><span style="font-family:Arial">1.7 Credit Card Information. </span></strong><span style="font-family:Arial">The Network may in certain cases collect credit card
numbers and related information, such as the expiration date of the card
("Credit Card Information") when an individual places an order from
Network. When the Credit Card Information is submitted to the Network, such
information is encrypted and is protected with SSL encryption software. The
Network will use the Credit Card Information for purposes of processing and
completing the purchase transaction, and the Credit Card Information will be
disclosed to third parties only as necessary to complete the purchase
transaction. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
