Survey Information.</span></b><span style="font-size:9.0pt;font-family:Arial"> <br>
The Network collects information from individuals when such individuals
voluntarily complete Network surveys, order forms, send an email through the

"Survey"). (As used herein, "online" means using the
Internet, including the websites and related technologies, and
"offline" means by methods other than online, including in person,
via postal mail, telephones, and other similar means.) In the Surveys, the
Network or a third party may ask individuals to provide various information to
the Network, which may include their name, email address, street address, zip

(collectively, "Survey Information"). Completing the Surveys is
completely voluntary, and individuals are under no obligation to provide Survey
Information to the Network or any third party, but individuals may receive
incentives from the Network or a third party in exchange for providing Survey
Information to the Network. <br>
<br>
<b>1.2 Other Information.</b> <br>
Other occasions when the Network obtains information from individuals include
when such individuals (1) make a claim for a prize or seek to redeem an
incentive offered by the Network or a third party, (2) request assistance
through the Network's customer service department, and (3) voluntarily
subscribe to a Network service or newsletter (collectively, "Other
Information"). <br>
<br>
<b>1.3 Cookies, Web beacons, and Other Information Collected Using Technology.</b>
<br>
The Network may use cookie technology to associate certain Internet-related
information about individuals with information about such individuals in our
database. Additionally, the Network may use other new and evolving sources of
information in the future (together, "Technology Information"). <br>
<br>
<b>(a) Cookies.</b> A cookie is a small amount of data stored on the hard drive
of the individual's computer that allows Network to identify the individual
with his or her corresponding data that resides in Network's database. You may
read more about cookies at <a href="http://www.cookiecentral.com">www.cookiecentral.com</a>.
<br>
<br>
<b>(b) Web beacons.</b> Web beacons are graphic images, often transparent and
no larger than 1 pixel x 1 pixel, that are placed on a Web site or in an
e-mail. Web beacons are used to monitor the behavior of the user visiting the
Web site or opening the e-mail. When the HTML code for the Web beacon points to
a site to retrieve the image, it simultaneously can pass along information such
as the IP address of the computer that retrieved the image, the time the Web
beacon was viewed and for how long, the type of browser that retrieved the
image and previously set cookie values. The Network, or third parties acting on
the Network's behalf, may utilize Web beacons on Web pages or in email for any
legally permissible purpose. <br>
<br>
<b>(c) General Behavior Tracking.</b> The Network may track online behaviors
("Behaviors") through its own technologies, including its desktop
software products, in order to increase the effectiveness of the advertisements
it delivers. Examples of such behaviors may include advertisement responses,
websites that individuals visit, and products that individuals purchase.
Individuals can prevent the tracking of Behaviors by globally unsubscribing
from the Network's marketing materials. As described in Section 2.1, the
Network reserves the right to use such technologies for any purpose permitted
by law. <br>
<br>
<b>(d) Information Automatically Collected.</b> For site maintenance,
optimization, security and other legally permissible purposes, the Network's
servers (or third party servers) may collect certain information about website
visitors automatically. Such information may include such visitors' IP address,
browser type, date, time and duration of visit and particular pages viewed, and
such other information as is permitted by law. <br>
<br>
<b>(e) New Technology.</b> The use of technology on the Internet is rapidly
evolving, as is the Network's use of new technology. As previously stated,
Network reserves the right to change this policy at any time without any
additional notice to the user. As a result, the Network strongly encourages
individuals to revisit this privacy policy from time to time for any updates
regarding its use of technology. Use of any Network website constitutes
acknowledgement and acceptance of the Network's Privacy Policy and the
Network's right to modify such Privacy Policy without additional notice. <br>
<br>
<b>1.4 Outside Information.</b> The Network may receive information about
individuals from a third party or from other sources of information outside of
the Network including information located in public databases ("Outside
Information"). <br>
<br>
<b>1.5 Individual Information.</b> As used herein, "Individual
Information" means Survey Information, Other Information, Technology
Information, and Outside Information, and any other information the Network
gathers or receives about individuals. <br>
<br>
<b>1.6 No Information Collected from Children.</b> The Network will never
knowingly or intentionally collect any personal information about children
under the age of 13. If the Network obtains actual knowledge that it has
collected personal information about a child under the age of 13, that
information will be immediately deleted from its database. Because it does not
knowingly or intentionally collect such information, to the best of the
Network's knowledge and belief, the Network has no such information to use or
to disclose to a third party. The Network has designed this policy in order to
comply with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act. <br>
<br>
<b>1.7 Credit Card Information.</b> The Network may in certain cases collect
credit card numbers and related information, such as the expiration date of the
card ("Credit Card Information") when an individual places an order
from Network. When the Credit Card Information is submitted to the Network,
such information is encrypted and is protected with SSL encryption software.
The Network will use the Credit Card Information for purposes of processing and
completing the purchase transaction, and the Credit Card Information will be
disclosed to third parties only as necessary to complete the purchase
transaction. </span></p>
