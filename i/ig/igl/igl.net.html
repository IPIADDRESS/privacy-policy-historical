<font size="-2">             <p align="justify">The Intermix Network of websites (the
                    "Network") provides diversionary entertainment,
                    topical news, information, editorial content and on-line shopping
                    to millions of users and subscribers on a daily basis.
					We recognize the importance of safeguarding the on-line privacy of our users.
					The Network recognizes the importance of safeguarding the on-line
                    privacy of its users. The information collected from users
                    of, and subscribers to, the various sites comprising the Network
                    will be used in accordance with the Privacy Policy set forth
                    below. However, this Privacy Policy does not cover web sites
                    or web pages that you may access or link to that are outside
                    the Network. </p>
                  <p><strong>Collection of Information</strong></p>
                  <p align="justify">Information that is Automatically Collected.
                    When a user accesses a Network site, our web server automatically
                    collects and stores the user's domain name, the date and time
                    of access to the site and the Internet address of the web
                    site that linked you to our site. </p>
                  <p align="justify">Information Voluntarily Provided.
				  We collect and store information that is voluntarily provided when
				  a user signs up for a site membership, purchases a product,
                    responds to a survey, signs up for a promotion or to receive
                    or send electronic newsletters, greetings and other emails
                    or content such as weekly jokes or enters a contest sponsored
                    by a Network site. When a membership or a product is purchased,
                    the user provides: name, mailing address, email address, telephone
                    number and credit card number and credit card expiration date
                    in order to complete the transaction. If a user enters a contest
                    or signs up for a promotion, the user provides: name and email
                    address. At various times, users may be asked to voluntarily
                    provide demographic information such as address, age range,
                    gender, occupation, interests or hobbies. Also, in connection
                    with signing up for, or subscribing to, services or features
                    offered across the Network, a user may be requested to provide
                    optional background information in order to identify users
                    and their interests.</p>
                  <p align="justify">Use of Cookies and Storage of Information.
                    We use cookies to collect and store information.
					Cookies are small files that the user's web browser places
                    on the user's hard drive for record keeping purposes. Cookies
                    permit us to identify the user and to recall from the Network's
					database the user's email address and other
                    information that the user has voluntarily provided. Third-party
                    advertising companies that may contract with the Network sites
                    also use cookies. For more information about third-party advertising

                    Information. </p>
                  <p align="justify"><strong>Uses of Information</strong></p>
                  <p align="justify">
				  We use the information that we collect from users in a variety of ways, including to process
				   membership or purchase transactions, to improve the content
                    of the Network sites to address user preferences and to attract
                    new users, to track user trends and patterns on the Internet
                    so that users may be informed about products and services
                    of interest and, in some instances, to properly credit third
                    parties that have referred users to the site. Stored information
                    is also used to pre-populate information fields for purchases,
                    contests or promotions. </p>
                  <p align="justify">Unless a user elects not to receive offers
                    and promotions from sites within the Network or from third-parties,
                    the Network shares individual information with other reputable
                    organizations including its affiliates, its advertisers, its
                    marketing partners and third-party advertising companies that
                    are interested in marketing to the Network users. Demographic
                    information is usually reported in aggregate to third parties
                    who are interested in knowing what type of audience the Network
                    attracts. We use this information to ensure that ads, offers and
					promotions are relevant and of value to users. Our advertisers
					and marketing partners who contract directly with the Netork sites
					are required to confirm that they will comply with the Network's
					Privacy Policy with respect
                    to information collected through ads displayed on any Network
                    site. Third-party advertising companies use cookies to measure
                    and improve the effectiveness of their clients' ads. To do
                    this, advertisers may use anonymous information about a user's
                    visit to a Network site (as well as other websites) including
                    what banner ad was shown, the date and time it was shown,
                    the cookie and the IP address. This information may also be
                    used for online preference marketing purposes. Visit Network

                    advertising cookies. </p>
                  <p align="justify">Users always have the ability through their account page
                    to update, change or delete information that we have collected via the Network.
					Users may also unsubscribe from any email list,
                    opt-out of receiving third party ads or prevent the disclosure
                    of your information to any third party by sending the Network
