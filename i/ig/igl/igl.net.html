        <p><a name="introduction"></a>
          eUniverse ( <a href="http://www.euniverse.com">http://www.euniverse.com</a> )
          is a network of Web sites (referred to hereafter as "the eUniverse Network,"
          or "Network" for short) providing diversionary entertainment and topical
          news, information and editorial content to millions of users and subscribers
          daily. The information collected from users of, and subscribers to,
          the various sites comprising the eUniverse Network, and the manner in
          which that information is used, may vary slightly from site to site
          depending on the nature of the site and the chosen level of involvement
          of the user. Nevertheless, the information contained in this policy,
          and eUniverse's respect for its users' privacy in general, is uniformly
          applicable across the Network. <br>
  <br>
  <b>What user information is collected by eUniverse and how is this information
          used?</b></p>
        <blockquote><b>Information
          automatically collected.</b><br>
          Network sites automatically collect and store the following information
          about you: the name of the domain from which you access the Internet;
          the date and time you access the site; and the Internet address of the
          website from which you linked directly to the Network site. eUniverse
          uses this information to measure the number of visitors to the sites
          in the Network and to different sections of a site, to better develop
          the Network sites to address Network users' preferences and to attract
          new users, and, in some instances, to properly credit third-parties
          who refer users to a site in the Network. <br>
          <br>
          <a name="automatic"></a><b>Information collected for use of services and
          features.</b><br>
          In addition to the information automatically collected any time a user
          visits a site in the Network, users are frequently asked to provide
          certain information in order to take advantage of the services and features
          offered across the Network. Users of sites in the Network are often
          able to enter contests, sign up to receive or send electronic newsletters,
          greetings and other emails or content (such as weekly jokes), become
          members, play games and participate in chat rooms. To provide these
          services to our users, we generally require that the user provide no
          more than a name and an email address. We use the information collected
          to distribute the requested newsletter or other content, to notify contest
          winners, to enable password protected access to certain services and
          sections within sites on the Network, and to provide whatever other
          service the user has authorized in providing the contact information.
          <br>
          <br>
          <a name="purchases"></a><b>Information collected for online purchases.</b><br>
          Some Network sites offer users the opportunity to purchase products,
          such as music CDs or inkjet printer refill cartridges. To complete such
          a transaction, users are asked to provide their name, email address,
          mailing address, telephone number, credit card number and credit card
          expiration date. Once entered, this information is usually saved by
          the e-commerce site. When you choose to make future purchases through
          a Network e-commerce site, this information automatically appears in
          the appropriate spaces (i.e. the information fields are "pre-populated")
          on the web page within the site for placing orders. <br>
          <br>
          <a name="voluntary"></a><b>Information requested and voluntarily provided.</b><br>
          eUniverse may occasionally poll users of Network sites and request background
          information from users such as address, age range, gender, occupation,
          interests, hobbies, etc. (also known as demographic information). Also,
          in connection with signing up for, or subscribing to, the services and
          features offered across the Network, a site may request background information
          to be optionally provided by the user along with whatever other information
          is required. The background information collected in user polls and
          in connection with subscriptions and sign-ups lets eUniverse and its
          advertisers and marketing partners know, in general, who Network users
          are and what they like. This, in turn, helps ensure that ads, offers
          and promotions published on Network sites or delivered to subscribers
          in emails will be relevant and of some value to Network users. Background
          user information is also commonly reported by eUniverse in aggregate
          statistical fashion to third parties interested in knowing what type
          of audience the Network is attracting. <br>
          <br>
          <a name="cookies"></a><b>Use of Cookies and storage of user information.</b><br>
          The first time a user provides an email address in connection with their
          activities at a site in the Network, eUniverse assigns an identification
          number to that email address and deploys a cookie to the user's PC (for
          information about cookies <a href="http://www.flowgo.com/flowgo2_privacy.cfm?show=cookies">click
          here</a>). Whenever that user comes back to a Network site using the
          same PC, the cookie allows the site to identify the user and to recall
          the user's email address. If, at any time, a user provides other information
          in connection with their activities on a Network site (such as name,
          address, birth date, gender, etc. in connection with, e.g., entering
          a contest, completing a survey, or signing up for a promotional offer
          from eUniverse or a third-party advertiser), eUniverse may store that
          information, along with the user's email address, in its user database.
          eUniverse uses the information stored in its database (i) for the purpose
          for which the information was originally provided by a user, (ii) to
          pre-populate information fields in the event a user wishes to sign up
          for and/or subscribe to services, promotions or offers in the future,
          (iii) to ensure that a user will not be repeatedly exposed to the same
          ads, offers and promotions while visiting Network sites, and (iv) to,
          in connection with regular communication with a user, include offers,
          promotions or advertisements historically, or likely to be, of interest
          to that user. eUniverse does not require users to enable the use of
          cookies on their browsers in order to access Network sites and participate
          in any of the activities offered to users. In addition, a user may,
          at any time, review and update their information, or request that eUniverse
          remove any and all information about them, stored in eUniverse's database
          by linking to, and following the instructions at, <a href="http://www.flowgo.com/support.cfm">www.flowgo.com/support.cfm</a>.
          <br>
          <br>
          <a name="advertisements"></a><b>Information collected through advertisements
          and links.</b><br>
          Advertisements appear in various forms and places throughout Network
          sites. eUniverse contracts with advertisers both directly and through
          third-party advertising companies. Advertisers who contract directly
          with eUniverse are required to represent that they comply with eUniverse's
          privacy policy with respect to information collected from users through
          ads displayed on Network sites (see "Information automatically collected"
          above). <br>
          <br>
          As mentioned, eUniverse also uses third-party advertising companies
          to serve ads on Network sites. These third-party advertising companies
          employ cookie and 1x1 pixel .gif technology to measure and improve the
          effectiveness of ads for their clients. To do so, these companies may
          use anonymous information about your visits to Network sites and other
          websites. This information can include: date/time of banner ad shown,
          the banner ad that was shown, their cookie, the IP address. This information
          can also be used for online preference marketing purposes. Users who
          want to prevent a third-party advertiser from setting and/or reading
          cookies on their computer may either visit each ad network's web site
          individually and opt out or visit the NAI gateway opt-out site to opt-out
          of all network advertising cookies. <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/optout_nonppii.asp">Click
          here</a> for the NAI gateway opt-out site. This site will also allow
          you to review the third-party advertising companies' privacy policies.
          <br>
          <br>
          Users should be aware that advertisements, whether text, graphic or
          animated, and whether appearing as banners, buttons or in pop-up windows,
          usually include a link to another page or website where more information
          is available about the particular product or service being advertised.
          This privacy policy only governs eUniverse Network sites and clicking
          on links in ads (or anywhere else for that matter) will often take a
          user to a site outside the Network, where information collection and
          use practices may differ from those employed by eUniverse. When linking
          to sites outside the Network, users should review the privacy policy
          applicable to that site. </blockquote>
        <a name="disclosure"></a><b>Does
        eUniverse disclose user information to anyone?</b>
        <blockquote>Unless
          a user has elected not to receive third-party offers and promotions
          or to limit or prohibit disclosure of information about them, eUniverse
          may provide individual user information to its advertising and marketing
          partners, eUniverse-affiliated companies, or other third parties interested
          in marketing to Network users. Most eUniverse Network services and features
          are provided to users at no charge. Network sites rely upon revenues
          from advertising and marketing in order to deliver content and newsletters
          to their numerous users and subscribers. Network sites make an effort
          to provide users and subscribers with ads and offers that they may find
          of interest and of some value. Nevertheless, it is eUniverse's policy
          to allow users to make the choices about, and to control, the information
          the Network sites collect and the manner in which that information is
          used. For this reason, users always have the ability to update, change
          or delete information about them collected by Network sites, to unsubscribe
          from any mailing list at any time, to opt out of receiving third-party
          ads, promotions and offers, and to prevent disclosure of their information
          to third-parties for such purposes. <br>
          <br>
          Notwithstanding any of the above, Network user information is commonly
          disclosed by eUniverse to advertisers, marketers and others in aggregate
          statistical fashion and not in any way that would allow for personal
          identification of individual users. Also, if a user specifically requests
          a mailing or other opt-in feature, or signs up to receive information
          or services, to be provided by a third-party, the Network site will
          provide that information to the third-party per the request or opt-in.
          <br>
          <br>
          eUniverse reserves the right to, in connection with transfer of its
          assets to any affiliated eUniverse Company, provide user information
          and data to the affiliate subject to the terms of this policy. Similarly,
          eUniverse reserves the right to, in connection with a sale of its assets
          or business to a third party, sell the eUniverse customer database,
          or relevant portion thereof, so that a third-party may be able to continue
          to provide the services and features to which Network users have subscribed.
          <br>
          <br>
          Finally, eUniverse may release user information if required by law,
          to enforce any Network site's terms of service, or to protect the rights,
          property or safety of eUniverse, its registered users, or others. Please
          note that eUniverse's privacy policy does not cover the web sites or
          web pages that link to the eUniverse Network of sites and services.
          </blockquote>
        <a name="protect"></a><b>How
        does eUniverse protect user information?</b>
        <blockquote>
          All transmissions of user information are through eUniverse's
          secure computer servers which, for e-commerce sites, also run authentication
          and data encryption software. Access to registered users' accounts on
          Network sites is password protected. </blockquote>
        <a name="minors"></a><b>How
        do we handle individually identifiable information collected from children
        under the age of 13 years old?</b>
        <blockquote>
          In general, the eUniverse Network is comprised of general
          interest/audience sites and is not directed at children under the age
          of 13. It is eUniverse's policy for Network sites to refrain from knowingly
          collecting personally identifying information from children 12 or under
          and to actively discourage children from providing such information
          at points of collection. <br>
          <br>
          To the extent any Network sites are or become directed at children 12
          or under and knowingly collect personally identifying information from
          those children (such as full name, home address, email address, telephone
          number or any other information that would allow someone to identify
          or contact the child) it is eUniverse's policy for such sites to include
          parental notice and/or consent features consistent with the Children's
          Online Privacy Protection Act. In short, and depending on the nature
          and intended use of the information at issue, sites collecting personally
          identifying information from children will provide parental notice or
          obtain verifiable parental consent as follows: in the case of notice,
          the Network site sends an email to the parents or legal guardian of
          the child that informs them i) what information was collected, ii) what
          contact has been, and/or will be, made, and iii) that the parent may
          require deletion of such information and cessation of any contact; OR,
          in the case of consent, the Network site informs parents or a legal
          guardian i) that the site wishes to collect personal information from
          the child, ii) that a parent's or legal guardian's verifiable consent
          is required for the collection, use and disclosure of the information,
          and iii) how the parent can provide consent. <br>
          <br>
          A parent or legal guardian has the option to agree to the collection
          and use of the child's information without consenting to the disclosure
          of the information to third parties. Network sites send a new notice
          and request for consent to parents and legal guardians if there are
          material changes in the collection, use or disclosure practices to which
          the parent or legal guardian had previously agreed. <br>
          <br>
          Network sites do not send a notice to parents or legal guardians prior
          to collection of a child's email address for the following activities:
          <a name="contests"></a>
          <li>Contest
            entries;
          </li><li>One-time
            online newsletter requests (parents are notified prior to future deliveries
            of the newsletter and given an opportunity to consent);
          </li><li>Electronic
            postcard or other e-greeting deliveries;
          </li><li>Providing
            notice and seeking consent to collect a child's or parent's email
            address; or
          </li><li>Responding
            to a one-time request from a child and then deleting the email address.
            <br>
            <br>
            At any time, a parent or legal guardian may revoke his/her consent
            or refuse to allow a Network site further use of his/her child's personal
            information and request that eUniverse delete the information. Effecting
            such a request can be accomplished using the contact information provided
            on the relevant Network site. Please note that a site may terminate
            any service provided to the child if the deleted information at issue
            is reasonably necessary for the child's participation in that activity.
        </li></blockquote>
