<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
	<p>The International Game Developers Association ("<strong>IGDA</strong>") 
      is committed to respecting the privacy rights of members, users and all 
      visitors to the web site. The following policy describes how the IGDA protects 
      information it receives from visitors to its web site:</p>

                  
    <h3>What information does the IGDA collect and how does the IGDA use it?</h3>
      
      <p>You may visit and use many features of our site without any registration 
      at all, however, in order to participate in the online discussion forums, 
      mailing lists, monthly newsletter and posts to the various resource databases, 
      we require you to either become an IGDA member or create an IGDA user account. 
      When you register, we will collect mandatory contact information (your name, 
      email address, mailing address and work phone), and optional demographic 
      information regarding your business (such as your job title, type of business, 
      number of employees, etc.). In order to register or renew your membership 
      on the site, your credit card information will also be collected.</p>
      
      <p>We use the information we collect to tailor your experience at our site 
      to content that we think you might be interested in, to display content 
      according to your preferences, to process and tailor your membership and 
      to provide a faster method for you to submit information to IGDA, and receive 
      back information or products you desire. We also use your IP address to 
      help diagnose problems with our server, and to administer our site. In addition, 
      your IP address is used to gather broad aggregated demographic information, 
      such as the number of visitors from a geographic area.</p>
      
      <p>On occasion the IGDA hosts contests and promotions. When you enter a contest 
      or other promotional feature, the IGDA may ask for additional information, 
      including further contact and demographic information, as well as consumer 
      preference information so that we are able to better administer the contest 
      and notify winners.</p>
      
      
    <p>Members and registered users will receive the IGDA's monthly email newsletter, 
      which includes notifications from the IGDA and IGDA partners and sponsors 
      about important functionality, changes to the web site, new IGDA services, 
      special offers we think you'll find valuable as well as overall news of 
      the IGDA and the game development industry. If you would rather not receive 
      the newsletter you may do so by either opting-out on your <a href="membership/myprofile.php">MyProfile 
      page</a>, or by submitting such an unsubscribe request to <a href="mailto:info@igda.org">info@igda.org</a>.</p>
                  
    <h3>How does the IGDA protect visitor information?</h3>
      
      
    <p>The IGDA implements a variety of security measures to maintain the safety 
      and confidentiality of your personal information. User personal information 
      is contained behind secured networks and is only accessible by a limited 
      number of employees who have special access rights to such systems. When 
      you register or access your personal information, we offer the use of a 
      secure server. All sensitive and credit information supplied by users is 
      transmitted and protected via Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology and then 
      encrypted into the IGDA's databases to be only accessed as stated above 
      (credit card information is NOT stored once your membership fee is processed).</p>
      
      <p>To ensure compliance with updated security technology, the IGDA recommends 
      using one of the following browsers, each of which can be downloaded free 
      of charge: Netscape Navigator (<a href="http://www.netscape.com">http://www.netscape.com</a>), 
      or Microsoft Internet Explorer (<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/ie">http://www.microsoft.com/ie</a>). 
      To ensure the highest level of security available today, the IGDA suggests 
      that you choose the 128-bit encryption version from the download options. 
      If you do not have access to a browser that supports at least 48-bit encryption, 
      your information may not be processed by the IGDA's servers, or may not 
      be securely transferred through your web browser to the IGDA's servers.</p>
      
      
    <p>When you submit information to us (or to any other web site) over the Internet, 
      the information may travel over many networks and systems that are not under 
      the control of the IGDA. The Internet is not completely secure and others 
      may intercept the information that you are sending. Further, anything you 
      voluntarily provide in any public area of the IGDA web site, including in 
      any discussion forum or mailing list, will be publicly available to other 
      visitors on the web site and potentially to other third parties, and you 
      should always exercise caution when deciding to publicly disclose any of 
      your personal information. The IGDA is not responsible for submissions to 
      discussion forums or mailing lists and your submissions could be used by 
      others in ways that the IGDA is unable to control. Please see our <a href="terms.php">Terms 
      of Use</a> for further information.</p>

                  
    <h3>Does the IGDA use "cookies"?</h3>
      
      <p>Cookies are bits of electronic information that a web site can transfer 
      to a visitor's hard drive to help tailor and keep records of his or her 
      visit to the site. Cookies allow web site operators to better customize 
      visits to the site to the visitor's individual preferences. The use of cookies 
      is standard on the Internet and many web sites use them. Although most web 
      browsers automatically accept cookies, you can usually change your browser 
      to prevent or notify you whenever you are sent a cookie. This gives you 
      the chance to decide whether or not to accept it. Even without accepting 
      a cookie, you can still access most of the features on the site. The IGDA 
      uses cookies in the discussion forums so that they can help provide its 
      visitors with a better experience at the forums, and to save your password 
      so you don't have to re-enter it each time you visit the forums. If you 
      would like more information about cookies, we suggest you visit <a href="http://www.cookiecentral.com">http://www.cookiecentral.com</a>.</p>

                  
    <h3>Does the IGDA disclose the information it collects from its visitors 
      to outside parties?</h3>
      
      
    <p>The IGDA does not, and never will, sell or trade any personally identifiable 
      information that visitors provide in any registration, purchase, or contest 
      submission on the web site. The IGDA does from time to time share data solely 
      in an AGGREGATE form (that will not enable third parties to personally identify 
      individual users, including you) to partners for marketing, advertising, 
      or other uses. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the IGDA reserves the right 
      to disclose any personal information about you to law enforcement or other 
      government officials as the IGDA, in its sole discretion, believe is necessary 
      or appropriate.</p>
                  
    <h3>The IGDA's special note to parents</h3>
      
      <p>Pursuant to the provisions of the Federal Children's Online Privacy Protection 
      Act (COPPA), we are not permitted, and therefore do not, collect personal 
      identifiable information from children we actually know to be under thirteen 
      years of age without the consent of that child's parent or legal guardian. 
      The IGDA is a general audience web site that does not contain content specifically 
      directed to children under the age of 13.</p>
                  
    <h3>How does a visitor opt-out, remove, or modify information they have 
      provided to IGDA?</h3>
      
      
    <p>After gathering any user information, the IGDA offers users the opportunity 
      to remove their information from our database so as not to receive future 
      communications or to no longer interact with the web site until they later 
      chose to by sending such a request to the IGDA at <a href="mailto:info@igda.org">info@igda.org</a>, 
      or as set forth below under "Contact Us." IGDA additionally provides 
      users the opportunity to update and modify any information they have previously 
      provided by viewing their <a href="membership/myprofile.php">MyProfile page</a>.</p>
      
      <p>In addition, our monthly email newsletter will always contain instructions 
      on how to discontinue receipt of the newsletter. However, if a visitor at 
      anytime chooses to no longer receive such information and opt-out from any 
      future mailings, they should simply reply to the IGDA's removal instructions 
      and request to be removed from any such list and/or mailings, or they may 
      also send such a request to <a href="mailto:info@igda.org">info@igda.org</a>.</p>
                  
    <h3>Third party links and co-brand relationships</h3>
      
      <p>In an attempt to provide increased value to our visitors, the IGDA may choose 
      various third party web sites to link from its own site. The IGDA also participates 
      in co-branding and other relationships to offer e-commerce and other services 
      and features to its users. However, even if the third party is affiliated 
      with the IGDA, the IGDA has no control over these linked sites, each of 
      who have separate privacy and data collection practices independent of the 
      IGDA. Data collected by our co-brand partners or third party web sites (even 
      if offered on or through our site) is not received, stored, or used in any 
      way by the IGDA. As such, the IGDA has no responsibility or liability for 
      these independent policies or actions, and is not responsible for the privacy 
      practices or the content of any such web sites. These linked sites are only 
      for your convenience and you therefore access them at your own risk. Nonetheless, 
      the IGDA seeks to protect the integrity of its web site and the links placed 
      upon it and therefore requests any feedback on not only its own site, but 
      for sites it links to as well (including if a specific link does not work).</p>
                  
    <h3>Public Forums</h3>
      
    <p>The IGDA makes discussion forums and mailing lists available at the web 
      site. These resources are read-only for non-registered visitors to the IGDA 
      web site. Only IGDA members and registered users may post to these resources. 
      As such, please remember that any information that is disclosed in these 
      areas immediately becomes public information and you should exercise caution 
      when deciding to disclose your personal information. The IGDA is not responsible 
      for submissions in discussion forums and/or mailing lists and your submissions 
      could be used by others in ways that the IGDA is unable to control. Please 
      see our <a href="terms.php">Terms of Use</a> for further information.</p>
                  
    <h3>Your Consent</h3>
      
      <p>By using our web site, you consent to the collection and use of information 
      by the IGDA as set forth in this Privacy Policy. If we decide to change 
      our privacy policy, we will post those changes on this page so that you 
      will always be aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and 
      under what limited circumstances we disclose it. Continued access or use 
      of the web site shall constitute your express acceptance of any modifications 
      to this Privacy Policy.</p>
                  
    <h3>Contact Us</h3>
      
      <p>The IGDA welcomes your questions, comments, and concerns about privacy. 
      Please send us any and all feedback pertaining to this, or any other issue, 
      at <a href="mailto:info@igda.org">info@igda.org</a>.</p>
