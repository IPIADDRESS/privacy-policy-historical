<strong>Other Information Collected</strong><br>
Some data may be collected automatically every time you visit the Company's web sites, such as cookies and computer data. In addition, data may be collected other independent, third-party sources. We also collect information about which pages you visit within this site. This site visitation data is identified only by a unique URL.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<strong>Cookies</strong><br>
The Company uses both session ID cookies and persistent cookies as part of its interaction with your browser. A cookie is an alphanumeric identifier (a file) that the Company's web sites transfer to your computer's hard drive through a web browser to enable its systems to recognize your browser for record-keeping purposes. A session ID cookie expires when you close your browser, while a persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period of time.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
We use session ID cookies to make it easier for you to navigate the our web sites. We use persistent cookies to identify and track which sections of its web site you most often visit. We also use persistent cookies in areas of its web site you must register, and you are able to customize the information you see, so that you don't have to enter your preferences more than once.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
By configuring the options in your browser, you may control how cookies are processed by your system. However, if you decline the use of cookies you may not be able to use certain features on this site and you may be required to reenter the information required to complete an order during new or interrupted browser sessions.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Some of the Company's business partners (e.g., advertisers) use cookies on the site. We have no access to or control over these cookies (see 'Third Party Advertising' and 'Third Party Cookies' below). Accordingly, this Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies by the Company only and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<strong>Log Files&nbsp;</strong><br>
As is true of most web sites, the Company gathers certain information automatically and stores it in log files. This information includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet services provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data. The Company uses this information to analyze trends, to screen for fraud, to administer the Company's sites, to track users' movements around the web sites and to gather demographic information about the Company's user base as a whole.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<strong>Clear Gifs (Web Beacons/Web Bugs)</strong>&nbsp;<br>
The Company employs a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs), that helps it better manage content on its web sites by informing the Company what content is effective. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of web users. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user's computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
The Company uses clear gifs in its HTML-based e-mails to inform itself of which e-mails have been opened by you. This allows the Company to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of the Company's marketing campaigns. If you would like to opt-out of these e-mails, please see 'Choice and Opt-Out' section of this Privacy Policy.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
<strong>Special Offers and Updates&nbsp;</strong><br>

The Company transmits the data used by its external service providers for the specific outsourced operations listed above across public and private networks via recognized encryption technologies, such as by using Secure Sockets layer (SSL) software, which encrypts the data you input.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Although the Company follows the procedures set forth above to protect the Personal data submitted to the Company, no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure.

<strong>Other Information Collected</strong><br>
Some data may be collected automatically every time you visit the Company's web sites, such as cookies and computer data. In addition, data may be collected other independent, third-party sources. We also collect information about which pages you visit within this site. This site visitation data is identified only by a unique URL.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<strong>Cookies</strong><br>
The Company uses both session ID cookies and persistent cookies as part of its interaction with your browser. A cookie is an alphanumeric identifier (a file) that the Company's web sites transfer to your computer's hard drive through a web browser to enable its systems to recognize your browser for record-keeping purposes. A session ID cookie expires when you close your browser, while a persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period of time.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
We use session ID cookies to make it easier for you to navigate the our web sites. We use persistent cookies to identify and track which sections of its web site you most often visit. We also use persistent cookies in areas of its web site you must register, and you are able to customize the information you see, so that you don't have to enter your preferences more than once.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
By configuring the options in your browser, you may control how cookies are processed by your system. However, if you decline the use of cookies you may not be able to use certain features on this site and you may be required to reenter the information required to complete an order during new or interrupted browser sessions.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Some of the Company's business partners (e.g., advertisers) use cookies on the site. We have no access to or control over these cookies (see 'Third Party Advertising' and 'Third Party Cookies' below). Accordingly, this Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies by the Company only and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<strong>Log Files&nbsp;</strong><br>
As is true of most web sites, the Company gathers certain information automatically and stores it in log files. This information includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet services provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data. The Company uses this information to analyze trends, to screen for fraud, to administer the Company's sites, to track users' movements around the web sites and to gather demographic information about the Company's user base as a whole.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<strong>Clear Gifs (Web Beacons/Web Bugs)</strong>&nbsp;<br>
The Company employs a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs), that helps it better manage content on its web sites by informing the Company what content is effective. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of web users. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user's computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
The Company uses clear gifs in its HTML-based e-mails to inform itself of which e-mails have been opened by you. This allows the Company to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of the Company's marketing campaigns. If you would like to opt-out of these e-mails, please see 'Choice and Opt-Out' section of this Privacy Policy.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
<strong>Special Offers and Updates&nbsp;</strong><br>
The Company collects data about which sections of its web site you visit most often, so that it can send you our newsletter and data about relevant offers, promotions, contests, and sweepstakes which may interest you.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Accordingly, the Company will occasionally send you information on products, services, special deals, promotions and sweepstakes.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<strong>Service-related Announcements</strong>&nbsp;<br>

&nbsp;<br>

&nbsp;<br>
Although the Company follows the procedures set forth above to protect the Personal data submitted to the Company, no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure.
