        PRIVACY POLICY </strong> </div>
        <p>iGames is committed to honoring the privacy of our members and visitors.
          This Privacy Policy, part of our overall <a href="/tos.asp" class="bodylink">Terms
          of Service</a>, describes exactly how iGames uses personally identifiable
          information regarding our members (such as name, address, and email
          addresses) (“<strong>Personal Information</strong>”) collected
          through the domain and sub-domains of <a href="http://www.igames.org" class="bodylink">www.igames.org</a> (the “<strong>Site</strong>”)
          as part of the registration process or otherwise in connection with
          your use of the various services (the “<strong>Service</strong>”)
          offered by iGames through the Site. </p>
        <p><strong>What information does iGames receive and how do we use it?</strong><br>
            <em>Registration Information</em>. When you become a member of iGames
            or register for various iGames services on the Site, we ask you for
            your name, contact information, preferences, and certain demographic
            information (<em>i.e.</em> the country in which you live and, in
            case of individuals, your age). In addition, for game center members
            we ask for information about your game center, such as the number
            and type of gaming platforms. This information lets us provide personalized
            services and communicate separately with you. We also use aggregated
            information about the use of our Service to evaluate our users’ preferences
            and improve our programming.</p>
        <p>Under the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act, no web site
          operator can require, as a condition of participation in an activity,
          that a child under the age of 13 disclose more information than is
          reasonably necessary to participate in that activity. iGames abides
          by this requirement. </p>
        <p><em>Events.</em> Game center members have the ability to initiate
          events, including tournaments, through the Service. In order to create
          such events through the Service, iGames requires Personal Information
          from the sponsoring game center. If gamer members wish to participate
          in such events, they will be required to provide certain Personal Information
          and may be asked to provide additional, optional, information. In addition,
          if the event is one for which iGames rankings are available (this is
          disclosed at the time of registration), iGames will collect the results
          of the event and incorporate them into the iGames rankings for the
          particular games. The rankings will indicate the relative standing
          of each participant for the particular game. </p>
        <p><em>Promotions.</em> We may occasionally run optional contests, surveys
          or other special promotions on the Service in which we ask participants
          for Personal Information or demographic information (like a zip code,
          age or favorite video game). We may use the data we collect in these
          contests and promotions to send you promotional material about iGames
          or third parties. Your Personal Information collected from these contests
          and promotions may be used to contact you when necessary and may be
          shared with other companies for promotional purposes, but only under
          the terms and conditions specified when you take part in the promotion.</p>
        <p><em>IP Addresses and Cookies.</em> Like most websites, our server
          software gathers in log files general demographic information from
          all users of the Site. This includes browser types and versions, Windows
          versions, IP addresses, dates, times and referring domains. We use
          this information to help us understand our visitors’ needs and
          to improve the Service and the Site. We also use small bits of data
          called “cookies” stored on users’ computers to simulate
          a continuous connection. Cookies let us “remember” information
          about your preferences and passwords and allow you to move within the
          Service and the Site without reintroducing yourself. You can see and
          control cookies through settings in your browser. However, refusing
          to accept cookies may limit your ability to access certain portions
          of the Service or the Site and it will not allow you to log into the
          members only portion of the site. </p>
        <p><strong>Is the information I provide disclosed to third parties?</strong> As
          a matter of policy, iGames does not sell or rent your Personal Information
          to any third party. However, the following describes some of the ways
          that your Personal Information may be disclosed and used:</p>
        <p><em>Technical Limits.</em> Due to technical limitations, iGames is
          unable to guarantee that your Personal Information will never be disclosed
          in ways not described in this Privacy Policy. For example, third parties
          (aka hackers) may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or abuse
          or misuse information that they collect from the Service or the Site.
          Therefore, although we use industry standard practices to protect your
          privacy, we do not promise, and you should not expect, that your Personal
          Information will always remain private. </p>
        <p><em>Game Centers.</em> If you are a member gamer and you indicate,
          when registering or by updating your account information, that you
          have a “home game center” which is a member of iGames,
          then we will provide to that game center Personal Information about
          you so that such game center may contact you about its activities,
          promotions and other matters which they believe may be of interest
          to you. </p>
        <p>If you participate in an event sponsored by a particular game center
          member, your Personal Information will be provided to such game center
          in order to operate the event and report the results. That game center
          also may use your Personal Information to contact you about its other
          activities, promotions and other matters which they believe may be
          of interest to you. </p>
        <p>Each game center member has agreed that it may only use the Personal
          Information it receives from iGames in a manner consistent with this
          Privacy Policy. However, iGames is unable to ensure that this will
          be the case. If you do not want to have your Personal Information provided
          to a game center, then do not designate a “home game center” and
          do not participate in game center sponsored events.</p>
        <p><em>Game Publishers, Advertisers, Etc.</em> We gather Personal Information
          and disclose such information in an aggregate (non-personally identifiable)
          manner to game publishers, advertisers and other third parties for
          marketing and promotional purposes and to enable these companies to
          understand the number and composition of the iGames members and their
          use of the Service. In these situations, we do not disclose to these
          entities any information that could be used to identify you personally.
          However, if you respond to ads provided by an advertiser they may assume
          that you fit a certain demographic profile based on the aggregate information
          provided to them. In addition, when you click on a banner ad, you should
          be aware that the advertiser may be collecting information from you.</p>
        <p>iGames also may allow certain companies, called third-party ad servers
          or ad networks, to serve advertisements to you through the Service
          and the Site. These companies may send their own cookies to your cookie
          file, just as if you had requested a web page from the Site. If you
          want to prevent a third-party ad server from sending and reading cookies
          on your computer, you must adjust the settings for cookies in your
          browser. </p>
        <p><em>Game Center Member Op- In.</em> During registration Game center
          members are provided the option to “Opt In” to having personal
          information shared with 3rd parties so that the 3rd parties may use
          your information to contact you about promotional materials, product
          information special offers, and other communications. The game center
          member must physically select to Opt-In either during the registration
          process or when updating their profile. If you wish to remove yourself
          from “Opt-In” you must deselect this option from your profile
          page. </p>
        <p><em>Other iGames Service Users.</em> The Service enables users to
          send and receive electronic mail, and participate in forums or other
          discussion groups such as private chats via the Internet. Of course,
          if you elect to exchange messages and share information with others
          and participate in forums or discussion groups, iGames has no control
          over what these third parties do with this information. For this reason,
          iGames strongly recommends that you use care when disclosing personally
          identifiable information to others. </p>
        <p><em>External Service Providers.</em> You may separately agree to provide
          information about yourself to other companies who provide content for
          various parts of the Service, in order to use their services, order
          their products, or receive offers from them. If you agree to provide
          information to these companies, that information will be subject to
          their privacy policies. iGames has no responsibility or liability for
          these independent policies. You should, therefore, review their privacy
          policies carefully if you have concerns about what information is collected
          and how it may be used.</p>
        <p><em>Internal Service Providers.</em> We may use internal service providers
          to facilitate and evaluate the Service. This may require disclosure
          of some of your Personal Information to these service providers. In
          some instances, the internal service provider may collect information
          directly from you. In all cases, these internal service providers’ use
          of your Personal Information is restricted by confidentiality agreements. </p>
        <p>Other Related Entities. From time to time we may provide information
          about you to our subsidiaries and other related entities in order to
          provide you the Service. Each of these entities will comply with the
          policies described in this Privacy Policy.</p>
        <p><em>Acquisition.</em> If the stock or assets of iGames, its subsidiaries,
          its joint ventures, or any combination of such, are acquired by another
          entity, then some or all of your Personal Information may be provided
          to such successor entity in connection with that transaction. </p>
        <p><em>Legal Requests.</em> iGames may disclose your Personal Information
          to law enforcement and such other government officials as we, in our
          sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate, in connection with
          an investigation or prosecution of alleged illegal activity. iGames
          also may disclose information about you pursuant to a court order in
          a civil action or other lawsuit. </p>
        <p><em>Children’s Information.</em> Please note that parents have
          the option of allowing iGames to collect and use their child’s
          information without consenting to iGames sharing this information with
          people and companies who may use this information for their own purposes. </p>
        <p><strong>May I choose what information I disclose?</strong> While we
          need certain information to register you as a unique user and let you
          access personalized services, other requested information is optional
          and may be given at your discretion. However, you may be unable to
          participate in optional services if you fail to provide certain requested
          information.</p>
        <p><strong>May I choose what communications I receive?</strong> We send
          out communications including an email newsletter, newsflashes and emails
          regarding events and programs to iGames members as part of the Service.
          You may cancel your iGames membership at any time and then you will
          no longer receive these communications.</p>
        <p><strong>What kind of security is used to protect my information?</strong> We
          store all Personal Information and other user information in secure
          databases protected using a variety of access controls. This data is
          accessed only for the purposes specified in this Privacy Policy. We
          limit access to Personal Information to only those employees, contractors
          and volunteers who need it to carry out their jobs. iGames personnel
          with access to Personal Information have been advised of the importance
          of maintaining the confidentiality of such information and of using
          it only for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy.</p>
        <p>Your Membership account and Personal Information on our Service is
          password-protected. We strongly recommend that you do not give your
          password to anyone and that you change it every 3 months. If you are
          using a public computer (public library, school computer, etc.) or
          a shared computer (family computer, roommate’s computer, etc.),
          we strongly recommend that you sign out of your iGames account and
          close your browser before getting up and moving away from the computer.
          This will prevent others from accessing your Membership account and
          Personal Information.</p>
        <p><strong>What if I need to review or change the contact information
            I previously disclosed?</strong> We encourage iGames members to update
            and edit their contact information and keep it current. You can easily
            correct or update contact and account information or delete optional
            information in the preferences menu at any time by using your login
            and password to access your iGames account. In addition, parents
            can review and edit information as well as delete optional information
            relating to their child’s iGames’ contact information,
            account information, and Membership through the same method. </p>
        <p>To delete required information, you may cancel your Membership but
          please understand, we also retain information in back-up storage for
          some period of time after your deletion request. This may be the case
          even though no information about your account remains in our active
          member databases.</p>
        <p><strong>What about children’s information?</strong> When a child
          under 13 years of age attempts to register with iGames, we ask that
          he or she have a parent or guardian consent to such registration. iGames
          will not contact children under age 13 about special offers or for
          marketing purposes without a parent’s permission. iGames does
          not ask a child under age 13 for more personal information, as a condition
          of participation, than is reasonably necessary to participate in a
          given activity or promotion. To protect children under 13, iGames will
          not allow the child to select a “home” game center (which
          provides the game center with the information collected during player
          registration). </p>
        <p><strong>Other information about privacy:</strong> <br>
            <em>Visitors from outside the United States:</em> For those of you
            visiting us from outside the United States of America, please note
            that if you register or use the Service, the information you enter
            may be transferred outside of your country. By using the Service,
            you consent to this transfer and to the information usage described
            above. If you choose to access the Service or the Site from outside
            the United States of America, you take responsibility for compliance
            with applicable privacy laws of your country. </p>
        <p><em>Notification of Change:</em> iGames may amend this Privacy Policy
          from time to time. Any changes to this Privacy Policy will be posted
          on this page so that you always will know what information we collect,
          how it is used, and when and how it will be disclosed. If at any point
          iGames decides to use Personal Information in a manner different from
          that stated at the time it was collected, we may also notify affected
          users by way of an email sent to the email address which you have provided
          to us. Your use of the Service or the Site following notice of such
          change will be deemed acceptance of the revised Privacy Policy, which
          may include application of the new policy to Personal Information provided
          prior to the date of such change. </p>
