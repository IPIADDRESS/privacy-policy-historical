          personally identifiable information does Yehey! collect from me? </i></b></font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">Yehey! 
          collects information in several ways from different parts of our network 
          of web sites. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">Some personal 
          information is gathered when you register. Upon registration, Yehey! 
          asks for your name, email address, birth date, gender, zip code, occupation, 
          industry and personal interests. The more information you volunteer 
          (and the more accurate it is), the better we are able to customize your 
          experience. Once you register you are no longer anonymous to Yehey! 
          - you are given a Yehey! ID and are able to take full advantage of Yehey!'s 
          many offerings. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">In addition 
          to registration we may ask you for personal information at other times, 
          including (but not limited to) when you enter a sweepstakes, contest 
          or promotion sponsored by Yehey! and/or our many partners; when you 
          submit a listing for a web site; and when you report a problem with 
          one of our sites or services. If you constantly keep in contact with 
          Yehey! we may keep a record of that correspondence. Yehey! also occasionally 
          asks users to complete surveys that we use for research purposes. Wherever 
          Yehey! collects personal information we make an effort to include a 
          link to this Privacy Policy on that page. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1"><b><i>What 
          are cookies and how does Yehey! use them?</i></b> </font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">As part 
          of offering and providing customizable and personalized services, Yehey! 
          uses cookies to store and sometimes track information about you. A cookie 
          is a small amount of data that is sent to your browser from a web server 
          and stored on your computer's hard drive. All sites on Yehey! where 
          you are prompted to log-in or that are customizable require that you 
          accept cookies. (See <i>"What are my choices regarding collection, use 
          and distribution of my information?"</i> for more information on cookies.) 
          </font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">Generally, 
          we use cookies to: </font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">(1) Remind 
          us of who you are and to access your account information (stored on 
          our computers) in order to deliver to you a better and more personalized 
          service. This cookie is set when you register or "Sign In" and is modified 
          when you "Sign Out" of our services. Yehey! also uses cookies to store 
          your zip code for other services, such as Yellow Pages. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">(2) Estimate 
          our audience size. Each browser accessing Yehey! is given a unique cookie 
          which is then used to determine the extent of repeat usage, usage by 
          a registered user versus by an unregistered user, and to help target 
          advertisements based on user interests and behavior. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">(3) Assist 
          merchants to track visits to and business at their stores. This information 
          collected by cookies is sometimes called "clickstream" or "click trail" 
          and may also describe which pages you have seen in each merchant's store. 
          </font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">(4) Track 
          your progress and number of entries in some of our promotions, sweepstakes 
          and contests. When a Yehey!-hosted promotion uses cookies, the information 
          written to the cookie indicates the player's progress through the promotion, 
          and may be used to track entries, submissions, and status in prize drawings. 
          </font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">(5) Measure 
          certain traffic patterns, which areas of Yehey!'s network of web sites 
          you have visited, and your visiting patterns in the aggregate. We use 
          this research to understand how our users' habits are similar or different 
          from one another so that we can make each new experience on Yehey! a 
          better one. We may use this information to better personalize the content, 
          banners, and promotions that you and other users will see on our sites. 
          </font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">Advertising 
          networks that serve ads onto Yehey! may also use their own cookies. 
          </font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">Yehey! 
          also collects IP addresses for system administration and to report aggregate 
          information to our advertisers. In addition, Yehey! Mail includes IP 
          addresses in outgoing mail message headers. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1"><b><i>How 
          does Yehey! use my information?</i></b> </font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">Yehey!'s 
          primary goal in collecting personal information is to provide you, the 
          user, with a customized experience on our network of sites. This includes 
          personalization services, interactive communications, online shopping 
          and many other types of services, most of which are completely free 
          to you. In order to provide services free of charge, we display advertisements. 
          By knowing a little about you, Yehey! is able to deliver more relevant 
          advertisements and content, and hence better service, to you. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">In our 
          role of delivering targeted advertisements, Yehey! plays the middleman. 
          Advertisers give us an advertisement and tell us the type of audience 
          they want to reach (for example, males over 35 years old). Yehey! takes 
          the advertisement and displays it to users meeting that criteria. In 
          this process, the advertiser never has access to individual account 
          information. Only Yehey! has access to individuals' accounts. This kind 
          of advertisement targeting is done with banner ads as well as promotional 
          email through Yehey! Delivers. You will only receive special offers 
          via email from Yehey! if you have indicated in your account preferences 
          that you would like to receive them. You can change your account preferences 
          at any time. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">Yehey! 
          does research on our users' demographics, interests, and behavior based 
          on the information provided to us upon registration, during a promotion, 
          from our server log files or from surveys. We do this to better understand 
          and serve our users. This research is compiled and analyzed on an aggregated 
          basis. Yehey! may share this aggregated data with advertisers or business 
          partners. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1"><b><i>Who 
          is collecting information?</i></b> </font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">When you 
          are on a Yehey! site and are asked for personal information, you are 
          sharing that information with Yehey! alone, unless it is specifically 
          stated otherwise. For example, some Yehey! services, like Yehey! Jobs, 
          are offered in conjunction with a partner company. In order to provide 
          this co-branded service to you, it is necessary for us to share your 
          personal information with our partner company. If data is being collected 
          and/or maintained by any company other than Yehey!, you will be notified 
          prior to the time of the data collection or transfer. If you do not 
          want your data to be shared, you can choose not to allow the transfer 
          by not using that particular service. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">Promotions 
          that run on Yehey! may be sponsored by companies other than Yehey! or 
          may be cosponsored by Yehey! and another company. Some or all data collected 
          during a promotion may be shared with the sponsor. If data will be shared, 
          you will be notified prior to the time of data collection or transfer. 
          You can decide not to participate in the promotion if you don't want 
          your data to be shared. Currently, most Yehey! promotions are limited 
          to Philippine residents. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">Please 
          be aware that Yehey! advertisers or web sites that have links on our

          of shared use can be found in specific Terms of Use, and promotions 
          rules. Some or all data collected during a Yehey! promotion may be shared 
          with a sponsor. If personally identifying data about you will be shared, 
          we will tell you before we collect or transfer the data. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">Many promotions 
          offer opportunities to request additional information from sponsors. 
          By requesting more information, you give Yehey! permission to transfer 
          your personal information to the sponsor so they can fulfill your request. 
          In many instances, only your email address will be shared. If more information 
          will be shared with the sponsor, you will be notified prior to the transfer.

          may, from time to time, send you email regarding our products and services. 
          In addition, if you indicated upon registration that you are interested 
          in receiving offers or information from Yehey! and our partners, we 
          may occasionally send you direct mail about products and services that 
          we feel may be of interest to you. Only Yehey! (or agents working on 
          behalf of Yehey! and under confidentiality agreements) will send you 
          these direct mailings and only if you indicated that you do not object 
          to these offers. If you do not want to receive such mailings, simply 
          tell us when you give us your personal information. Or, at any time 
          you can easily edit your Yehey! Account Information to no longer receive 
          such offers and mailings. You will need your Yehey! ID and Password 
          in order to access your Yehey! Account Information. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">On some 
          types of Yehey! promotions, we will ask for your email address in order 
          to update you on your score, entries, and status in prize drawings. 
          When you participate in these types of promotions, you automatically 
          receive promotion-related email, unless you choose the no-email option 
          that some promotions offer. Occasionally these promotion-related email 
          messages may include targeted advertisements. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">You also 
          have choices with respect to cookies. By modifying your browser preferences,

          you will be unable to use those Yehey! services that require registration 
          in order to participate. </font></p>

        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">Your Yehey! 
          account can be deleted or deactivated, but doing so will result in not 
          being able to access any members-only area of the Yehey! network, including 
          your Yehey! Mail account (if you have one). If you saved the confirmation 
          email you received when you first created your Yehey! account, you can 
          use the URL provided in that message to delete your account at any time. 
          Please contact <a href="mailto:privacy@teamyehey.com">privacy@teamyehey.com</a>

        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">We recommend 
          that you do not divulge your password to anyone. Yehey! will never ask 
          you for your password in an unsolicited phone call or in an unsolicited 
          email. Also remember to sign out of your Yehey! account and close your 
          browser window when you have finished your work. This is to ensure that 
          others cannot access your personal information and correspondence if 
          you share a computer with someone else or are using a computer in a 
          public place like a library or Internet cafe. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">Unfortunately, 
          no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100%

          Yehey! cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you 
          transmit to us or from our online products or services, and you do so 
          at your own risk. Once we receive your transmission, we make our best

          keep in mind that whenever you voluntarily disclose personal information 
          online - for example on message boards, through email, or in chat areas 
          - that information can be collected and used by others. In short, if 
          you post personal information online that is accessible to the public, 
          you may receive unsolicited messages from other parties in return. </font></p>
