           asks for your name, email address, birth 
          date, gender, zip code, occupation, industry and personal interests. 
          The more information you volunteer (and the more accurate it is), the 
          better we are able to customize your experience. Once you register you 
          are no longer anonymous to YEHEY! - you

          many offerings.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">In

          other times, including (but not limited to) when you enter a sweepstakes, 
          contest or promotion sponsored by YEHEY! and/or our many partners; when 
          you submit a listing for a web site; and when you report a problem with 
          one of our sites or services. If you constantly keep in contact with 
          yehey! we may keep a record of that correspondence. YEHEY! also occasionally 
          asks users to complete surveys that we use for research purposes. Wherever 
          Yehey! collects personal information we make an effort to include a

          of offering and providing customizable and personalized services, YEHEY! 
          uses cookies to store and sometimes track information about you. A cookie 
          is a small amount of data that is sent to your browser from a web server 
          and stored on your computer's hard drive. All sites on YEHEY! where 
          you are prompted to log-in or that are customizable require that you 
          accept cookies. (See <i>"What are my choices regarding collection, use 
          and distribution of my information?"</i> for more information on cookies.)

        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">Generally,

          us of who you are and to access your account information (stored on 
          our computers) in order to deliver to you a better and more personalized 
          service. This cookie is set when you register or "Sign In" and is modified 
          when you "Sign Out" of our services. YEHEY! also uses cookies to store 
          your zip code for other services, such as Yellow Pages. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">(2) Estimate 
          our audience size. Each browser accessing YEHEY! is given a unique cookie 
          which is then used to determine the extent of repeat usage, usage by 
          a registered user versus by an unregistered user, and to help target 
          advertisements based on user interests and behavior. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">(3) Assist 
          merchants to track visits to and business at their stores. This information 
          collected by cookies is sometimes called "clickstream" or "click trail" 
          and may also describe which pages you have seen in each merchant's store. 
          </font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">(4) Track 
          your progress and number of entries in some of our promotions, sweepstakes 
          and contests. When a YEHEY!-hosted promotion uses cookies, the information 
          written to the cookie indicates the player's progress through the promotion, 
          and may be used to track entries, submissions, and status in prize drawings. 
          </font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">(5) Measure 
          certain traffic patterns, which areas of YEHEY!'s 
          network of web sites you have visited, and your visiting patterns in 
          the aggregate. We use this research to understand how our users' habits 
          are similar or different from one another so that we can make each new 
          experience on YEHEY! a better one.YEHEY! a 
          better one. We may use this information to better personalize the content, 
          banners, and promotions that you and other users will see on our sites. 
          </font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana" size="1"> 
          Advertising networks that serve ads onto YEHEY! may also use their own 
          cookies. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">YEHEY! 
          also collects IP addresses for system administration and to report aggregate 
          information to our advertisers. In addition, yehey! Mail includes IP 
          addresses in outgoing mail message headers. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1" color="#000099"><b>How 
          does YEHEY! use my information?</b> </font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">YEHEY!'s 
          primary goal in collecting personal information is to provide you, the 
          user, with a customized experience on our network of sites. This includes 
          personalization services, interactive communications, online shopping 
          and many other types of services, most of which are completely free 
          to you. In order to provide services free of charge, we display advertisements. 
          By knowing a little about you, YEHEY! is able to deliver more relevant 
          advertisements and content, and hence better service, to you. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">In our 
          role of delivering targeted advertisements, YEHEY! plays the middleman. 
          Advertisers give us an advertisement and tell us the type of audience 
          they want to reach (for example, males over 35 years old). YEHEY! takes 
          the advertisement and displays it to users meeting that criteria. In 
          this process, the advertiser never has access to individual account 
          information. Only yehey! has access to individuals' accounts. This kind 
          of advertisement targeting is done with banner ads as well as promotional 
          email. You will only receive special offers 
          via email from YEHEY! if you have indicated in your account preferences 
          that you would like to receive them. You can change your account preferences 
          at any time. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">YEHEY! 
          does research on our users' demographics, interests, and behavior based 
          on the information provided to us upon registration, during a promotion, 
          from our server log files or from surveys. We do this to better understand 
          and serve our users. This research is compiled and analyzed on an aggregated 
          basis. yehey! may share this aggregated data with advertisers or business 
          partners. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1" color="#000099"><b>Who 
          is collecting information?</b> </font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">When you 
          are on a
		   YEHEY! site and are asked for personal information, you are 
          sharing that information with YEHEY! alone, unless it is specifically 
          stated otherwise. For example, some yehey! services, like yehey! Jobs, 
          are offered in conjunction with a partner company. In order to provide 
          this co-branded service to you, it is necessary for us to share your 
          personal information with our partner company. If data is being collected 
          and/or maintained by any company other than yehey!, you will be notified 
          prior to the time of the data collection or transfer. If you do not 
          want your data to be shared, you can choose not to allow the transfer 
          by not using that particular service. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">Promotions 
          that run on YEHEY! may be sponsored by companies other than YEHEY! or 
          may be cosponsored by yehey! and another company. Some or all data collected 
          during a promotion may be shared with the sponsor. If data will be shared, 
          you will be notified prior to the time of data collection or transfer. 
          You can decide not to participate in the promotion if you don't want 
          your data to be shared. Currently, most yehey! promotions are limited 
          to Philippine residents. </font></p>

          your personal information to the sponsor so they can fulfill your request. 
          In many instances, only your email address will be shared. If more information

        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">We recommend

          browser window when you have finished your work. This is to ensure that 
          others cannot access your personal information and correspondence if 
          you share a computer with someone else or are using a computer in a

          transmit to us or from our online products or services, and you do so
