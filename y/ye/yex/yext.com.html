          We, like many businesses, sometimes hire other companies (the "Service Providers") to perform certain
          business-related functions. Examples include mailing information, maintaining databases, and hosting services.  When
          we employ another company to perform a function of this nature, we provide them with the information that they need
          to perform their specific function, which may include information that you provide to us via Yext.<br>
          <br>
          We may share the information that you provide to us with Service Providers, which information shall be protected
          by such Service Providers in accordance with their privacy policies.  All information that you share directly with
          the Service Providers will be governed by such Service Providers' privacy policies.  When you call a Service
          Provider using the phone number available via Yext, we, or our third party service providers, may record these
          phone calls and share such recordings with the applicable Service Provider.  The recordings shall be maintained by
          the Service Providers in accordance with their privacy policies.<br>
          <br>

          List, Yext retains the right to contact you via telemarketing in accordance with the ATSR. Moreover, by registering
          with, or requesting information from, a third-party advertiser at or through Yext, such action shall constitute

          you may be contacted via e-mail, direct mail and/or telemarketing by such third-party advertiser in accordance with
          the ATSR.<br>
          <br>
