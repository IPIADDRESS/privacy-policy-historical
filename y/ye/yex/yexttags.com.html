  <h1>Yext.com Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p class="section-head">(Last Updated: August 12, 2014)</p>
  <p>This Privacy Policy (this "Privacy Policy") discloses the privacy practices for <a href="www.yext.com">www.yext.com</a> and all other internet properties (collectively, the "Sites") belonging to Yext, Inc. or any of its affiliates ("Yext", "us" or "we"). We understand the importance that Internet users place on privacy and have designed this Privacy Policy to disclose and describe our information-gathering and dissemination practices. You agree to this Privacy Policy, in its entirety, when you: 1) access or use any Site; and/or 2) agree to receive e-mail from us. Please note that we reserve the right to review and update this Privacy Policy from time to time by posting a prominent notice on the homepage stating that the Privacy Policy has been changed and updating the effective date of this Privacy Policy. If we make any material changes we will notify you by email (sent to the e-mail address specified in your account) or by means of a notice on this Site prior to the change becoming effective. If you use a Site after the amended Privacy Policy has been posted, you will be deemed to have agreed to the amended Privacy Policy.</p>
  <h3><span class="section-head">This Privacy Policy addresses the following:</span></h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Information that we collect about you.</li>
    <li>What we do with the information that we collect.</li>
    <li>With whom we share the information we collect.</li>
    <li>Our opt-out policy.</li>
    <li>Our policy on correcting and updating the personally identifiable information and deactivation of your account.</li>
    <li>Miscellaneous</li>
  </ol>
  <h2>Information that we collect about you:</h2>
  <h3><span class="section-head">Information Provided by You Upon Registration</span>.  <span style="font-weight: normal">Upon registration, you may be required to provide some or all of the following personally identifiable information ("PII"):</span></h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Name</li>
    <li>Gender</li>
    <li>E-mail address</li>
    <li>ZIP Code</li>
    <li>Home Phone</li>
    <li>Mobile Phone Phone</li>
    <li>Credit Card Number</li>
  </ol>
  <p><span class="section-head">Passively Collected Information</span>.  When you interact with us through a Site, we receive and store certain additional information. Such information, which is collected passively using various technologies, cannot presently be used to specifically identify you. Examples include IP addresses, browser types, domain names, and other anonymous statistical data involving your use of a Site and/or our services.</p>
  <p><span class="section-head">Use of Cookies</span>. In operating the Sites, we use "cookies." A "cookie" is a piece of information that the computer that hosts a Site gives to your computer when you access a Site. Cookies enable us to deliver content specific to your interests, to save your password so that you do not have to re-enter it each time that you visit a Site (if you choose), and for other purposes. On most web browsers, you will find a "help" section on the toolbar. Please refer to this section for information on how to receive notification when you are receiving a new cookie and how to turn cookies off. Acceptance of cookies is not a requirement to browse a Site; however certain areas and features of a Site require your acceptance of cookies to work properly.</p>
  <p><span class="section-head">Use of Web Beacons</span>.  We employ a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs), that help us better manage content on our site by informing us what content is effective.  Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users.  In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on Web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. We tie the information gathered by clear gifs to our customers’ personally identifiable information.</p>
  <p><span class="section-head">3rd Party Tracking</span>. We may use third-party service providers to serve advertisements on our behalf across the Internet. These service providers may collect your IP address and non-personally identifiable or de-identified information about your visits to our Sites in order to serve ads while you are visiting other web sites. Such non-personally identifiable information is anonymous or de-identified and does not reflect your name, address, e-mail address or other personal information; however your IP address may be collected by such services. This anonymous or de-identified information is often collected through the use of a web beacon, which is industry-standard technology used by most major websites. Third party advertising sites, such as Facebook Ads, may use web beacons to track conversions of the ads we run on Facebook and other websites. </p>
  <p><span class="section-head">Use of Google Analytics</span>.  We use a third-party tracking service called Google Analytics that uses cookies to track non-personally identifiable information about visitors to our Sites in the aggregate.</p>
  <h2>What we do with the information we collect</h2>
  <p><span class="section-head">Use of PII</span>.  If you provide PII for a certain reason, we will use the PII in connection with the reason for which it was provided. For example, we will use the PII you input during the registration process to administer your access to a Site. We may also use the registration data that you provide to personalize your experience with us and for verification purposes. We also use contact information from your registration data to send you information about us and to keep you informed of our other products and services that may be of interest to you. Your contact information is also used to reach you, when necessary, regarding issues concerning the use of the Sites and/or our service. We use PII collected through the Sites to help us improve the Sites and our products and services, and to better understand our users. We may use your PII to create aggregate data. Aggregate data is data that describes the demographics, usage or other characteristics of a Site's users as a group without disclosing PII. We reserve the right to transfer and/or sell aggregate or group data about a Site's users for lawful purposes. We may also create internal reports on user demographics and traffic patterns and share these reports with our advertisers and partners. We may include your PII in our reports. This information allows our third-party advertisers and partners to deliver, and our users to receive, more relevant advertisements. We use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server, and to administer the Sites. Your IP address is also used to gather broad and specific demographic information as well as for validation purposes.</p>

  <p><span class="section-head">Use of Information that is NOT PII</span>. We may pool information that is not PII with other information in order to track, for example, the total number of visitors to a Site, the number of visitors to each page of a Site, the domain names of our users' Internet service providers. No PII is available or used in this process.</p>

  <p><span class="section-head">Amended Telemarketing Sales Rule</span>.  With your consent, by submitting your e-mail address via a Site and/or obtaining services from us, you agree to receive e-mail marketing from us and our third-party advertisers. In addition, you agree that such act constitutes a purchase, an inquiry and/or an application for purposes of the Amended Telemarketing Sales Rule, 16 CFR 310 et seq. (the "ATSR"). Notwithstanding that your telephone number may be listed on the Federal Trade Commission's Do-Not-Call List, we retain the right to contact you via telemarketing in accordance with the ATSR. Moreover, by registering with, or requesting information from, a third-party advertiser at or through a Site, such action shall constitute a purchase, an inquiry and/or an application with the respective third-party advertiser for purposes of the ATSR and you may be contacted via e-mail, direct mail and/or telemarketing by such third-party advertiser in accordance with the ATSR.</p>

  <h2>With whom we share the information we collect:</h2>
  <span style="font-weight: normal">We will share your personal information with third parties only in the ways that are described in this privacy policy.  We do not sell your personal information to third parties.</span>
  <p><span class="section-head">Third Party Advertisers</span>.  We are able to offer our services to you, in part, based on your willingness to be reached by our third-party advertisers. By allowing us to make the information you supply available to these third parties, you will receive free information on products and services that may be of interest to you. This information may also be shared with advertisers on an aggregate basis. Please keep in mind, though, that we do not control, and are not responsible for, the practices of our third-party advertisers.</p>
  <p><span class="section-head">Third-Party Offers</span>.  We may provide you with the opportunity to receive special offers, products and/or services from third-party companies. To receive such offers, products or services, your PII will be shared with such third-party companies, so that they may provide their products and/or services to you without requiring that you first fill another registration form. You may opt-out of receiving these communications by emailing us at <a href="mailto:service@yext.com">service@yext.com</a>.</p>
  <p><span class="section-head">Third-Party Newsletter</span>.  With your use of a Site, you may receive a complimentary copy of the Privacy Safety Newsletter via email. You may unsubscribe from the Newsletter at any time by emailing service@yext.com. Any questions or concerns regarding the Privacy Safety Newsletter should also be sent to <a href="mailto:service@yext.com">service@yext.com</a>.</p>


  <p><span class="section-head">Service Providers</span>.  We, like many businesses, sometimes hire other companies ("Service Providers") to perform certain business-related functions. Examples include mailing information, maintaining databases, and hosting services. When we employ a Service Provider to perform a function of this nature, we provide it with the information that it needs to perform its specific function, which may include PII and other information that you provide to us via a Site. All information that we provide to a Service Provider, as well as information that you share directly with a Service Provider, will be governed by such Service Provider's privacy policies. When you call a Service Provider using a phone number available via a Site, we, or our third party service providers, may record these phone calls and share such recordings with the applicable Service Provider. The recordings shall be maintained by the Service Providers in accordance with their privacy policies.</p>

  <p><span class="section-head">Legal Requirements</span>: We may disclose PII if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to (a) comply with a legal obligation, (b) protect and defend our rights or property, (c) act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of any Site or the public, or (d) protect against legal liability. Moreover, you hereby consent to disclosure of any record or communication to any third party when we, in our sole discretion, determine the disclosure to be appropriate including, without limitation, sharing your e-mail address with other third parties for suppression purposes in compliance with the CAN-SPAM Act of 2003, as amended from time to time.</p>

  <p><span class="section-head">Business Transfers</span>: As we develop our business, we might sell or buy businesses or assets. In the event of a corporate sale, merger, reorganization, dissolution or similar event, PII may be part of the transferred assets. You will be notified via email and/or a prominent notice on our Web site of any change in ownership or uses of your personal information, as well as any choices you may have regarding your personal information.</p>

  <h2>Our opt-out policy:</h2>
  <p>To stop receiving future communications from us or to opt out of having your PII shared with third parties, please send an e-mail with your Login Name and e-mail address to <a href="mailto:service@yext.com">service@yext.com</a>. To unsubscribe from our service, please send an e-mail with your Login Name and e-mail address to <a href="mailto:service@yext.com">service@yext.com</a>.</p>

  <h2>Our policy on correcting and updating PII and deactivating your account:</h2>
  <p>If your PII changes, or if you no longer desire our services, you may correct, update or delete your PII, and/or deactivate your account, by emailing our Customer Support at <a href="mailto:service@yext.com">service@yext.com</a>.</p>
  <p><span class="section-head">Data Retention</span>: We will retain personal data and the data we process on behalf of our customers for as long as needed in order to provide our services and as required by law
  
  </p><h2>Miscellaneous</h2>
  <p><span class="section-head">Other Websites</span>.  The Sites may contain links to third-party owned and/or operated websites. We are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such websites. We suggest that you contact these third parties directly for information regarding their privacy, security and data collection and distribution policies prior to providing them with any information.</p>
  <p><span class="section-head">Blogs and Public Features of the Sites</span>.  Our website offers publicly accessible blogs or community forums. You should be aware that any PII you submit there can be read and collected by other users of these forums and could be used to send you unsolicited messages and for other purposes. To request removal of your personal information from our blog or community forum, contact us at <a href="mailto:service@yext.com">service@yext.com</a>.  In some cases, we may not be able to remove your personal information, in which case we will let you know if we are unable to do so and why.</p>
  <p>You may also post a comment by registering with the third party application that manages our blog. NONE OF THE INFORMATION THAT YOU PROVIDE USING THESE FEATURES IS PROTECTED BY THIS PRIVACY POLICY. WE ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR THE PII YOU CHOOSE TO SUBMIT IN THESE FORUMS OR THE USE THEREOF BY ANY THIRD PARTY. You will need to contact or login into the third party application if you want the PII that was posted to the comments section removed. To learn how the third party application uses your information, please review their privacy policy.</p>

  <p><span class="section-head">Testimonials</span>.  We may post customer testimonials on the Sites which may contain PII such as the customer's name. We obtain the customer's consent to post his/her PII along with the testimonial, prior to posting the testimonial.  If you want to remove your PII that is being displayed on a Site under public pages, please send your request to <a href="mailto:service@yext.com">service@yext.com</a>.</p>

  <p><span class="section-head">Social Media Widgets</span>.  Our Web site may include social media features, such as the Facebook Like button and widgets such as the share this button or interactive mini-programs that run on our site. These features may collect your IP address, which pages you are visiting on our Sites, and may set a cookie to enable the feature to function properly. Social media features and widgets are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our Site. Your interactions with these features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing them.</p>
  <p><span class="section-head">Security</span>.  We take commercially reasonable steps to protect PII from loss, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction. However, no Internet or e-mail transmission is ever fully secure or error free. In particular, e-mail sent to or from a Site may not be secure, and you should therefore take special care in deciding what information you send to us via e-mail. Please keep this in mind when disclosing any PII to us or to any other party via the Internet. The security of your personal information is important to us.  When you enter sensitive information (such as a credit card number) on our order forms, we encrypt the transmission of that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL).</p>
  <p><span class="section-head">Minors</span>.  Visitors under 18 years of age are not permitted to use and/or submit their personal information at any Site. We do not knowingly solicit or collect information from visitors under 18 years of age. We encourage parents and guardians to spend time online with their children and to participate and monitor the interactive activities of their children.</p>
