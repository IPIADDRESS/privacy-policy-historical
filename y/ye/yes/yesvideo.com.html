This Privacy Policy is entered into in conjunction with the MemorySafe Terms and Conditions of Use. This Privacy Policy may be updated by YesVideo from time to time.

<br>
<strong>HOW INFORMATION IS USED </strong><br>
<br>
<strong>Personal Data</strong><br>
Personal Data may be used for the following purposes: (i) to provide and improve our Service, (ii) to administer your use of the Service, (iii) to enable you to enjoy and easily navigate the Service, (iv) to better understand users’ needs and interests, (v) to fulfill requests users may make, (vi) to personalize users’ experience, and (vii) to provide or offer updates and/or Service announcements. We may also use Personal Data to provide you with further information and offers from us or third parties that we believe you may find useful or interesting, including newsletters, marketing or promotional materials and other information on services and products offered by us or third parties ("Marketing Communications"). If you decide at any time that you no longer wish to receive any such Marketing Communications, please follow the "unsubscribe" instructions provided in any of the communications sent to you. <br>
<br>
We will not sell or market the email addresses or other collected personal information of registered users to third parties. We will not view the files that you upload using the Service, unless reasonably required for monitoring purposes (see our Terms and Conditions of Use). We may view your file system information to provide technical support. You acknowledge and agree that YesVideo may occasionally send you administrative communications regarding your account or the Service via email. <br>
<br>
<strong>Cookies and Passive Data Collection</strong><br>
YesVideo uses cookies, IP addresses, and URLs to improve and further develop the Service, and to provide enhanced features to users, where available. YesVideo uses cookies to save user names, session validators, and on users’ browsers and hard drives, and may use them to provide tailored products and services to those users, as they become available. In addition, YesVideo may use cookies to authenticate the user on each page after the user logs on to the site. You may instruct your browser, by changing its options, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the sites you visit. However, if you do not accept cookies, you may not be able to use all portions or functionality of the Service. IP addresses also help us to diagnose problems with our servers, to administer the Service, and to otherwise provide the Service to our users. We use information we obtain by these technical means for the above purposes and in order to monitor and analyze use of the Service, for the Service’s technical administration, to increase the Service’s functionality and user-friendliness, to better tailor it to users’ needs, to generate and derive useful data and information concerning the interests, characteristics and site use behavior of our users, and to verify that users meet the criteria required to process their use or requests. <br>
<br>
<strong>Surveillance</strong><br>
YesVideo disclaims any intention to censor, edit, or engage in ongoing review or surveillance of communications stored on or transmitted through its facilities by users or others. YesVideo will, however, review, delete, or block access to communications that may harm YesVideo, its users or other third parties. The grounds on which YesVideo may take such action include, but are not limited to, actual or potential violations of the MemorySafe Terms and Conditions of Use or of this MemorySafe Privacy Policy. <br>
<strong><br>

<br>
<strong>DISCLOSURES </strong><br>
<br>
<strong>YesVideo Partners and Affiliates</strong><br>
YesVideo may disclose users’ Personal Data to third party business partners or affiliates who provide specific services to the user along with the Service (such as hosting or other support services). Such third party business partner or affiliate may have their own privacy policies, and if YesVideo discloses the third parties name to the user, it is your responsibility to read and adhere to such policies. However, if we disclose your Personal Data to a third party business partner or affiliate that you are reasonably unaware of, then YesVideo will require that such third party’s privacy policy is at least as strong as YesVideo’s; otherwise, users will be provided with a mechanism to opt-out of having their Personal Data viewed by such third parties.<br>

Change of Ownership</strong><br>
In the event of a change in ownership (including through bankruptcy), or a merger, acquisition or sale of assets with or to another entity, we reserve the right to transfer all of the MemorySafe user information, including Personal Data, to such separate entity. We will use commercially reasonable efforts to notify you (by posting on our site or an email to the email address you provide when you register) of any change in ownership, merger or acquisition of the MemorySafe Service assets by a third party, and you may choose to modify any of your registration information at that time. <br>

<br>
<strong>International Transfers</strong><br>
Personal Data may be stored and processed in the United States, or in any other country in which YesVideo or its affiliates, subsidiaries or agents maintain facilities, and by using or accessing the Service, you consent to any such transfer of Personal Data outside of your country. <br>
<br>
<strong>SECURITY</strong><br>
<br>
YesVideo uses industry standard security measures to protect against the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control. Although we make good faith efforts to store the information collected by the MemorySafe Service in a secure operating environment that is not available to the public, such as using SSL security measures, YesVideo cannot guarantee complete security.
