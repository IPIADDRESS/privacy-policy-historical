<p>
We at YesVideo.com respect your right to privacy
and have a firm commitment to safeguarding our customers' personal information.
YesVideo.com will not rent, sell, or share any information regarding any
individual customer (such as name, address, e-mail address or credit cards
numbers) to any third party other than under the terms outlined in this privacy
statement.
</p>

<p>
YesVideo.com collects information from you at
several different points on our website. By using our services, you consent to
the collection and use of information as described below. If we decide to
change our privacy practices, we will post those changes on this page so that
you are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under
what circumstances we disclose it.
</p>

<p>
<b>Your Videos</b>
<br>
YesVideo is committed to providing you with a
safe and private environment to upload and share your videos. Your uploaded
videos and Playlists are accessible only through your password protected member
area.
</p>

<p>
When you webcast a Playlist, YesVideo will send 
an e-mail to the e-mail address of the member account to which the Playlist has been 
uploaded, containing the URL to your webcast. To share your webcast, simply 
forward the e-mail containing the URL.&nbsp;&nbsp;Please note that your invitees can then 
forward that e-mail containing the URL to other parties, if they choose.
</p>

<p>
YesVideo may disclose information it has
collected from any member of the YesVideo Site ("Member") and/or
content any Member has made available on the YesVideo Site when it believes in
good faith that the law or legal process requires it, or when it is necessary
to do so to protect the rights or property of YesVideo or others.
</p>

<p>
<b>Third Party Service Providers</b>
<br>
We may share your personally identifiable information with those companies that
assist us in providing our service to you. Following are some examples of our
use of third party service providers: We may share your credit card information
with a financial institution to effect your purchase of our products using your
credit card. We may share personally identifiable information (not including
credit card information) with third parties that assist us with the
administration of our newsletters or contests or that help us understand the
results of particular surveys we may perform. We may also engage third parties
to assist us by tracking the number of visitors to the YesVideo site that have
"clicked-through" from specified promotions on third party Web sites
and those visitors' activities on the YesVideo Site. We may also choose to
offer certain third party products through the YesVideo Site and may disclose
certain portions of your personally identifiable information (not including
credit card information) to allow those vendors to fulfill your product order.
</p>

<p>
<b>Information We Collect</b>
<br>
During registration you are required to give contact information such as name
and e-mail address. This information is used to contact you about the services
on our site for which you have expressed interest.

When you purchase YesVideo.com products, we also
need financial information - credit card number and expiration date - and
billing and shipping address. This information is used for processing your
order and fulfilling your order. If we have trouble processing an order, this
contact information is used to get in touch with you.
</p>

<p>
<b>Cookies</b>
<br>
YesVideo.com's&nbsp;cookies do not contain any personal information about
you. They contain a unique identifier
that only we can match up with your personal information, which allows you to
use the ordering and member-related features on our site. Our cookies expire when you log off our
site, or after 30 minutes of inactivity on our site.
</p>

<p>
<b>IP Address</b>
<br>
We analyze IP addresses in the aggregate for system administration purposes and
to gather broad demographic information. We do not link IP addresses to your
computer's User ID, with the following exception: when you place an order using
our online checkout process we record your computer's IP address with your
order to help us identify fraudulent credit card use. We may share this
information with the financial institution that issued the credit card with
which an order was placed, or with law enforcement authorities if we determine,
or are notified, that the use of the credit card was fraudulent.
</p>

<p>
<b>Affiliate IP Address</b>
<br>
If you entered the YesVideo Site by clicking a link or promotion on another Web
site (including a YesVideo co-branded portion of another Web site), we will
store the ID of that affiliate site in our database along with your computer's
User ID. We do this to ensure that the affiliate site receives proper credit
for any subsequent order you might place. We may also use this information in
conjunction with your activities on our site to help us identify what offers
and services may be of interest to you.
</p>

<p>
<b>Sharing</b>
<br>
We may share aggregated demographic information with our partners and
advertisers. This is not linked to any personal information that can identify
any individual person.
</p>

<p>
<b>Links</b>
<br>
This web site may contain links to other sites. Please be aware that we,
YesVideo.com, are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other
sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read
the privacy statements of each and every website that collects personally
identifiable information. This privacy statement applies solely to information
collected by this website.
</p>

<p>
<b>Surveys &amp; Contests</b>
<br>
From time-to-time our site requests information from users via surveys or
contests. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary
and the user therefore has a choice whether or not to disclose this
information. Information requested may include contact information (such as
name and shipping address), and demographic information (such as zip code, age
level). Contact information will be used to notify the winners and award
prizes. Survey information will be used for purposes of monitoring or improving
the use and satisfaction of this site.
</p>

<p>
<b>Security</b>
<br>
This website takes every precaution to protect our users’ information. When you
submit sensitive information via the website, your information is protected.
</p>

<p>
When our registration/order form asks you to
enter sensitive information (such as credit card number), that information is
encrypted and is protected with the best encryption software in the industry -
SSL. While on a secure page, such as our order form, the lock icon on the
bottom of Web browsers such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet
Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to un-locked, or open, when you are just
‘surfing’.
</p>

<p>
If you have any questions about the security at
our website, you can send an email to <a href="mailto:support@yesvideo.com">support@yesvideo.com.</a>
</p>

<p>
<b>Correction/Updating Personal Information:</b>
<br>
If your personally identifiable information changes (such as your zip code) we
will endeavor to provide a way to correct or update or your personal data
provided to us. This can usually be done at the user profile page or by
e-mailing our Customer Support.
</p>

<p>
<b>Choice/Opt-out</b>
<br>
You are given the opportunity to 'opt-in' of having your information used for
purposes not directly related to at the point where we ask for the information.
For example, our order form has an ‘opt-in’ mechanism so users who buy products
or services from us, and want to receive marketing materials, surveys or other
e-mail communication, can include their e-mail address in our lists.
</p>

<p>
Users who no longer wish to receive our
newsletter or promotional materials may opt-out of receiving these
communications by either changing their user profile or replying to unsubscribe
in the subject line in the email or email us at <a href="mailto:support@yesvideo.com">support@yesvideo.com</a>
</p>

<p>
<b>Notification of Changes</b>
<br>
If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes on this
page so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use
it, and under circumstances, if any, we disclose it. If at any point we decide
to use personally identifiable information in a manner different from that
stated at the time it was collected, we will post a notification of that change
on this page. Users will have a choice as to whether or not we use their
information in this different manner. We will use information in accordance
with the privacy policy under which the information was collected.
