            <h2>OUR COMMITMENT TO PRIVACY</h2>

            <p>This Privacy Policy (“Privacy Policy”) sets forth the information privacy practices of Yesware, Inc.
                (“Yesware”, “we” or “us”) for www.yesware.com (the “Site”). Except where otherwise expressly indicated
                in this Privacy Policy or on the Site, this Privacy Policy applies only to information collected on the
                Site and does not apply to information collected outside of the Site. This Privacy Policy also does not
                apply to content, business information, ideas, concepts or inventions that you send to Yesware by email.
                Please refer to our <a href="http://www.yesware.com/terms.html" title="Terms of Use">Terms of Use</a>
                for our policy with respect to such information. If you want to keep such information private or
                proprietary, please do not send it an email or otherwise provide such information to Yesware.</p>

            <p>Before using or submitting information to the Site, please review this Privacy Policy carefully.</p>

            <h2>INFORMATION THAT WE COLLECT AND HOW WE USE IT</h2>

            <p>Personal Information: Personally identifiable information (“Personal Information”) is information that
                can be used to identify or contact you, such as your name, email address, telephone number or similar
                information. We only collect Personal Information that you choose to share with us, such as when you
                send us an email or initiate a chat session. If you contact us via email, we will use your Personal
                Information contained in your email to respond to your specific inquiry or comments in the email.
                Likewise, when you initiate a chat sessions, we will use any Personal Information that you submit to
                respond to your inquiry. We may retain your email for a period of time but will not use any of your
                Personal Information for any purpose other than responding to your email.</p>

            <p>Aggregate Information: When you visit the Site, we may monitor your activity on the Site. This
                information will not be stored in a manner that is personally identifiable with you. Also, in connection
                with your visit to the Site, we may collect various categories of non-personally identifiable
                information, including, without limitation, aggregated statistics generated from visitors to our Site
                (“Users”).</p>

            <p>We use “cookies” to help you access and navigate the Site more efficiently and to statistically monitor
                how many Users are using the Site. A “cookie” is a small file or tool stored on a User’s hard drive
                containing information that allows us to deliver customized information to you. You may set your browser
                to notify you of or decline the receipt of cookies; however, certain features of the Site may not
                function properly or be available if your browser is configured to disable cookies.
                We use both "session" and "persistent" cookies on this Site. Session cookies are temporary bits of
                information that are erased once you exit your web browser or turn off your computer. Persistent cookies
                are more permanent bits of information that are placed on the hard drive of your computer and stay there
                unless you delete the cookie. They store information on your computer for a number of reasons, such as
                helping to determine what areas of the Site you find most valuable. Persistent cookies placed on your
                computer by this Site do not store any personal information.</p>

                permission, to comply with any applicable law, regulation, legal process or governmental request.
                Yesware reserves the right to disclose Personal Information of a User who we believe is in violation of
                these Terms of Use or in order to protect or defend Yesware’s rights or property, even without a
