<h1 style="text-align: left; ">
	&nbsp;</h1>
<p>
	Effective: April 1, 2011<br>
	Last Revised: June 12, 2012</p>
<p style="text-align: left; ">
	<strong>WELCOME</strong><br>
	This Privacy Policy (“Privacy Policy”) is designed to help you understand how Yesware, Inc. (“Yesware”, “we” or “us”) collects and uses the information that you share when you use www.yesware.com and its associated domains (together, the “Site”), as well as the information, software or services available through the Site (collectively, “Services”).&nbsp; Except where otherwise expressly indicated in this Privacy Policy or on the Site, this Privacy Policy applies only to information collected on the Site and through the Services and does not apply to information that we receive off-line.</p>
<p>
	Before submitting information to the Site or Services, please review this Privacy Policy carefully.&nbsp; By using or accessing the Site or Services, you are accepting the practices described in this Privacy Policy.&nbsp; You are responsible for submitting accurate information to the Site.&nbsp; If you prefer that we not collect your personal information, please do not provide it to us.&nbsp; When you submit your personal and other information on the Site, you hereby consent to the collection, use and disclosure of such information as set forth in the Privacy Policy.</p>
<p style="text-align: left; ">
	<strong>INFORMATION WE COLLECT</strong><br>
	We collect the information that you share with us, including:</p>
<p>
	1. Personal Information: "Personal Information" is information that can personally identify you.&nbsp; We maintain one or more databases to store your Personal Information and may retain it as reasonably required to fulfill the purposes identified herein.&nbsp; Personal Information that we collect depends on how you use the Site.&nbsp; For example, if you register to use or use any of the Services, we may collect your name, email address, telephone number, information about other software that you use and the email addresses that you provide to us.&nbsp; If you use access and use the Site and/or Services through a mobile device, Yesware may collect information regarding your GPS location and associated services from your mobile device.&nbsp; Providing your Personal Information to us is your choice.&nbsp; If you choose not to provide us with certain Personal Information, you may not be able to take advantage of certain features of the Site and Services; and</p>
<p style="text-align: left; ">
	2. General Information:&nbsp; When you visit the Site, we may collect various categories of general non-personal information (“General Information”).&nbsp; General Information includes browser information, operating system information, IP address and the date, time, length of stay and specific pages accessed during your visits to the Site.&nbsp; When possible, General Information may be linked to Personal Information.</p>
<p>
	We also may collect information from the people with whom you interact by email when you use the Site and Services.&nbsp; This information may include the number of times that the recipient opens your email, the recipient’s IP address and the computer platform that the recipient is using.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: left; ">
	Yesware does not collect or store your credit card information.&nbsp; If you purchase Services, your credit card information is processed and stored by Stripe (https://stripe.com/).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<strong>COOKIES &amp; OTHER ONLINE IDENTIFICATION TOOLS</strong><br>
	A “cookie” is a small file or tool sent from a website to your web browser and stored on your computer.&nbsp;&nbsp; A “session cookie” is comprised of temporary bits of information that are erased once you exit your web browser or turn off your computer.&nbsp; A “persistent cookie” is comprised of more permanent bits of information that are placed on the hard drive of your computer and stay there until you delete the cookie.&nbsp; A persistent cookie enables a website to recognize you when you return.<br>
	Yesware uses various types of session and persistent cookies to help you access and navigate the Site more efficiently, to customize your experience of the Site and Services, to store certain information that you previously provided (such as username and password), to authenticate users and to statistically monitor how many users are using the Site and Services.&nbsp; You may set your browser to notify you when a cookie is placed or decline the receipt of cookies; however, certain features of the Site and Services will not function properly or be available if your browser is configured to disable cookies.</p>
<p style="text-align: left; ">
	Yesware also may use web beacons (a.k.a. clear GIFs, web bugs or pixel tags) to personalize your experience of the Site and Services.&nbsp; Web beacons usually are not visible to you and are delivered by a web browser as part of a web page request or in an email.&nbsp; Web beacons collect General Information, such as the number and time of interactions with an email containing a web beacon, the type of browser used and IP address.&nbsp; Web beacons may be use alone or in conjunction with cookies; when web beacons are used with cookies, they may link General Information to Personal Information.</p>
