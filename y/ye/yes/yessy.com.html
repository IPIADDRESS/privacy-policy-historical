<p>2. INFORMATION COLLECTION AND USE</p>

<p>Yessy does not collect any unique information about you (such as your name, email address, etc.) except when you specifically and knowingly provide such information. Yessy collects personal information and information about your transactions when you use Yessy services, such as buying and selling art. When you register, Yessy asks for your email address.

<p>Yessy automatically receives and records information on the Yessy server logs from your browser, including your IP address, Yessy cookie information, and the page you request.</p>

<p>3. INFORMATION SHARING AND DISCLOSURE</p>

<p>Yessy does not rent, sell, or share personal information about you with other people or companies. Yessy may divulge aggregate information about users but will not share personally identifiable information with any third party without your express consent. For example, Yessy may disclose how frequently the average Yessy user visits Yessy, or which sort of art is most popular. Please be aware, however, that Yessy will release specific personal information about you if required to do so in order to comply with any valid legal process such as a search warrant, subpoena, statute, or court order, or if Yessy believes it is necessary to share information in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of the <a href="/terms.html">Terms of Service</a>, or as otherwise required by law. </p>

<p>4. CONFIDENTIALITY AND SECURITY</p>

<p>Yessy limits access to personal information about you to employees who Yessy believes reasonably need to come into contact with that information in order to do their jobs.</p>

<p>Yessy has physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards that comply with federal regulations to protect personal information about you. Your Yessy account information is password-protected. In certain areas, such as Checkout, Yessy uses industry-standard SSL-encryption to protect data transmissions.</p>

<p>5. PREFERENCES</p>

<p>Yessy reserves the right to send you certain communications relating to Yessy, such as service announcements and administrative messages, which are considered part of Yessy membership, without offering you the opportunity to opt-out of receiving them.</p>
