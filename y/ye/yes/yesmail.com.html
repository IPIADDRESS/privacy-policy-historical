				we will respect their needs for privacy. Our relationships are our most valuable asset and the very
				basis for our reputation, so we will only disclose information that companies and individuals have
				given us explicit permission to disclose.</p>

				Enterprise and Yesmail Professional solutions and the Yesmail Web site, www.yesmail.com. TRUSTe can
				only cover the activities on this Web site, www.yesmail.com.</p>

				comments you may have. We read every message sent in and try to reply promptly to every one when
				appropriate. The information we receive from you is used to respond directly to your questions or

				<h3>Permission Marketing is Our Philosophy</h3>
				<p>Yesmail facilitates the most consumer-oriented marketing practices in the e-mail marketing industry.
				By supporting permission e-mail, we allow individuals to identify personal preferences and needs, and
				then only communicate with them regarding those specific areas for which they have identified an
				interest. Using our unique opt-in survey methodology, we truly can understand the individuals'
				personal needs and tailor communication accordingly.</p>
				
				<h3>Prospecting Services Deliver Only Targeted Information </h3>
				<p>The prospecting services provided by Yesmail
				are targeting services that allow companies to find individuals who would be most interested in
				using their products and services. These services give companies the ability to send very targeted
				communication to a very targeted audience. At any time, if an individual wishes to be removed from
				these databases, he or she may choose to opt out and be eliminated from the database.</p>
				
				<h3>Choice/Opt-Out</h3>
				<p>Yesmail makes it easy for individuals to change their information requests or opt-out of future
				communications from Yesmail altogether. Whether they sign up for Yesmail-powered e-mail
				communications from a client or register a Yesmail product and request future product news, they'll
				be informed of easy opt-out instructions with each communication should they decide to remove their
				name from our databases.</p>
				
				<p>Our Yesmail privacy policies contain additional opt-out information specific to the service or product. </p>
				
				<h3>Children's Online Privacy Protection</h3>
				<p>The safety of children is important to us. Yesmail's Web site is a general audience site and is not
				directed to children under the age of 13. Similarly, Yesmail's services are not directed to nor
				intended for anyone under the age of 13. Yesmail will not knowingly accept, collect or maintain
				personally identifiable information from or about anyone under the age of 13 years. Yesmail relies
				on the truthfulness of individual registrant certifications when accepting data from Network
				Partners. In the event that Yesmail receives information that establishes that a registrant is under
				the age of 13 years, Yesmail reserves the right to eliminate that person's information from its
				database. If you believe Yesmail has any information from or about anyone under 13, please contact
				us at <a href="mailto:privacy@yesmail.com">privacy@yesmail.com</a>.</p>
