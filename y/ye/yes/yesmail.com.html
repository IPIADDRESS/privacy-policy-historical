            Your privacy on the Internet is important to Yesmail™. As part 
            of the operation of Yesmail, certain pieces of information are gathered 
            about Yesmail Members. Below are explanations regarding the types 
            of information collected, what is done with it, and how to correct 
            or change the information. 
            <p class="shd">What Information is Collected</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>As part of the Yesmail Member registration process, the prospective 
              member is asked to provide an email address and interest category 
              selections. The prospective member, at their option, may voluntarily 
              provide additional information, including personal, geographic and 
              demographic information. In addition to the information provided 
              by members, Yesmail may also collect information about Yesmail 
              Members from third party sources. Furthermore, Yesmail monitors 
              incoming and outgoing Web site traffic data to help diagnose problems 
              with its servers and to administer its Web site. Yesmail also 
              uses this data to assemble broad demographic information about its 
              members in general. The purpose of this data collection is to ensure 
              that Yesmail Members receive only the most relevant, targeted offers 
              and information from Yesmail. </p>
            <p>Yesmail uses "contact us" forms as a way for clients, 
              potential clients and members to communicate with Yesmail. Yesmail 
              collects the information supplied by the sender of the "contact 
              us" form in order to establish and maintain relationships with 
              clients, potential clients and members. Yesmail also uses email 
              links located on various pages of the Yesmail Web site to allow 
              you to contact Yesmail with questions or comments you may have. 
              Yesmail welcomes these email communications and makes efforts 
              to respond to these communications where appropriate. Email communications 
              and the ideas sent to Yesmail in these email communications 
              become the property of Yesmail. Yesmail uses the email communications 
              to evaluate and improve its services and Web site. Yesmail also 
              may save these email communications for future reference or use. 
            </p>
            <p>In an attempt to customize the Yesmail service and provide members 
              with the information they may be most interested in, Yesmail 
              also conducts internal research on our users’ demographics, 
              interests, and behavior based upon information members provide directly 
              to Yesmail and information that Yesmail may collect from 
              third party sources and/or through the use of “cookies” 
              (see below). Yesmail may combine or otherwise overlay some or 
              all of the foregoing information to build profiles about Yesmail 
              Members, which may be individual specific or in aggregate form. 
              By becoming a Yesmail Member, you consent to Yesmail employing 
              the foregoing techniques in its continuing efforts to better serve 
              its members by providing them with the information in which they 
              may be most interested. Yesmail does not use information about 
              its members for any purposes unrelated to the services offered by 
              Yesmail. </p>
            <p>As discussed above, Yesmail may, from time to time, obtain 
              information about its members from third party sources. In addition, 
              Yesmail may, from time to time, assist third parties in developing, 
              implementing and monitoring advertising campaigns using data owned 
              or supplied by the third party. Please be aware that this Privacy 
              Policy does not cover the conduct or practices of these third party 
              sources. However, Yesmail will treat information that it receives 
              from third party sources according to the terms of this Privacy 
              Policy. </p>
            <p class="shd">The Use of Cookies</p>
            <p>As an important and necessary part of providing customizable and 
              personalized services to its members, Yesmail uses cookies to 
              store and sometimes track information about members. A cookie is 
              a small amount of data that is sent to a member’s browser from 
              a Web server and stored on a member’s computer hard drive. 
              Areas of Yesmail’s Web site where members are prompted 
              to login or that are customizable require acceptance of cookies. 
              Cookies are also used to help Yesmail track the response to 
              messages sent to members on behalf of marketers so that Yesmail 
              can monitor and report campaign results to the marketer and track 
              response history. With respect to cookies, you have a choice. By 
              modifying your browser preferences, you have the choice to accept 
              all cookies, to be notified when a cookie is set, or to reject all 
              cookies. If you choose to reject all cookies, you will be unable 
              to use those Yesmail services that require the use of cookies in 
              order to participate. </p>
            <p class="shd">Children’s Online Privacy Protection</p>
            <p>The safety of children is important to us. Yesmail’s Web 
              site is a general audience site and is not directed to children 
              under the age of 13. Similarly, Yesmail’s services are 
              not directed to nor intended for anyone under the age of 13. Yesmail 
              will not knowingly accept members who are under the age of 13 years 
              nor will it knowingly collect or maintain personally identifiable 
              information from or about anyone under the age of 13 years. Accordingly, 
              when registering to become a Yesmail Member, the new member must 
              certify that they are not under the age of 13. Yesmail relies 
              on the truthfulness of this certification when accepting new members. 
              In the event that Yesmail receives information that establishes 
              that a member is under the age of 13 years, Yesmail reserves 
              the right, which it will exercise, to terminate that member's membership. 
              Yesmail will also delete all information in its databases about 
              that terminated member. </p>
            <p>If you believe Yesmail has any information from or about anyone 
              under 13, please contact us at the address listed below. </p>
            <p>Email: <a href="mailto:privacy@Yesmail.com">privacy@Yesmail.com</a></p>
            <p class="shd">Confidentiality</p>
            <p>Yesmail will not provide personally identifiable information 
              of a Yesmail Member to third parties except as noted under “Limits 
              of Confidentiality.” Personally identifiable information means 
              the member’s name, residence address, email address, social 
              security number or other information from which the member’s 
              identity may be reasonably ascertained. Yesmail uses proprietary 
              technologies to preserve the anonymity of members while matching 
              the member’s interests with targeted information sent via email. 
              Yesmail will under no circumstance knowingly reveal any member’s 
              identity to marketers. It is solely at a Yesmail Member’s discretion 
              if he or she chooses to provide personally identifiable information 
              to a marketer by making a purchase, requesting additional information, 
              or communicating directly with the company or organization after 
              visiting its Web site or otherwise. </p>
            <p class="shd">Limits of Confidentiality</p>
            <p>As part of its day-to-day business activities, Yesmail must 
              disclose certain aggregate level information about Yesmail Members 
              to certain third parties; principally, (1) Yesmail’s Network 
              Partners, and (2) Marketers who use Yesmail’s network. 
              Below is the information and circumstances under which Yesmail 
              may be required to disclose information to third parties. </p>
            <p>(1) Network Partners: When a Yesmail Member registers through the 
              Web site of a Network Partner, Yesmail is obligated to disclose 
              to that particular Network Partner the information submitted by 
              the Yesmail Member during the registration process. In addition 
              to the foregoing information, Yesmail may also disclose aggregate 
              level information to the Network Partner about Yesmail Members who 
              registered through that particular Network Partner’s site. 
              Such aggregate information may include, for example, the number 
              of individuals who registered through the Network Partner’s 
              site; the turnover rate of Yesmail Members who have registered through 
              the Network Partner’s site; with respect to any particular 
              campaign, the response rates of the Yesmail Members who registered 
              through the Network Partner’s site; and statistics on the interest 
              categories selected by the Yesmail Members who have registered through 
              the Network Partner’s site. Subject to the exceptions discussed 
              below, Yesmail will not knowingly disclose any personally identifiable 
              information about a Yesmail Member to a Network Partner unless such 
              personally identifiable information was provided during the registration 
              process through the Network Partner’s Web site. </p>
            <p>(2) Marketers: Yesmail will disclose aggregate level information 
              about Yesmail Members to marketers as reasonably necessary to explain 
              the services that Yesmail can offer, to report on the advertising 
              campaigns that Yesmail undertakes for any particular marketer, 
              and/or to implement and explain campaign strategies. Subject to 
              the exceptions discussed below, Yesmail will not knowingly disclose 
              any personally identifiable information about a Yesmail Member to 
              a marketer. </p>
            <p>Due to the existing legal, regulatory and security environment, 
              Yesmail may be required, under certain circumstances, to disclose 
              aggregate level and/or personally identifiable information about 
              its members. Yesmail will use its best efforts to limit such 
              disclosure to the following: where Yesmail believes in good 
              faith that it is required to do so in response to a subpoena or 
              other legal process; where reasonably required to do so in order 
              to maintain, update or otherwise implement Yesmail’s data 
              security measures, equipment, technical operations and the like; 
              or where reasonably necessary to identify, contact or bring legal 
              action against persons or entities to preserve and/or enforce Yesmail’s 
              rights. </p>
            <p class="shd">Use of Information</p>
            <p>Yesmail uses member information to deliver the Yesmail services. 
              Thus, member information is used by Yesmail in identifying information 
              that may be of interest to its members. A member's email address 
              will be used by Yesmail to contact that member about member-selected 
              interests. Yesmail also uses member information to monitor, 
              interpret, analyze and report campaign results. Yesmail does 
              not use member information for purposes unrelated to the services 
              offered by Yesmail. </p>
            <p class="shd">Protection of Member Information</p>
            <p>Yesmail undertakes substantial efforts to protect the confidentiality 
              of the identity, preferences and other information it has collected 
              about individual members and will never knowingly allow access to 
              this information to anyone outside Yesmail other than to the 
              member or as described above under the heading Limits of Confidentiality. 
              Yesmail has made a substantial investment in its server, database, 
              backup and firewall technologies to protect the information assets 
              of the Yesmail Network™, including the confidentiality of information 
              collected about Yesmail Members. These technologies are deployed 
              as part of a sophisticated security architecture and protocol. </p>
            <p>You should also do your part in protecting your information. Your 
              Yesmail user name and password are confidential and we recommend 
              that you not divulge them to anyone. Unfortunately, neither Yesmail 
              network nor data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed 
              to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect member 
              information, Yesmail cannot ensure or warrant the security of 
              member information. Thus, any information a member transmits to 
              us is done so at the member’s own risk. Once we receive member 
              information, Yesmail undertakes substantial efforts to protect 
              the confidentiality of this information consistent with this Policy. 
            </p>
            <p class="shd">Reviewing or Modifying Member Information or Terminating 
              Membership</p>
            <p>A Yesmail Member may choose at any time to review, modify or permanently 
              remove all information stored by Yesmail about that member by accessing 
              their account directly at <a href="http://my.yesmail.com">my.Yesmail.com</a>. 
              A Yesmail Member can also send an email to subs@my.Yesmail.com to 
              terminate the account. If a member terminates their membership, 
              the past member will no longer receive any communications from Yesmail. 
              Yesmail will not sell, rent, or otherwise use the information about 
              former members. </p>
            <p>Policy Changes</p>
            <p>The foregoing policy is effective as of June 2000. Yesmail reserves 
              the right to change this policy at any time. Please check this page 
              periodically for changes. Your continued use of Yesmail’s services 
              following the posting of changes to these terms will mean you accept 
              those changes. Yesmail will take reasonable measures to notify you 
              if there is a material change in our privacy practices with respect 
              to use of the information you have provided to Yesmail. Yesmail 
              will conspicuously post these changes in our Privacy Policy. Yesmail 
              also will post a message on the home page of its Web site that states 
              that the Privacy Policy has been changed, and will provide a link 
              to the Privacy Policy. These postings will occur on Yesmail’s 
              Web site at least 30 days prior to any material change. For more 
              information, see our <a href="terms.asp">Terms and Conditions</a> 
              of service. If you have any questions about this privacy statement, 
              Yesmail practices, or feel that your privacy has been compromised, 
              please contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@Yesmail.com">privacy@Yesmail.com</a>.
