                  Your privacy on the Internet is important to Yesmailâ„¢. 
                  When you register directly with Yesmail or one of our Network 
                  Partners to provide certain information about yourself in order 
                  to receive email from Yesmail, you become a Yesmail Member. 
                  Below is an explanation regarding the type of information collected 
                  from Yesmail Members, what is done with it, and how to correct 
                  or change that information. By registering online through Yesmail's 
                  Web site or the Web sites of any of our Network Partners, you 
                  are agreeing to the terms of Yesmail's Privacy Policy. You should 
                  also review our Network Partners' privacy policies for more 
                  informaiton on their data collection and handling practices. 
                  This Privacy Policy is incorporated into our Terms and Conditions 
                  of service. 
                  <p>Please be aware that this Privacy Policy only applies to 
                    personally identifiable information that you provide when 
                    you register at the Yesmail Web site or at the Web sites of 
                    any of our Network Partners ("Member-Provided Information"). 
                    "Personally identifiable information" means your 
                    name, residence address, email address, social security number 
                    or other information from which your identity may be ascertained. 
                  </p>
                  <p>If Yesmail acquires information about you from other sources 
                    ("Other Information"), even if you provided substantially 
                    similar or identical information at the time you registered, 
                    the Other Information is not governed by this Privacy Policy 
                    and this Privacy Policy does not restrict us with regard to 
                    use of such Other Information. Further, the Privacy Policy 
                    does not cover the conduct or practices of any other parties, 
                    including without limitation, any third-party source of information. 
                    Nor does this Privacy Policy restrict the disclosure, sharing 
                    or transfer of aggregate-level information. "Aggregate-level 
                    information" is any information that does not allow a 
                    Yesmail Member's identity to be ascertained in a commercially 
                    likely manner. It is solely at a Yesmail Member's discretion 
                    if he or she chooses to provide personally identifiable information 
                    to a marketer or other party by making a purchase, requesting 
                    additional information, or communicating directly with the 
                    company or organization after visiting its Web site or otherwise, 
                    and this Privacy Policy does not govern any such information 
                    provided.<br>

                    What Information You Provide<br>
                    </span>Member-Provided Information: As part of the Yesmail 
                    Member registration process, a prospective member is asked 
                    to provide an email address and interest category selections. 
                    The prospective member, at his or her option, may voluntarily 
                    provide additional information, including personal, geographic 
                    and demographic information. Yesmail uses this data to assemble 
                    broad demographic information about Yesmail Members in general. 
                    The primary purpose of this data collection is to ensure that 
                    Yesmail Members receive relevant, targeted offers and information 
                    from Yesmail. </p>
                  <p>Web Traffic Information: Yesmail also collects and monitors 
                    incoming and outgoing Web site traffic data to help diagnose 
                    problems with its servers and to administer its Web site. 
                  </p>
                  <p>"Contact Us" Information: Yesmail uses "contact 
                    us" forms as a way for Yesmail Customers, potential customers 
                    and Yesmail Members to communicate with Yesmail. Yesmail collects 
                    the information supplied by the sender of the "contact 
                    us" form in order to establish and maintain relationships 
                    with Customers, potential customers and Yesmail Members. Yesmail 
                    also uses email links located on various pages of the Yesmail 
                    Web site to allow you to contact Yesmail with questions or 
                    comments you may have. Yesmail welcomes these email communications 
                    and makes efforts to respond to these communications where 
                    appropriate. Email communications and the ideas sent to Yesmail 
                    in these email communications become the property of Yesmail. 
                    Yesmail uses the email communications to evaluate and improve 
                    its services and Web site. Yesmail also may save these email 
                    communications as an archive to address Member questions and 
                    concerns, for auditing purposes and to ensure privacy compliance 
                    with third-party Internet Service Providers. </p>
                  <p><span class="shd">The Use of Cookies and Clear GIFs</span><br>
                    As an important and necessary part of providing customizable 
                    and personalized services to our Yesmail Members, Yesmail 
                    uses cookies and Clear GIFs to store and sometimes track information 
                    about you. A cookie or Clear GIF is a small amount of data 
                    that is sent to a Member's browser from a Web server and stored 
                    on your computer hard drive. Areas of Yesmail's Web site where 
                    Yesmail Members are prompted to log in or that are customizable 
                    require acceptance of cookies and Clear GIFs. Cookies and 
                    Clear GIFs are also used to help Yesmail track the response 
                    to messages sent to Members on behalf of Customers so that 
                    Yesmail can monitor and report campaign results to the Customer 
                    and track response history. With respect to cookies and Clear 
                    GIFs, you have a choice. By modifying your browser preferences, 
                    you have the choice to accept all cookies and Clear GIFs, 
                    to be notified when a cookie or Clear GIF is set, or to reject 
                    all cookies and Clear GIFs. If you choose to reject all cookies 
                    and Clear GIFs, you will be unable to use those Yesmail services 
                    that require the use of cookies or Clear GIFs in order to 
                    participate. </p>
                  <p><span class="shd">Children's Online Privacy Protection</span><br>
                    The safety of children is important to us. Yesmail's Web site 
                    is a general audience site and is not directed to children 
                    under the age of 13. Similarly, Yesmail's services are not 
                    directed to nor intended for anyone under the age of 13. Yesmail 
                    will not knowingly accept members who are under the age of 
                    13 years, nor will it knowingly collect or maintain personally 
                    identifiable information from or about anyone under the age 
                    of 13 years. Accordingly, when registering to become a Yesmail 
                    Member, the new Member must certify that he or she is not 
                    under the age of 13. Yesmail relies on the truthfulness of 
                    this certification when accepting new Yesmail Members. In 
                    the event that Yesmail receives information that establishes 
                    that a Member is under the age of 13 years, Yesmail reserves 
                    the right, which it will exercise, to terminate that Member's 
                    membership. Yesmail will also delete all information in its 
                    databases about that terminated Member. If you believe Yesmail 
                    has any information from or about anyone under 13, please 
                    contact us at the address listed below. </p>

                    Yesmail uses Member-Provided Information to deliver Yesmail's 
                    services. Thus, Member-Provided Information is used by Yesmail 
                    in identifying information that may be of interest to Yesmail 
                    Members. A Yesmail Member's email address will be used by 
                    Yesmail to contact that Member about matters in which Yesmail 
                    believes the Member may be interested. Yesmail also uses Member-Provided 
                    Information to monitor, interpret, analyze and report campaign 
                    results. </p>
                  <p>In an attempt to customize Yesmail's services and provide 
                    Members with the information they may be most interested in, 
                    Yesmail also conducts research on Yesmail Members' demographics, 
                    interests, and behavior based upon Member-Provided Information 
                    and Other Information that Yesmail may collect from third-party 
                    sources and/or through the use of "cookies" and/or 
                    "Clear GIFs" (see above). Yesmail may combine or 
                    otherwise overlay some or all of the foregoing information 
                    to build profiles about Yesmail Members, which may be individual-specific 
                    or in aggregate form. </p>
                  <p>By becoming a Yesmail Member, you consent to Yesmail employing 
                    the foregoing techniques in its continuing efforts to better 
                    serve its Members by providing them with the information in 
                    which they may be most interested.</p>
                  <p>Yesmail undertakes substantial efforts to protect the confidentiality 
                    of Member-Provided Information and will never knowingly allow 
                    access to this information to anyone outside Yesmail other 
                    than to the Yesmail Member or as described in this Privacy 
                    Policy. Yesmail uses technology to preserve the anonymity 
                    of Yesmail Members while matching the Members' interests with 
                    targeted information sent via email. Yesmail has made a substantial 
                    investment in its server, database, backup and firewall technologies 
                    to protect the information assets of the Yesmail Networkâ„¢, 
                    including the confidentiality of Member-Provided Information 
                    . These technologies are deployed as part of a sophisticated 
                    security architecture and protocol. </p>
                  <p>You should also do your part in protecting your information. 
                    Your Yesmail user name and password are confidential and we 
                    recommend that you not divulge them to anyone. Unfortunately, 
                    neither the Yesmail Network nor data transmission over the 
                    Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, 
                    while we strive to protect Yesmail Member-Provided Information, 
                    Yesmail cannot ensure or warrant the security of Member-Provided 
                    Information. Thus, any information a Member transmits to us 
                    is done so at the Member's own risk. Once we receive the Member-Provided 
                    Information, Yesmail undertakes substantial efforts to protect 
                    the confidentiality of this information consistent with this 
                    Policy. </p>
                  <p><span class="shd">Confidentiality and Disclosures</span><br>
                    In certain situations, as described in this Privacy Policy, 
                    and as part of our day-to-day business activities, Yesmail 
                    will disclose certain Member-Provided Information about Yesmail 
                    Members to certain third parties. Below is the information 
                    and circumstances under which Yesmail will disclose information 
                    to third parties. </p>
                  <p>Disclosure to Network Partners: When a Yesmail Member registers 
                    through a Network Partner's Web site, Yesmail will disclose 
                    to that particular Network Partner the information submitted 
                    by the Yesmail Member during the registration process. </p>
                  <p>Disclosure to Service Providers: Yesmail partners with other 
                    third-party Service Providers to provide specific services. 
                    Yesmail will transfer Member-Provided Information to these 
                    third parties in order to provide requested services. For 
                    example, Yesmail partners with Service Providers to send emails 
                    to Yesmail Members on Yesmail's behalf. These Service Providers 
                    are not allowed to use personally identifiable information 
                    except for the purpose of providing these services.</p>
                  <p>Disclosure to Customers: Yesmail will disclose, share or 
                    license Member-Provided Information and any Other Information 
                    to Yesmail Customers. Customers are defined as Yesmail marketing 
                    partners or other third parties interested in providing services 
                    that meet your interests. Yesmail Members may opt out of this 
                    sharing at any time by sending an email message to <a href="mailto:subs@ym1.net">subs@ym1.net</a>, 
                    or by updating your Member profile at <a href="http://my.yesmail.com" target="_blank">http://my.yesmail.com</a>.<br>
                    <br>
                    Other Disclosure: Due to the existing legal, regulatory and 
                    security environment, Yesmail may be required, under certain 
                    circumstances, to disclose Member-Provided Information, as 
                    well as any Other Information. Yesmail will use its best efforts 
                    to limit such disclosure to the following: where Yesmail believes 
                    in good faith that it is required to do so in response to 
                    a subpoena or other legal process; where reasonably required 
                    to do so in order to maintain, update or otherwise implement 
                    Yesmail's data security measures, equipment, technical operations 
                    and the like; or where reasonably necessary to identify, contact 
                    or bring legal action against persons or entities to preserve 
                    and/or enforce Yesmail's rights. </p>
                  <p>Yesmail Sale or Merger: If all or part of Yesmail should 
                    change controlling ownership, or Yesmail merge with another 
                    party, Member-Provided Information may be transferred as part 
                    of that event; such transfers, to the extent allowed by law, 
                    will always be conditioned on the preservation of the promises 
                    made in this Privacy Policy.</p>

                    or Terminating Membership</span><br>
                    A Yesmail Member may choose at any time to review, modify 
                    or deactiviate all personally identifiable information stored 
                    by Yesmail about that Member by accessing his/her account 
                    directly at <a href="http://my.yesmail.com" target="_blank">http://my.yesmail.com</a>. 
                  </p>
                  <p>A Yesmail Member can terminate his or her membership for 
                    any reason, such as to prevent the sharing of information 
                    with third parties, by sending an email to <a href="mailto:subs@ym1.net">subs@ym1.net</a>. 
                    If a Yesmail Member terminates his or her membership, Yesmail 
                    will use its best efforts to ensure that, within a reasonable 
                    time, the past Member will not receive any future communications 
                    from Yesmail, and, thereafter, that Yesmail will not disclose, 
                    share or otherwise transfer or use the past Member's Member-Provided 
                    Information. </p>
                  <p>A Yesmail Member wanting to discontinue receiving communications 
                    from a Customer that was provided with Member-Provided Information 
                    prior to the Yesmail Member terminating his or her membership 
                    should first contact the Customer directly to opt out of further 
                    communications. If this is not succesful, the Yesmail Member 
                    should contact Yesmail by sending an email to <a href="mailto:subs@ym1.net">subs@ym1.net</a>.</p>
                  <p><span class="shd">Policy Changes</span><br>
                    The foregoing policy shall be effective January 1, 2003 (the 
                    "Effective Date"), and applies to all information 
                    Yesmail has collected about you since you registered with 
                    us or with one of our Network Partners. Yesmail reserves the 
                    right to change this policy at any time. Please check this

                    measures to notify you if there is a material change in our 
                    privacy practices with respect to use of the information you 
                    have provided to Yesmail by conspicuously posting these changes 
                    in our Privacy Policy and by posting a message on the home 
                    page of our Web site that states that the Privacy Policy has 
                    been changed and links to the revised Privacy Policy, and 
                    by sending an email message to the affected Members with links 
                    to the revised Privacy Policy. Yesmail will use reasonable 
                    efforts to ensure that these postings will occur on Yesmail's
