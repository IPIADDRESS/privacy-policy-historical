					<b>Permission Marketing is Our Philosophy</b>
					Yesmail facilitates the most consumer-oriented marketing practices in the email marketing industry. By supporting permission email, we allow individuals to identify personal preferences and needs, and then only communicate with them regarding those specific areas for which they have identified an interest. Using our unique opt-in survey methodology, we truly can understand the individuals' personal needs and tailor communication accordingly.
					<br><br>

					<b>Prospecting Services Deliver Only Targeted Information</b>
					The prospecting services provided by Yesmail are targeting services that allow companies to find individuals who would be most interested in using their products and services. These services give companies the ability to send very targeted communication to a very targeted audience. At any time, if an individual wishes to be removed from these databases, he or she may choose to opt out and be eliminated from the database.
					<br><br>

					<b>Choice/Opt-Out</b>
					Yesmail makes it easy for individuals to change their information requests or opt-out of future communications from Yesmail altogether. Whether they sign up for Yesmail-powered email communications from a client or register a Yesmail product and request future product news, they'll be informed of easy opt-out instructions with each communication should they decide to remove their name from our databases.
					<br><br>
					Our Yesmail privacy policies contain additional opt-out information specific to the service or product.
					<br><br>

					The safety of children is important to us. Yesmail's Web site is a general audience site and is not directed to children under the age of 13.
