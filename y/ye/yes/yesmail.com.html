                        <br><br><b>Permission Marketing is Our Philosophy</b><br> 
                        Yesmail facilitates the most consumer-oriented marketing 
                        practices in the email marketing industry. By supporting 
                        permission email, we allow individuals to identify 
                        personal preferences and needs, and then only 
                        communicate with them regarding those specific areas for 
                        which they have identified an interest. Using our unique 
                        opt-in survey methodology, we truly can understand the 
                        individuals' personal needs and tailor communication 
                        accordingly. <br><br><b>Prospecting Services Deliver 
                        Only Targeted Information</b> The prospecting services 
                        provided by Yesmail are targeting services that allow 
                        companies to find individuals who would be most 
                        interested in using their products and services. These 
                        services give companies the ability to send very 
                        targeted communication to a very targeted audience. At 
                        any time, if an individual wishes to be removed from 
                        these databases, he or she may choose to opt out and be 
                        eliminated from the database. 
                        <br><br><b>Choice/Opt-Out</b><br> Yesmail makes it easy for 
                        individuals to change their information requests or 
                        opt-out of future communications from Yesmail 
                        altogether. Whether they sign up for Yesmail-powered 
                        email communications from a client or register a Yesmail 
                        product and request future product news, they'll be 
                        informed of easy opt-out instructions with each 
                        communication should they decide to remove their name 
                        from our databases. <br><br>Our Yesmail privacy policies 
                        contain additional opt-out information specific to the 
                        service or product. <br><br><b>Children's Online Privacy 
                        Protection</b><br> The safety of children is important to 
                        us. Yesmail's Web site is a general audience site and is 
                        not directed to children under the age of 13. Similarly, 
                        Yesmail's services are not directed to nor intended for 
                        anyone under the age of 13. Yesmail will not knowingly 
                        accept, collect or maintain personally identifiable 
                        information from or about anyone under the age of 13 
                        years. Yesmail relies on the truthfulness of individual 
                        registrant certifications when accepting data from 
                        Network Partners. In the event that Yesmail receives 
                        information that establishes that a registrant is under 
                        the age of 13 years, Yesmail reserves the right to 
                        eliminate that person's information from its database. 
                        If you believe Yesmail has any information from or about
