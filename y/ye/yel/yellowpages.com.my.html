<p>If you do not have an e-mail address or you do not wish to disclose it, we   offer an alternative password retrieval process during registration.</p>
<p>We might also use the information you have given us to bring you important news   such as functionality changes to the YellowPages.com.my site or new services and special   offers you might find valuable. This is only sent to users who have chosen to   opt in when registering, and each time we e-mail you, you can choose not to be   sent any further messages from us.

                  <p>A cookie is a text-only string of information that a website transfers to the   cookie file of the browser on your computer's hard disk so that the website can   remember who you are.</p>
                  <p>A cookie will typically contain the name of the domain from which the cookie   has come, the "lifetime" of the cookie, and a value, usually a randomly   generated unique number. Two types of cookies are used on this website-session   cookies, which are temporary cookies that remain in the cookie file of your   browser until you leave the site, and persistent cookies, which remain in the   cookie file of your browser for much longer (though how long will depend on the   lifetime of the specific cookie).</p>
                  <p>Cookies can help a website to arrange content to match your preferred   interests more quickly. Most major websites use cookies. Cookies cannot be used   by themselves to identify you.</p>
                  <p><strong>How do you use cookies and what information do you collect about   me?</strong></p>

We use temporary/session cookies in the following   ways:
<ul>
  <li>within YellowPages.com.my Search to store your locations during a search session; </li>
  <li>within registration to enable access to your address book. </li>
</ul>

Persistent cookies are used on YellowPages.com.my in the   following ways:
<ul>
  <li>to track aggregated usage and the number of unique, anonymous users; </li>
  <li>to manage advertisement serving and to ensure the same advert is not shown   too frequently; </li>
  <li>within research surveys, to ensure you are not invited to complete a   questionnaire too often or after you have already done so. </li>
</ul>
<p>We do not link cookies to information you have provided during   registration.</p>
<p>If you do not want a cookie to be created on your computer, web browsers like   Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer provide the option to disable   them. However, you might not be able to take advantage of the full functionality   of our website if you do.</p>
<p>Sites linked to YellowPages.com may also use cookies. Please check the individual   privacy policies of such sites to find out more.</p>
<strong>What is a web beacon?</strong>
<p>A web beacon—sometimes referred to as a clear GIF (Graphics Interchange   Format) or pixel tag—is a line of code that we have installed on some of our   pages to help us learn more about how our visitors interact with the content and   services that we offer, and to count the traffic to different areas of the   website. A web beacon is a 1x1 pixel tag that is invisible to you and does not  affect the content you see.</p>
<p>This helps us provide a better service to you by allowing us to understand   which areas of the site are more popular with visitors than others. Web beacons   are not used to collect any personal information about you. But allow us to   gather aggregated information about the use of our site. YellowPages.com.my pages may also   contain web beacons inserted by our advertising agency so that we can measure   the effectiveness of our advertising on other websites. Web beacon files enable   our agency to recognise a unique cookie on your web browser, which in turn   enables us to learn which advertisements bring users to our website. The web   beacon only records a limited amount of information that includes the cookie   number, the page id and the time and date the page was accessed, it does not   contain your name, address, telephone number or e-mail address.</p>
<p><strong>How to manage the use of cookies on our website?</strong></p>
<p>You can manage the cookies in the cookie folder of your browser. You can   either delete cookies from your cookie folder once you have left our site, or   you can set your preferences before you enter our website.</p>
<p>Deleting or rejecting cookies may impair your experience of our website. You   may not be able to access some pages or complete some transactions securely.</p></td>

                  </strong>
                  <p>Yes. We take the security of your personal data extremely seriously. We have   implemented technology and security policies designed to protect the personal   data under our control. We also follow strict security procedures as required by   the applicable acts in Malaysia. These cover the storage and disclosure of any   information you have provided, and the prevention of unauthorised access.</p>
                  <p>Any credit card details you pass on to us are encrypted using a Secure Socket   Layer (SSL). SSL is an industry standard for data encryption and is one of the   best ways to ensure internet messages are not intercepted. Older browsers can not  use SSL, so you will need Netscape Navigator 3, Microsoft Internet Explorer 3 or   later versions of these browsers.</p>
                  <strong>Can anybody else who's using YellowPages.com.my access my personal details?                  </strong>
                  <p>No. All personal information given to YellowPages.com.my is secured and stored away   from public access. Credit card information is encrypted before any transaction   takes place.</p>
                  <strong>Is my information available to any companies who partner with YellowPages.com.my to   provide products or services?                  </strong>
                  <p>Yes, YellowPages.com may use partners to ensure the effective operation of our site.   These companies have access to your personal information under our strict   supervision and within the requirements of the applicable acts.</p></td>
