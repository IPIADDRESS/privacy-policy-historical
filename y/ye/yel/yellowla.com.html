                            We believe that by addressing these issues, we will fulfill the goals of fair information use supported by the

                          <p class="style33">We do not disclose customer contact information (such as telephone numbers or various personal identification 
                            numbers), to any third party except as required by law, or as needed to fulfill an order or deliver a product 
                            that a customer has ordered.</p>
                          <p class="style33">We do not disclose customer credit or debit card numbers or checking account information to any third party 
                            except as required by law, or as needed to fulfill an order or deliver a product that a customer has ordered.</p>
                          <p class="style33">In support of maintaining a safe and secure environment for credit card purchases, it is essential to our<br>
                            customers that we use credit card and other billing account numbers only for the fulfillment of purchases or<br>
                            other transactions initiated by our Customers. We do not use credit card or other billing account numbers in 
                            other ways.</p>

                            information. For security reasons, we will not disclose the original information directly to the customer, but<br>
                            rather provide a means to reenter changes to the information on record.</p>
                          <p class="style33"><strong>Online Purchases</strong></p>
                          <p class="style33">The objective of the online purchases principle is to protect the information about customer transactions and 
                            other online uses from misuse and unauthorized disclosure.</p>
                          <p class="style33">We may use information about the kinds of products you buy from us to make other marketing offers to you, unless 
                            you tell us not to, or to personalize your visits to our Web site. We do not give out this purchase data to 
                            others except as specified below:</p>
                          <p class="style33">We do not give out information about what individual customers purchase, except to complete the transactions or 
                            to comply with valid legal process. However, pursuant to specific contracts, we may be required provide 
                            third-parties with listings of specific groups of customers who have made purchases. Generally, this data will 
                            be aggregated and not individually identifiable, but this may not be true in all cases.</p>
                          <p class="style33">When we facilitate a transaction which is to be fulfilled by an outside party, we will not use the specific,<br>
                            individually identifiable transaction information collected from a customer for purposes other than fulfilling<br>
                            the transaction.                          </p>

                            The objective of the choice principle is to allow customers to opt-out of future marketing offers.                          </p>
                          <p class="style33">We give you choices about how the information that you provide may be used to make marketing offers to you. We 
                            provide you with a means to easily remove your contact information (like your email address) from marketing lists 
                            at any point in the future. </p>
                          <p class="style33">We do not sell or rent customer contact information to unaffiliated third parties for marketing purposes.                          </p>

                            restrictions on employee access in order to safeguard your personal information.</p>
                          <p class="style33">We use state of the art technology (i.e., Secure Socket Layer, or SSL) encryption to keep customer personal <br>
                            information as secure as possible. We have also put in place privacy protection control systems designed to 
                            ensure that personal Customer data remains safe and private.</p>
                          <p class="style33">We allow only authorized employees access to personal information and ensure that the access is limited by need.</p>
                          <p class="style33">We require companies contracted as agents to adhere to confidentiality agreements to ensure that Customer  
                            information remains safe and secure.</p>
                          <p class="style33">We require employees to acknowledge that they understand and will comply with our privacy policy. We subject 
                            employees who violate the privacy policy to disciplinary action.</p>
                          <p class="style33">Safe Shopping Guarantee: We guarantee that every online transaction you make will be 100% safe. Under the Fair 
                            Credit Billing Act, your bank cannot hold you liable for more than $50.00 of fraudulent charges. In the event of
                            unauthorized use of your credit card, you must notify your credit card provider in accordance with its reporting
