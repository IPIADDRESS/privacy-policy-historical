<p>This Site is one of several sites (“Sites”) relating to and/or operated by Xanterra Leisure Holding, LLC, its subsidiaries, affiliates and related companies (“Xanterra” or “we”). The purpose of this Privacy Policy is to disclose to you what information we may collect, how we may collect it, with whom we may share it, and certain other matters related to such information, including the choices you have regarding our collection of information and our use and disclosure to other parties of information we may have collected from you. Terms not otherwise defined herein shall have the meaning ascribed to such terms in our <a href="/terms">Terms of Use</a>.</p>
<p>Except as otherwise discussed in this Privacy Policy, this document only addresses the use and disclosure of information we collect from you online. For some services, we collect and transfer personal information to a service provider, or you may visit other merchants or service providers through links on our Sites who may collect and use your personal information. We encourage you to review the privacy policies of these sites before you disclose your personal information to others.</p>
<p>Please read the following to learn more about our data collection policies and practices:</p>

<div class="toggle-title toggle-close">Types of information that may be collected.</div>
<div class="toggle-slide">
<p>We may collect personally-identifiable information and non-personally identifiable information when you use our Sites.  Personally-identifiable information is information that can be used to identify you personally (either alone or in combination with other information), and non-personally identifiable information cannot be used to identify a specific individual.  The personally-identifiable information we collect is used to facilitate the purchase and delivery of information, products or services to our customers and visitors.  Specific personally-identifiable information collected may include, but is not limited to the following and may be subject to change:</p>
<ul>
<li>In the case of a reservation or other purchase which is completed on one of our Sites, an online credit card transaction is required in order to complete the purchase. During this process we may generate and collect certain personally-identifiable information, such as name, name of the credit card holder, credit card billing address, credit card number, credit card security code, credit card expiration date, customer’s shipping address, phone number, and email address, however we do not retain credit card information beyond the duration of your stay with us.   For certain tours, activities, or other purposes, we may request health related information (such as medical conditions that may require the special attention of our employees during trips).  You are not required to provide health information, but it may impact your ability to participate in a requested activity.  You may also have the opportunity to provide dietary information or other preferences in connection with certain tours or activities, if you choose to do so.</li>
<li>If you wish to receive any of our newsletters, view our webcasts or other interactive features, or participate in any of our contests, drawings, sweepstakes, or promotions, we may require you to complete an entry or similar form which will require the submission of certain personally-identifiable information, such as name, mailing address, phone number, email address, and potentially other information.
</li><li>
</li><li>We may provide you with the option of creating your own personal profile, or a profile may automatically be created in our database if you provide certain information to us (including if you make a reservation or book a tour through Xanterra, whether through our Sites or otherwise).  If a profile is created, we may combine information we receive from you or about you from various sources (including your bookings at our properties, your transactions on our various websites, or information you provide offline) in your profile.</li>
</ul>

<div class="toggle-title toggle-close">How is information collected?</div>
<div class="toggle-slide">
<p>We may collect information from you in several different areas on the Sites, including but not limited to those described below:</p>
<h3>Registration or Inquiries.</h3>
<p>If you register for a service or inquire about our properties, tours, or other travel opportunities, you may be asked to complete a registration form and provide personally-identifiable information. You may also be asked to choose a user ID and password in order to take advantage of certain features the Sites may offer, including, but not limited to, newsletters, contests, forums, webcasts or subscription-based services.  Similarly, if you agree to provide us with optional profile information, this information will be collected through a registration form.</p>
<h3>Newsletters, Site Emails and Mobile Offers.</h3>
<p>We may offer newsletters and/or other communications to share information with you about the Site, about us and our affiliates and subsidiaries, about our business partners, or about third party offers or information we think would be of interest to you.  You may receive communications either by registering for a particular newsletter or type of information, or in conjunction with a special tour, property, feature or membership for which you have registered on a Site.  Remember, if you consent to receive text messages from us, your wireless carrier may impose a charge on incoming texts.  Please check with your wireless carrier for details.</p>
<h3>Paid Transactions.</h3>
<p>Certain transactions within our Sites, such as booking a reservation or purchasing items in one of our online stores, may require that you enter your name, email, address, payment information, and other details.  We will use this information to complete the transaction that you have requested, e.g. to process your reservation and to invoice you.  Although some of these services are handled directly by Xanterra or its subsidiaries, others are managed on behalf of Xanterra or its subsidiaries by third party service providers, and the information you provide during these paid transactions may be submitted directly to the applicable provider, which in turn may share limited information (such as your name and email address, but not payment account details) with Xanterra or its subsidiaries.</p>
<h3>Contests or Sweepstakes.</h3>
<p>We may operate contests, sweepstakes or other promotions through the Sites, which may require registration in order to enter. Your personally-identifiable information may be used by us to contact you for winner notification, prize delivery confirmation or other promotional purposes. Your entry may also result in your being added to our mailing/texting lists as well as those of our promotional partners associated with the promotion. Acceptance of a prize may require you (unless prohibited by law) to allow us to post publicly some of your information on the Sites, such as on a winner’s page, in the event you win a contest or sweepstakes. In some instances, a third-party advertiser or sponsor may operate or host a contest or sweepstakes on the Sites, and collect your information. In those cases, where we are not the sponsor, operator or host of the contest or sweepstakes, we may have no control over the information collected and accordingly urge you to review the official rules of the contest/sweepstakes as well as the advertiser’s or sponsor’s privacy policy applicable to the contest or sweepstakes before participating.</p>
<h3>Surveys or Voting.</h3>
<p>From time-to-time we may request personally-identifiable information from you via surveys or voting polls. Participation is voluntary and you will have the opportunity to decide whether or not to disclose information. At times, you may have to register to vote or to take part in a survey.</p>
<h3>Cookies.</h3>
<p>The Sites use standard technology called “cookies,” (which are small data files that are transferred to your computer when you allow your browser to accept cookies) or similar technologies.  Please view our <a href="/eucookie">Cookie Policy</a> (which is incorporated herein) for detailed information regarding the use of cookies and similar technologies on our Sites. If you do not want information collected through the use of cookies, you generally can opt out of providing this information by turning the cookies off in your browser; however, some areas of the Sites may not provide you with a personalized experience if you have disabled the use of cookies. </p>
<h3>Analytics Tools.</h3>
<p>Our Sites may use Google Analytics or similar tools or services to collect information about the performance and use of our Sites. Our analytics services may collect information such as how often users visit our Sites, what pages they visit when they do so, and what other sites they used prior to coming to our Sites. We use the information we get from Google Analytics and other providers to improve our Sites. Although Google Analytics places persistent cookies on your computer to identify how users arrived at a Site and the number of times they return, the cookies cannot be used by anyone but Google. Google’s ability to use and share information collected by Google Analytics about your visits to the Sites is restricted by the <a href="http://www.google.com/analytics/tos.html" target="_blank" onclick="recordOutboundLink(this,'Outbound Link','/outGoingLink=http://www.google.com/analytics/tos.html')">Google Analytics Terms of Use</a> and the <a href="http://www.google.com/privacypolicy.html" target="_blank" onclick="recordOutboundLink(this,'Outbound Link','/outGoingLink=http://www.google.com/privacypolicy.html')">Google Privacy Policy</a>. You can prevent Google Analytics from recognizing you on return visits to this Site by disabling cookies on your browser.</p>
<h3>IP Addresses and click-stream data.</h3>
<p>We may identify users by their IP address (e.g. to determine if a visitor is located in a country other than the U.S.).  An IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you access the Internet.  When you request Web pages from the Sites, our computers log your IP address.  Some countries may consider IP addresses to be personal information, so you may exercise choices with regard to your IP address as with other personal information, as described further below.</p>
<p>We may identify click-stream data for purposes of system administration, to improve the Sites and to report aggregate information to our advertisers and sponsors and/or other internal uses related to the Sites.  Click-stream data is information collected by our computers when you request Web pages from the Sites. Click-stream data may include such information as the page served, the time, the source of the request, the type of browser making the request, the preceding page view and other such non-personal information.  This data helps us analyze how visitors arrive at the Sites, what type of content is most popular, what type of visitors in the aggregate are interested in particular kinds of content and advertising, and the like.</p>
<h3>How do we use the information we collect?</h3>
<p>We internally use personally-identifiable information about our customers and Site visitors to improve our marketing and promotional efforts, to statistically analyze Site usage, to improve our content and product offerings and to customize the content and layout of our Sites. We believe these uses allow us to improve the Sites and provide better service to our customers. We may use a customer’s email address and mailing address or phone number, to contact a customer regarding, administrative matters or notices, issues with a transaction, satisfaction with the Sites and/or our products and services and to provide further information regarding additional events, products and/or services in which we believe the customer would be interested subject to privacy laws and opt-in requirements of various countries.   We may also use information in the file we maintain about a customer to resolve disputes and troubleshoot problems.</p>
<p>We collect, process and use personal information for the purpose for which it was first collected and, if applicable, as authorized by you or as needed to fulfill your reservation or other purchase. This may include the uses described above or other uses which you may later authorize. We take reasonable steps to ensure that personal information collected is relevant to its intended use, and is accurate, current and complete.   We will not use your personal information for any purpose incompatible with this Privacy Policy unless we provide you notice and an opportunity to opt-out (or opt-in to the extent required by applicable law).</p>
<p>We only use, process and transfer health or medical information you voluntarily provide us as needed to ensure your health and physical well-being, and to protect your vital interests, when you participate on one of our tours or trips.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="togglewrap">
<div class="toggle-title toggle-close">To whom may the information be disclosed?</div>
<div class="toggle-slide">
<p>Information we collect may be disclosed to a variety of parties, depending upon the purpose for which the information was provided and the context in which it was provided. When we transfer information to third parties, we use reasonable efforts to assure that they comply with our Privacy Policy and applicable legal requirements.</p>
<p>If you register with any of our Sites, your information (including information related to reservations or purchases you make on any of our Sites) will be aggregated and maintained as part of your profile.  We may access or use such information, and we may share such information with our current or future affiliated and related companies, or carefully selected third parties, to provide you with information or marketing communications in which we think you may be interested (subject to privacy laws and opt-in requirements of various countries, to the extent applicable to your information). You may opt-out of having your information shared with any third parties or used for marketing communications by following the instructions below under “What choices do I have about collecting, using, and disclosing my information?”</p>
<p>In order to process your requests, we may provide your personally-identifiable information to service providers or other companies who work on our behalf in order, for example, to deliver the goods or services you have ordered, or to provide lodging, activities, or other services during certain tours you may book through the Sites.  If you have been booked on a reservation through a third party travel agent or as part of a group, the travel agent or tour operator may provide your information to us as needed.  You understand that in some cases it may be necessary for us to disclose and process your information outside of the United States if you purchase an international trip.  In order for you to travel abroad, it may be mandatory (as required by government authorities at the points of departure and/or destination) to disclose and process your personal information for immigration, border control, security and anti-terrorism purposes, or any other purposes which they determine appropriate.  These requirements may differ depending on your destination, and we may exercise our discretion to assist where appropriate. </p>
<p>In addition, in the event that we go through an existing or potential business transition, such as a merger, acquisition, liquidation or sale of all or a portion of our assets, certain customer information, including without limitation details on future reservations, will, in most instances, be part of the assets transferred.</p>
<p>We may, without your consent, access and disclose your personal information, any communications sent or received by you, and any other information that we may have about you to the extent we believe such disclosure is required by law, regulation, rule or court order; pursuant to requests from governmental, regulatory or administrative agencies or law enforcement authorities; or to prevent, investigate, identify persons or organizations potentially involved in, or take any action regarding suspected fraud, violations of our Terms of Use, or activity that appears to us to be illegal or we believe may expose us to legal liability. Additionally, we may disclose personal information in situations that we believe to be emergencies involving potential threats to the physical safety or any person or property if we believe that your information in any way relates to that threat. </p>
