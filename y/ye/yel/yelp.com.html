					<h2>Yelp Privacy policy</h2>
					<p>
						Yelp is an online application that helps people find local services they can 
						trust by asking their friends. To accomplish this, our users send requests
						via email to their friends, which in turn respond via the web site with 
						reviews. For the purposes of this document, a friend is defined as 
						someone you have sent a request to or explicitly invited to share reviews 
						with you. To fulfill the purpose of our site, we need to display a limited 
						amount of personal information, so that users are able to evaluate the 
						trustworthiness of a particular review.
					</p>
					<p>
						By using Yelp you permit the collection and use of your personal information 
						as outlined below in our Privacy Policy. You should visit this page periodically 
						to review any changes to the Privacy Policy.
					</p>
					<h3>Information We Collect</h3>
					<p>
						Yelp collects user submitted account information such as name and email address 
						to identify you and send you notifications related to the use of the service. 
						Yelp also collects user submitted location information such as city, state or zip. 
						Yelp also collects user submitted reviews, ratings, and reviews of local
						businesses and service providers.
					</p>
					<p>
						Some information collected is not explicitly submitted by the user; we log your 
						browser-type related information, IP address, requested URL, referring URL, and 
						timestamp. This information helps us diagnose problems with our server, administer 
						Yelp, and otherwise provide the highest possible level of service to you.
					</p>
					<h3>How We Use Your Information</h3>
					<p>
						Information such as your full name or email address may be shown to friends or 
						other users primarily in conjunction with reviews you have contributed. 
						If a person is a friend they can also see your name or email address in their list 
						of friends. 
					</p>
					<p>
						Your full name and email address may also used when you send an email notification 
						to a friend (such as in a request for a review, in an invitation, when sharing 
						a review, or when forwarding a request). We may also use your email address 
						to send you updates or news regarding our site, but you may choose not to receive email 
						of this type by accessing the "Account Settings" tab of the web site and updating your 
						notification settings. Additionally, we use your email address to contact you on 
						behalf of your friends (such as when a friend asks for a review).
					</p>
					<p>
						Browser-type related information, IP address, requested URL, referring URL, and timestamp 
						data are used in the general administration of our service.
					</p>
					<h3>Transfer of Information</h3>
					<p>
						We do not sell, rent, share, trade or give away any of your personal information unless 
						required by law.
					</p>
					<p>
						We reserve the right to transfer your personal information in the event of a transfer 
						of ownership of Yelp, such as acquisition by or merger with another company. In such 
						an event, Yelp will notify you before information about you is transferred and becomes 
						subject to a different privacy policy.
					</p>
					<h3>Links</h3>
					<p>
						Yelp may contain links to other websites. Please be aware that Yelp is not responsible 
						for the privacy policies of other sites.
					</p>
					<h3>Use of Cookies</h3>
					<p>
						Like most websites, Yelp requires cookies to function properly. Cookies are small text 
						files that reside on a user's computer and identify you as a unique user. We use cookies 
						to refine our site and simplify the user experience. For example, the use of cookies 
						allows registered users to enter our site without explicitly typing in their email 
						address and password every time.
					</p>
					<h3>Controlling Your Personal Information</h3>
					<p>
						As a registered Yelp user, you can modify your personal information at any time by 
						accessing the "Account Settings" section of the site. Registered users who wish to close 
						their account should contact <a href="mailto:admin@yelp.com">admin@yelp.com</a>.
					</p>
					<h3>Security</h3>
					<p>
						Your Yelp account is password-protected. This web site takes every precaution to
						protect our users' information. We use industry standard measures to protect your 
						information that is stored within our database. We limit the access to your information 
						to those employees who need access to perform their job function such as our customer 
						service personnel. If you have any questions about the security at our website, please 
						<a href="mailto:admin@yelp.com">contact us</a>.
					</p>
					<h3>Emails and Opt-out</h3>
					<p>
						At this time, registered members cannot opt-out of email messages initiated by their 
						friends (such as, requests for a review), however they may opt-out of receiving 
						notifications initiated by Yelp (note: notification settings can be found under the "My 
						Account" tab). Unregistered users that do not wish to receive emails may opt-out of 
						receiving any communications by following the instructions contained in all emails.
					</p>
					<h3>Contacting the Web Site </h3>
					<p>
						If you have any questions about this privacy statement, the practices of this site, or 
						your dealings with this web site, please <a href="mailto:admin@yelp.com">contact us</a>.
