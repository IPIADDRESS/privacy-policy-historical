					<h2 class="western c2">Yelp Privacy Policy</h2>

					<p class="c7"><strong>Last modified: August 5th, 2008.</strong></p>

<p class="c7">We recognize that your privacy is important. This
privacy policy applies to your use of Yelp's
websites and mobile applications (collectively, the
"<b>Site</b>"), but
not does apply to any third party sites that may be linked to this
one, or any relationships you may have with the business listed on
the Site.</p>
<p class="c7">The terms "<b>we</b>",
"<b>us</b>", and
"<b>Yelp</b>" refer
to Yelp! Inc. The terms "<b>you</b>" and
"<b>your</b>" refer
to you, as a user of the Site. The term "<b>personal information</b>" means information that you provide us
which personally identifies
you, such as your name, phone number, email address, and any other
data that is tied to such information.
</p>
<p class="c8">BY USING THE SITE, YOU AGREE TO THE TERMS OF
THIS PRIVACY POLICY. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH THESE TERMS, YOU
SHOULD NOT USE THE SITE.</p>
<h3 class="western c9">I. Information We Collect
and How We Use It</h3>
<p class="c8">We use commercially reasonable efforts to
ensure that the collection of personal information is limited to
that which is necessary to fulfill the purposes identified below.
If we use your information in a manner different than the purpose
for which it is collected, then we will ask you for your consent
prior to such use.</p>
<p class="c7"><b>Account information.</b> If you create an account to take advantage of the full
range of services offered on the Site, we ask for and record
personal information such as your name and email
address. We use your email
address to send you updates and news, and contact you on behalf of
other users (such as other users who send you compliments, personal
messages, or favorite reviews). You may choose not to receive
e-mail of this type by accessing the "Account" tab on the Site and
updating your notification
settings.</p>
<p class="c7"><b>Submissions.</b> We record and may publicly display your submissions in
order to provide the services that we offer. When we display your
submissions, we do so together with your account name (first name
and last initial). The term "<b>submissions</b>"refers to the
information that you submit or post to the Site for public display,
such as business ratings, reviews, photos, compliments, and the
information that you display as part of your account
profile.</p>
<p class="c7"><b>Feedback.</b> If
you contact us to provide feedback, register a complaint, or ask a
question, we will record any personal information and other content
that you provide in your communication so that we can effectively
respond to your communication.</p>
<p class="c7"><b>Personal messaging.</b> In order to allow you to send and receive personal
messages to other registered users of the Site, we record
the messages that you send and
receive using the Site's personal messaging
feature.</p>
<p class="c7"><b>Activity.</b> We
record information relating to your use of the Site, such as the
searches you undertake, the pages you view, your browser type, IP
address, requested URL, referring URL, and timestamp
information. We use this type
of information to administer the Site and provide the highest
possible level of service to you. We also use this information in
the aggregate to perform statistical analyses of user behavior and
characteristics in order to measure interest in and use of the
various areas of the Site.</p>
<p class="c7"><b>Cookies.</b> We
send cookies to your computer in order to uniquely indentify your
browser and improve the quality of our service. The term
"<b>cookies</b>"
refers to small pieces of information that a website sends to your
computer's hard drive while you are viewing the
site. We may use both session cookies (which expire once you close
your browser) and persistent cookies (which stay on your computer
until you delete them). Persistent cookies can be removed by
following your browser help file directions. If you choose to
disable cookies, some areas of the Site may not work
properly.</p>
<p class="c7"><b>Enforcement.</b> We may use the information we collect in connection with
your use of the Site (including your personal information) in order
to investigate, enforce, and apply our Terms of Service and Privacy
Policy.</p>
<h3 class="western c9">II. Transfer of
Information</h3>
<p class="c8">We may distribute your submissions to third
parties, as permitted pursuant to our Terms of Service. The third
parties may in turn publicly display or publish your submissions in
connection with their own websites and media platforms. When we
distribute your submissions to third parties, we typically include
your account name (but not your personal information unless you
include your personal information in your Submission).</p>
<p class="c8">We may share your personal information with
third parties to provide you with services that we offer through
the Site, conduct quality assurance testing, facilitate creation of
accounts, provide technical and customer support, or provide
specific services, such as synchronization of your contacts with
other software applications, in accordance with your instructions.
These third parties are required not to use your personal
information other than to provide the services requested by
you.</p>
<p class="c7">We may share your personal information with our parent
company, subsidiaries, joint ventures, or other companies under a
common control (collectively, "<b>Affiliates</b>")
that we may have now or in the future, in which case we will
require them to honor this Privacy Policy. If another company
acquires our company or our assets, that company will possess your
personal information, and will assume the rights and obligations
with respect to that information as described in this Privacy
Policy.</p>
<p class="c8">We may disclose your personal information to
third parties in a good faith belief that such disclosure is
reasonably necessary to (a) take action regarding suspected illegal
activities; (b) enforce or apply our Terms of Service and Privacy
Policy; (c) comply with legal process, such as a search warrant,
subpoena, statute, or court order; or (d) protect our rights,
reputation, and property, or that of our users, affiliates, or the
public. Please note that we are not required to question or contest
the validity of any search warrant, subpoena or other similar
governmental request that we receive.</p>
<p class="c8">We may disclose information in the aggregate to
third parties relating to user behavior in connection with actual
or prospective business relationship with those third parties, such
as advertisers and content distributors. For example, we may
disclose the number of users that have been exposed to, or clicked
on, advertising banners.</p>
<h3 class="western c9">III. Others'
Information</h3>
<p class="c8">You may choose to provide us with another
person's e-mail address so that person may be invited to create an
account on this website and become your friend. We use this
information to contact and, if necessary, remind that person about
the invitation. By providing us with another
person's e-mail address, you represent to us that
you have obtained the consent of the person concerned as regards
such disclosure to us of their personal information. All invitees
are provided with the option not to receive further invitations. We
may disclose such information if required to do so in order to
comply with legal process, as described above.</p>
<h3 class="western c9">IV. Links</h3>
<p class="c8">This Site may contain links to third party
websites to which we have no affiliation. Except as set forth
herein, we do not share your Personal Data with those third
parties, and are not responsible for their privacy practices. We
suggest you read the privacy policies on all such third party
websites.</p>
<h3 class="western c9">V. Controlling Your
Personal Data</h3>
<p class="c8">To the extent you include personal information
in your submissions (such as a photo of yourself), third parties
may be able to identify you, associate you with your user account,
and contact you. Third parties can also associate you with your
user account using the member lookup feature on the Site, but only
if the third party already knows your full name and you include
information in your submission that allows the third party to
distinguish you from other users who might share the same full
name. Please do not include information in your submissions that
you expect to keep private.</p>
<p class="c7">Please also note that the personal messages you send or
receive using the Site's personal messaging
feature are only private to the extent that you and the
sender/recipient keep them private. For example, we do not have any
control over whether a recipient of one of your personal messages
publicly posts the contents of such a
message.</p>
<p class="c8">As a registered Yelp user, you can modify some
of your personal information and your privacy preferences by
accessing the "Account" section of this website. For example, you
may choose not to receive e-mail solicitations from Yelp by
accessing the "Account" tab on the Site and updating your
notification settings. Also, upon your request, Yelp will use
commercially reasonable efforts to close your account, and cease
displaying your submissions on the Site; nevertheless, we may still
retain your personal information in our systems. Registered
users who wish to close their account should <a href="/contact?topic=support&amp;subtopic=close">click here</a>.</p>
<h3 class="western c10">VI. Security</h3>
<p class="c8">Your account is password protected. We use
industry standard measures to protect the personal information that
is stored in our database. We limit the access to your personal
information to those employees and contractors who need access to
perform their job function, such as our customer service personnel.
If you have any questions about the security on the Site, please
contact us. Although we take appropriate measures to safeguard
against unauthorized disclosures of information, we cannot assure
you that your personal information will never be disclosed in a
manner that is inconsistent with this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p class="c7"><em>You hereby acknowledge that Yelp is
not responsible for any intercepted information sent via the
internet, and you hereby release us from any and all claims arising
out of or related to the use of intercepted information in any
unauthorized manner.</em></p>
<h3 class="western c9">VII. E-mails and
Opt-out</h3>
<p class="c8">You may opt-out of receiving personal messages
from specific users. In addition, you may opt-out of receiving
notifications from us by changing your notification settings under
the "Account" tab after you log on to this website. Unregistered
users who receive e-mails from us may also opt-out of receiving
further e-mails by following the instructions contained in our
e-mails. Despite your indicated e-mail preferences, we may send you
notices of any updates to our Terms of Use or Privacy
Policy.</p>
<h3 class="western c9">VIII. Terms and
Modifications to this Privacy Policy</h3>
<p class="c8">We may modify this Privacy Policy at any time,
and we will post any new versions on this page. If we make any
material changes in the way we use your personal information, we
will notify you by sending an e-mail to the last e-mail address you
provided to us and/or by prominently posting notice of the changes
on our website. Any such changes will be effective upon the earlier
of thirty (30) calendar days following our dispatch of an e-mail
notice to you or thirty (30) calendar days following our posting of
notice of the changes on our website. These changes will be
effective immediately for new users of the Site. Please note that
at all times you are responsible for updating your personal
information to provide us with your most current e-mail address. In
the event that the last e-mail you have provided us is not valid,
or for any reason is not capable of delivering to you the notice
described above, our dispatch of the e-mail containing such notice
will nonetheless constitute effective notice of the changes
described in the notice. In any event, changes to this Privacy
Policy may affect our use of Personal Data that you provided us
prior to our notification to you of the changes. If you do not wish
to permit changes in our use of your personal information, you must
notify us prior to the effective date of the changes that you wish
to deactivate your account with us. Continued use of the Site
following notice of such changes shall indicate your
acknowledgement of such changes and agreement to be bound by the
terms and conditions of such changes.</p>
<h3 class="western c12">IX. Dispute
Resolution</h3>
<p class="c8">If you believe that Yelp has not adhered to
this Privacy Policy you may write to the Yelp Privacy Office at the
following address:</p>
<p class="c13">Yelp! Inc.<br>
Privacy Officer<br>
706 Mission Street<br>

E-mail:
<a href="mailto:legal@yelp.com">legal@yelp.com</a>

<p class="c8">In your letter, please describe in as much
detail as possible ways in which you believe the Privacy Policy has
not been complied with. We will investigate your complaint
promptly.</p>
<h3 class="western c9">X. Contacting the Website
and Access to Your Personal Information</h3>
<p class="c8">Upon written request, subject to certain
exceptions, Yelp will inform you of the existence, use, and
disclosure of your personal information and will give you access to
that information. Access requests should be sent to our Privacy
Officer, using the contact information above. When requesting
access to your personal information, we may request specific
information from you to enable us to confirm your identity and
right to access, as well as to search for and provide the personal
information that we hold about you. We may charge you a fee to
access your personal information to cover our costs; however, we
will advise you of any fee in advance.</p>

Policy, the privacy practices of this website, or if you want to
exercise any of the rights that you are given under this Privacy
Policy, you can contact us using the contact information listed
