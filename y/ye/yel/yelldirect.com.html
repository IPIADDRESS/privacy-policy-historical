        <h2 class="sitemap"><a name="hwci"></a>1.  The information we collect about you and how we do it</h2>

<p>To provide you with the advertising services you have ordered, we need information about you.</p>  
<p>If you use Yell Direct, you are in control of what information we collect about you, but if you choose not to share your information, you may not be able to access or use some areas of our websites.
</p><br>
                <strong>1a  How we collect information about you</strong>
        <p>We will ask for information about you when you:</p>
        <ul>
          <li> advertise with us; </li><li> ask for a free line entry (a listing of your business details which we will include in our services for free); </li><li> order directories or any of our other products and services; </li><li> apply for credit with us; </li><li> register to use Yell Direct; </li><li> ask for Yell.com Mobile services (the part of Yell.com you can use from a mobile phone); </li><li> use the ‘send-to-a-friend’ feature on Yell.com (this is where you can email <strong></strong>information about a business or service on our site to a friend); </li><li> set up, look at, or change your profile or account with us; </li><li> ask for information from us; </li><li> give us a testimonial or other feedback; </li><li> enter competitions or special promotions; or </li><li> fill in surveys. </li></ul><br>

        <p>We may ask other organisations for information about you, for example, if we check your credit rating or credit score, before we provide credit to you to allow you to buy advertising.  We also buy business information from other organisations, so we may get information about you from those organisations.</p>
        <br>

        <strong>1b  What information we collect</strong>
        <p>The information we collect and hold about you may include your:</p>

          <li>job title;</li>
          <li>business address;</li>
          <li>phone and/or mobile phone numbers;</li>
          <li>email address;</li>

        <br>

        <strong>1c  Why we need your email address</strong>

We may use it for account administration (for example to email you your password, if you forget it) and for added security.  We may use your email address to send you a confirmation of any order you make, if you buy our products or services and to confirm any profile or account changes you make.  We might also use your email address to bring you news such as changes to the way you can use Yell Direct or new services and special offers we think you might be interested in.

		<p>We take the security of your personal information very seriously.  We have put in place technology and security policies which are designed to protect the personal information that we hold about you.  We also follow the strict security procedures that privacy laws require.  These cover storing, using and releasing any information you have provided, and preventing unauthorised access or use.  For more information on how Yell Direct protects the security of your information, please read the <a href="/ydsecuritypolicy.html">Yell Direct Security Policy</a>.</p><br><br>

        <h2>9  Why we link to other websites</h2>
		<p>Our websites contain hyperlinks to websites that are owned and operated by other organisations. These websites have their own privacy and cookie policies, and we urge you to read them.  They control how your personal information  is used when you give it to these other organisations or they collect it with cookies.  We do not approve any other websites and we are not responsible for any information, material, products or services that are on or accessible through those websites or for the privacy practices of websites run by other organisations. If you use these other websites you do it at your own risk.</p><br><br>

        <a name="tuoc"></a>
        <h2>10  Using cookies on our websites and how you can reject them</h2>
		<p>A cookie is a piece of information that a website transfers to the cookie file of the browser on your computer's hard disk so that the website can remember who you are.  Cookies can help to display the information on a website in a way that matches your  interests.  Most major websites use cookies.  Cookies cannot be used by themselves to identify you.  We use two types of cookie on our websites.</p><br>
		<p>The first type is a 'session-based' cookie. This means that it is only saved on your hard disk for the time you are using our website. On Yell Direct, this cookie helps the website to 'remember' that you are logged into the site.  If you log in and then don't do anything for 20 minutes you will get a message telling you that your session has timed out and that you need to log in again.  This is a security measure to help us protect your information. </p><br>

		<p>The second type of cookie we use stays on your hard disk for up to five years.  This 'persistent' cookie helps us understand the number of different people coming to the site, rather than the total number of times the site is used.  Without the persistent cookie, if you visited the site once each week for three weeks we would count you as three separate users. We also use them for research surveys, to make sure you are not invited to fill in a questionnaire too often, or after you have already done so.  </p><br>
		<p>We do not store any of your personal information in either type of cookie.  We do not link cookies to information you have given us during registration. We only use cookies to help us make the services we offer on Yell Direct better for all our advertisers.</p><br>
		<p>If you do not want a website to create a cookie on your computer, most web browsers provide the option to disable them.  However,  Yell Direct may not work properly if you reject our cookies.</p><br>
		<p>If you want to know more about how cookies work and how to manage or delete them, visit the <a href="http://www.w3.org/Security/Faq/wwwsf2.html#CLT-Q10" rel="nofollow">World Wide Web Consortium's website</a> or visit the <a href="http://www.allaboutcookies.org/manage-cookies/" rel="nofollow">Interactive Advertising Bureau's website</a>.</p><br>

		<p><strong>Web beacons</strong></p>  
<p>A web beacon - sometimes called a clear GIF (Graphics Interchange Format) or pixel tag - is a line of code that we have installed on some of our pages to help us learn more about how our visitors make use of the content and services that we offer, and to count how often people visit different areas of Yell Direct.  A web beacon is invisible to you and doesn't affect the content you see.</p><br>
		<p>Web beacons help us provide a better service to you by allowing us to understand which areas of Yell Direct are more popular with visitors than others.  We do not use web beacons to collect any personal information about you, but they allow us to build up general information about how people use our site.  Certain pages on Yell Direct may also contain web beacons put in place by our advertising agencies so that we can measure how useful our advertising on other websites is.  Web beacon files let our agency recognise a unique cookie on your web browser, which in turn means we can learn which adverts bring users to Yell Direct.  The web beacon only records a limited amount of information that includes the cookie number, the page ID and the time and date you accessed the page. It does not contain your name, address, telephone number or email address.</p><br>
