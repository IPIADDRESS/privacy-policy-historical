<p>4.1.<b>&nbsp;Data received from Facebook</b>: Once users log into Facebook in order to take a quiz, Yenpu may process the following information, depending on the quiz being taken: full name, profile picture, Facebook User ID, gender, timeline posts (including reactions), photos and list of friends. Yenpu, through Facebook, will only process the necessary data to provide and improve its Service to users. This data is required to provide the User with the Service. Refusal to provide this data will not allow Yenpu to provide the Service to the User.</p>
<p>4.2.&nbsp;<b>Data received from you</b>: Users may provide us voluntarily their Personal Data, such as name, e-mail address and company name when contacting us (through Facebook, Messenger, e-mail or any other channel), your images and profile pictures (if you choose to upload them to our quizzes). Yenpu might also collect meta-data from the User such as their IP address and the date and time of their visit to the Site for purposes including, but not limited to fraud prevention.</p>
<p>4.3.&nbsp;<b>Data automatically collected or generated</b>: Yenpu will obtain data on the User’s usage of the Service either independently or with the help of third party services through the use of “cookies” (as described in Section 1). Such data consists of connectivity, technical or aggregated usage data, such as IP address, non-identifying data regarding the device, operating system, browser version locale and language settings used, the cookies and pixels installed on such device, and the activity (clicks and other interactions) of users of our Services. We do not use such data to learn a person’s true identity or contact details, but mostly to have a better understanding on how our users typically use and engage with our Services. The use of such technical and device data also helps us and our partners to deliver contextual or otherwise more effective advertisements and content; to optimize our ad management and our users’ viewing experience, and to improve the overall user experience and performance of our Services.</p>
<p><b>5. Registration Through Authentication Services Of Third Parties</b></p>
<p>5.1. Users can register and log in by using authentication services of Third-party Providers, as far as these are available (hereinafter referred to as „authentication by a third-party“). Particularly Facebook, Google or Twitter can be possible authentication service providers.</p>
<p>5.2. As requirement for the authentication through a Third-party Provider, users should be registered at the respective Third-party Provider and enter the necessary login details in the appropriate web formula or should be already logged in to the Third-party Provider.</p>
<p>5.3. In the context of a registration, we receive a user ID with the information under which the user with this user ID is logged in and an ID that cannot be further used by the Service Provider (so called “user handle”). Whether we receive further data depends only on the user who uses the authentication by a Third-party Provider, the data that is selected to be released in the context of the authentication, and which data has been authorized by the user in the privacy or other settings of the user account at the Third-party Provider. The data can differ, depending on the provider and the selections of the user; normally these are the e-mail address and the user name. In case of Facebook, this is also the – so called – Public Profile Information, that can be seen by everyone. This includes the name, profile and cover picture, gender, networks (i.e. school or working place), user name (Facebook URL) and user identification number (Facebook ID).</p>
<p>5.4. The password that has been entered in the context of the authentication by a Third-party Provider cannot be seen by us, neither can it be saved by the Service Provider.</p>
<p>5.5. The users are asked to keep in mind that their data, which we save, can be compared and synchronized with their user account at the Third-party Provider automatically. There is no obligation however for us to update the data.</p>
<p>5.6. In the case that users decide that they do not wish to further use the connection of their user account at the Third-party Provider for the authentication by a Third-party Provider, they must cancel this connection within their user account at the Third-party Provider. If the users wish to delete their data we save, they must cancel their account at our Service.</p>
<p>5.7. During the use of authentication by a third party, the users are asked to keep in mind the applicable Terms of Use, as well as the Rules for Data Use of the third party. These can be found: Twitter (<a href="https://twitter.com/tos">https://twitter.com/tos</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/privacy">https://twitter.com/privacy</a>), Google (<a href="https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/">http://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/</a>), Facebook (<a href="https://www.facebook.com/policies/">https://www.facebook.com/policies/</a>).</p>

<p><b>14. Use of Google Marketing and ReMarketing Services</b></p>
<p>14.1. We use the marketing and remarketing services (hereinafter referred to as the “Google Marketing Services”) provided by Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountian View, CA 94043, USA.</p>
<p>14.2. The Google Marketing Services enable us to display ads for and on our Websites and Service in a more targeted manner so that users are only shown ads which might actually be of interest to them. For this purpose, as soon as the user accesses our Websites, or other websites on which Google Marketing Services have been activated, Google immediately executes a Google code and so called re/marketing tags (invisible graphics or code) are integrated into the Website. With the help of these tags, an inpidual cookie, is stored on the users’ device (comparable technology can be used instead of cookies). The cookies can be set from various domains, including google.com and doubleclick.net. This file keeps a record of which websites the user visits, what content he/she is interested in and which offers he/she has clicked on, as well as technical information about the browser and operating system, referring websites, time of access and other details about the use of the website content. The users’ IP address is also recorded, whereby we, within the context of Google Analytics, would like to point out that, within member states of the European Union or in other countries that are party to the Agreement on the European Economic Area, the IP address is truncated and only transmitted in its entirety to a Google server in the US and truncated there in exceptional cases. The IP address will not be linked with any of the user’s data from other services offered by Google. The aforementioned information can also be combined with equivalent information from other sources. If the user visits other websites afterwards, he/she can only be shown the ads that directly reflect his/her interests.</p>
<p>14.3. Within the scope of Google Marketing Services, the users’ data is processed pseudonymously. This means that Google does not, for example, store and process the users’ name or e-mail address, instead processing the relevant data on the basis of the cookies within pseudonymous user profiles. In other words, from Google’s point of view, the ads are managed and displayed for the cookie owner, regardless of who the cookie owner is, rather than for a specifically identified person. This shall not apply where the user has expressly permitted Google to process the data without this pseudonymization. The information collected about the users via “DoubleClick” shall be transmitted to Google and stored on Google’s servers in the US.</p>
<p>14.4. On the basis of Google Marketing Services, we integrate third-party “DoubleClick“ ads. DoubleClick uses cookies that enable Google and its partner websites to run ads based on users visiting this or other websites.</p>
