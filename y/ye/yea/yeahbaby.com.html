<h3><b>Privacy Policy</b></h3>

YeahBaby, LLC, operator of YeahBaby.com, is committed to making your search for baby names and baby information as pleasant and successful as possible. Maintaining your privacy is part of that commitment. This privacy policy applies to the use by consumers of YeahBaby.Com and governs online data collection and usage by Yeahbaby.com. 
<p><b>
What information we collect </b><br> 
You may browse the YeahBaby.com site without providing any personally identifiable information but if you choose to use some of our products or services, you will be asked to provide certain personal information such as: contact information (like your full name and address), unique identifiers (such as your email address and phone number), and demographic information (like your zip code).
</p><p>
When using certain tools on our site, you may be asked to provide additional information.  Many YeahBaby.com pages contain a feature to email a friend.  YeahBaby.com will not at anytime retain a friend's email address.
</p><p>
In addition to the personal information that you voluntarily provide directly to us, your "Internet Protocol" or IP address, browser type, domain name, access times and referring web site address are also recorded. This information is collected both during registration on a site or in response to specific requests. This data helps us serve you by allowing us to understand how visitors use our services. 
</p><p>
Some of the services available on our site are provided by third parties and sometimes we will give you the opportunity to opt in to offers from third parties not affiliated with us. If you decide to use these services or accept these offers, we may provide, with your consent, your information to the third party. However, you should note this privacy policy does not apply to information you consent to give to third parties (or voluntarily provide to third parties) not affiliated with us. Any information you give to another party is governed by the rules of that party's privacy policy, which may differ from this privacy policy. We are not responsible for information given to or collected by other parties. Please review their privacy policies prior to providing any information to third parties. 
</p><p>
What we do with collected information 
When you register on our site, we use the information you provide to us to track what kind of activities you conduct on our site, including, for example, the types of content that you have viewed. 
</p><p>
To provide you the best products and services, we often team with business partners. When you indicate that you want to receive a product or service, or contact a person or organization, we share the data needed for you to receive what you have indicated. We take great care to require these business partners agree by contract not to disclose any personal information they may receive. We may contract with third parties to administer our mailing lists or provide retail services. In such event, your personal information may be shared with such third party for the purpose of administering the products, services and programs you have selected. 
</p><p>
We use your email as a unique identifier in our record system, to verify communications from you, and to send you newsletters, promotion offerings or other email that you ask to receive. You will have the option to stop these communications at any time by unsubscribing according to the instructions in the newsletter, promotion or email. We will also use your information to contact you when necessary for administrative purposes related to your account and to communicate with you about changes to the site, our services or this privacy policy. 
</p><p>
We may, at times, produce reports for advertisers containing aggregate information about our users such as demographic, age and online usage information. This allows us to work more closely with advertisers to provide content and offers that are most relevant to our users. We will never include any personal information of our users in these reports. 
</p><p>
We reserve the right to use or disclose any information without notice or consent as needed to satisfy any law, regulation (including our Terms of Use) or legal request; to conduct investigations of consumer complaints or possible breaches of law; to protect the integrity of our site and our property; to protect the safety of our visitors or others; to fulfill your requests; or to cooperate in any legal investigation. 
</p><p>
In developing our business, we might sell certain assets or the company, or parts of it, may be sold, merged or otherwise transferred. In such transactions, your user information, whether personally identifiable or otherwise, may be one of the transferred assets. 
</p><p><b>
