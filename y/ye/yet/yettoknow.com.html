        Website Privacy Statement</h3>
    <p>
        Last Updated: January 1, 2012</p>
    <h3>
        Scope and Changes</h3>
    <p>
        Yet To Know, Inc. ("YTK" or "we")
        operates the website <a class="blue_lnk" href="http://www.yettoknow.com/">www.yettoknow.com</a>,
        and permutations thereof that refer to this Website Privacy Statement in a direct
        hyperlink (the "Websites").</p>
    <p>
        YTK respects your privacy and we want you to be confident in sharing your information
        with us. This Website Privacy Statement is designed to inform you of the types of
        information we collect from users, how we use that information, and the circumstances
        under which we will share it with third parties. This Privacy Statement applies
        only to the Websites. It does not apply to your use of any other websites (whether
        or not operated by us), including any websites which we provide links to or websites
        of our partners or advertisers, or to any activities which are not online.</p>
    <p>
        Please note that some features and/or services referenced may not be available on
        some Websites. Therefore, portions of this Privacy Statement which pertain to such
        features or services may not be applicable on each of the Websites.</p>
    <p>
        This Website Privacy Statement is effective as of the date listed above. Even if
        you read and/or agreed to a prior policy statement, you need to review this updated
        version. We reserve the right to revise this Website Privacy Statement at any time
        and at our discretion. If we decide to change our Website Privacy Statement, we
        will post those changes to this Website Privacy Statement accessible on the homepage
        of the Websites, and other places we deem appropriate so our users are always aware
        of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if
        any, we disclose it. If, however, we are going to use users' personally identifiable
        information in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection we
        will notify users via either email or by posting a notice on the Websites for 30
        days.</p>
    <h3>
        A Special Note About Children</h3>
    <p>
        We do not knowingly market to or encourage children, minors or anyone under the
        age of 13 to use our service and we request that children do not submit information
        to us.</p>
    <h3>
        Personal Information and How We Use It</h3>
    <p>
        YTK operates a social network offering users a set of tools to connect to our global community.  Generally it is possible to use the Websites without providing us with any personally identifiable information, but on some of our Websites, users have the option of providing various types of personal information to make the best use of available services and features. This section describes what we collect and how we use it. Providing the information is always voluntary, however, and you can always choose not to provide the information by choosing not to use the service or feature. By providing the information you agree to our use consistent with this statement.</p>
    <h3>
        INFORMATION SUBMITTED BY YOU</h3>
    <p>
        <b>Zip Code Only:</b> On some of the Websites, you have the choice of providing
        your ZIP Code. We use your ZIP Code to compute your location for simple matching
        and product shipping and sales tax estimates. In connection with some of the matching
        services we provide we may also use your ZIP Code to match you with third parties
        offering services in your area.</p>
    <p>
        <b>E-mail Address Only: </b>On some of the Websites if you wish to sign up as a
        registered user, provide reviews, be matched with participating service providers,
        we require that you provide us with your email address. We will use this to email
        you information or service provider information you may have requested.</p>
    <p>
        <b>Basic Contact Info:</b> On some of the Websites a user may be able to become
        a registered user. When a user decides to become a registered user, we ask for some
        basic contact information, such as username, ZIP Codes, and email address. We use
        this basic contact information to facilitate the use of certain features of our
        Websites and to send you information about our company, services and products, and
        to communicate occasional offers from our partners and advertisers if you elect
        to receive them.</p>
    <p>
        <b>Complete Profile Info: </b>In our online registration form, we ask users provide
        us with certain information such as name, email address, gender, date of birth,
        location details and some optional details. These details are available to the user
        at anytime, and capable of being corrected or updated (with the exception of gender
        and URL address) through the users account settings.</p>
    <p>
        At the users own discretion, they may choose to post additional facts about themselves. These facts may include sensitive personal data such as ethnic origin, level of education, religious denomination, physical or mental information. Users may volunteer sensitive personal data to us when they create their profile. Please also remember that photographs and videos that are posted may reveal sensitive personal data about e.g. about one's health. If the user volunteers sensitive personal data to us, they explicitly consent to our using such information as described in this Privacy Policy.</p>
    <p>
        On some of the Websites a registered user may decide to become a buyer of coupon
        offers. When registering as a buyer, we collect complete contact information, i.e.,
        full name, address, e-mail address, and phone number, as well as credit card number
        and expiration date. We use this information to validate the buyer's identity and
        to bill for coupons purchased through YTK. All credit card information is encrypted.</p>
    <p>
        <b>Service User Information: </b>On the Websites where it is available, if a user
        wants to receive potential personal "match" information, YTK requests
        that users of certain Website services complete a questionnaire, which includes
        personal and contact information ("Member User Information"). Member User
        Information enables YTK to provide matches and information specifically about requested

        <b>Content Submitted By You: </b>When a user chooses to post content on any of the
        Websites where posting is available, for example, in the form of a photo review
        we may collect and maintain that information in a file specific to the user.</p>
    <p>
        <b>Correspondence Submitted By You: </b>When a user sends us personal correspondence,
        such as emails or comments, or if other users or third parties send us correspondence
        about activities or postings on the website, we may collect such information into
        a file which is only accessed by authorized personnel. We may also collect other
        users' comments about a user in our complaints department.</p>
    <h3>
        INFORMATION ACQUIRED AUTOMATICALLY</h3>
    <p>
        We collect certain information on the Websites through the user's experience and
        activities, cookies, log files, clear gifs, and/or third parties to create a profile
        of our users. A profile is stored information that we keep on individual users that
        detail their viewing preferences, activities and interactions with YTK. Consequently,
        collected information is tied to the user's personally identifiable information
        to provide offers and improve the content of the site for the user. This profile
        is used to tailor a user's visit to the Websites, and, subject to the Opt-Out Policy
        stated below, to direct pertinent marketing promotions and communications to them.</p>
    <p>
        <b>Cookies:</b> A cookie is a piece of data tied to information about the user and
        stored on the user's computer. We use both session cookies, which terminate when
        a user closes his browser, and persistent cookies, which remain on the user's computer
        until manually deleted. Cookies are used to help make your use of our Websites more
        enjoyable. YTK creates these cookie files on your hard drive through your browser
        and uses them to save information on your YTK username, ZIP Codes and Website preferences
        so you can avoid re-entry of this information each time you visit our Websites.
        Cookies also help us to deliver content specific to your interests. You may decline
        our cookies if your web browser software permits, although this may prevent you
        from accessing certain features on our Websites. For more information about deleting
        and controlling cookies please visit <a class="blue_lnk" href="http://www.aboutcookies.org" target="_blank">
            http://www.aboutcookies.org</a>.</p>
    <p>
        <b>Log Files:</b> Like most standard website servers we use log files. This includes
        internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP),
        referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, and number of clicks to analyze
        trends, administer the Web site, track user's movement in the aggregate, and gather
        broad demographic information for aggregate use. We use your IP address at times
        to help identify you as you browse and to gather broad technical and demographic
        information on who uses our Websites. We do not tie log files to personally identifiable
        information.</p>
    <p>
        <b>Clear Gifs (Web Beacons/Web Bugs): </b>We employ and/or our third party advertisers
        employ a software technology called clear gifs (also known as Web Beacons or Web
        Bugs). They help us better manage content on our site by informing us what content
        and which campaigns are effective. Clear gifs are tiny graphics, about the size
        of a period at the end of a sentence, with a unique identifier. Clear gifs are similar
        in function to cookies and are used to track the online movements of Web users.
        In addition, YTK and its advertisers may use clear gifs in HTML-based emails. This
        allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness
        of our marketing campaigns by showing how many emails recipients have opened. We
        do not tie web-beacons to personally identifiable information.</p>
    <h3>
        GENERAL USES OF INFORMATION</h3>
    <p>
        In addition to the uses described above, we may use your personal information for
        any of the following:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>To contact you in response to a customer service question from you, or in relation
            to any issue arising in respect of the agreement between YTK and you, or to resolve
            or attempt to resolve a dispute between users or between YTK and you</li>
        <li>To process credit card payments approved in advance by you</li>
        <li>To allow you to send an email to another user who is on the YTK site, where available</li>
        <li>To assist law enforcement or other governmental agencies investigating cases of
            possible illegal activities by third parties</li>
        <li>To improve the experience of using the Websites, improve YTK's products and services,
            improve marketing and promotion of our products and services, customize the Websites'
            content and layout, and generally improve the Websites to meet your needs better</li>
        <li>To make your profile data available to other users of the website if you select
            the 'Any users' access setting</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>
        Who We Share Your Personal Information With</h3>
    <p>
        <b>Aggregated information:</b> We aggregate personal information into statistics
        about users, their usage of the Websites, traffic patterns, and demographics. We
        may provide third parties with such statistics, but never in a way that would make
        the information personally identifiable: this data is aggregated from millions of
        users to the Websites each month.</p>
    <p>
        <b>Advertisers:</b> If you choose to submit to us your Complete Contact Info as
        part of a request to be contacted by an advertiser or advertisers, we will supply
        to the advertiser(s) your Complete Contact Info and those advertiser(s) will contact
        you using the information regarding the specific query which you have raised. Advertiser(s)
        that receive your Complete Contact Info may contact you regarding other products
        and/or services. If you choose to submit to us a questionnaire which includes Member User Information, we may provide the information submitted in that questionnaire
        to any of our participating advertiser(s) who may provide the products or services
        to which your request relates. Your submission of the questionnaire will be your
        consent to our disclosure to any such advertiser(s). YTK does not have control over
        the use of the Service User Information once provided to sellers(s): your rights
        in respect of their treatment of your information will be governed by their own
        policies.</p>
    <p>
        <b>Processing Agents: </b>We may from time to time use external service providers
        to facilitate or outsource elements of our service or operation of the Websites,
        including without limitation the use of agencies to process credit card transactions.</p>
    <p>
        <b>Business Transfer:</b> As we continue to develop our business we might buy or
        sell companies, subsidiaries, or business units. In such transactions, customer
        information is generally one of the transferred assets but remains subject to the
        promises made in any pre-existing privacy policy. In the event that our company,
        or substantially all of its assets, is acquired, your information may be one of
        the transferred assets and we may share it with an actual or potential acquirer.</p>
    <p>
        <b>Legal Requests and Customers' Requests:</b> We cooperate with law enforcement
        inquiries and third parties to enforce all applicable laws including but not limited
        to laws relating to intellectual property rights, fraud, and other rights. Therefore,
        we can (and you authorize us to) release your name, city, state, telephone number,
        email address, previous fraud complaints, if any, and other account and personal
        information without a subpoena, court order or other substantially similar legal
        procedure to law enforcement entities when we believe release is necessary to comply
        with the law to protect the rights, property, or integrity of the Websites, our
        customers, users or third parties, or to prevent illegal activities, suspected fraud,
        situations involving potential threat to the physical safety of any person, or violation
        of YTK's <a class="blue_lnk" href="http://www.yettoknow.com/terms-of-use/">Terms
            of Use</a>. Further we can (and you authorize us to) disclose your name, street
        address, city, state, zip code, country, phone number, email, and company name to
        consumers who have alleged fraud or any other consumer dispute relating to their
        transactions and/or communications with you.</p>
    <p>
        <b>Other Trusted Parties:</b> We may provide your contact information and other
        personal data to trusted third parties to provide information on products and services
        that may be of interest to you.</p>
    <h3>
        Accessing and Changing your Personal Information</h3>

        For registered users on the YTK Website, a user can review personal identifiable information by logging in with the user email and password and then navigating to Settings. After accessing the user's Account Settings, click the appropriate link to make changes as necessary. Users will be able to review and change much of their personal information, including but not limited to:</p>

        <li>City, region and country of residence;</li>
        <li>Password.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        For access and changes of any other data, please <a class="blue_lnk" href="http://www.yettoknow.com/contact-us/">
            contact us</a>. Upon receipt of your request, and possibly subject to identification
        measures, we will provide you with reasonable access and comply with appropriate
        data correction requests in accordance with applicable law. For access requests,
        we will respond within thirty (30) days upon receiving your request.</p>
    <p>
        You should also note that if we have provided your information to third parties,
        you will have to make a separate request to them directly if you want to have your
        information removed from, or corrected in, their databases.</p>
    <p>
        <b>Control of your password:</b> You may not disclose your password to any third parties or share it with any third parties. If, despite the foregoing, you lose control of your password, you may lose substantial control over your personal information and may be subject to legally binding actions taken on your behalf. Therefore, if your password has been compromised for any reason, you should immediately change your password.</p>
    <p>
        <b>Security:</b> YTK has security measures in place to protect and prevent the loss,
        misuse, and alteration of the information under our control. YTK uses industry standard
        efforts to safeguard the confidentiality of your personal information such as firewalls.
        While "perfect security" does not exist on the Internet, our technical
        team at YTK works hard to ensure secure use of our site.</p>
    <h3>
        Deactivating Your Profile</h3>
    <p>
        Users of the YTK network have the following choices to delete their profile from
        our database:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Send a message to Member Services; and</li>
        <li>Sign in with your password and deactivate your profile</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        These options are available within Account Settings</p>
    <h3>
        Invite a Friend</h3>
    <p>
        If a user decides to use YTK's Invitation option to invite a friend to our site,
        we ask them for the friend's email address. YTK will automatically send the friend
        an email inviting them to join the website. YTK stores this email address for the
        purpose of automatically associating the friend with the user sending the invitation.
        YTK does not sell these email addresses or use them to send any other communication
        besides invitations. The friend may contact YTK to request the removal of this information
        from our database.</p>
    <p>
        By providing us with information about a friend, you confirm that they have given
        you their informed consent to do so.</p>
    <h3>
        Uploading your Contacts</h3>
    <p>
        If a user decides to upload their contacts, they accept that by doing so, an email
        invitation will be sent on their behalf, to the email addresses of the contacts
        that have been uploaded and then selected to be invited. YTK stores the name and
        email address of the contacts for the purpose of automatically associating the friend
        with the user sending the invitation. YTK does not sell these email addresses or
        use them to send any other communication besides invitations.</p>
    <h3>
        Your Use of Other User's Information</h3>
    <p>
        You may not use other users' information for commercial purposes, to spam, to harass,
        or to make unlawful threats. We reserve the right to terminate the accounts of those
        who misuse other users' information or who otherwise violate the <a href="#TB_inline?height=400&amp;width=600&amp;inlineId=TermsOfUse&amp;modal=true" class="blue_lnk thickbox">Terms of Use</a>.</p>

                                    YTK is not in a position to arbitrate trademark disputes between the advertisers
                                    on the Yet To Know Network and trademark owners. Accordingly, we encourage trademark
                                    owners to resolve their disputes directly with the advertisers, particularly because
                                    the advertisers may have similar advertisements on other sites. Similarly, YTK does
                                    not control and assumes no responsibility for content that appears on a third party's
                                    website that may be accessed via the Yet To Know Network, and trademark owners should
                                    contact third-party sites directly to resolve trademark disputes.</p>

                                    federal registration of the trademark in question and will take whatever action,
                                    in its sole discretion, it deems appropriate, including removal of the challenged

                                    been provided to YTK by a third party and in YTK's sole discretion, we conclude
                                    that the content is identical to the registered mark and is used in connection with
                                    goods and/or services covered by the trademark owner's federal registration, YTK
                                    will provide to notice to the third party prior to any removal of content. If prior
                                    to such removal, the third party demonstrates that it has its own trademark registration
                                    or approved trademark application covering the challenged content, YTK will not
                                    remove the content.</p>

                                    any court order relating to the behavior of the challenged party identified in such

                                    and without regard to conflict of laws. Any claim arising out of or relating to
                                    this Agreement or the Yet To Know Network shall be settled by binding arbitration
                                    in Orange County, California in accordance with the American Arbitration Association's
                                    commercial arbitration rules. Any such claim shall be arbitrated on an individual
                                    basis, not consolidated with another party's claim. Each of us may conduct discovery
                                    per California CCPA §1283.05 and §1283.1. Judgment on the arbitration
                                    award may be entered into any court with jurisdiction, and the arbitrator's award
                                    shall not be appealable or reviewable except as permitted by California law. However,
                                    (a) each of us may seek interim relief from a Orange County, California court to
                                    protect the party's rights or property while arbitration is pending, and (b) at
                                    our option, we may bypass arbitration in cases of fraud or other crimes against
                                    us, interference with our technical operations or violations of our rights or property.</p>
