<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Protecting your privacy is important to <a href="/">Yeties Open Directory</a>.<br> <br> This Privacy Policy explains how Yeties Open Directory collects, uses, and discloses  the personal information you may provide while using Yeties Open Directory (the  "Website") and the services provided through the Website. It is  always your choice whether or not to provide personal information  through the Website. Any personal information you provide will be  treated in accordance with this Privacy Policy.<br> <br> <strong>Your Consent</strong><br> <br> 1. By using or submitting information to this Website, you consent to Yeties Open Directory's collection, use, and disclosure of your personal information  in accordance with this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree with this  Privacy Policy, you may not use or submit personal information to the  Website.<br> <br> <strong>Information Automatically Collected</strong><br> <br> <em>2. Non-Personal Information</em> - As is typical with many other  Internet sites, the Website automatically collects certain non-personal  information regarding users, such as the date and time you access the  Website, your IP address, the URL from which you linked to the Website,  the web browser you are using, the Website pages read and images  viewed, and any content you post to the Website. This non-personal  information is used for Website and system administration purposes.  Non-personal information may be disclosed to third-parties and permanently  archived for future use.<br> <br> <em>3. Cookies </em>- The Website uses "cookies," a technology that  stores a small amount of information on a user's computer to permit the  Website to recognize future visits using that computer. Cookies enhance  the convenience and use of the Website. For example, the information  provided through cookies is used to recognize you as a previous user of  the Website (so you do not have to enter your personal information every  time), offer personalized content and information for your use and  otherwise facilitate your Website experience.<br> <br> Some of the banner ads displayed in the Website are provided by outside  companies. These ads contain cookies. While Yeties.com uses cookies in  other parts of the Website, cookies received with banner ads are  collected by Yeties Open Directory's advertisers and Yeties Open Directory does not have access to  this information. Yeties Open Directory may engage third parties to provide cookies  that collect information regarding Website use. You may choose to  decline cookies generally if your browser permits, but doing so may  affect your use of the Website and your ability to access certain  features of the Website.<br> <br> <strong>Personal Information You Specifically Provide</strong><br> <br> <em>4. Your Personal Information</em> - During your use of the Website,  you may be asked to voluntarily provide personal information (such as  your name, e-mail address, and address) for communications with you.

Use of Your Personal Information</em> - Yeties Open Directory may use your  personal information to contact and correspond with you, respond to your  communications, provide services to you, facilitate and enhance your  use of the Website, and as otherwise permitted by law. Additionally, Yeties Open Directory<a href="/"> </a>may keep a record of all communications with you.<br> <br> Yeties uses third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you  visit its Website. These companies may use information (not including  your name, address, email address or telephone number) about your search  queries and visits to the Website and other websites in order to  provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. If  you would like more information about this practice and to know your  choices about not having this information used by these companies, <a href="http://networkadvertising.org/consumer/opt_out.asp">click here</a>.<br> <br> You should be aware that if you voluntarily disclose information online  (whether through Yeties Open Directory's services or any other service available  online), personal or otherwise, that information can be collected and  used by others. For example, if you use forums or if you post personal  information online, you may receive unsolicited messages from others. Yeties Open Directory has no control over this use of your personal information.<br> <br> <em>6.
