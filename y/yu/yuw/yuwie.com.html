			<br><br>
			<span class="t3">Sharing of the Information this Site Gathers/Tracks</span><br>
			Except as otherwise described in this privacy statement, Yuwie will not disclose personal information to any third party unless we believe that disclosure is necessary: (1) to conform to legal requirements or to respond to a subpoena, search warrant or other legal process received by Yuwie.com, whether or not a response is required by applicable law; (2) to enforce the Yuwie.com Terms of Use Agreement or to protect our rights; or (3) to protect the safety of members of the public and users of the service. Yuwie reserves the right to transfer personal information to a successor in interest that acquires rights to that information as a result of the sale of Yuwie or substantially all of its assets to that successor in interest For more information see the "Changes in Our Privacy Policy" section below.
			<br><br>
			<span class="t3">Links</span><br>
			The Yuwie Website contains links to other websites. This includes links that are placed there by Yuwie (such as in advertisements), as well as by other Yuwie members. Please be aware that Yuwie is not responsible for the privacy practices of any other website. We encourage all members and other users of the Yuwie website to be aware of when they leave our website, and to read the privacy policies of each and every website that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy policy applies solely to information collected by Yuwie through the Yuwie website. 
			<br><br>
			<span class="t3">Use of Cookies</span><br>
			A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user's computer for record-keeping purposes. We use cookies on the Yuwie website. However, we do not and will not use cookies to collect private information from any Member or other user of the Yuwie website which they did not intentionally submit to us, other than as stated in this Privacy Policy.
			<br><br> 
			We use both "session ID cookies" and "persistent cookies." We use session ID cookies to make it easier for you to navigate our site. A session ID cookie expires when you close you browser. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period of time. Note also that members may optionally use a cookie to remember their email in order to automatically log in to our website. You can remove persistent cookies by following directions provided in your Internet browsers' "help" file; however, please note that, if you reject cookies or disable cookies in your web browser, you will not be able to use the Yuwie website. 
			<br><br>
			This privacy statement covers the use of cookies by Yuwie only, and does not cover the use of cookies by any other party.

			<br><br>
			<span class="t3">Changes in Our Privacy Policy</span><br>
			If we change our privacy policy, we will post those changes on our web site so members and other users of the Yuwie website are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. If we are going to use members' or other users' personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection, we will notify those members and users via email or by placing a prominent notice on our website. 
			<br><br>
			<span class="t3">Invite a Friend</span><br>
			If a Member elects to use our "Invite" feature to invite a friend to become a Member of the Yuwie service, we ask them for the friend's email address. Yuwie will automatically send the friend an email inviting them to join the site. Yuwie stores this email address for the purpose of automatically adding the respondent to the friends list of the member sending the invitation, and also to send reminders of the invitation. Yuwie will never sell these email addresses or send them any invitations unless it is requested by the member who invited them originally. Any person who receives an invitation may contact Yuwie to request the removal of this information from our database.
			<br><br>
			<span class="t3">Security</span><br>
			The Yuwie account of every member is password-protected. Yuwie takes every precaution to protect the information of the members, as well as information collected from other users of the Yuwie website. We use industry standard measures to protect all information that is stored on our servers and within our database. We limit the access to this information to those employees who need access to perform their job function such as our customer service personnel. Be aware that we cannot guarantee the security of member account information. Unauthorized entry or use, hardware or software failure, and other factors may compromise the security of member information at any time
			<br><br>
			<span class="t3">Email Choice/Opt-out</span><br>
			Members who no longer wish to receive our weekly email updates or other email notifications may opt-out of receiving these communications by following the instructions contained in the applicable email or by logging-in and changing their settings in the "Account Settings" section of the Yuwie website. You can access this page by clicking on the "Control Panel" link in the main menu. 
			<br><br>
			<span class="t3">Third Party Advertising</span><br>
			The ads appearing on this Web site are delivered to members by our web advertising partners. Our web advertising partners may use cookies. Doing this allows the ad network to recognize your computer each time they send you an online advertisement. In this way, ad networks may compile information about where you, or others who are using your computer, saw their advertisements and determine which ads are clicked on. This information allows an ad network to deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you. Yuwie does not have access to or control of the cookies that may be placed on the computer of any Member or other user of the Yuwie website by the third-party ad servers or ad networks. 
			<br><br>
			<span class="t3">Members and Users Located Outside of the United States of America</span><br>
			We have made an effort to protect the personal information of all members and other users of the Yuwie website, and to the extent applicable, we attempt to comply with local data protection and consumer rights laws. If you are unsure whether this privacy policy is in conflict with the applicable local rules where you are located, you should not submit your personal information to the Yuwie website. <b>IN ADDITION, IF YOU ARE LOCATED WITHIN THE EUROPEAN UNION, YOU SHOULD NOTE THAT YOUR INFORMATION WILL BE TRANSFERRED TO THE UNITED STATES, THE LAWS OF WHICH MAY BE DEEMED BY THE EUROPEAN UNION TO HAVE INADEQUATE DATA PROTECTION</b>. Members and other users of the Yuwie website located in countries outside of the United States of America who submit personal information do thereby consent to the general use of such information as provided in this privacy policy and to the transfer of that information to and/or storage of the information in the United States of America.
