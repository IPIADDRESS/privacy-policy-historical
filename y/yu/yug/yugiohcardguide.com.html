		<p><b>Collection of Information:</b><br>
		For each visitor to this web site, our web server does not recognize a user's domain or e-mail address. We collect aggregate
		information on what pages visitors access, referring URL, operating systems, browser type, and other such, non-personally identifiable information.</p>

		<p>In order to use our online forum we require that a visitor register with their email address. We may also collect other information volunteered by the visitor including ICQ number, AIM address, MSN Messenger ID, Yahoo Messenger ID, location and occupation. Each registered visitor may choose whether or not to make this information publicly available.</p>

		<p>If you supply personally identifiable information while registering for our forum, we do not gather that data for any use other than to identify you when you access that service. We do not share this information with any other person or business. However, we do not have any control over address harvesters that may visit our web site for the purpose of harvesting addresses for use by other parties.  <!-- When you register to be added to one or more of the e-mail lists maintained by us, we do not share that information with any other person or business.  --></p>

		<!-- p><strong>Advertisements:</strong> <br>
		We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our website.

		<p><strong>Off-Site Links:</strong><br>
		This web site may contain links to other sites. Please be aware that we are not responsible for the content or privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every web site that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by this Web site.</p>


		<p><b>Notification of Changes:</b><br>
		If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes on our privacy policy statement page so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. If at any point we decide to use personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time it was collected, we will notify users by way of an email. Users will have a choice as to whether or not we use their information in this different manner. We will use information in accordance with the privacy policy under which the information was collected.</p>


			<p><strong>Our cookie policy</strong></p>
			<p>In compliance with the European Union legislation, we inform you that our website will store some information about your preferences on your own computer inside a tiny file called a 'cookie'.</p>
			<p>A cookie is a small piece of data that a website asks your browser to store on your computer or mobile device. The cookie allows the website to "remember" your actions or preferences over time.</p>
			<p>You can delete all cookies that are already on your computer and you can set most browsers to prevent them from being placed. If you do this, however, you may have to manually adjust some preferences every time you visit a site and some services and functionalities may not work.</p>
			<p>Most browsers support cookies, but users can set their browsers to decline them and can delete them whenever they like. A third-party website called <a href="https://www.aboutcookies.org/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">aboutcookies.org</a> has been setup to help you with instructions how you can do that on various browsers.</p>

			<p><strong>We use cookies to:</strong></p>
			<ol>
				<li>Identify you as a returning user and to count your visits in our traffic statistics analysis;</li>
				<li>Remember your custom display preferences;</li>
				<li>Suggest any recent searches you've made on our site</li>
				<li>Other usability features including tracking whether you've already given your consent to cookies</li>
			</ol>

			<p>Enabling cookies from our website is not strictly necessary for the website to work but it will provide you with a better browsing experience.</p>
			<p>The cookie-related information is not used to identify you personally and the pattern data is fully under our control. These cookies are not used for any purpose other than those described here.</p>
			<p>There may also be other types of cookies created after you've visited our website. We use Google Analytics, a popular web analytics service provided by Google, Inc. Google Analytics uses cookies to help us to analyse how users use the site. The information generated by the cookie about your use of our website (including your IP address) will be transmitted to and stored by Google on servers in the United States. Google will use this information for the purpose of evaluating your use of our website, compiling reports on website activity and providing other services relating to website activity and internet usage. Google may also transfer this information to third parties where required to do so by law, or where such third parties process the information on Google's behalf. Google undertakes not to associate your IP address with any other data held by Google.</p>

			<p><strong>Third Party Advertising</strong></p>
			<p>We may have third-party advertising companies serving ads to you when you visit our website. These companies may store information about your visits to our website and to other websites in order to provide you with relevant advertisements about goods and services.</p>
			<p>These companies may employ cookies and other identifiers to gather information which measures advertising effectiveness. The information is generally not personally identifiable unless, for example, you provide personally identifiable information to them through an ad or an e-mail message.</p>

			<p><strong>Information Gathered by Third Party Advertisers</strong></p>
			<p>Cookies enable advertisers to learn about what ads you see, what ads you click, and other actions you take on our site and other sites. This allows advertisers to provide you with more useful and relevant ads. For example, if they know what ads you are shown while visiting our site, they can be careful not to show you the same ones repeatedly. They do not associate your interaction with unaffiliated sites with your identity in providing you with interest-based ads.</p>
			<p>We do not provide any personal information to advertisers or to third party sites. Advertisers and other third-parties (including the ad networks, ad-serving companies, and other service providers they may use) may assume that users who interact with or click on a personalized ad or content are part of the group that the ad or content is directed towards (for example, readers in the Pacific Northwest who read certain types of articles). Also, some third-party cookies may provide them with information about you (such as the sites where you have been shown ads or demographic information) from offline and online sources that they may use to provide you more relevant and useful advertising.</p>
			<p>If you would like to learn more about what options you have about limiting the gathering of information by third-party ad networks, you can consult the website of the <a href="http://optout.networkadvertising.org" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Network Advertising Initiative</a>.</p>
			<p>You can opt out of participating in interest-based advertising networks but opting out does not mean you will no longer receive online advertising. It does mean that the companies from which you opted out will no longer customize ads based on your interests and web usage patterns using cookie-based technology.</p>

			<p><strong>Type and Purpose of Collection</strong></p>
			<p>We collect information at various points in the Website to facilitate its use by our customers. Non-Personal Information: Upon accessing the Website, certain non-personal information will be automatically collected without your knowledge or consent, such as your IP address, location data (which is anonymous) and the referring website (Non-Personal Information). We use Non-Personal Information to examine our traffic and to view how our customers use the Website. This type of information will not allow you to be personally identified. For example, we use cookies, which contains only certain statistical information. You can instruct your computer to inform you whenever a cookie is being sent, or you can disallow cookies through your web browser. If you do choose to disallow cookies, your experience on the Website may be diminished, or your ability to choose some of the options on the Website may be limited.</p>

			<hr>

			<p><strong>Sharing Information</strong></p>
			<p>We will not sell, rent or disclose to outside parties the information we collect, save and except that we may share the collected information with other parties as follows:</p>
			<ol type="a">
			<li>Affiliated Service Providers: We have agreements with various affiliated service providers to facilitate the functioning of the Website, with whom we may share the information we have collected. For example, we may share your credit card information with the credit card service provider to process your purchase. All administrative service providers that we use are required to have the same level of privacy protection as we have, and therefore we expect that your information will be handled with the same level of care that we employ. Additionally, for example, we may use analytic or marketing services such as Google Analytics, Google Adsense, Taboola, or RevContent, to which collection you hereby unconditionally consent.</li>
			<li>Where required by law: We may share the collected information where required by law, specifically in response to a demand from government authorities where such demand meets the legal requirements.</li>
			<li>Statistical Analysis: We may share Non-Personal Information and aggregated information with third parties, including but not limited to for advertising or marketing purposes. No Personal Information will be shared in this manner.</li>
			<li>Transactions: In connection with, or during negotiations of, any merger, sale of company assets, financing or acquisition, or in any other situation where Personal Information may be disclosed or transferred as one of our business assets.</li>
