ONLINE PRIVACY POLICY<br>
<br>
<u>General Privacy Policy Statement:</u> <br>
4Kids Entertainment, Inc. ("4Kids" or "we"), the owner of
the 4Kids.TV (website (the "Website"), recognizes its obligation to
its customers, community, online visitors and subscribers (collectively
"Users" or "You") to adhere to the highest standards of
decency, fairness, and integrity in all of its operations. 4Kids is dedicated
to protecting consumer privacy on the Internet, especially for children. We
have developed our privacy practices in compliance with the requirements
established by the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act ("COPPA")
and make every effort to comply with the guidelines established by the
Children's Advertising Review Unit (CARU).<br>
<br>
<u>General Website Online Privacy Policy Applicable to Users 13 and over:</u><br>
The policy set forth below is applicable to Users of the Website who are 13 and
over.<br>

color:white">In addition, information is collected in certain sections of the
Website in which a User specifically and knowingly provides such information to
4Kids such as in chat rooms or on bulletin boards. 4Kids may use such
information for a variety of purposes, including fulfillment and the
development of editorial content and marketing and promotional campaigns for
the Website.<br>
<br>
In the event that 4Kids plans to post any such information on the Website,
Users shall be provided with prior notification of such posting and given the
option of preventing such posting. If a User objects to such use for any
reason, he/she may stop that use--either by e-mail request or by modifying
his/her Registration information online.<br>
<br>
If a User wishes to modify their registration information or stop receiving

<p class="MsoNormal"><u><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana;
color:white">Special Privacy Policy for Users Under 13:</span></u><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana;color:white"> <br>
4Kids has a Special Privacy Policy for Users under 13 that is set forth below: <br>
(i) 4Kids encourages parents and guardians to spend time online with their
children and to participate in the interactive activities offered on various
websites. <br>
(ii) Except as provided in subparagraphs (iv)-(viii) below, 4Kids does not
collect personally identifiable information about any User under 13. Except as
provided in subparagraphs (iv)-(viii), no information collected from any User
under 13 years of age is used for any marketing or promotional purpose
whatsoever, either inside or outside the Website. The e-mail address of a User
under 13 is never posted on the Website. <br>
(iii) For some activities, such as online polls or surveys, we may ask a User
under 13 to provide information that is not personally identifiable. This might
include the User's first name only, city or state of residence, age, gender, or
favorite 4Kids TV character. <br>
(iv) Except as provided below in subparagraphs (v) and (vii), 4Kids does not
knowingly collect names and e-mail addresses from children under 13 without (x)
notifying the parent via e-mail and giving the parent the option to remove their
child's e-mail address and any other information pertaining to the child from
the applicable database for that activity or (y) obtaining verifiable consent
from that child's parent. A parent or guardian may permit a User under 13 to
participate in activities on our Website without consenting to the disclosure
of the User under 13's personally identifiable information to third parties. No
personally identifying information should be submitted to, or posted at, the
Website by any User under 13 years of age without the consent of such User's
parent or guardian. <br>
<br>
4Kids will obtain such consent from a parent of a User under 13, by requiring a
parent or legal guardian to (1) send 4Kids a signed consent form via e-mail,
fax or regular mail or, (2) All registrants shall receive an e-mail confirming
their registration at the Website. Parents or Legal Guardians always have the
option of calling us at 1-212-758-7666 or e-mailing us at <a href="mailto:comments@foxbox.tv"><span style="font-family:Arial;color:navy;
text-decoration:none"><u><span style="color:eeeeee">webmaster@4kids.tv</span></u>
</span></a>&nbsp;with any questions or problems with regards to consent.<br>
<br>
(v) 4Kids will not request from any User under 13, and 4Kids does not condition
the participation of any User under 13 in any contest or other activity on the
Website on, the disclosure by the User under 13 of more personal information
than is reasonably required for such User under 13 to participate in such
contest or activity. For example, for sweepstakes and contests, e-mail
addresses are collected for the purpose of entering the online sweepstakes or
contest on a one-time basis and are used to notify winners of the sweepstakes
or contest once by e-mail. If any User under 13 wins the contest, the User
under 13 will be contacted and asked for parental contact information. Notification
and prizes will be sent to the User under 13 's parent or guardian. 4Kids keeps
any personally identifiable information we obtain through a contest or
sweepstakes only until we have successfully selected the winner(s), awarded the
prize(s), and completed the administration of the contest or sweepstakes as
legally required and such information will not be used for any other purpose.
We will not publish the names, ages, images or other personally identifiable
information of any contest winner under 13 without first obtaining the consent
of such contest winner's parent or guardian.<br>
(vi) For any periodic newsletters offered by the Website, we collect a
participant's first name, e-mail address, and his or her parent's e-mail
address. We then send an e-mail notification to the parent asking permission.
If the parent wishes to deny permission for the child's receipt of any
newsletter from the Website, the parent simply needs to reply to the e-mail
within 72 hours of receipt. Otherwise, the parent will be deemed to have
approved the child's receipt of the newsletter. A parent or User can, at any
time, be removed from the newsletter mailing list by following the instructions
at the bottom of the newsletter. If such a removal request is made (or if the
parent denies permission from the outset), any personal information collected
for the newsletter subscription is deleted from our database. <br>
(vii) For other activities, such as sending an electronic postcard or e-mail to
a friend, we may also ask for personal information about other people. This is
usually limited to a first name and e-mail address. E-mail addresses collected
to send an electronic postcard or e-mail to a friend are deleted when the
requested postcard or e-mail is transmitted.<br>
(viii) We will disclose information we maintain as required by law, such as,
for example, in response to a court order or a subpoena. We also may disclose
such information in response to a specific law enforcement agency's request.<br>
<br>
</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><u><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana;
color:white">About IP Addresses</span></u><span style="font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Verdana;color:white"><br>
4Kids collects IP addresses for the purpose of system administration and to
report information to our advertisers. An IP address is a number that is
automatically assigned to the User's computer whenever the User is surfing the
Web. When a User request pages from the Website, our servers log the Users' IP
address. We do not link IP addresses to any personally identifiable
information. This means that a User's session will be logged, but the User
remains anonymous to us. <br>
<br>
<u>Use of Cookies: The 4Kids Cookies Policy</u><br>
Cookies are pieces of information that a Website transfers to an individual's
hard drive for record keeping purposes. Cookies make web-surfing easier for a
User by saving the User's passwords, purchases, and preferences. A cookie lets
the computer remember that a User has registered, which allows us to speed up
such User's future activities at our Website. Similarly, any Website store may
use a temporary cookie to track which products a User has chosen to purchase
while shopping. Letting the cookie do the record keeping saves the User the
trouble of entering information over and over again during a single visit. You
may occasionally get cookies from our Ad Server and/or third party advertisers.
The Ad Server cookie is only used to track frequency limits on the ads. No
personally identifiable information is stored on the Ad Server cookie. 4Kids
does not control the cookies of our Ad Server and/or third party advertisers,
and these cookies are not subject to the 4Kids cookie policy. The use of
advertising cookies sent by Ad Servers or third party advertisers is standard
in the Internet industry. The use of cookies is an Industry standard, and
you'll find cookies at most major web sites. By showing how and when a User
uses the Website, cookies help us see which areas are popular and which are
not. Many improvements and updates to the Website are based on such data. <br>
<br>
<u>How the Website Does Not use Cookies</u><br>
The Website never uses cookies to retrieve information from your computer that
was not originally sent in a cookie. Except as described in this Privacy
Policy, the Website does not use information transferred through cookies for
any promotional or marketing purposes; nor is that information shared with any
third parties. The Website does not use cookies to identify specific individuals,
except in such cases as online shopping (see above) and contest registration
(where a cookie may allow you to enter a contest without registering again each
time). <br>
<br>
Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies. If you'd prefer, you can
set yours to refuse cookies or to alert you when cookies are being sent.
However, it is possible that some areas of the Website, such as any shopping,
contest, and game area, may not function properly if you set your computer to
refuse cookies. <br>
<br>
<u>Links to Other Sites</u><br>
The Website may contain banner advertisements or other links to other sites not
controlled by 4Kids. These other sites may send their own cookies to Users,
collect data or solicit personal information. 4Kids and its affiliates are not
responsible for any failure on the part of any linked websites to comply with
any privacy policy posted on our Website or for any violation by such other
websites of any contractual or other legal obligation to which the operator(s)
of such linked website may be subject. In addition, other websites which may
contain material not suitable for children, may also link to the Website
without our knowledge or consent. The Website will clearly display a
"bumper" page to identify to children and parents when they are
leaving the Website and entering an advertiser’s site. The bumper is a reminder
to children to never give out information online without getting permission
from a parent or legal guardian.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
