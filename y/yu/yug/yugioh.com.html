<h2>COOKIES</h2>
<p>This Website uses cookies to collect information about you. &nbsp;"Cookies" are small data files which are placed on your computer by this Website. &nbsp;Cookies can identify you as a unique customer and store your personal preferences as well as technical information.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We use cookies and technical information to personalise your visit to our Website (e.g. to recognise you by name when you return to our Website) and to track our customers' behaviour. This helps us improve the design and content of our Website for visitors and assists us in marketing our products and services. &nbsp;Although most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies, you can change your website browser settings at any time to refuse all cookies or to tell you when a cookie is being sent.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Certain ads appearing on the Website may be delivered to you by a third party ad service provider. &nbsp;The ad service provider may place or recognise their own unique cookie on our browser and may use information about your visit to the Website, such as the number of times that you have viewed an ad. &nbsp;However please note that this information will not identify you as an individual.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Website never uses cookies to retrieve information from your computer that was not originally sent in a cookie. Except as described in this Privacy Policy, the Website does not use information transferred through cookies to advertise or to sell our goods or services to you; nor is that information shared with any independent third parties who are not connected to our business. The Website does not use cookies to identify specific individuals, except in such cases as online shopping (see above), sweepstakes and contest registration (where a cookie may allow you to enter a contest without registering again each time).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies. If you'd prefer, you can set yours to refuse cookies or to alert you when cookies are being sent. However, it is possible that some areas of the Website, such as any shopping, contest, and game area, may not function properly if you set your computer to refuse cookies.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION</h2>
<p>We do not disclose personal information that identifies you individually to third parties, except from time to time we may transfer, disclose or share such information with third parties who may be engaged by us specifically to handle and deliver certain online activities (e.g. conducting contests and sweepstakes). Such third parties only have access to the personal information necessary to perform their functions, but may not use it for other purposes. Any such use will comply fully with this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>We may also disclose personal information to third parties in the following circumstances:</p>
<p>•<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>In order to comply with laws or requests by law enforcement agencies, or to protect the rights, property or safety of this Website and its visitors;</p>
<p>•<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>In response to legal proceedings, for example, in response to a court order;&nbsp;</p>
<p>•<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>To obtain professional advice, for example, from auditors or legal advisors;</p>
<p>•<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>In the event that we sell all or part of our business (we may transfer the information to the third party buyer).&nbsp;</p>
<h2>GUIDANCE FOR PARENTS AND GUARDIANS OF CHILDREN 15 AND UNDER</h2>
<p>We have a special Privacy Policy for children visiting this Website under the age of 16. We urge children to check with their parents or guardians before entering information on any website, and we urge parents and guardians to discuss this Privacy Policy with their children, including restrictions regarding the online release of personal information to anyone they don't know.</p>
<p>We do not collect personal information about any website visitor aged 15 and under, such as names and email addresses, without either:&nbsp;</p>
<p>(a) <span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>emailing the parent/guardian to provide the option to remove their child's email address and any other information relating to the child from the relevant database for that activity; or&nbsp;</p>
<p>(b)<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>obtaining verifiable consent from that child's parent or guardian.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We will obtain such verifiable consent from a parent or guardian of a child before s/he can register for an account on the Website. The registration process consists of the following steps:</p>
<p>(a)<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>a Website visitor is asked to provide his/her age, email address and the email address for his/her parent or guardian;</p>
<p>(b)<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>we email the parent or guardian confirming that the child has begun the registration process and providing a link where the parent or guardian can give permission to the child to complete registration;</p>
<p>(c)<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>once approved, an email is sent to both parent and child confirming the completion of registration.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once this process is complete, the registered child will then be able to: (1) create a Website profile; (2) post on message boards; (3) challenge other Users to online games; and (4) chat with other Users during online games.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Even with a parent or guardian's consent, we will only request personal information from children that is necessary to allow them to participate in a contest or activity on the Website. For example, for sweepstakes and contests, email addresses are used to notify winners and winners’ parents directly of the sweepstakes or contest once by email. We will not entice children into disclosing personal information with the prospect of a game or prize or something similar. &nbsp;Notification and prizes will be sent to parents/guardians.</p>
<p>We only keep any personal information we obtain through a contest or sweepstake until we have successfully selected the winner(s), awarded the prize(s), and completed the administration of the contest or sweepstake as legally required; and such information will not be used for any other purpose. We will not publish the names, ages, images or other personal information of any contest winner under 16 without first obtaining the consent of the contest winner's parent or guardian.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The email address of a child under 16 is never posted on the Website. No personally identifying information should be submitted to, or posted at, the Website by anyone under 16 without obtaining their parent/guardian’s prior consent.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>GUIDANCE FOR PARENTS AND GUARDIANS OF CHILDREN 16 AND ABOVE</h2>
<p>It is important to us that older children can enjoy our Website in a responsible fashion. We therefore encourage them to consult with their parents or guardian(s) before providing personal information. We also encourage parents and guardians to supervise their children’s online activities by, for example, adopting parental control tools available from online services and software manufacturers that help provide a child-friendly online environment. As with younger children, no personally identifying information should be submitted to, or posted at, the Website by older children without obtaining their parent/guardian’s prior consent. We do not knowingly disclose or publish &nbsp;personal information about any website visitor aged 17 and under (such as names and email addresses) without obtaining verifiable consent from that child's parent or guardian.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>ABOUT IP ADDRESSES</h2>
<p>An IP address is a unique sequence of numbers that identifies your computer whenever your surf the Internet. &nbsp;We collect IP addresses for the purpose of system administration and to report information to our advertisers. When you request pages from the Website, our servers record your IP address. We do not link IP addresses to any information that identifies you personally. This means that although your session will be recorded, your identity remains hidden from us.</p>

<p>The Website may contain banner advertisements or other links to other sites we do not control. These other sites may send their own cookies, collect data or personal information. We cannot accept responsibility for any failure on their part to comply with the terms of our Privacy Policy or with any relevant legal requirement. You should always carefully read the privacy policy of each website you visit. &nbsp;In addition, other websites that may contain material not suitable for children may also link to the Website without our knowledge or consent. &nbsp;</p>
