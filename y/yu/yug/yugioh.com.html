			<p><b>Yugioh.com Privacy Policy</b></p>

<p>	Please read this carefully before using the yugioh.com website.  By using any part of the yugioh.com website, you are agreeing to this Privacy Policy and the Terms of Use, and you are consenting to the collection, use and disclosure of your information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</p>

<p>	Thank you for visiting yugioh.com ("Website").  4K Media Inc. ("4K", "we", “us” or “our”), the owner of the Website, developed this Website to be an enjoyable experience for visitors and users (“Users”, “you” or “your”) to view Yu-Gi-Oh! content.  Your privacy is important to us.  </p>

<p>To better protect your privacy, and to help ensure a rewarding online experience for all visitors, we provide this Privacy Policy summarizing our online information collection practices and explaining the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used. We may modify this Privacy Policy periodically, so please check back from time to time to review any updates to our Privacy Policy.  This Privacy Policy applies to information collected when you visit the yugioh.com site only.  When using other 4K websites, or any other websites, please review the privacy policy controlling that specific website.</p>

<p><b>1.	Our Information Collection and Uses</b></p>

<p>You do not need to register with us in order to view most of the pages on yugioh.com. However, certain portions of our Website and services may not be accessible without your registration or your provision of certain information. From time to time, including for sweepstakes, subscriptions, voluntary online research surveys, content submissions, voting and polling activities, online shopping, Report a Problem, and “refer a friend”, we may ask you for personal identifiers such as your name, email address, mailing address, and telephone number, among other things. Providing such information may be necessary for you to fully enjoy or participate in a particular activity or service offered on our Website. At times, sweepstakes or contests may be open to children under 13.  Please see section 6 below regarding the privacy of children.</p>

<p>When you visit our Website, our servers automatically collect information that describes how you use our Website (such as which pages you visit and how long you visited the pages). Also, your web browser will automatically send us information such as your browser type, Internet service provider, data that identifies the page you visited prior to and after your visit to our Website, and your IP address). We also may determine what technology is available through your browser so we can serve you the most appropriate version of a page. We use this information to better understand your interests, as well as to understand the preferences of other Users. This helps us improve our website, tailor our offerings, and make Users’ visits to our Website efficient and effective.</p>

<p>IP Address and Location-Based Information</p>

<p>4K collects IP addresses for a variety of purposes, including for system administration and for tracking the number of visits to different pages on the Website and to report information to our advertisers.  An IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to the portal through which the User connects with the Internet. When a User requests pages from the Website, our servers log the Users' IP address. </p>

<p>Cookies</p>

<p>Like many websites, we use “cookies” to make your visit to our Website as seamless and efficient as possible.   Cookies are pieces of information that our Website transfers to a User’s hard drive to recognize your computer and your preferences when you visit our Website again. A cookie also lets the computer remember if a User has registered with us, which allows us to speed up such User's future activities at our Website. Letting the cookie do the record keeping of a User’s preferences saves the User the trouble of entering information over and over again during a single visit, and helps us identify the Website features in which you have the greatest interests.   Cookies, or beacons for that matter, do not provide personally identifiable information to us unless the User voluntarily provides the information during Website activities.  If you do provide personally identifiable information, then this information may be linked to the data stored in a cookie.</p>

<p>Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies. You can set your browser to refuse cookies or to alert you when cookies are being sent. However, it is possible that some areas of our Website, such as any shopping, contest, and game area, may not function properly if you set your computer to refuse cookies.</p>

<p>Web Beacons and Local Shared Objects</p>

<p>Web beacons are small pieces of code placed on a web page to track or monitor the frequency with which Users visit certain areas of our Website, the length of time they spent visiting those areas and other behavioral data. Web beacons also deliver a cookie to a User’s browser. This helps us analyze the popularity of our pages and offerings.</p>

<p>Local Shared Object (LSO) is similar to a cookie and is used in flash applications. The use of LSOs on our Website is limited to storing information in regards to the specific flash rich media application which sets it, such as a media player or a game.</p>

<p><b>2.	Information Collection and Uses by Social Platform and Social Media Plugins</b></p>

<p>Yugioh.com contains links to and integrations with social networking platforms (such as Facebook, Google Plus, Pinterest and Twitter) that will permit or require Users to register or log into their account via that social networking platform. Yugioh.com also will permit you to use social media plugins such as the Facebook ‘Like” or Google ‘1’ buttons. When you use these social networking platforms and plugins, your username, password and other personal information about you on these services may be shared with us.
<br>When linking with those social networking platforms or plugins through yugioh.com, those services may be able to collect information about your activity on yugioh.com, and may notify your connections (for example, your facebook friends) about your use of yugioh.com. These social networking platforms and plugins may also employ unique identifiers which allow your activity to be monitored across multiple websites for purposes of delivering more targeted advertising to you. Please note that their privacy policies may be different from our own. We urge you to review the privacy policy controlling that specific social networking platform. </p>

<p><b>3.	Hulu, Crunchyroll, Video Players and Other Services</b></p>

<p>We use video players, and other tools and services, provided by Hulu, Crunchyroll and others to provide content on our Website. Please note that use of these tools and services from Hulu, Crunchyroll and/or other parties are subject to the “terms of use” and privacy policy of those service providers. Our Website may embed content, such as video players and games, from third parties, which are governed by the content provider's privacy policy. It is recommended that you review each content provider's privacy policy.</p>

<p>Our Website uses Crunchyroll to service our Users outside of the United States. Crunchyroll may require  registration.  International Users will be subject to Crunchyroll’s Privacy Policy as determined by specified Country. We strongly recommend that you familiarize yourself with their policies which can be viewed at http://www.crunchyroll.com/privacy.   </p>

<p>Hulu services our Users in the United States. We strongly recommend that you familiarize yourself with their policies which can be viewed at http://www.hulu.com/privacy.</p>

<p><b>4.	Collection of Information by Third-Parties; Links to Other Websites</b></p>

<p>When using our Website, you may encounter links to other websites---whether it is an advertisement link, a promotion, a social networking platform, a contest, a blog or anything else.  A User may arrive at one of these sites by clicking on a banner advertisement, or simply by selecting a link on our Website. </p>

<p>However, we do not endorse or sponsor other websites. We are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such sites. We are not responsible for the collection or use of information on these other websites. 4K expressly disclaims any and all liability associated with a User's use of, and the content on, such other websites. </p>

<p>These websites might issue their own cookies, and have their own data collection practices and policies. Your use of such sites may be subject to the terms of service and privacy policies posted on such sites. This Privacy Policy only covers information collected by 4K on yugioh.com.  We recommend that you review the privacy policy of any website that you visit.  </p>

<p>You may occasionally get cookies from our Ad Server and/or third party advertisers. Certain ads appearing on our Website may be delivered to you by a third party ad service provider. The ad service provider may place or recognize their own unique cookie on our Website and may use non-personally identifiable information about your visit to our Website, such as the number of times that you have viewed an ad. 4K does not control the cookies of our Ad Server and/or third party advertisers, and these cookies are governed by the privacy policy of the third party advertiser. Our Privacy Policy does not cover these third parties’ use of information collected and these third parties are not subject to our Privacy Policy. </p>

<p><b>5.	Further Uses and Disclosures of Information</b></p>

<p>We use the personal information provided by Users at times for various reasons, including:</p>

<p>•	to deliver information, products, or content requested by Users, 
<br>•	to contact Users about our programs, products, features, surveys, promotions, offerings, or other services, 
<br>•	to  verify access rights to access-restricted services, including for purpose of supporting digital rights management software,
<br>•	to  improve our services by providing personalized content, language and location customization, and/or personalized help and instructions, 
<br>•	to provide information concerning compatibility, 
<br>•	to ask Users to participate in surveys about products, services, news and events
<br>•	to provide Users with news, newsletters, updates, targeted advertising, promotions, and special offers,
<br>•	to better understand how the Website is used, and understand Users’ preferences, including web traffic patterns and what types of content are most popular with users, 
<br>•	for research and analytical purposes, which may help us tailor our Website and our products and services,
<br>•	to find appropriate advertisers,
<br>•	for other purposes specifically explained at the time we collect the information</p>

<p>4K may disclose personally identifiable information and aggregate anonymous data about Users to the parents and affiliates of 4K. We may share such information at any time to a third party in order to fulfill a service or offering on our Website, to fulfill a User’s request, to analyze preferences and behavioral patters, and to find appropriate advertisers.   </p>

<p>Additionally, in the event that all, or substantially all, of the assets relating to the Website or of 4K are transferred or sold to another entity, personally identifiable information submitted to us, and all information collected by us, may be transferred to the acquiring entity. Also, we may disclose any and all information to third parties in order to comply with laws or at the request of law enforcement agencies or other legal entities, or to protect the rights, property or safety of our Website, Users, ourselves and others, or to respond to claims or complaints, or to enforce our Terms Of Use or Privacy Policy. Please note that the disclosure of information might include the disclosure of your IP address.</p>

<p>In the event that 4K plans to post any information collected from a User for any purpose other than the activity for which it was collected, then the User shall be provided with prior notification of such posting and given the option to prevent such posting. If a User objects to such use for any reason, he/she may stop that use by e-mail request.</p>

<p><b>6.	Users Under the Age of 13</b></p>

<p>4K generally does not knowingly collect or use any personally identifiable information submitted to the Website from children under the age of 13, unless 4K is offering a sweepstakes or contest open to young participants.  In the event of such a sweepstakes or contest, we collect personal information from children to the extent reasonably necessary for children to participate in the sweepstakes or contest. We will not knowingly contact the child for any reason other than in connection with the sweepstakes or contest that he/she has registered for.  If the child wins the contest or sweepstakes, we will contact his/her parent or legal guardian at the email address provided to us during the registration process by the child. We would then request that the parent provide additional personal information, including postal address, in order for the child to be eligible to collect the prize, if any. We may also notify the child directly one time in the event that he/she wins the sweepstakes or contest. After the sweepstakes or contest is over, and after all of the prizes have been distributed accordingly, we will then delete personal information that we collected from the child, including his/her email address, unless his/her parent or legal guardian instructs us otherwise.  </p>

<p>If you become aware that a child has provided us with personal information outside of a sweepstakes or contest that is open to children under 13, or if you as a parent/legal guardian of a child do not want your child to participate in a sweepstakes or contest, please contact us at privacy@yugioh.com. You may also mail the request to Privacy Policy Coordinator, 4K Media Inc., 53 West 23rd Street, 11th Floor New York, New York 10010. </p>

<p><b>7.	4K Security Policy </b></p>

<p>We strive to keep all personally identifiable information of our Users secure, and we will make reasonable efforts to ensure that any personal information provided by a User is maintained in a secure environment.  However, no data transmission over the internet is 100% safe and secure, and no information storage is impenetrable.  While we strive to protect your personally identifiable information, we cannot guarantee that your information will not be unlawfully accessed or intercepted.
