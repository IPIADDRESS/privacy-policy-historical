			<p>Privacy Policy</p>

<p>Please read this carefully before using the yugioh.com website and/or the Yu-Gi-Oh! Sticker Pack.  By using any part of the yugioh.com website or the Yu-Gi-Oh! Sticker Pack, you are agreeing to this Privacy Policy, and you are consenting to the collection, use and disclosure of your information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</p>

<p>Thank you for visiting yugioh.com ("Website") and/or using the Yu-Gi-Oh! Sticker Pack (“Tools”). As used in this policy, “Platforms” refers to the Website and Tools. Konami Cross Media NY, Inc. ("KCM", "we", “us” or “our”) controls the Platforms and developed them to be an enjoyable experience for visitors and users (“Users”, “you” or “your”) to view Yu-Gi-Oh! content on the Website and to use the stickers from the Tools.  Your privacy is important to us.  </p>

<p>To better protect your privacy, and to help ensure a rewarding online experience for all visitors, we provide this Privacy Policy summarizing our online information collection practices and explaining the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used. We may modify this Privacy Policy periodically, so please check back from time to time to review any updates to our Privacy Policy.  This Privacy Policy applies to information collected from the Platforms only.  When using other websites, tools or platforms owned or controlled by KCM, or any other websites, tools or platforms (even if you arrived at such sites through a link on our Platforms), please review the privacy policy controlling that specific website, tool or platform, as applicable.</p>

<p><strong>1.	Our Information Collection and Uses </strong></p>

<p>You do not need to register with us in order to view most of the pages on this Website or to use the Tools. However, certain portions of our Website and services may not be accessible without your registration or your provision of certain information. From time to time, including for sweepstakes and contests, subscriptions, voluntary online research surveys, content submissions, voting and polling activities, online shopping, Report a Problem, and “refer a friend”, we may ask you for personal identifiers such as your name, email address, mailing address, and telephone number, among other things. Providing such information may be necessary for you to fully enjoy or participate in a particular activity or service offered on our Website. At times, sweepstakes or contests may be open to children under 13.  Please see section 6 below regarding the privacy of children.</p>

<p>When you visit our Website, our servers automatically collect information that describes how you use our Website (such as which pages you visit and how long you visited the pages). Also, we use Google Analytics and receive information such as your browser type, Internet service provider, data that identifies the page you visited prior to and after your visit to our Website, your IP address and location data derived from your IP address. We also may determine what technology is available through your browser so we can serve you the most appropriate version of a page. We use this information to better understand your interests, as well as to understand the preferences of other Users. This helps us improve our website, tailor our offerings, and make Users’ visits to our Website efficient and effective.</p>

<p>When you email us or contact us at any of the addresses and email address provided below, we collect Information you provide, including your name, address or other contact information, the content of the request and the content of the response. </p>

<p>IP Address and Location-Based Information</p>

<p>KCM collects IP addresses for a variety of purposes, including for system administration and for tracking the number of visits to different pages on the Website and to report information to our advertisers.  An IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to the portal through which the User connects with the Internet. When a User accesses our Website, our servers log the Users' IP address. </p>

<p>Cookies</p>

<p>Like many websites, we use “cookies” to make your visit to our Website as seamless and efficient as possible.   Cookies are pieces of information that our Website transfers to a User’s hard drive to recognize your computer and your preferences when you visit our Website again. A cookie also lets the computer remember if a User has registered with us, which allows us to speed up such User's future activities at our Website. Letting the cookie do the record keeping of a User’s preferences saves the User the trouble of entering information over and over again during a single visit, and helps us identify the Website features in which you have the greatest interests.</p>

<p>Web Beacons and Local Shared Objects</p>

<p>Web beacons are small pieces of code placed on a web page to track or monitor the frequency with which Users visit certain areas of our Website, the length of time they spent visiting those areas and other behavioral data. Web beacons also deliver a cookie to a User’s browser. This helps us analyze the popularity of our pages and offerings.</p>

<p>Local Shared Object (LSO) is similar to a cookie and is used in flash applications. The use of LSOs on our Website is limited to storing information in regards to the specific flash rich media application which sets it, such as a media player or a game.</p>

<p><strong>2.	Further Uses and Disclosures of Information</strong></p>

<p>We also use the personal information from or about Users at times for various reasons, including:</p>

<p>•	to deliver information, products, or content requested by Users,

<br>•	to verify access rights to access-restricted services, including for purpose of supporting digital rights management software,
<br>•	to improve our services by providing personalized content, language and location customization, and/or personalized help and instructions, 
<br>•	to provide information concerning compatibility, 
<br>•	to ask Users to participate in surveys about products, services, news and events
<br>•	to provide Users with news, newsletters, updates, targeted advertising, promotions, and special offers,

<br>•	for research and analytical purposes, which may help us tailor our Website and our products and services,
<br>•	to find appropriate advertisers,
<br>•	for other purposes specifically explained at the time we collect the information,
<br>•	to display fan art and User’s submissions on our community/fan pages (see Terms and Conditions and registration pages for fan art and community/fan page submissions). </p>

A User may arrive at one of these sites by clicking on a banner advertisement, or simply by selecting a link on our Website. Our Tools are hosted by third parties or run on the operating systems of third parties, who have their own data collection and privacy policies.</p>

<p>However, we do not endorse or sponsor other websites, platforms or operating systems, or the third parties who assist us in information collection and analysis.

<p><strong>6.	Cross-Border Transfer </strong></p>

<p>KCM may from time to time store and process information from or about you on servers located in countries outside your country of residence, even when we store and process the Information ourselves.

<p><strong>7.	Users Under the Age of 13</strong></p>

<p>KCM generally does not knowingly collect or use any personally identifiable information submitted to the Website from children under the age of 13, unless KCM is offering a sweepstakes or contest open to young participants.  In the event of such a sweepstakes or contest, we collect personal information from children to the extent reasonably necessary for children to participate in the sweepstakes or contest. We will not knowingly contact the child for any reason other than in connection with the sweepstakes or contest that he/she has registered for.  If the child wins the contest or sweepstakes, we will contact his/her parent or legal guardian at the email address provided to us during the registration process by the child. We would then request that the parent provide additional personal information, including postal address, in order for the child to be eligible to collect the prize, if any. We may also notify the child directly one time in the event that he/she wins the sweepstakes or contest. After the sweepstakes or contest is over, and after all of the prizes have been distributed accordingly, we will then delete personal information that we collected from the child, including his/her email address, unless his/her parent or legal guardian instructs us otherwise.  </p>

<p>If you become aware that a child has provided us with personal information outside of a sweepstakes or contest that is open to children under 13, or if you as a parent/legal guardian of a child do not want your child to participate in a sweepstakes or contest, please contact us at privacy@yugioh.com. You may also mail the request to Privacy Policy Coordinator, Konami Cross Media NY, Inc., 53 West 23rd Street, 11th Floor New York, New York 10010. </p>
