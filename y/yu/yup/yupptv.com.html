To enable Global Takeoff to make its sites more responsive to the needs of the  Users, Global Takeoff may use a standard feature of browser software called a  "cookie," to assign each visitor a unique, random number, a type of  user ID that may reside on the Users computer. The cookie doesn't actually  identify the User but identifies only the computer that is used to access the  site. Advertisers and other third parties that provide products or services  through the Global Takeoff site may also assign their own cookies to the Users  browser and such process is beyond Global Takeoffs control. Global Takeoff may  use both session cookies (which are temporary and disappear after the User  closes the browser) and persistent cookies (which remain after the User closes  the browser and which may be used by the Users browser on subsequent visits to  the site). The User may reset the web browser to refuse all cookies or to  indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some features of the Global  Takeoff sites may not function properly if the ability to accept cookies is  disabled.</p>
                                                        <p>Other  Methods. The Global Takeoff web pages may contain electronic images (called  "single-pixel GIFs" or "web beacons") that allow Global  Takeoff and its affiliates to count users who have visited particular pages or  to access certain cookies. These tools and other technologies to may be used to  recognize which pages users visit, and which links they click on. These  features may also be included in email newsletters so that Global Takeoff may learn  which messages have been opened and acted upon. These tools may also enable  Global Takeoff to verify online purchases by the User from the Global Takeoff  sites or from third party sites that have agreed to share such information with  Global Takeoff.</p>
                                                        <p>Browser  Level Information and IP Addresses. The Global Takeoff web servers  automatically collect limited information about the Users computer  configuration, including browser software, the operating system, the website  that referred the User, and the Users Internet Protocol (IP) address browser  language, platform type, number of clicks, domain names, landing pages, pages  viewed, the order of those pages, and the amount of time spent on particular  pages, the date and time of the Users request, and one or more cookies that may  uniquely identify the Users browser.<br>
Third Party. Global Takeoff may permit third-party ad servers or ad networks,  to display advertisements within the Global Takeoff sites. Such third-party ad  servers or ad networks use technology to send, directly to the Users your  browser, the advertisements and links that appear on the Global Takeoff sites  and automatically receive the Users IP address when this happens. The third  party may also use other technologies (such as cookies, JavaScript, or Web  Beacons) to measure the effectiveness of their advertisements and to  personalize the advertising content the User sees. The User should consult the  respective privacy policies of these third-party ad servers or ad networks for  more information on their practices and for instructions on how to opt-out of  certain practices.
