          <p>By using the Global Takeoff our website, the User consents to the collection, use, and storage of User information by Global Takeoff in the manner described in this Privacy Policy and elsewhere on the Global Takeoff sites. This Privacy Policy applies only to information Global Takeoff and the Services collects about the User and does not apply to information about the User collected by Global Takeoffs affiliated providers or third party websites and offerings linked to or otherwise accessible from the Global Takeoff website or the Services. The information collected or received by Global Takeoffs affiliated providers and/ or third parties are subject to their own privacy policies.</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>This Privacy Policy details important information regarding the use and disclosure of User information collected on the Global Takeoff sites to enable the User to make an informed decision about whether to use or continue using the Global Takeoff sites and the Services. It is clarified that any video, image, or other User Content posted at the direction of the User onto the Global Takeoff site and the Services becomes published content and shall not be considered personally identifiable information subject to this Privacy Policy.</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>2. COLLECTION OF INFORMATION</span></p>
          <p>The information gathered by Global Takeoff may either be information that the User voluntarily supplies to Global Takeoff when the User registers or initiates transactions with the Services and/ or information gathered on usage patterns and preferences as the User navigates through Global Takeoffs sites and/ or uses the Services. An agent or affiliate of Global Takeoff may, at times and on being so authorized, collect information on behalf of Global Takeoff. Third party providers featured on or linked to by the Global Takeoff sites, such as vendors of products and services offered through the sites, may be gathering the same kinds of information.</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>User provided Information. To make use of certain features on the Global Takeoff sites and to use the Services and when choosing to participate in various activities on the Global Takeoff sites such as uploading videos, posting messages, entering contests or sweepstakes, taking advantage of promotions, responding to surveys, or subscribing to newsletters or other mailing lists, the User may be required to register and/ or provide certain personally identifiable information as part of the participation/ registration process. Global Takeoff may also ask for information from Users who buy products or services or conduct other transactions on its sites.</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>Any personal information or video content that the User voluntarily discloses online (on discussion boards, in messages and chat areas, etc.) becomes publicly available and can be collected and used by others. The Users account name (not the email address) is displayed to other Users when any videos are uploaded or messages are sent through the Services and other Users can contact the User through messages and comments. Any videos that the User submits to the Global Takeoff sites may be redistributed through the internet and other media channels, and may be viewed by the general public.</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>Cookies. To enable Global Takeoff to make its sites more responsive to the needs of the Users, Global Takeoff may use a standard feature of browser software called a "cookie," to assign each visitor a unique, random number, a type of user ID that may reside on the Users computer. The cookie doesn't actually identify the User but identifies only the computer that is used to access the site. Advertisers and other third parties that provide products or services through the Global Takeoff site may also assign their own cookies to the Users browser and such process is beyond Global Takeoffs control. Global Takeoff may use both session cookies (which are temporary and disappear after the User closes the browser) and persistent cookies (which remain after the User closes the browser and which may be used by the Users browser on subsequent visits to the site). The User may reset the web browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some features of the Global Takeoff sites may not function properly if the ability to accept cookies is disabled.</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>Other Methods. The Global Takeoff web pages may contain electronic images (called "single-pixel GIFs" or "web beacons") that allow Global Takeoff and its affiliates to count users who have visited particular pages or to access certain cookies. These tools and other technologies to may be used to recognize which pages users visit, and which links they click on. These features may also be included in email newsletters so that Global Takeoff may learn which messages have been opened and acted upon. These tools may also enable Global Takeoff to verify online purchases by the User from the Global Takeoff sites or from third party sites that have agreed to share such information with Global Takeoff.</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>Browser Level Information and IP Addresses. The Global Takeoff web servers automatically collect limited information about the Users computer configuration, including browser software, the operating system, the website that referred the User, and the Users Internet Protocol (IP) address browser language, platform type, number of clicks, domain names, landing pages, pages viewed, the order of those pages, and the amount of time spent on particular pages, the date and time of the Users request, and one or more cookies that may uniquely identify the Users browser.</p>
          <p><br>
            Third Party. Global Takeoff may permit third-party ad servers or ad networks, to display advertisements within the Global Takeoff sites. Such third-party ad servers or ad networks use technology to send, directly to the Users your browser, the advertisements and links that appear on the Global Takeoff sites and automatically receive the Users IP address when this happens. The third party may also use other technologies (such as cookies, JavaScript, or Web Beacons) to measure the effectiveness of their advertisements and to personalize the advertising content the User sees. The User should consult the respective privacy policies of these third-party ad servers or ad networks for more information on their practices and for instructions on how to opt-out of certain practices. Global Takeoffs privacy policy does not apply to, and Global Takeoff cannot control the activities of, such other advertisers or web sites.</p>

          <p><span>3. STORAGE OF INFORMATION</span></p>
          <p>Any information provided by the User to Global Takeoff shall be stored and held under generally accepted standards of technology and operational security in order to protect the Users personally identifiable information from loss, misuse, alteration, or destruction. Only authorized personnel are permitted access to the User information and these personnel are required to treat this information as confidential. Despite these precautions, Global Takeoff cannot guarantee that any and all unauthorized access to the Users information will be prevented.</p>

          <p>Any personally identifiable information provided by the User is used to operate, maintain, and provide the User with the features and functionality of the Global Takeoff sites.</p>

          <p>&nbsp;</p>

          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p><span>5. DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION</span></p>
          <p>Affiliates. Global Takeoff may share certain types of information such as account information, diagnostic information, transaction information, and usage information with subsidiaries, affiliated companies, or other businesses or persons for the purpose of processing such information on its behalf. Global Takeoff requires such affiliates to process such information in compliance with this Privacy Policy and shall undertake all reasonable efforts to limit their use of such information and to use other appropriate confidentiality and security measures.</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>Third Parties.

Global Takeoff may share non-personally-identifiable information with interested third-parties to assist them in understanding the usage patterns for certain content, services, advertisements, promotions, and/or functionality on the Global Takeoff sites and the Services. Global Takeoff may use the information to present offers to the User on behalf of business partners and advertisers. These business partners and advertisers may receive aggregate data about groups of Global Takeoff but do not receive information that personally identifies the User</p>
          <p><br>
            Transactions/Requests with Third Parties. The User may choose to use the Services to purchase goods/services from third party providers.

The information may also be required to be disclosed in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of TOU, or as otherwise required or permitted by law.</p>
          <p>Statistical Information. Much of the information Global Takeoff collects is in the form of aggregated statistics, such as the traffic that visits various pages within the Services, the habits and preferences of the audience, etc. Such aggregated information does not include any personally identifiable information and Global Takeoff may use such aggregated information and/ or disclose it to third parties as it deems fit.</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>

Credit card transactions are transmitted to a financial gateway, and Global Takeoff endeavors to protect the security of the Users payment information during transmission by using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology. Global Takeoff will not disclose to third parties the Users your credit card information or other financial data except to the extent necessary to complete the transaction initiated by the User.</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>For e-commerce transactions, Global Takeoff may transmit the Users billing information using encryption which scrambles the credit card number and personal information.

          <p><span>7. SECURITY OF INFORMATION</span></p>

          <p><br>
            Global Takeoff uses commercially reasonable physical, managerial, and technical safeguards to preserve the integrity and security of User information. Global Takeoff, however, ensure or warrant the security of any information transmitted to Global Takeoff by the User and is transmitted at the Users own risk. Once Global Takeoff receives the transmission of information, Global Takeoff makes commercially reasonable efforts to ensure the security of its systems. However, Global Takeoff cannot a guarantee that such information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any physical, technical, or managerial safeguards.</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>

Depending on where the User resides, the User may have a legal right to receive notice of a security breach in writing. To receive a free written notice of a security breach (or to withdraw consent from receiving electronic notice) the User should notify Global Takeoff using the contact form.</p>

          <p><span>8. USER CHOICES</span></p>

If the User opts to remove registration information completely, the User may not be able to continue using certain services that require registration.</p>
          <p><br>

The User is responsible for maintaining the secrecy of the unique password and account information at all times. It is clarified that media files uploaded by Users to the Global Takeoff sites and the Services cannot be removed and remain subject to the TOU.</p>
