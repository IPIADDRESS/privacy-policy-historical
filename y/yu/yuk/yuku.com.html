<div class="ka-section ka-hvr"><h2>Introduction</h2><div class="ka-content"><p>Your privacy is of the utmost importance to Yuku. Our basic principles are:</p>
<ul class="ka-list-items">
  <li>We respect your privacy at Yuku</li>
  <li>You control your personal information,</li>
  <li>We try to limit our collection of personal information as needed to provide and improve our services to you,</li>
  <li>We do not disclose your personal information to third parties unless we need to do so to fulfill your requests,
    you expressly tell us to, we believe we are reasonably compelled to do so, or we are required to by law.</li>
</ul>

<p>Yuku is a network of collaborative publishing communities, user
  profiles and images. You the user and we as Yuku have entered a
  voluntary relationship in which we provide services to you. The data
  you disclose to us makes it possible to deliver the services you
  truly want and ask for.</p>

<p>Yuku's services contain links to other web sites outside Yuku. We
  are not responsible for the privacy policies and/or practices of
  other sites. When linking to another site a user should read the
  privacy policy stated on that site. This privacy policy only governs
  information collected on Yuku.com.</p>

</div></div>

<div class="ka-section ka-hvr"><h2>What Information is Gathered</h2><div class="ka-content"><p>We collect information the information you give us when you become a member of Yuku.</p>
<h3>Site Visitors</h3>
<p>In general, you can browse parts of the site without telling us who
you are or revealing any personal information about yourself. If you
choose to use our services, we may require you to provide contact and
identity information, billing information, and other personal
information as indicated on forms throughout the site. Where possible,
we indicate which fields are required and which fields are
optional. You always have the option to not provide information by
choosing not to use a particular service or feature. Your failure or
unwillingness to provide certain information may mean that a service
or feature will not be available to you.</p>

<h3>Browser and Other Information We May Collect</h3>
<p>
	In addition to the information you choose to provide to us,
	Yuku also collects and stores certain technical and other
	information about the online activities of our users-whether
	or not they are registered-on an aggregated (or collective)
	basis. This may include your IP address, browser type, and
	operating system. We track the number of people who view each
	page, and other site usage data, in order to learn which
	features are the most popular and thereby improve our
	service. We also record statistical information collected on
	our site to better understand our audience. This information
	is recorded as anonymous group statistical information and is
	not connected to any personal information that you provide as
	a member.</p>

<p>
	We, as well as the administrators of each domain, do have the
	ability to view your IP address if you post content within a
	domain on the network. We also collect the information that
	you provide when you make a post on one of our domains so that
	we can archive and display your posts. Please use caution when
	posting material on any domain as your posts may become
	immediately available to the public and may be recorded and
	stored by anyone.</p>

<h3>Registered Members</h3>

<p>
	When you register as a member, we ask you to provide us with a
	user name, password, e-mail address, name, address, birth
	year, and gender. We'll also ask you whether you'd like to
	participate in our business partners' programs.</p>

<h3>Member Emails</h3>

	<p>
	As a registered member, you must choose to receive our system
	emails. System emails are used to contact you in the event of
	changes to our services, terms of use or privacy policies.
	Yuku may use URL tracking in the emails sent to you.  When you
	open such email messages, our system may record the following
	data: the time you viewed the email and the URLs that you
	clicked on from that email. Yuku will also record if your
	email program is capable of receiving HTML-encoded email. URL
	tracking may use cookies.</p>

	<h3>International Visitors</h3>

	<p>
	Like almost every Web site, Yuku may be accessed by an
	international audience. By visiting our Web site and providing
	us with data, you acknowledge and agree that your personal
	information may be processed for the purposes identified in
	this policy. In addition, such data may be stored on servers
	located outside your resident jurisdiction, which may have
	more or less stringent privacy practices than your own. By
	providing us with your data, you consent to the transfer of
	such data.</p>

</div></div>
<div class="ka-section ka-hvr"><h2>How Information is Used</h2><div class="ka-content"><p>
	We understand that you value your personally identifiable
	information. We generally use your personal information to
	render you services and to improve our services.</p>

	<p>
	We may use your personal and registration information to:
	improve our services; troubleshoot problems; measure consumer
	interest in our products and services; inform you about online
	and offline offers, products, services, and updates; customize
	your experience; protect us against error, fraud and other
	criminal activity; enforce our Terms of Use; and as otherwise
	described to you at the time of collection and in this
	policy. At times, we may look across multiple users to
	identify problems, and in particular we may examine your
	personal information to identify users using multiple User IDs
	or aliases.</p>

	<h3>Email Communications from Yuku</h3>

	<p>
	Yuku may send you messages through our messaging system to
	keep you apprised of your membership status, site
	developments, and to inform you of new offers.</p>

	<h3>Third Party Use and Partner Site Email Communications</h3>

	<p>
	In the interest of bringing the highest quality services to
	you "under one roof," Yuku has partnerships with other
	Web-based services. Some of these arrangements include the
	sharing of some of your personal information with our partners
	in order to extend these services to you. We only share
	information when you specifically authorize it.</p>

	<p>
	Yuku, as well as its partner sites, may send you e-mail
	messages on a regular basis to keep you apprised of your
	membership status, site developments, and to inform you of new
	offers. Examples of this include special offers from our
	business partners.  Included in each of these messages are
	simple instructions on how to remove yourself from these
	mailings if you do not wish to receive them in the future.</p>

	<h3>Third Party Sharing to Render Services to You</h3>

	<p>
	We may use third parties to help us perform services, like
	processing credit card information, transmitting emails in
	response to your requests, or other service-related
	functions. If these third parties require access to your
	personally identifiable information in order to provide their
	services, they will be obligated to abide by this privacy
	policy when handling your information. We require third party
	service providers to limit their use of your personal
	information to rendering services for us and you consistent
	with this policy.</p>
</div></div>

<div class="ka-section ka-hvr"><h2>Disclosure of Personal Information</h2><div class="ka-content">	<p>
	Our business is about building a long-term relationship with
	you. To build that trust, we know that as you spend time on
	our site, your personal information must remain within your
	control. Be assured that your personally identifiable
	information, such as your name, address, and email address is
	not sold to others.</p>

	<p>
	There are some situations where we may need to disclose
	information to organizations or entities not described in our
	policy here.  Yuku may be required to disclose your personal
	information: (i) if we believe it is reasonably necessary to
	comply with legal process (such as a court order, subpoena,
	search warrant, etc.) or other legal requirements of any
	governmental authority; (ii) would potentially mitigate our
	liability in an actual or potential lawsuit; (iii) is
	otherwise necessary to protect our rights or property; or that
	of others (iv) is necessary to protect the interest of other
	users of our web site.</p>

	<h3>Merger or Sale of Yuku</h3>

	<p>
	We may also transfer the information in our possession in
	connection with a sale of assets of the company, a sale of the
	company or a merger.</p>

	<h3>Respecting Others' Privacy</h3>

	<p>
	By agreeing to our Terms of Use, you agree that, with respect
	to other users' personal information that you obtain through
	the site or through a Yuku-related communication or
	Yuku-facilitated transaction, Yuku hereby grants to you a
	license to use such information only for: (a) Yuku-related
	personal communications that are not unsolicited commercial
	messages, (b) using services offered through Yuku, and (c) any
	other purpose that a user expressly agrees to after you tell
	them the purpose you would like to use it for. In all cases,
	you must give users an opportunity to remove themselves from
	your systems and a chance to review what information you have
	collected about them. In addition, under no circumstances,
	except as defined in this paragraph, can you disclose personal
	information about another user to any third party without our
	consent and the consent of that user. You agree that other
	users may use your personal information to communicate with
	you in accordance with this paragraph.</p>

	<p>
	Yuku and our members do not tolerate spam. Therefore, without
	limiting the foregoing, you are not licensed to add a Yuku
	member, even one who participates on our domain, to your
	mailing list (email or physical mail) without their express
	consent. To report Yuku related spam to, please contact us
	using our legal form.</p>
</div></div>

<div class="ka-section ka-hvr"><h2>Security of Information</h2><div class="ka-content">	<p>
	Your information is stored on Yuku's servers located in the
	United States. We use procedural and technical safeguards to
	protect your personal information against loss or theft as
	well as unauthorized access and disclosure to protect your
	privacy.</p>

	<p>
	That being said, "perfect security" does not exist
	on the Internet. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the
	Internet can be guaranteed to be absolutely secure. As a
	result, while we strive to protect your personal information,
	Yuku cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information
	you transmit to us or from our online products or services,
	and you do so at your own risk. Once we receive your
	transmission, we make our best effort to ensure the security
	of your information on our systems.</p>

	<p>
	Please note that we cannot guarantee the security of member
	account information. Unauthorized entry or use, hardware or
	software failure, and other factors may compromise the
	security of member information at any time. Therefore,
	although we use industry standard practices to protect your
	privacy, we do not promise, and you should not expect, that
	your personal information or private communications will
	always remain private.</p>

	<p>
	If Yuku learns of a security systems breach we may attempt to
	notify you electronically so that you can take appropriate
	protective steps. By using this web site or providing personal
	information to us you agree that we can communicate with you
	electronically regarding security, privacy and administrative
	issues relating to your use of this site. Yuku may post a
	notice on our web site if a security breach occurs. If this
	happens, you will need a web browser enabling you to view the
	Yuku.com web site. Yuku may also send an email to you at the
	email address you have provided to us in these
	circumstances. Depending on where you live, you may have a
	legal right to receive notice of a security breach in
	writing. To receive free written notice of a security breach
	(or to withdraw your consent from receiving electronic notice)
	you should
	<a href="http://www.yuku.com/help/ticket">notify us</a>.</p>

	<h3>Cookies, Web Beacons and Personalization</h3>
	<p>
	"Cookies" are small files placed on your hard drive
	that assist us in providing our services. We offer certain
	features that are only available through the use of a
	"cookie". We also use cookies to allow you to enter
	your password less frequently during a session. Cookies can
	also help us provide information that is targeted to your
	interests.</p>

	<p>
	Yuku uses cookies to store visitors' preferences and to record
	session information for purposes including: ensuring that
	visitors are not repeatedly offered the same advertisements;
	to customize advertising and Web page content based on browser
	type and user profile information; to estimate and report our
	total audience size and traffic; and to conduct research to
	improve our content and services. We do not link the
	information we store in cookies to any personally identifiable
	information you submit while on our site. You may be able to
	configure your browser to accept or reject all or some
	cookies, or notify you when a cookie is set-each browser is
	different, so check the "Help" menu of your browser to learn
	how to change your cookie preferences-however, you must enable
	cookies from Yuku in order to use most functions on the
	site.</p>

	<p>
	Please note that we permit third party advertisers who present
	advertisements on some of our pages to set and access their
	cookies on your computer. Advertisers' use of cookies is
	subject to their own privacy policies, not the Yuku Privacy
	Policy. You can choose not to receive tailored online advertising 
	on other websites, based on your travel-related searches on this 
	website, by clicking <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/">here</a>.</p>

	<p>
	Yuku uses web beacons to research certain usage and activities
	on its and our website. The information collected through
	these web beacons is used to find out more about our users;
	for more accurate reporting; and to improve the effectiveness
	of our marketing. No personally identifiable information about
	you is shared by Yuku as a result of this research.</p>

	<p>
	You agree that we may use your personal information to contact
	you and deliver information to you that, in some cases, are
	targeted to your interests, such as targeted banner
	advertisements, administrative notices, product offerings, and
	communications relevant to your use of the Site. By accepting
	the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, you expressly agree to
	receive this information.</p>

	<p>
	Not only do you have the opportunity to post content on any of
	our public Yuku domains, but you also have the opportunity to
	create your own Profiles and Domain and tailor it to your own
	special interests. In order to create a community, you need to
	be registered as a member to do these things. Once you've
	registered, you can follow our instructions on how to create
	your Profiles and Domain and customize them to match your
	preferences. This means you get to decide how to structure
	your Profiles, Domain, what design you'll use, and more. If
	you no longer wish to operate your Yuku domain, you can delete
	your content and turn off the "allow replies" feature.</p>

</div></div>

<div class="ka-section ka-hvr"><h2>Children</h2><div class="ka-content">
	<p>
	We at Yuku believe it essential that parents are involved in
	their children's online experiences. That is why, in
	compliance with federal law, we do not knowingly collect
	personal information of any kind from anyone under the age of
	13. If we become aware of a user under the age of 13 providing
	information on our site, we will terminate their account and
	purge our databases of all information provided by that
	user.</p>
</div></div>

<div class="ka-section ka-hvr"><h2>Access to and Changing Information</h2><div class="ka-content">	<p>
	Once you become a member of Yuku, your personal information is
	stored in the site. You may access or change your information
	at any time.</p>
</div></div>

<div class="ka-section ka-hvr"><h2>Notice of Modifications</h2><div class="ka-content">	<p>
	In the future, Yuku may update and revise its privacy
	policy. We will provide conspicuous notice on our website if
	we decide to change our privacy policy in a way that would be
	materially less restrictive than this policy. At that time,
	you will have the opportunity to decide whether or not you
	would like Yuku to apply the new privacy policy to your
	personal information or to opt out of the new policy. If you
	continue to use Yuku, you will be accepting the new
	policies. If you decide to opt out of the new policy, you will
	no longer be able to participate as a member. The effective
	date of this policy is Januaary 4, 2006.</p>

	<p>
	Ultimately, you are solely responsible for maintaining the
	secrecy of your passwords and/or any account
	information. Please be careful and responsible whenever you're
	online. The few employees who have access to personal data are
	trained to comply with the above privacy policy and made aware
	of any updates or modifications.</p>
