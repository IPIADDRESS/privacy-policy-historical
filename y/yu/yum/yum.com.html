If as a result of a business transition, your personally identifiable information will be used in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection, you will be give the choice to opt–out.</p>
<p><a name="childrenprivacy"><strong>9. How does Company handle children’s privacy online?</strong></a><br>
Company adheres to the federal privacy protection standards articulated in the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA).</p>

<p>On the sections of the site directed towards children, Company does not collect Personal Information online from children under 13 without their parent’s consent except to respond to e–mail, as described below.  Company may collect information that is not Personal Information in special, limited circumstances, as described below.  If a child is under 13 and wants to use the children’s sites with special activities, like scavenger hunts, personalized pages or clubs, Company might ask the child to “register” by giving Us a first name and his⁄her state of residence. When asking for a child’s first name, the child is encouraged to use a “screen name” (not his⁄her real name) that only the child knows. Sometimes the child will be asked to make up a special password so that only they can see their customized areas on the site.</p>

<p>With parent’s verifiable consent, Company may collect personal information from a child such as an e–mail address when the information is necessary for a particular activity.  A Parent can provide verifiable consent by printing a permission form that is posted to this Site, signing and returning it to the Webmaster by either (1) mail to 1441 Gardiner Lane, Louisville, Kentucky 40213, Attn: Webmaster Children’s Online Privacy Act or (2) fax to 502–874–2112.  When we ask for parental permission, we will tell the parents what we will do with the information his⁄her child provides us, and we will tell parents how they can review their child’s information and ask us to delete the information.  We do not keep parents’ (or children’s) e–mail address unless parents tell us it is okay.  Usually the child is asked for his⁄her parent’s email in order to get parental permission for a child to provide any Personal Information. When We ask for parental permission, We will tell the parents what We will do with the information his⁄her child provides Us, and We will tell parents how they can review their child’s information and ask Us to delete the information. We do not keep parents’ (or children’s) e–mail address unless parents tell Us it is okay.</p>

<p>Company might collect some information from a child under 13 without the parent’s consent, but only in the following special cases: If a child under 13 sends a request to Us, We keep their e–mail address for long enough to respond to them. Company deletes this information from its system after the child’s question is answered. Company’s webmaster is the only person who receives, collects or maintains children’s submitted information, even temporarily, through the Site. The webmaster will not use such information for any purpose, including marketing back to the child. The webmaster will not disclose information collected from children to third parties.</p>

<p>Occasionally, Company has special site activities or promotions like sweepstakes or contests which are open to children even if they are under 13. In these activities, Company is not allowed to ask for more information from a child other than what is necessary for a child to participate in the activity. For instance, Company might ask for a parent’s email address so Company can request information on how to send the child any prizes won or to tell a parent when his⁄her child has won a prize.</p>

<p>In the last two situations when Company asks for information without parental consent, Company requires the child to give his⁄her parent’s e–mail address, so the parent is notified that their child registered in a promotion or for a service. Any information a child provides in the above special circumstances will be deleted from the database once the promotion, program or activity is concluded, and after any legally required period for keeping such information is complete. Company also might collect contact information where it is necessary to protect a child’s safety.</p>

<p>A parent can always ask to review the information his⁄her child has submitted by sending an e–mail to <a href="mailto: webmaster@yum.com"><strong>webmaster@yum.com</strong></a> or a written request addressed to Company, 1441 Gardiner Lane, Louisville, Kentucky 40213, Attention: Webmaster, Children’s Online Privacy Act – Information Request, or by calling the webmaster at 502–874–8300. Requests must include the screen name of the child, the child’s password and any other information which will allow Company to verify that the requester is the parent of the child whose information is requested. A parent can ask to delete a child’s information at any time and a parent can ask that Company not collect any more personal information from his⁄her child, by sending an e–mail at <a href="mailto: webmaster@yum.com"><strong>webmaster@yum.com</strong></a> or a written request addressed to Company 1441 Gardiner Lane, Louisville, Kentucky 40213, Attention: Webmaster, Children’s Online Privacy Act – Delete Request or by calling the webmaster at 502–874–8300.</p>


<p><a name="contact"><strong>10. How do I contact the Company?</strong></a><br>
If you have any further questions concerning the Company’s Privacy Policy and the use of your Personal Information, please contact <a href="mailto: webmaster@yum.com"><strong>webmaster@yum.com</strong></a>.</p>
