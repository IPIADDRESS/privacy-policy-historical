            <p><strong>National Australia Bank Group Websites Privacy and Security
              Policy<br>
              <br>
              </strong>We have developed this policy so that you may feel confident
              about the privacy and security of your personal information.</p>
            <p>Countries in the European Economic Area (EEA) are required to have
              a similar standard of protection of personal data. This is not always
              the case outside that area. We do sometimes transfer data outside
              the EEA and before doing so take steps to ensure that there is adequate
              protection, as required by relevant Data Protection legislation.<br>
            </p>
            <p><strong>Use of Personal Information</strong><br><br>
              You don't need to register to access most of our websites and where you do not register personal information about you will not be collected by us.</p>
            <p>If you register for our internet banking services, any details you provide may be stored for use on future visits, as we do not want you to give us any information more than once. The details you give us may be combined with information about your use of the Yorkshire Bank PLC website and information from other of our records in order to provide you with online services you request. </p>
            <p>If you register for our internet banking services, we will treat you as having consented to our using your personal data in the manner described in this Policy. If you do not register, the personal data we collect from you will be limited to that which you give us voluntarily in order to process your request and we will use that data only to fulfil that request.</p>
            <p> We currently may hold personal and financial information about
              you and may obtain or receive such information about you in the
              future. Such information may include the identity of suppliers of
              goods and services to you and the general nature of such goods and
              services and may also include sensitive personal data such as information
              relating to your health, racial, or ethnic origin, sexual life,
              criminal convictions or proceedings where we need to hold such data
              for the purposes of the product or services we provide to you or
              it is in the normal course of business to do so. Information about
              you may be contained in one or more databases which are used by
              various members of the Group. <br>
              <br>
              The information we process about you will be obtained from various
              sources, eg., directly from you, from your dealings with any member
              of the Group including from the transactions and operation of your
              accounts and services, from other organisations including credit
              reference and fraud protection agencies and, from persons who know
              you including joint account holders and persons with whom you are
              financially linked.<br>
              <br>
              For our internal operational reasons we may link information concerning
              your accounts with us to information concerning other products and
              services we provide to you. We may also link your information to
              that of other individuals with whom you are financially associated.<br>
              <br>
              When you request a service or product from us we will use the details
              you provide to us and details we may already hold about you, such
              as how you manage your accounts with us to assist us in our assessment
              process.<br>
              <br>
              We use a process known as Credit Scoring and may use other automated
              decision making processes to assist in the assessment of applications
              and to make other decisions during your relationship with us. Declined
              applications and decisions may also be reviewed manually.<br>
              <br>
              	We will use your information to assess the suitability of our products and services for you including the making of credit decisions about you which may involve credit scoring, for market purposes and analysis, to develop, improve and market our products and services generally, to understand your purchasing preferences, to operate and administer the products and services we provide you, for fraud prevention, for debt recovery and for marketing purposes.  Where a third party has introduced your custom to the Group we may pass back to the third party the necessary information to enable administration of any payment or settlement.<br>
              <br>
              In the provision to you of products and services involving insurance
              we are required to pass your details to insurers. Information you
              provide in connection with any claims made under the insurance may
              be recorded on to a register of claims through which insurers share
              information to prevent fraudulent claims. A list of participants
              and the register operator is available from the insurers.<br>
              <br>
              <strong>Email addresses</strong> </p>
            <p>We respect the privacy of personal email accounts and we store your email addresses just as securely as other personal information. We will not send you unwanted email messages or junk mail, and your details will not be passed to any organisation outside the Group for marketing purposes without your explicit permission. <br>
              <br>
              However, we may use email in response to enquiries you make about
              our services or service issues. <br>
            </p>
            <p><strong>Disclosure of information</strong> </p>
            <p>We take all reasonable care to prevent any unauthorised access
              to your personal data. </p>
            <p>We sometimes use other companies to provide some of our services
              or to provide services to us. To enable them to do this, we may
              need to let them process your personal information. Our staff and
              those working for our agents or contractors have a responsibility
              to keep your information confidential and are only allowed to use
              it to offer products and services on our behalf.</p>
            <p>We may disclose information, in response to properly made requests, for the purpose of the prevention and detection of crime, and the apprehension or prosecution of offenders. We may also disclose information for the purpose of safeguarding national security. We also disclose information when required to do so by law, for example under a Court Order, or in response to properly made demands under powers contained in legislation.</p>
            <p>We subscribe to the <a href="/about/169.php" class="link">Mortgage Code</a>, the <a href="/about/169.php" class="link">Banking Code</a> and the <a href="/business/contacts.php" class="link">Business Banking Code</a>.  In order to comply with such codes or in accordance with our duties to regulators, we may provide authorised persons with access to our records (which may include information about you) for reporting, auditing and compliance purposes.<br>
            </p>
            <p><strong>Right of access to your information</strong> </p>
            <p>If you want to know exactly what personal information Yorkshire Bank PLC holds on you, you can obtain it. If it transpires that the information held is inaccurate, we will make the necessary amendments and confirm to you that these have been made. Please write to the Data Protection Officer at the registered office (for the time being 20 Merrion Way, Leeds LS2 8NZ) enclosing a cheque for the administration fee of £10 made payable to Yorkshire Bank PLC.</p>
            <p><strong>How we protect your data</strong></p>
            <p>When you register details and are logged into our internet banking
              we use a secure server. Any data you give us is encrypted using
              a 'Secure Socket Layer' (SSL) session. SSL is an industry standard
              and is one of the best ways to ensure Internet messages are not
              intercepted. You should be aware, however, that some older browsers
              cannot use SSL. If your browser does not support 128 bit encryption
              (or higher) you will not be able to log into or use our internet
              banking service.</p>
            <p>Apart from things we do to protect you there are things that you can also do to protect yourself while using our Internet Banking service.  For more information regarding security <a href="/ibank/security.php" class="link">click here</a>.</p>
