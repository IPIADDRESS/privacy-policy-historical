In this Privacy Policy, âPersonal Informationâ refers to any information that can reasonably be used to identify, contact or locate you. Examples of Personal Information may include, without limitation, your name, your precise location, your credit card number, your email address, your mailing address, and your phone number.&nbsp; If you are a California resident, Personal Information may also include other information about or relating to you, such as Device IDs and uniquely assigned alpha-numeric identifiers, as provided in the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, Civil Code Â§1798.100 et seq. (CCPA) and applicable regulations thereunder</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Personal Information may be collected on, through or in connection with any of the Prodege Sites and Features and/or our Services</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are a California resident, starting January 1, 2020, you have a right to receive notice of our collection of consumer âpersonal informationâ </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(as defined in the CCPA), which provides information regarding our collection of consumer âpersonal informationâ of California residents, including </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">a description of the categories of âpersonal informationâ that we collect, along with the business or commercial purpose for such use</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. We encourage California residents to visit the â<a href="https://www.prodege.com/privacy-policy/#toc-17">Your California Privacy Rights</a>â section </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">of this Privacy Policy (below) for additional information.&nbsp;</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Generally, we collect Personal Information when you provide it to us by visiting the Prodege Sites and Features and/or using our Services. This may include registering for any account with us, filling out surveys, participating in our Card Linked Offer Programs, joining a mailing list, uploading receipts, corresponding with us, entering one of our sweepstakes or contests, choosing to submit testimonials, stories, photos or the like, or otherwise volunteering or providing information about yourself.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We use your Personal Information and other information we collect about you in order to (i) provide you with our Services, (ii) to improve the Prodege Sites and Features, (iii) to provide advertising, content, surveys, location-based deals, special offers, promotions and rewards (collectively âOffersâ), and (iv) for other marketing, administrative and operational purposes (collectively, our âBusiness Purposesâ). The information we collect may be used by itself, aggregated, or combined with unique identifiers (such as Prodege-assigned identifiers, Device IDs, etc), and shared with (x) our parent companies, subsidiaries, trusted agents and affiliated Services that we own and/or operate (â</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Affiliates</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">â) and (y) our vendors, advertisers, merchants, survey partners, joint business venturers and other trusted service providers (collectively, â</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trusted </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Service Providersâ</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">), for purposes related to our business, including, without limitation, advertising, attribution, measurement of campaigns, analytics and research.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you donât provide us with your Personal Information, we will generally be unable to provide you with our Services and you will be unable to use the Prodege Sites and Features. You can opt-out of data collection by changing the settings on your Device or by <a href="https://www.prodege.com/privacy-policy/#toc-18">Contacting Us </a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(but key services and features may lose functionality as a result). </span></div><a class="legal__contents-anchor-link" href="#toc-2">Other User Information We Collect</a><div class="legal__accordion"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to the information referenced above, we also collect other information when you visit the Prodege Sites and Features, use our Services, or when we conduct business transactions with our Affiliates and Trusted Service Providers. In some jurisdictions, this information may be considered personally identifiable. We collect this information to provide you with personalized </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Offers when reasonably possible</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and available and to improve the overall quality of your experience with the Prodege Sites and Features and our Services.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, we collect or may collect your IP address, Device ID, referrer data, and browser and platform type. You do not have to register on any of our Services before we can collect this information. We may assign a unique identification number to your activity and/or registration and link additional data to that number, such as the date and time you visited, the information you provide, and the links you choose to click. Like most standard website servers, we use log files to collect and store this user information. We may analyze and use this information for a variety of purposes, including operating and improving the Prodege Sites and Features or our Services, collecting further information about and learning from user behavior and trends, measuring the effectiveness of our, our Affiliates and our Trusted Service Providerâs marketing campaigns, and gathering demographic information. Furthermore, we may combine or link information we collect from or about you offline with information we collect from or about you online through the Prodege Sites and Features or your use of our Services.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">You may choose to install and use optional Internet browser extensions, add-ons or similar plug-in software and technologies (the âExtensionsâ) which may collect and use your information in a variety of ways.

Our Affiliates and Trusted Service Providers use this information to recognize you across different channels and platforms, including but not limited to, computers, mobile devices, and Smart TVs, over time for advertising, analytics, attribution, and reporting purposes. For example, our Trusted Service Providers may deliver an advertisement to you in your web browser based on a purchase you made in a physical retail store, or they may send a personalized marketing email to you based on the fact that you visited a particular website.

By using the Prodege Sites and Features and our Services, you consent to this transfer of your personal data to any server used by the Company or its service providers from time to time.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are not a resident of the United States or Canada, please consult the international version of our Privacy Policy (https://www.prodege.com/privacy-policy-intl/) and be aware that data protection laws in the United States and Canada (as well as the legal procedures for courts, governmental authorities, and parties in civil litigation to obtain access to our user data) may differ substantially from the laws and procedures in your country of residence.</span>

Once per calendar year California residents may request that the business provide a list of companies with which it shares such Personal Information for the third partiesâ or affiliatesâ direct marketing purposes, and a list of the categories of such Personal Information that the business shares.&nbsp; California residents may request further information about our compliance with this law by emailing </span><a href="mailto:CaliforniaPrivacy@Prodege.com"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CaliforniaPrivacy@Prodege.com</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.

<span style="font-weight: 400;">(3)&nbsp; </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Right to Opt-Out of the Sale of Personal Information</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. California residents have the right to opt-out of the sale of their Personal Information. Under the CCPA, the âsaleâ of Personal Information broadly includes any communication of Personal Information to any business that is deemed to be a âthird partyâ (as defined in the CCPA) for monetary or other valuable consideration, subject to certain exceptions and limitations.&nbsp; For more information, please consult our Notice of Right to Opt Out of the Sale of Info (</span><a href="https://www.prodege.com/do-not-sell/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.prodege.com/do-not-sell/</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">).</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">(4) </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Authorized Agent</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&nbsp; California residents may</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> use an authorized agent to exercise certain privacy-related requests and rights on their behalf.&nbsp; The authorized agentâs exercise or request on your behalf sent by mail shall include a power of attorney or a notarized statement properly signed by you appointing such authorized agent for such purpose.&nbsp; If your authorized agent submits the exercise or request online via the link below, a copy of the power of attorney or the original notarized statement shall be mailed to the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">following address: Prodege, LLC, P.O. Box 70, Manhattan Beach, CA 90267; Attention: Privacy, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">within five (5) days after submitting such online request, or we may in our discretion otherwise verify the agentâs authority to our reasonable satisfaction.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">(5) </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Notice of Financial Incentive</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. California residents have the right to receive notice of financial incentives provided to them by a business. Please consult our Notice of Financial Incentive (</span><a href="https://www.prodege.com/financial-incentives-notice/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.prodege.com/financial-incentives-notice/</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">) which provides information regarding financial incentives or âprice or service differencesâ that Prodege may provide in exchange for your Personal Information.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">(6) </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Right to Non-Discrimination for the Exercise of a Consumerâs Privacy Rights</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.

Prodege offers California consumers (or their authorized agent) two (2) ways to submit requests concerning their California privacy rights under the CCPA: (i) by completing the online form located here: </span><a href="http://prodege.com/PrivacyRequests"><span style="font-weight: 400;">http://prodege.com/PrivacyRequests</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or (b) by mailing your request to the following address: Prodege, LLC, P.O. Box 70, Manhattan Beach, CA 90267; Attention: Privacy.&nbsp; Prodege will review all properly-submitted requests and respond in a timely manner in accordance with the CCPA and applicable regulations thereunder.

<b>TO ENSURE THAT YOUR CCPA REQUESTS ARE EFFECTIVE AND RESPONDED TO IN A TIMELY MANNER, YOU MUST USE THE WEBFORM OR MAILING ADDRESS SPECIFIED IN THIS SECTION.&nbsp; &nbsp; PRIVACY REQUESTS SENT TO US BY ANY OTHER METHOD OF COMMUNICATION WILL NOT BE VALID AND MAY NOT BE RECEIVED BY OUR PERSONNEL AS WE CANNOT MONITOR ALL CHANNELS OF COMMUNICATION NOR CAN WE VERIFY THE AUTHENTICITY OF PRIVACY REQUESTS SENT VIA ANY OTHER CHANNELS.</b>

In this Privacy Policy, âPersonal Informationâ refers to any information that can reasonably be used to identify, contact or locate you. Examples of Personal Information may include, without limitation, your name, your precise location, your credit card number, your email address, your mailing address, and your phone number.&nbsp; If you are a California resident, Personal Information may also include other information about or relating to you, such as Device IDs and uniquely assigned alpha-numeric identifiers, as provided in the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, Civil Code Â§1798.100 et seq.

Personal Information may be collected on, through or in connection with any of the Prodege Sites and Features and/or our Services</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are a California resident, starting January 1, 2020, you have a right to receive notice of our collection of consumer âpersonal informationâ </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(as defined in the CCPA), which provides information regarding our collection of consumer âpersonal informationâ of California residents, including </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">a description of the categories of âpersonal informationâ that we collect, along with the business or commercial purpose for such use</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you donât provide us with your Personal Information, we will generally be unable to provide you with our Services and you will be unable to use the Prodege Sites and Features. You can opt-out of data collection by changing the settings on your Device or by <a href="https://www.prodege.com/privacy-policy/#toc-18">Contacting Us </a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">(but key services and features may lose functionality as a result). </span></p>
<h3 id="toc-2">Other User Information We Collect</h3><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to the information referenced above, we also collect other information when you visit the Prodege Sites and Features, use our Services, or when we conduct business transactions with our Affiliates and Trusted Service Providers. In some jurisdictions, this information may be considered personally identifiable. We collect this information to provide you with personalized </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Offers when reasonably possible</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and available and to improve the overall quality of your experience with the Prodege Sites and Features and our Services.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, we collect or may collect your IP address, Device ID, referrer data, and browser and platform type. You do not have to register on any of our Services before we can collect this information. We may assign a unique identification number to your activity and/or registration and link additional data to that number, such as the date and time you visited, the information you provide, and the links you choose to click. Like most standard website servers, we use log files to collect and store this user information. We may analyze and use this information for a variety of purposes, including operating and improving the Prodege Sites and Features or our Services, collecting further information about and learning from user behavior and trends, measuring the effectiveness of our, our Affiliates and our Trusted Service Providerâs marketing campaigns, and gathering demographic information. Furthermore, we may combine or link information we collect from or about you offline with information we collect from or about you online through the Prodege Sites and Features or your use of our Services.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You may choose to install and use optional Internet browser extensions, add-ons or similar plug-in software and technologies (the âExtensionsâ) which may collect and use your information in a variety of ways. For example, the Swagbucks Swagbutton, MyPoints Score!, Savings Button and ySense Addon are Extensions that allow you to shop directly with our merchant partners and earn rewards.&nbsp; The Extensions also provide other features and access to Offers which may include cash-back offers to take surveys, watch videos, complete tasks, monitor your earnings, customize your account information and other activities. If you install an Extension, we will automatically track the websites you visit to allow us to offer you the aforementioned features and to correlate your browser history, merchant visits and Prodege Sites and Features engagements to provide better services and Offers to you. To assist in rewarding you for purchases made through our shopping-rewards features, third-party affiliate or Ad Network cookies (as defined below) may be placed on your Device when you install and use an Extension or when you click on an affiliate or Ad Network link within a shopping-rewards feature. Your browsing activity on our merchant partnersâ websites (and other websites you visit) will be tracked by cookies, Extensions or other Prodege Sites and Features having such tracking capabilities.&nbsp; This information may be shared with our Trusted Service Providers in order to provide you with Offers and for our Business Purposes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We may also use GPS or similar geo-location technology to determine the geo-coordinates of where you or your Device are located. As noted in the section on âSharingâ below, we may use and share your location information with our Trusted Service Providers in order to provide you with Offers and for Business Purposes, based on your location.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition, our mobile applications may collect, among other things, certain information automatically, including, but not limited to the type of mobile Device you use, your mobile Deviceâs unique Device identifier (UDID), the IP address of your mobile Device, your mobile operating system, the type of mobile Internet browsers you use, and information about the way you use the mobile application.</span></p>
<h3 id="toc-3">Information We Receive from Third Parties</h3><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We may also receive and supplement the information we directly collect from or about you with information from third parties, such as our Trusted Service Providers. If you are on a third party website or service and you opt-in to receive information from us, the third party may forward to us your email address and other information about you so that we may contact you as requested. In addition, we may receive information from our Trusted Service Providers, including, without limitation, advertisers, merchant and/or survey partners to ensure that you properly receive any earned rewards and/or for the Business Purposes. We may also supplement and combine the information we collect about you with outside records from third parties in order to enhance our ability to provide you with Offers and for Business Purposes.</span></p>
<h3 id="toc-4">Friend Referrals</h3><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We may provide you with an opportunity to invite your friends, family and acquaintances (âFriendsâ) to use various Prodege Sites and Features. If you elect to use our referral service for informing a Friend about any of the Prodege Sites and Features, you will provide us with your Friendâs name and email address. Using our referral service permits us to automatically send the Friend one or more emails or other communications, on your behalf, inviting them to visit or register for the Prodege Sites and Features (which invite may include additional subsequent reminders and communications). You warrant and represent that you have your Friendâs consent to provide us with his or her information for this purpose, and that you will not give us referral information for any person not permitted to use the Prodege Sites and Features, including, without limitation a child under the age of 13, a person whose account has previously been suspended or deactivated, a person who unsubscribed from receiving communication from the applicable Prodege Service, or a person residing or located in a territory where use of the Prodege Sites and Features is not authorized.</span></p>
<h3 id="toc-5">Community Features and User Content</h3><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Prodege Sites and Features may provide you the opportunity to participate in, make available, and/or post text (e.g. questions, comments, and suggestions), images, audio, videos, or other content (collectively, âUser Contentâ) publicly through our blogs, chat rooms, forums, interactive features, public-facing member profile, third-party social networking services or other communication functionality (âCommunity Featuresâ). Please note that certain information, such as your username, Service start date, earning preferences, total rewards earned, profile picture and other profile information we believe will help motivate you and others to participate in our program may be publicly displayed on the Prodege Sites and Features along with User Content. User Content may also contain metadata, which may contain information about or relating to you, that we may also collect, share and use.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anything posted through Community Features is publicly available.&nbsp; This means that others will have access to that User Content and may use it or share it with third parties; this is beyond our control. If you choose to voluntarily disclose Personal Information in the User Content and/or on the Community Features, that information will be considered publicly available information as well.&nbsp; The protections of this Privacy Policy will not apply to publicly available information.

For example, third-party tracking technologies may analyze restaurant visit trends to better serve customersâ needs or your mobile application install history to provide you Offers that may be of interest. See instructions to limit or disable such tracking in this section below; but be aware that limiting such tracking will affect some device or mobile application functionality.</span></p>

If we decide to change this Privacy Policy, we will provide notice of such changes by sending you an administrative email and/or posting those changes in places on the Prodege Sites and Features deemed appropriate by us so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances it may be shared with others.

If you do not agree to the changes, please discontinue your use of such Prodege Sites and Features and our Services. To the extent that an arbitrator or court of applicable jurisdiction determines that applying any changes to this Privacy Policy to any prior events or circumstances would render this an illusory or unenforceable contract, such changes shall be applicable on a prospective basis only, with respect to events or circumstances occurring after the date of such changes, to the extent necessary to avoid this Privacy Policy being deemed illusory or unenforceable. In any event, if any Personal Information was previously submitted to or collected by us pursuant to an earlier version of this Privacy Policy that required a certain notice period prior to any changes being effective, any changes under this Privacy Policy will not be effective as to you or such previously-collected Personal Information until the previously-specified notice period has passed after the date of this Privacy Policy.</span></p>

Box 70, Manhattan Beach, CA 90267; Attention: Privacy, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">within five (5) days after submitting such online request, or we may in our discretion otherwise verify the agentâs authority to our reasonable satisfaction.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;</span></p>
