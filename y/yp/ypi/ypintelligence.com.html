    <div id="content_left" class="blank_left clearfix">
      <p>This privacy policy applies to your use of the
        ypintelligence        websites located  at www.
        ypintelligence        .com, but not does apply to any  third party sites that may be linked to them, or any relationships you  may have with the business listed on the
        ypintelligence        Sites.</p>
      <p>The terms "<strong>we</strong>", "<strong>us</strong>", and "<strong>
        ypintelligence        </strong>" refer to
        ypintelligence        Inc. The terms "<strong>you</strong>" and "<strong>your</strong>" refer to you, as a user of any of the
        ypintelligence        Sites. The term "<strong>personal information</strong>"  means information that you provide to us which personally identifies  you to be contacted or identified, such as your name, phone number,  email address, and any other data that is tied to such information.</p>
      <p>BY  USING THE
        upperdomain        SITES, YOU AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS  PRIVACY POLICY. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH THESE TERMS, PLEASE DO NOT USE  THE
        upperdomain        SITES.</p>
      <h3>I. Information We Collect and How We Use It</h3>
      <p>We  use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that the collection of  personal information is limited to that which is necessary to fulfill  the purposes identified below. If we use your information in a manner  different than the purpose for which it is collected, then we will ask  you for your consent prior to such use.</p>
      <p><em>Account information.</em> If you create an account to take advantage of the full range of  services offered on the
        ypintelligence        Sites, we ask for and record personal  information such as your name and email address. We use your email  address to send you updates and news, and contact you on behalf of  other users (such as other users who send you compliments, personal  messages, or favorite reviews). You may choose not to receive e-mail of  this type by accessing the "Account" tab on the
        ypintelligence        Sites and updating  your notification settings.</p>
      <p><em>Submissions.</em> We store  and may publicly display your submissions in order to provide the  services that we offer. When we display your submissions, we do so  together with your account name (first name and last initial). The term  "<strong>submissions</strong>" refers to the information that you submit or post  to the
        ypintelligence        Sites for public display, such as business ratings,  reviews, photos, compliments, and the information that you display as  part of your account profile.</p>
      <p><em>Feedback.</em> If you  contact us to provide feedback, register a complaint, or ask a  question, we will record any personal information and other content  that you provide in your communication so that we can effectively  respond to your communication.</p>
      <p><em>Personal messaging.</em> In order to allow you to send and receive personal messages to other  registered users of the
        ypintelligence        Sites, we record the messages that you  send and receive using the
        ypintelligence        Sites' personal messaging feature.</p>
      <p><em>Activity.</em> We record information relating to your use of the
        ypintelligence        Sites, such as  the searches you undertake, the pages you view, your browser type, IP  address, requested URL, referring URL, and timestamp information. We  use this type of information to administer the
        ypintelligence        Sites and provide  the highest possible level of service to you. We also use this  information in the aggregate to perform statistical analyses of user  behavior and characteristics in order to measure interest in and use of  the various areas of the
        ypintelligence        Sites. You cannot be identified from this  aggregate information. </p>
      <p><em>Cookies.</em> We send cookies to your computer in order to uniquely indentify your browser and improve the quality of our service. The term "<strong>cookies</strong>"  refers to small pieces of information that a website sends to your  computer's hard drive while you are viewing the site. We may use both  session cookies (which expire once you close your browser) and  persistent cookies (which stay on your computer until you delete them).  Persistent cookies can be removed by following your browser help file  directions. If you choose to disable cookies, some areas of the
        ypintelligence        Sites may not work properly or at all.</p>
      <p><em>Enforcement.</em> We may use the information we collect in connection with your use of  the
        ypintelligence        Sites (including your personal information) in order to  investigate, enforce, and apply our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy.</p>
      <h3>II. Transfer of Information</h3>
      <p>We  may distribute your submissions to third parties, as permitted pursuant  to our Terms of Service. The third parties may in turn publicly display  or publish your submissions in connection with their own websites and  media platforms. When we distribute your submissions to third parties,  we typically include your account name (but not your personal  information unless you include your personal information in your  submissions).</p>
      <p>We may share your personal information with  third parties to provide you with services that we offer through the
        ypintelligence        Sites, conduct quality assurance testing, facilitate creation of  accounts, provide technical and customer support, or provide specific  services, such as synchronization of your contacts with other software  applications, in accordance with your instructions. These third parties  are required not to use your personal information other than to provide  the services requested by you.</p>
      <p>We may share your personal  information with our parent company, subsidiaries, joint ventures, or  other companies under a common control (collectively, "<strong>Affiliates</strong>")  that we may have now or in the future, in which case we will require  them to honor this Privacy Policy. If another company acquires our  company or our assets, that company will possess your personal  information, and will assume the rights and obligations with respect to  that information as described in this Privacy Policy.</p>
      <p>We may  disclose your personal information to third parties in a good faith  belief that such disclosure is reasonably necessary to (a) take action  regarding suspected illegal activities; (b) enforce or apply our Terms  of Service and Privacy Policy; (c) comply with legal process, such as a  search warrant, subpoena, statute, or court order; or (d) protect our  rights, reputation, and property, or that of our users, affiliates, or  the public. Please note that we are not required to question or contest  the validity of any search warrant, subpoena or other similar  governmental request that we receive.</p>
      <p>We may disclose  information in the aggregate to third parties relating to user behavior  in connection with actual or prospective business relationship with  those third parties, such as advertisers and content distributors. For  example, we may disclose the number of users that have been exposed to,  or clicked on, advertising banners.</p>
      <p>We use third party  advertising companies to serve ads when you visit the
        ypintelligence        Sites. These  companies may use information (not including your name, address, email  address, or telephone number) about your visits to this and other  websites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of  interest to you. If you would like more information about this practice  and to know your choices about not having this information used by  these companies, <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp" rel="nofollow">click here</a>. </p>
      <h3>III. Others' Information</h3>
      <p>You  may choose to provide us with another person's e-mail address so that  person may be invited to create an account on this website and become  your friend. We use this information to contact and, if necessary,  remind that person about the invitation. By providing us with another  person's e-mail address, you represent to us that you have obtained the  consent of the person concerned as regards such disclosure to us of  their personal information. All invitees are provided with the option  not to receive further invitations. We may disclose such information if  required to do so in order to comply with legal process, as described  above.</p>
      <h3>IV. Links</h3>
      <p>The
        ypintelligence        Sites may contain links  to third party websites to which we have no affiliation. Except as set  forth herein, we do not share your personal information with those  third parties, and are not responsible for their privacy practices. We  suggest you read the privacy policies on all such third party websites.</p>
      <h3>V. Controlling Your Personal Data</h3>
      <p>To  the extent you include personal information in your submissions (such  as a photo of yourself), third parties may be able to identify you,  associate you with your user account, and contact you. Third parties  can also associate you with your user account using the member lookup  feature on the
        ypintelligence        Sites, but only if the third party already knows  your full name and you include information in your submission that  allows the third party to distinguish you from other users who might  share the same full name. Please do not include information in your  submissions that you expect to keep private. In addition, you can  reduce the risk of being personally identified by choosing a fictitious  account name, though doing so could detract from the credibility of  your submissions. </p>
      <p>Please also note that the personal  messages you send or receive using the
        ypintelligence        Sites' personal messaging  feature are only private to the extent that you and the  sender/recipient keep them private. For example, we do not have any  control over whether a recipient of one of your personal messages  publicly posts the contents of such a message.</p>
      <p>As a  registered
        ypintelligence        user, you can modify some of your personal information  and your privacy preferences by accessing the "Account" section of this  website. For example, you may choose not to receive e-mail  solicitations from
        ypintelligence        by accessing the "Account" tab on the
        ypintelligence        Sites and updating your notification settings. Upon your request,
        ypintelligence        will use commercially reasonable efforts to close your account, and  cease displaying your submissions on the
        ypintelligence        Sites; nevertheless, we  may still retain your personal information in our systems. Registered  users who wish to close their account should <a href="http://www.ypintelligence.com/contact?topic=support&amp;subtopic=close">click here</a>.</p>
      <h3>VI. Security</h3>
      <p>Your  account is password protected. We use industry standard measures to  protect the personal information that is stored in our database. We  limit the access to your personal information to those employees and  contractors who need access to perform their job function, such as our  customer service personnel. If you have any questions about the  security on the
        ypintelligence        Sites, please contact us. Although we take  appropriate measures to safeguard against unauthorized disclosures of  information, we cannot assure you that your personal information will  never be disclosed in a manner that is inconsistent with this Privacy  Policy.</p>
      <p><em>You hereby acknowledge that
        ypintelligence        is not  responsible for any intercepted information sent via the internet, and  you hereby release us from any and all claims arising out of or related  to the use of intercepted information in any unauthorized manner.</em></p>
      <h3>VII. E-mails and Opt-out</h3>
      <p>You  may opt-out of receiving personal messages from specific users. In  addition, you may opt-out of receiving notifications from us by  changing your notification settings under the "Account" tab after you  log on to a
        ypintelligence        Site. Unregistered users who receive e-mails from us  may also opt-out of receiving further e-mails by following the  instructions contained in our e-mails. Despite your indicated e-mail  preferences, we may send you notices of any updates to our Terms of Use  or Privacy Policy.</p>
      <h3>VIII. Terms and Modifications to this Privacy Policy</h3>
      <p>We  may modify this Privacy Policy at any time, and we will post any new  versions on this page. If we make any material changes in the way we  use your personal information, we will notify you by sending an e-mail  to the last e-mail address you provided to us and/or by prominently  posting notice of the changes on our website. Any such changes will be  effective upon the earlier of thirty (30) calendar days following our  dispatch of an e-mail notice to you or thirty (30) calendar days  following our posting of notice of the changes on our website. These  changes will be effective immediately for new users of the
        ypintelligence        Sites.  Please note that at all times you are responsible for updating your  personal information to provide us with your most current e-mail  address. In the event that the last e-mail you have provided us is not  valid, or for any reason is not capable of delivering to you the notice  described above, our dispatch of the e-mail containing such notice will  nonetheless constitute effective notice of the changes described in the  notice. In any event, changes to this Privacy Policy may affect our use  of personal information that you provided us prior to our notification  to you of the changes. If you do not wish to permit changes in our use  of your personal information, you must notify us prior to the effective  date of the changes that you wish to deactivate your account with us.  Continued use of the
        ypintelligence        Sites following notice of such changes shall  indicate your acknowledgement of such changes and agreement to be bound  by the terms and conditions of such changes.</p>
