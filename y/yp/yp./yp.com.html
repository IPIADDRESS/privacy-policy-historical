 <h2 class="TXTMD">Privacy</h2>
 We at YP.Com are constantly striving to provide excellent
 service to you, our customers and business partners, while
 building a long-lasting relationship with you. To achieve
 these goals, we occasionally need information about you when
 you visit our site.<br><br>
 First and foremost, YP.Com respects your right to privacy.
 When you visit YP.Com, you may be providing information to
 YP.Com on two different levels about your visit:<br><br>
 • Anonymous statistics collected as you browse the site,<br><br>
 • And personal information you knowingly give us.<br>
 <br>
 We want you to be aware of how we handle this information.
 <h3>Our Commitment to Your Privacy</h3>
 YP.Com would like to assure you that we do not:<br><br>
 • Collect personal information from you unless you provide
 it to us.<br><br>
 • Provide or sell the names and addresses of our customers
 [site users] to outside vendors.<br>
 <br>
 YP.Com does:<br><br>
 • Safeguard customers' information from unauthorized
 access.<br><br>
 • Collect, maintain and use customer information as
 necessary to provide the most helpful and targeted products
 and services to meet customers' needs (e.g. customer care
 or new products or services).<br><br>
 • Honor customers' requests to remove their names from
 our telephone or mail solicitation lists. (Just contact us.).<br><br>
 • Maintain confidentiality of customer information when
 undertaking projects with other companies.<br><br>
 YP.Com has always valued your privacy, and we reinforce this
 belief throughout our organization. Your information will be
 protected as described unless the specific web page says otherwise.
 If you have further questions about our privacy policy, please
 contact us.
 <br><br>
 <h2 class="TXTMD">Information this Site Gathers/Tracks</h2>
 <h3>Statistics about your visit</h3>
 As you browse the site, YP.Com's computers collect information
 about your visit, not about you personally. Via web server logs
 and browser cookie files, we monitor statistics such as:<br>
 <br>
 • How many people visit our site<br>
 <br>
 • Which pages people visit on our site<br><br>
 • From which domains our visitors come (e.g., "aol.com")<br><br>
 • Which browsers people use to visit our site<br><br>
 While we gather this information, none of it is associated with
 you as an individual. We use these statistics to improve our
 web site, to monitor its performance, and to make it easier
 for you and other visitors to use.
 <h3>Organizational and personal information you knowingly give us</h3>
 Within the YP.Com web site, you may be asked to give us personal
 or organizational information when you ask a question that requires
 a response, request rate information online, or order a service
 online. This information may range from your generic zip code,
 to your specific phone number, account number, a credit card
 number, e-mail address, organization URL, business description,
 business graphics, or mailing address.
 <br><br>
 <h2 class="TXTMD">Use of the Information this Site Gathers/Tracks</h2>
 <h3>Your IP Address and Host Name</h3>YP.Com's web site logs Host
 Names and IP addresses (when the Host Name is not available) for
 systems administration and security purposes. These logs are monitored
 and analyzed to maintain systems and information security and
 allow us to constantly improve the value and the availability
 of the web content.
 <h3>YP.Com Registration Forms</h3>
 We encourage all visitors
 to register with YP.Com, although registration is not required,
 except for access to our premium content areas. The registration
 forms require users to give us accurate contact information
 (like name and e-mail address) and preferences that help us
 better serve you. Your name and e-mail address are used to send
 you information about our company, product updates, special
 offers, and newsletters. You may change your preferences at
 any time, or remove your name entirely from our user registry.
 <h3>Order Forms and Enrollment Forms</h3>
 Our order forms
 securely collect visitor's contact information and financial
 information (like your credit card number and other billing
 information). Contact information on the order form is used
 for order fulfillment and may be shared with our Partners
 or Resellers if that is necessary to fulfill your request.
 The information that we require on our order form is only
 used to process your order quickly and accurately. Your contact
 information will only be used to send you the product that
 you purchase and your billing information will only be used
 to bill you for that product. During the purchasing process,
 you may be given the opportunity to sign up for future e-mailings
 regarding our products, services, and promotions. If you sign
 up here, YP.Com will share your contact information with other
 YP.Com companies only, not with other companies.<br><br>
 As YP.Com's online systems become more sophisticated, you may
 also be given the option of registering a profile with YP.Com.
 This would store your name, purchase history, and billing information
 to make it easier for you to shop and purchase products/services
 from us in the future. Once profiling is available, you may opt
 out of this feature at any time by changing/canceling your profile
 online.
 <h3>Cookies</h3>
 A cookie is a small, encrypted data string
 our server writes to your hard drive that contains your unique
 YP.Com User ID. We use cookies to deliver web content specific
 to your interests and to control access to YP.Com premium
 content. A cookie cannot be used to access or otherwise compromise
 the data on your hard drive. You can choose to change your
 browser settings to disable cookies if you do not want us
 to establish and maintain a unique YP.Com User ID. Please
 be aware that cookies may be required to complete certain
 functions on YP.Com.
 <br><br>
 <h2 class="TXTMD">Sharing of the Information this Site Gathers/Tracks</h2>
 The information you submit on the order form is never shared
 with any third parties unless it is necessary to complete
 your request. Also, as required by law, YP.Com will not share
 customer proprietary network information with other YP.Com
 companies, unless you give YP.Com permission to do so (either
 online, or via phone or mail).
 <br><br>
 <h2 class="TXTMD">Information Security</h2>
 We have security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse
 and alteration of information under our control. When you
 place an order, the information you submit is encrypted using
 the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol.
 <br><br>
 <h2 class="TXTMD">Links to Other Sites</h2>
 The YP.Com web site contains links to other web sites. Please
 be aware that our privacy policy does not apply to these sites.
 <br><br>
 <h2 class="TXTMD">Opt-out Policy</h2>
 Our site provides users the opportunity to opt-out of receiving
 communications from us and our Partners at the point where
 we request information about the visitor. Visitors who wish
 to remove their information from our database to not receive
 future communications or to no longer receive our service
 can contact us.
 <br><br>
 <a name="privacy"></a><h2 class="TXTMD">Privacy Policy</h2>
 The Site is a general audience site. We do not currently collect any personal information from children under the age of thirteen (13) on the Site. If in the future, we collect personally identifiable information from children, we will do so in compliance with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 (15 U.S.C. 6501 et seq.).
 <br><br>
 <h2 class="TXTMD">Third-Party Ad Serving &amp; Audience and Traffic Measurement Services</h2>
 The Site may use third party network advertisers to serve the advertisements on the Site and may use a traffic measurement service to analyze the traffic on the Site. Network advertisers are third parties that display advertisements based on your visits to this Site and other Web sites you have visited. Third-party ad serving enables us to target advertisements to you for products and services you might be interested in. Although advertisers and other companies do not have access to your cookies as provided by the Site, the Site's third party network advertisers, the advertisers, the sponsors, and/or traffic measurement services may themselves set and access their own cookies on your computer if you choose to have cookies enabled in your browser. These third party cookies are set for purposes including but not limited to targeting advertisements to you that you might be interested in, to prevent you from seeing the same advertisements too many times and to conduct research regarding how useful certain advertisements are to you. Note that any images (or any other parts of a web page) served by third parties in association with third party cookies may serve as web beacons, which enable third parties to carry out the previously described activities. Third party cookies are governed by each third party's specific privacy policy, not this one. Please visit http://www.networkadvertising.org/optout_nonppii.asp in order to learn more about the information collection practices and "opt-out" procedures of third party ad servers we may use.
 <br><br>
 <h2 class="TXTMD">Web Beacons</h2>
 Consistent with standard practice within the web publishing industry, web pages throughout the Site may contain electronic images (generally, single-pixel ".gif" images) called "web beacons." These web beacons allow SITE to access certain cookies that were set in a domain different from that which is displayed in the current web page's address bar. SITE's use of web beacons, includes, without limitation, the following:
 <br><br>
 • SITE may use web beacons within the Site in order to count unique users (actually, unique web browsers), visits and page views. Unique browser recognition is possible through the use of web beacons and associated cookies that may be managed by a third party site analytics partner.<br><br>
 • SITE may use web beacons to monitor SITE traffic and conversion patterns through our various product and service offerings. For example, web beacons may be integrated into a merchandise product page as well as the subsequent shopping cart, transaction and verification pages. This allows us to determine the most appropriate methods to serve our transaction-oriented customers.<br><br>
 • SITE includes web beacons in HTML-formatted email messages (messages in which we are able to include graphics). These beacons allow us to determine whether or not email messages were opened, links were clicked and notifications/offers were acted upon.
 <br><br>
