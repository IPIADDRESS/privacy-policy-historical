        <h2>FAQ</h2>
        <div class="sep"></div>
        <h3>BOOKING</h3>
        <h4>WHAT'S YPLAN ALL ABOUT?</h4>
        <p>YPlan is for the spontaneous. Get inspired by a fantastic event, pay in 2 taps and go tonight! Our curators party tirelessly around the clock to bring you the best events in London. Every day we give the YPlan stamp of approval to a special few and score you a unique deal. That's us in a nutshell.</p>

        <h4>HOW DOES IT ALL WORK?</h4>
        <p>We feature events as soon as we can, usually 48 hours before they start. Keep an eye out within event for unique YPlan perks such as: access to a sold-out show, invitation-only events, automatic upgrade, a free something with your booking, or a mouth-watering discount.</p>

        <h4>HOW DO I BOOK AN EVENT?</h4>
        <p>Select the event that tickles your fancy from the main events screen, tap 'Book Now' at the bottom, select the number of tickets, tap 'Confirm Booking' at the bottom (add your card details now if it's your first booking), and 'Yes' to confirm the purchase. That's it - just like magic, you're going tonight.</p>

        <h4>HOW DO I PAY FOR THE BOOKING?</h4>
        <p>Once you've entered your American Express, Visa, MasterCard, or Maestro card to YPlan, you can buy any event in 2 taps. To enter your card details, tap 'Settings' in the main menu, then tap 'Credit Card', and enter your details. You can also add this information when making your first booking.</p>
        <p>YPlan is certified by STAR (Society of Ticket Agents and Retailers), an official ticket industry regulatory body, so you can be sure that with YPlan you’re booking from a trusted company. We also encrypt your payment details using the industry's leading standard, SSL (Secure Sockets Layer), and never store payment card information on the phone (that's why you only see the last four digits of the card).</p>

        <h4>ARE THERE ANY HIDDEN FEES?</h4>
        <p>Nope, we think it sucks to sneak in fees and charges just before you confirm your booking. At YPlan, you pay what you see. Always.</p>

        <h4>HOW DO I GET IN TO THE EVENT ONCE I'VE MADE THE BOOKING?</h4>
        <p>You'll find your latest booking in the side menu and all your bookings in 'My Tickets'. At the bottom of each ticket under 'How Do I Get In?' you'll find instructions on how to redeem your tickets and enter the venue. If you have any questions, who you gonna call? YPlan's team is here for you ‘round the clock, be it early breakfast or last cocktail: 02071 839 394. Or tap the 'Call Us' button in 'Help'.</p>

        <h4>DO EVENTS SELL OUT?</h4>
        <p>Of course, so snap 'em up quick. Once they're gone, they're gone.</p>

        <h4>HOW LATE CAN I BOOK AN EVENT?</h4>
        <p>If you see it in the app, it's yours for the taking. We'll keep all tickets open until the last possible moment.</p>

        <h4>CAN I BOOK AN EVENT FOR TOMORROW OR LATER?</h4>
        <p>Why, yes you can. We usually have events on 48 hours before start time, but sometimes there’s more added last minute, and even a select few that go on sale several days early. Keep checking YPlan regularly as the top events sell out quickly...why plan when you have YPlan?</p>

        <h4>CAN I CHOOSE MY SEATS?</h4>
        <p>At the moment, all the seats are on a 'best available' basis. Unless it's general admission or unreserved seating, we'll always let you know what type of seats you are buying, just not the exact seats. If you buy 2 or more tickets, we'll make sure you all sit together.</p>

        <h4>ARE MY FRIENDS SEEING THE SAME EVENTS AS ME?</h4>
        <p>Not necessarily. Everyone sees individually handpicked events, so you and your mates may see different sets of events. Use the app to share events with your buddies, or better still, snap up tickets for everyone - they'll love you forever.</p>

        <h3>USING YPLAN</h3>
        <h4>HOW DO I CHANGE MY ACCOUNT INFORMATION?</h4>
        <p>Go to 'Settings' in the main menu. Easy peasy lemon squeezy.</p>

        <h4>CAN I INVITE FRIENDS TO USE THE APP?</h4>
        <p>Appsolutely. Get your friends to join the movement by going to 'My Rewards' in the main menu and 'Share Your Code' through your social networks, email, or text message.</p>

        <h4>HOW DO I GET ME SOME CREDIT?</h4>
        <p>As Frank Sinatra once sang, 'Start spreading the news' and we'll reward you. YPlan Rewards is free money for you to spend on any event. Want some? Go to 'My Rewards' and invite your friends to YPlan - they'll get £7 for joining, and you'll get £7 when they first buy something. Not too shabby, huh? Keep sharing and we'll keep dishing out the credit.</p>

        <h4>WHERE CAN I GIVE FEEDBACK?</h4>
        <p>Tell us the good, the bad, and the ugly. We'll answer any questions you may have, listen to your feedback, or just have a friendly chinwag if you're feeling lonely. Rain or shine, early breakfast or last cocktail – we'd love to hear from you!</p>

        <h3 id="introduction">1. Introduction</h3>

        <p>1.1 These are the terms of use, including the terms and
        conditions of supply (<b>Terms</b>), for www.yplanapp.com and the YPlan
        application. For the purposes of
        these Terms, both the website and application shall be referred to as the
        "<b>App</b><span>"</span>. The App is operated by LeanWorks Ltd trading
        as YPlan (<b>we</b>, <b>us</b> and <b>our</b>). We are a limited company,
        registered in England. Our registered company number is 7934000, and our
        registered office is at 5 New Street Square, London, UK, EC4A 3TW. Our VAT
        registration number is 138597273.</p>

        <p>1.2 We are a member of "The Society of
        Ticket Agents and Retailers"
        (STAR) and we undertake to comply with the
        STAR Code of Practice in our dealings with you. Follow the link for more
        information on STAR's services, a copy of the Code, and also the STAR process
        for dispute resolution between you and us, which we agree to follow:
        <a href="http://www.star.org.uk/starmembers/provisionalmembers/leanworks-ltd">http://www.star.org.uk/starmembers/provisionalmembers/leanworks-ltd</a>.</p>

        <p>1.3 Your use of the App and your Purchase of any of
        the Tickets offered via our App is subject to these Terms and by placing an
        order for any Tickets you agree to be bound by them. You should print a copy of
        these Terms for future reference. Use of your personal information submitted
        via this App is governed by our privacy policy.</p>

        <p>1.4 We reserve the right to change these Terms from
        time to time by changing them on the App, although no such change will affect
        any Purchase you have already made with us. Your continued use of the App and
        any new Purchases will be bound by the new Terms. These Terms were last updated
        on February 21, 2013.</p>

        <p>1.5 As a consumer, nothing in these Terms will
        prevent you or stop you from being able to enforce or receive the full benefit
        of your legal rights provided under general UK law (your "non-excludable
        statutory rights"). For more information, please contact your local
        Citizens Advice Bureau, phone numbers can be found on their national website at
        <a href="http://www.nacab.org.uk/">www.nacab.org.uk</a>.</p>

        <p>1.6 In these Terms we use various capitalised terms
        (they are "defined"). This means they have special meanings, found in
        the next-to-last section of these Terms.</p>

        <h3 id="the_basics">2. The basics</h3>

        <p>2.1 To use the App and make any Purchases, you must
        be 18 or over. By continuing to use the App and agreeing to these Terms you are
        representing to us that you are 18 and we can rely on this representation.</p>

        <p>2.2 The App and the Events offered on the App are
        only directed at people who access the App and make Purchases in the UK. We do
        not represent that any Events are suitable outside the UK and you should be
        careful to satisfy yourself of a Event's suitability to your circumstances
        (such as considering your travel arrangements to/from the event because unless
        this is expressly stated as part of the Event, it is not included as part of
        the Purchase). If you choose to use the App or make a Purchase outside the UK
        you do so at your own initiative.</p>

        <p>2.3 We grant you a limited licence to use the App to
        access and use our services for your own personal and non-commercial use,
        provided that you comply fully with these Terms<span> (e.g. you must not
        re-sell the Tickets).</span></p>

        <p>2.4 We reserve the right to prevent you using the App
        or making Purchases, however we will honour Purchases already made, unless you
        have not complied with these Terms or we are unable to because of circumstances
        outside our control. For more on this, please read below.</p>

        <h3 id="access">3. Access to the App</h3>

        <p>3.1 We cannot guarantee the continuous, uninterrupted
        or error-free operability of the App. There may be times when certain features,
        parts or content of the App, or the entire App, become unavailable (whether on
        a scheduled or unscheduled basis) or are modified, suspended or withdrawn by
        us, in our sole discretion, without notice to you. You agree that we will not
        be liable to you or to any third party for any unavailability, modification,
        suspension or withdrawal of the App, or any features, parts or content of the App.</p>

        <p>3.2 We may change the format and content of the App
        from time to time. We reserve the right to modify, change, substitute or
        withdraw any Events or other information on our App. You agree that your use of
        the App is on an 'as is' and 'as available' basis and at your sole risk.</p>

        <h3 id="registering">4. Registering a YPlan account</h3>

        <p>4.1 Why register? To put simply, if you don't
        register an account, you won't be able to make any Purchases. This is because
        you need an account in order to view your Purchased Tickets, redeem them (if
        required), view your past Purchases, store your financial details and modify
        your preferences to name a few. We reserve the right to decline a new
        registration or cancel your account at any time (including if you don't provide
        us with a valid e-mail address that is personal to you, or if you don't provide
        us with a correct name and surname).</p>

        <p>4.2 To register an account you will need to fill out
        a form on the mobile app or online. You warrant that the information you input
        is true, complete and accurate. You will promptly inform us of any changes to
        such information (you can do this by updated your account details at any time).
        The personal information you give us is governed by our privacy policy.</p>

        <p>4.3 In order to register and access your account,
        you will need to choose a password. It is important you keep this password
        confidential because you are entirely responsible if you do not maintain the
        confidentiality of your password to a reasonably expected standard and
        Purchases are made via your account. Let us know as soon as you become aware
        there has been a breach of security and we will suspend your account. You agree
        that any person who you directly or implicitly permit to use your password
        (implicitly, for example, because you do not log out of your account and
        another person uses your device to make Purchases or you write your password on
        a noticeboard in your home and a family member then uses it to gain access to
        your account) is authorised to act as your agent to use the App and make
        Purchases via your account. You will not be responsible to pay for Purchases
        made after you have notified us of a password change or that security has been
        compromised.</p>

        <p>4.4 One individual user is allowed to register only one account on
        the App.  You warrant that you will not create fraudulent
        accounts.  You also warrant that you will not use any
        fraudulent activities to generate unfair Reward Credits in the
        App to be applied to you (for instance, you will not redeem
        your own invitation code with a different account of yours).</p>

        <h3 id="what_you_are_allowed">5. What you are allowed to do</h3>

        <p>5.1 You may only use the App for non-commercial use
        and only in accordance with these Terms. You may retrieve and display content from
        the App on a computer or mobile device screen, print and copy individual pages and Tickets and,
        subject to the next section, store such pages and/or Tickets in electronic
        form. Additional terms may also apply to certain features, parts or content of
        the App and, where they apply, they will be displayed before you access the
        relevant features, parts or content.</p>

        <h3 id="what_you_are_not_allowed">6. What you are not allowed to do</h3>

        <p>6.1 Except to the extent expressly set out in these Terms, you are not allowed to:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>store pages of the App on a server or
            other storage device connected to a network or create an electronic
            database by systematically downloading and storing all or most of the
            pages of the App; or
            </li>
            <li>remove or change any content of the App
            or attempt to circumvent security or interfere with the proper working of
            the App or the servers on which it is hosted.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>6.2 You must only use the App and anything available
        from the App for lawful purposes (complying with all applicable laws and
        regulations), in a responsible manner, and not in a way that might damage our name
        or reputation or that of any of our affiliates.</p>

        <p>6.3 All rights granted to you under these Terms will
        terminate immediately in the event that you have not followed your
        responsibilities as required by them (legally known as a "breach").</p>

        <h3 id="ip_rights">7. Intellectual property rights</h3>

        <p>7.1 All intellectual property rights (which includes
        rights such as copyright, and rights in trade marks) in any content of the App
        (including text, graphics, software, photographs and other images, videos,
        sound, trade marks and logos) are owned by us and/or our licensors. Except as
        expressly set out in these Terms, nothing in these Terms gives you any rights
        in respect of any intellectual property owned by us or our licensors and you
        acknowledge that you do not acquire any ownership rights by downloading content
        from the App. If you print off, copy or store pages from the App (only as
        permitted by these terms and conditions), you must ensure that any copyright,
        trade mark or other intellectual property right notices contained in the
        original content are reproduced.</p>

        <p>7.2 You agree that by submitting any posting, images
        or other content for publication on the App (<b>Your Content</b>), you retain
        any copyright you may have in Your Content, however you grant us and our
        affiliates a perpetual, irrevocable, worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free and
        fully sub-licensable right and licence to use, reproduce, edit, modify, adapt,
        publish, translate, create derivative works from, distribute, perform and
        display such content (in whole or in part) and/or to incorporate it into other
        works in any form, media or technology, whether for commercial or
        non-commercial purposes. You waive any moral rights you may have in, or to be
        identified as the author, of Your Content.</p>

        <p>7.3 You are solely responsible for Your Content
        (including content you share with other sites, such as social networking sites)
        and we do not endorse Your Content or any opinion, recommendation, or advice
        expressed therein, and we expressly disclaim any and all liability in
        connection with Your Content.</p>

        <h3 id="external_links">8. External links</h3>

        <p>8.1 The App may, from time to time, include links to
        external sites. We have included links to these sites to provide you with
        access to information and services that you may find useful or interesting. We
        are not responsible for the content of these sites or for anything provided by
        them and do not guarantee that they will be continuously available. The fact
        that we include links to such external sites does not imply any endorsement of
        or association with their operators.</p>

        <h3 id="your_personal_information">9. Your personal information</h3>

        <p>Use of your personal information submitted via the App is governed by our privacy policy.</p>

        <h3 id="purchasing_tickets">10. Purchasing tickets</h3>

        <p>10.1 <em>Your relationship with the Merchant</em></p>

        <p>Except for a
        very small number of Events, we act as a disclosed agent for our Merchants,
        such as a theatre or concert promoter. This means that the contract for the
        Event is between you and the Merchant. In most cases this means there are likely to be
        additional terms and conditions which apply to your contract with the Merchant
        (because each Merchant has different terms relevant to the Event, for example a
        concert promoter will have different terms of entry than a theatre). These
        additional terms, if any, shall be made known to you at the time of Purchase,
        and/or you may <a href="#contact_us">Contact Us</a> for details.
        We will also provide a link to the terms in the ticket confirmation email
        and/or as part of the redemption instructions we send you. You shall ensure
        that anyone using a Ticket with a Merchant complies with those terms.</p>

        <p>10.2 Where we act as agent this means that we have no
        contractual liability to you in respect of that particular Event. However, we
        may still be liable to you if we have been negligent, made a fraudulent
        misrepresentation or been in breach of any other relevant law. For a small
        number of Events we may act as principal rather than agent, which means the
        contract for the Event is between you and us. We will let you know where we act
        as principal, otherwise we will always be acting as agent.</p>

        <p>10.3 It is important to note that it is the Merchant,
        not us, who is the seller of the Events. Therefore, if you have a complaint
        with the quality of the Events your complaint lies with the Merchant, not LeanWorks
        Ltd, although we'd still love to hear your feedback so we can decide whether or
        not to continue offering events from that Merchant in the future. Contact
        details for the Merchant will be provided in the confirmatory email and/or in
        the redemption instructions we send you when you make a Purchase. We will of
        course use our reasonable endeavours to assist you with providing feedback to
        the Merchant if you so request: <a href="#contact_us">Contact us.</a></p>

        <p>10.4 Since your contract is not with us, but with a
        Merchant, we may pass your payment details and other essential booking details
        to that Merchant (remember, they are not a part of our company, but are third
        parties to whom we act as agent for). The placing of an order to purchase a
        Ticket will constitute consent to us passing your details for this.</p>

        <p>10.5 <em>Tickets</em></p>

        <p>For most events you will receive an electronic Ticket or redemption instructions, since YPlan
        generally works on the basis of selling last-minute Event tickets (e.g. theatre
        seats). Sometimes you will need to collect your Tickets from the box office
        where we are unable to send the electronic Ticket straight to your account. You
        will be notified if this is necessary. You must take the acknowledgment of your
        order with you and the credit/debit card you used to make the order.</p>

        <p>10.6 Tickets must be used by the date of the Event
        shown on the Ticket, or it will no longer be valid (and you will not be
        entitled to a refund).</p>

        <p>10.7 Tickets may be restricted to a maximum number.
        You will be informed of this at the point of purchase.</p>

        <p>10.8 It is your responsibility to check your Tickets
        as if you have made a mistake it cannot always be rectified after purchase.
        Please check your Ticket(s) on receipt carefully and <a href="#contact_us">Contact Us</a>
        immediately prior to the Event if there is a
        mistake, or if you have not received your Ticket(s).</p>

        <p>10.9 It is your responsibility to ascertain whether
        an Event has been cancelled or re-scheduled and the date and time of the
        re-scheduled Event. We will use reasonable endeavours to notify you of a
        cancelled or re-scheduled Event but we do not guarantee you will be informed of
        such cancellation before the time for the Event.</p>

        <p><em>10.10 Process of purchasing</em></p>

        <p>Tickets may be
        Purchased by clicking on the Events you wish to Purchase and then following the
        prompts that will appear on-screen. You may check and correct any input errors
        in your order up until the point at which you submit your order to us by
        clicking the "Confirm Booking" button within the App.</p>

        <p>10.11 Where a concession is claimed, proof of identity
        and concession entitlement (for example of age or student status) may be
        required.</p>

        <p>10.12 Once submitted, your order constitutes an offer
        to us to Purchase a Ticket. All orders are subject to acceptance by us. We are
        not obliged to accept your order and may, in our discretion, decline to accept
        any order. Where we accept your order, we will confirm such acceptance to you
        by sending you an email that confirms that we have accepted your order and
        providing details of your Ticket. Notwithstanding our acceptance, we may
        immediately terminate or suspend the Purchase (and suspend or void the Ticket)
        if subsequently your payment details are found to be invalid or lack funds by
        our payment provider, or we or our payment provider reasonably suspect
        fraudulent behaviour linked with your account.</p>

        <p>10.13 Reproduction, sale, resale or trade of a Ticket is
        prohibited. If you attempt to do this we reserve the right to void the Ticket and
        cancel your account. However, we encourage you to Purchase Tickets and <span>give
        them as gifts!</span></p>

        <p><em>10.14 Additional terms </em></p>

        <p>Your ticket remains the property of the Merchant and is a personal revocable licence which
        may be withdrawn and admission refused at any time upon refunding the printed
        purchase price.</p>

        <p>10.15 Our Merchants may prohibit us from issuing
        exchanges or refunds after a Purchase is made, or for lost, stolen, damaged or
        destroyed tickets. It is your responsibility to keep your tickets safe, whether
        in digital or paper ticket formats. It is not always possible to issue
        duplicate tickets. If duplicates are being issued, a reasonable administration
        charge may be levied.</p>

        <p>10.16 We may limit the amount of Tickets you can buy
        to an Event. We reserve the right, on reasonable suspicion, to cancel without
        notice or liability to you any order for Tickets purchased over any specified
        limits or if we reasonably suspect fraudulent conduct in connection with the
        Purchase.</p>

        <p>10.17 A ticket shall not be used for advertising,
        promotions, contests or sweepstakes without the Merchant's and LeanWorks Ltd written
        consent.</p>

        <p>10.18 Tickets are sold subject to the Event Partner's
        right to alter or vary the programme due to events or circumstances beyond its
        reasonable control without being obliged to refund monies or exchange Tickets
        other than in certain cases set out in <a href="#our_refunds_policy">Our refunds
        policy</a>.</p>

        <p>10.19 The venue may refuse or revoke admission should
        you or your guests breach any terms and conditions of the Event or Merchant, or
        otherwise upon reasonable grounds. Every effort to admit latecomers will be
        made at a suitable break in the event, but admission cannot be guaranteed. Ticket-holders
        may only leave and re-enter a venue during an Event at the discretion of the
        management of the venue. You only have the right to a seat corresponding to
        that stated on the Ticket, but the Merchant reserves the right to provide
        alternative seats to those stated on the Ticket.</p>

        <h3 id="price_and_payment">11. Price and payment</h3>

        <p>11.1 The price of Tickets is as quoted on the App from time to time. Prices include VAT, if applicable.</p>

        <p>Prices are liable to change at any time, but changes will not affect Purchases in respect of which we have already sent
        you an email confirmation.</p>

        <p>11.2 Payment for all orders must be made by credit or
        debit card by entering such information in the Settings part in the App or as
        part of the booking process.</p>

        <p>11.3 You should be aware that online payment
        transactions are subject to validation checks by your card issuer and we are
        not responsible if your card issuer declines to authorise payment for any
        reason. Please note, it is possible that your card issuer may charge you an
        online handling fee or processing fee. We are not responsible for this.</p>

        <h3 id="our_refunds_policy">12. Our refunds policy</h3>

        <p>12.1 Purchases for Tickets cannot be exchanged or refunded, except in the following circumstances:</p>

        <p>(a) If we discover an error in the price of the
        Tickets you have ordered, we will use reasonable endeavours to inform you as
        soon as possible and allow you to either reconfirm your order at the correct
        price (crediting or debiting your account as applicable), or cancel your order.
        If you choose to cancel, you will receive a full refund from us if you've
        already paid. If we are unable to contact you, this will be treated as a
        cancellation.</p>

        <p>(b) If an Event is cancelled or re-scheduled (and you cannot attend the
        re-scheduled date), or there is a material change to the subject
        matter of the Ticket contract (that is what you have contracted to
        see), we will give you a full refund of at least the face value price
        paid or, if the face value has been reduced by the Merchant, the
        discounted face value price paid in accordance with the STAR Code of
        Practice. A 'material' change is one which, in our reasonable opinion,
        makes the Event materially different to what a purchaser of the Event,
        taken generally, could reasonably expect. The use of understudies in a
        theatre performance does not constitute a material change. Where an
        outdoor Event is cancelled or re-scheduled because of the weather, we
        shall not be liable to pay a refund but you may still be eligible for
        a refund direct from the Merchant according to the terms and
        conditions of the Merchant applicable to the Purchase. In order to
        claim your refund, please, <a href="#contact_us">Contact Us</a> as soon as possible after
        becoming aware of such change or cancellation, or where the Event has
        been re-scheduled, at least prior to the re-scheduled Event. In any
        event, you must apply within three months of the original date of the
        event.</p>

        <p>(c) If you call or email us informing of your booking
        cancellation, and get a confirmation from our representative,
        whether verbally or in writing, that your booking has been
        cancelled.</p>

        <p>12.2 Paying refunds</p>

        <p>We will usually refund any money received from you using the same method originally used by you to pay for your purchase.</p>

        <p>You may reject a credit or refund within
        30 days of receiving the credit or refund, but if you do not reject the credit
        or refund by notifying us within that timeframe you will be deemed to have
        accepted the credit or refund in full and final settlement of any and all
        claims, actions, demands and proceedings you may have against LeanWorks Ltd
        arising out of the Ticket or Purchase for which you received the credit or
        refund.</p>

        <p>12.3 Your legal rights</p>

        <p>Nothing in these Terms limits or takes
        away from your legal rights under general law, including your rights to cancel
        contracts within seven (7) days and receive refunds for goods and/or services
        purchased by distance means. This cancellation right does not apply to
        contracts for the provision of accommodation, transport, catering or leisure
        services on a specific date or within a specific period. As such, Purchases
        made via the App are generally non-cancellable and non-refundable, although you
        may be entitled to a refund in certain circumstances (see <a href="#our_refunds_policy">Our Refunds Policy</a>).
        For more information, please contact your local Citizens Advice Bureau, phone numbers can be found on their
        national website at <a href="http://www.nacab.org.uk/">www.nacab.org.uk</a>.</p>

        <h3 id="our_service_standards">13. Our service standards</h3>

        <p>We warrant that we will exercise
        reasonable care and skill in performing our obligations under these Terms.
        Provided we have done so, we shall not be liable for errors or omissions, although
        we do, however, issue credits and refunds in limited circumstances (see section
        <a href="#our_refunds_policy">Our Refunds Policy</a>). In the
        event of an error or omission we will use reasonable endeavours to correct any
        errors or omissions as soon as reasonably practicable after we become aware.</p>

        <p>Except as expressly stated in these Terms,
        all warranties, conditions or other terms, whether express or implied by
        statute or common law or otherwise are excluded to the fullest extent permitted
        by law. This does not stop you from exercising your legal rights under general
        law to the extent that we cannot lawfully exclude them, or claiming any
        remedies you might be entitled to under general law.</p>

        <h3 id="our_liability">14. Our liability</h3>

        <p>14.1 Nothing in these Terms shall limit or exclude our liability to you:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>for death or personal injury caused by our negligence;</li>
            <li>for fraudulent misrepresentation;</li>
            <li>for breach of any obligations implied by section 12 of the Sale of Goods Act 1979 or section 2 of the Supply of Goods and Services Act 1982;</li>
            <li>under Part I of the Consumer Protection Act 1987; or</li>
            <li>for any other liability that may not, under English law, be limited or excluded.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>14.2 Subject to this, in no event shall we be liable
        to you for any business losses (and loss of profits shall always be treated as
        a type of business loss) and any liability we do have for losses you suffer
        arising from any Purchases shall not exceed 100% of the aggregate amount spent
        on the Purchase for the relevant Ticket(s). Further, our liability to you for
        any and all losses however they arise in connection with these Terms and your
        use of the App (including any Purchases) is strictly limited to losses that
        were reasonably foreseeable. Losses are foreseeable where they could be
        contemplated by you and us at the time your order is accepted by us.</p>

        <p>14.3 Other than as expressly described in these
        Terms, LeanWorks Ltd does not warrant and excludes all liability in respect of,
        or to provide, the Events for which Tickets may be redeemed, including in
        respect of the quality, safety, usability or any other aspect of the Events in
        respect of which a Ticket is or may be redeemed. We do, however, issue credits
        and refunds in limited circumstances (see section <a href="#our_refunds_policy">Our Refunds Policy</a>).</p>

        <p>14.4 We will not be liable or responsible for any
        failure to perform, or delay in performance of, any of our obligations that are
        caused by events outside our reasonable control.</p>

        <h3 id="suspension">15. Suspension and termination</h3>

        <p>15.1 We may suspend or terminate all or part of your
        use of the App, your account and/or a Purchased Ticket if you use (or permit
        anyone other than you to use) the App, your account or a Purchased Ticket in
        breach of these Terms and we do not reasonably consider that your breach can be
        resolved, or if it can be resolved you have failed to resolve it to our
        reasonable satisfaction after we have asked you to do so and given you a
        reasonable opportunity to do so.</p>

        <p>15.2 Termination shall not prejudice any other right
        or remedy you or we may have in respect of accrued rights (including rights in
        respect of any breach) or liabilities which arose prior to termination.</p>

        <h3 id="general">16. General</h3>

        <p>16.1 These Terms are personal to you. You may not
        transfer or assign any or all of your rights or obligations under these Terms
        to any other person without our consent.</p>

        <p>16.2 All notices given by you to us must be given in
        writing to the address set out at the end of these Terms. We may give notice to
        you at either the email or postal address you provide to us when placing an
        order.</p>

        <p>16.3 If we fail to enforce any of our rights, it does
        not result in a waiver of that right.</p>

        <p>16.4 If any provision of these Terms is found to be
        unenforceable, that provision shall be struck out and where capable all other
        provisions shall remain in force unaffected.</p>

        <p>16.5 These Terms may not be varied except with our express written consent.</p>

        <p>16.6 These Terms and any document expressly referred
        to in them constitute the entire agreement between you and us about the subject
        matter of these Terms and, in relation to such subject matter, supersedes and
        extinguishes all earlier understandings and agreements between you and us and
        all earlier representations by us, including any innocent or negligent
        misrepresentations.  We do not limit our liability to you for any fraudulent
        misrepresentations made by us in these Terms or otherwise.</p>

        <p>16.7 All provisions of these Terms apply equally to
        and are for the benefit of LeanWorks Ltd, its group members (which means, in
        relation to LeanWorks Ltd, any "group undertaking" as defined in
        section 1161 of the Companies Act) and the Merchants at any relevant time and
        each shall have the right to enforce such provisions directly or on its own
        behalf (save that these Terms may be varied or rescinded without the consent of
        the group members and the Merchants). Subject to the previous sentence, no term
        of this Agreement is otherwise enforceable pursuant to the Contracts (Rights of
        Third Parties) Act 1999 by any person who is not a party to it.</p>

        <p>16.8 These Terms (and all non-contractual
        relationships between you and us) shall be governed by English law, and you
        agree that any dispute between you and us regarding them or any Purchase will
        only be dealt with by the nearest courts in England and Wales (nearest to where
        you reside).</p>

        <h3 id="dispute_resolution">17. Dispute Resolution</h3>

        <p>17.1 In the first instance we request that you <a href="#contact_us">Contact Us</a>
        if you have a complaint against us and we shall try to resolve it.</p>

        <p>17.2 We shall deal with complaints by following the
        dispute resolution processes set out in the STAR Code of Practice. Please
        follow the link at <a href="http://www.star.org.uk/starmembers/provisionalmembers/leanworks-ltd">http://www.star.org.uk/starmembers/provisionalmembers/leanworks-ltd</a>
        or <a href="#contact_us">Contact Us</a> and we shall give you
        details and email or post you a copy of the Code if you request.</p>

        <p>17.3 Nothing limits your right to bring a complaint
        against us by applying to your nearest court in England and Wales.</p>

        <h3 id="additional_terms_relating_to_apple">18. Additional terms relating to Apple</h3>

        <p>If you download, access and/or use the App on Apple’s iOS operating system:</p>

        <p>18.1 The App may only be accessed and used on a device owned or controlled by
        you and using Apple’s iOS operating system, and only in accordance with Apple’s
        usage rules published in its App Store terms of service;</p>

        <p>18.2 You acknowledge and agree that:</p>

        <p>a) Apple has no obligation at all to provide any support or maintenance services
        in relation to the App. If you have any maintenance or support questions in relation
        to the App, please <a href="mailto:hello@yplanapp.com">Contact Us</a>, not Apple,
        using the details in these Terms;</p>

        <p>b) Except as otherwise expressly set out in these Terms, any claims relating to
        the possession or use of the App are between you and us (and not between you, or
        anyone else, and Apple);</p>

        <p>c) In the event of any claim by a third party that your possession or use (in
        accordance with these Terms) of the App infringes any intellectual property rights,
        Apple will not be responsible or liable to you in relation to that claim; and</p>

        <p>d) Although these Terms are entered into between you and us (and not Apple),
        Apple, as a third party beneficiary under these Terms, will have the right to
        enforce these Terms against you;</p>

        <p>18.3 You represent and warrant that:</p>

        <p>a) You are not, and will not be, located in any country that is the subject of
        a United States Government embargo or that has been designated by the United
        States Government as a "terrorist supporting" country; and</p>

        <p>b) You are not listed on any United States Government list of prohibited or restricted parties; and</p>

        <p>18.4 If the App does not conform to any warranty applying to it, you may notify
        Apple, which will then refund the purchase price of the App (if any) to you. Subject
        to that, and to the maximum extent permitted by law, Apple does not give or enter
        into any warranty, condition or other term in relation to the App and will not be
        liable to you for any claims, losses, costs or expenses of whatever nature in relation
        to the App or as a result of you or anyone else using the App or relying on any of its content.</p>

            data” means information that does not directly identify you.
            Additionally, non-personal data means “aggregate” and
            “de-personalized” information, which is data we collect about the use
            of YPlan's services, from which any personally identifiable data has
            been removed. We may use tools or third party analytical software to
            automatically collect and use certain non-personal data that does not
            directly enable us to identify you. The types of non-personal data we
            may collect and use include, but are not limited to: (i) device
            properties, including, but not limited to IP address, Media Access
            Control (“MAC”) address and unique device identifier or other device
            identifier ("UDID"); (ii) device software platform and firmware; (iii)
            mobile phone carrier; (iv) geographical data such as post code and

        information, we may not be able to provide you with certain services.</p>

        <h3>Uses made of your information</h3>

        your consent and our direct marketing policy which is explained in full below.</p>

        <h3>Additional information</h3>

        <p>When you visit the App, we may
        automatically collect additional information about you, such as the type of phone
        or operating system you use and, if you came to the website, the type of
        internet browser you use and the website from which you have come to the site.
        Also, depending on whether you access YPlan on your PC or via your mobile
        device, we will collect your IP address (the unique address which identifies
        your home computer on the internet) or the unique identifier (which is linked
        to your mobile device) which are automatically recognised by our servers. You
        cannot be identified solely from this information and it is only used to assist
        us in providing an effective service on the App and to collect broad
        demographic information for aggregate use.</p>

        <p>The website uses cookies to store certain
        information. Cookies are pieces of information that a website transfers to your
        hard drive to store and sometimes track information about you. Although they do
        identify a user's device, cookies do not personally identify users. Cookies are
        specific to the server that created them and cannot be accessed by other
        servers, which means they cannot be used to track your movements around the
        internet.</p>

        <p>For more information about how we use
        cookies and other tracking devices, please refer to our <a href="#cookies_policy">Cookie Policy</a>.</p>

        <h3>Information sharing</h3>

        <p>We may disclose aggregate statistics
        about visitors to the App, customers and sales in order to describe our
        services to prospective partners, advertisers, potential merchants and other
        reputable third parties and for other lawful purposes, but these statistics
        will include no personally identifiable information.</p>

        <p>We may disclose your personal information
        to any of our affiliates, or to our agents or contractors who assist us in
        providing the services we offer through the App, processing transactions,
        fulfilling requests for information, receiving and sending communications,
        updating marketing lists, analysing data, providing support services or in
        other tasks, from time to time. Our agents and contractors will only use
        your information to the extent necessary to perform their functions.</p>

        <p>In the event that we undergo
        re-organisation or are sold to a third party, you agree that any personal
        information we hold about you may be transferred to that re-organised entity or
        third party.</p>

        <p>We may disclose your personal information
        if required to do so by law or if we believe that such action is necessary to
        prevent fraud or cyber crime or to protect the App or enforce the terms under
        which you transact with us or enforce the rights, property or personal safety
        of any person.</p>

        <h3>Public forums</h3>

        <p>The App may, from time to time, make
        public forums available to its users. Any information that is disclosed
        in these areas becomes public information and you should exercise caution when
        using these and never disclose your personal information.</p>

        <h3>External links</h3>

        <p>The App may, from time to time, contain
        links to external sites. We are not responsible for the privacy policies
        or the content of such sites.</p>

        <h3>Payment processing</h3>

        <p>Payment details you provide will be
        encrypted using industry standard 128 bit secure sockets layer (SSL) technology
        before they are submitted to us or our payment partners over the internet. Payments
        made on the App are made through our payment solutions providers, Braintree Payment Solutions LLC or DataCash Ltd (collectively, our "PSP").
        You will be providing credit or debit card information directly to the
        PSP which operates a secure server to process payment details, encrypting your
        credit/debit card information and authorising payment. We do not store your credit card number or security code
        on our servers, though it may transit through our servers as it passes to PSP. Information which you supply to our PSP is not
        within our control and is subject to PSP's own privacy policy and terms and conditions.</p>

        <h3>Marketing to you</h3>

        <p>We may send you information we think you
        may find useful or which you have requested from us by push notification and/or
        (if you provide us with your e-mail address) by e-mail, including information
        about the latest or upcoming events featured on the App, provided you have
        indicated that you do not object to being contacted for these purposes and we
        will always give you the option to opt-out of receiving further e-mails or push
        notifications by following the unsubscribe instructions on any communications
        sent to you.</p>

        <p>Additionally we may allow, if you consent
        by opting-in to receive such information and offers, carefully selected third
        parties to send you information directly which you may find useful regarding
        their products and services.</p>

        <p>You can tell us not to contact you with
        information regarding the products or services of third parties, or to share
        your details with third parties so that they can directly send you information
        regarding their products and services, either at the point such information is
        collected on the App (by checking the relevant box), or where you do not wish
        us to continue to use your information in this way by following the unsubscribe
        instructions on any communications sent to you.</p>

        <p>You can also exercise this right at any
        time by contacting us using the contact details at the end of this privacy
        policy.</p>

        <p>When you purchase a ticket from YPlan,
        you may at that time be offered an opportunity to purchase third party products
        or services or enter third party promotions or loyalty programmes. If you
        expressly consent to purchase those products or services or enter into the
        promotions or programmes you authorise us to share your name, e-mail address
        and, where necessary and only where you have consented for us to do so, your
        financial and billing details with that third party merchant. The use of your
        personal information will be governed by the terms of that merchant's own terms
        of supply and privacy policy, so ensure that you read the relevant terms and
        privacy policy carefully before you agree to purchase from, or participate with
        that third party merchant.</p>

        <h3>Your location data</h3>

        <p>In order to get the most out of our
        service and to allow us to provide you with tailored offers, we need to process
        your approximate location from time to time. The types of location data that
        will be processed are your latitude, longitude, cell tower ID, etc. Your
        location data will only be processed for as long as necessary in order for us
        to respond to your request for tailored offers. After this the data will be
        deleted. The location data may be transferred to our merchants for the purpose
        of providing you with the best offers at that time to match your
        preferences.</p>

        <p>You can choose not to allow us to process
        your approximate location at the time you connect to the app, or any time after
        that either by changing the settings on your mobile device or by contacting us
        using the contact details at the end of this privacy policy. Please note that
        if you choose not to allow us to process your location data, we will not have enough
        data in order to provide you with the full benefit of our service (e.g. a list
        of tailored offers matched to your approximate location).</p>

        <h3>Security</h3>

        <p>We place great importance on the security
        of all personally identifiable information associated with our users. We
        have security measures in place to attempt to protect against the loss, misuse
        and alteration of personal information under our control. For example,
        our security and privacy policies are periodically reviewed and enhanced as
        necessary and only authorised personnel have access to personal
        information. Whilst we cannot ensure or guarantee that loss, misuse or alteration
        of information will never occur, we use all reasonable efforts to prevent it.</p>

        <p>You should bear in mind that submission
        of information over the internet is never entirely secure. We cannot guarantee
        the security of information you submit via the App whilst it is in transit over
        the internet and any such submission is at your own risk.</p>

        <h3>Storage of your information</h3>

        <p>Information that you submit via the App
        is sent to and stored on secure servers located in the United Kingdom and other
        European Economic Area countries. This is necessary in order to process the
        information. Information submitted by you may be transferred by us to our other
        offices and/or to the third parties mentioned in the circumstances described
        above, which may be situated outside the European Economic Area and may be
        processed by staff operating outside the European Economic Area. By
        submitting information via the App, you agree to this storing, processing
        and/or transfer.</p>

        <h3>Your rights</h3>

        <p>You have a legal right under the Data
        Protection Act 1998 to a copy of all the personal information about you held by
        us. On request, we will provide you with a copy of this information subject to
        a fee not exceeding £10. You also have a right to correct any errors in
        that information. As mentioned above, you have a right to prevent the use
        of your personal information for direct marketing purposes.</p>

        <h3 id="cookies_policy">YPlan Cookies Policy</h3>

        <p>When you interact with the App, we try to make that experience simple and meaningful.
        When you visit our App our Web server sends a cookie to your computer or mobile
        device (depending on how you access the site). Cookies are small pieces
        of information which are issued to your computer when you visit a website and
        which store and sometimes track information about your use of the site. A
        number of cookies we use last only for the duration of your web session and expire
        when you close your App. These are known as session cookies. Other
        cookies are used to remember you when you return to the App and will last for
        longer. These are known as persistent cookies.</p>

        We use cookies to:

        <ul>
            <li>remember that you have visited us before; this means we can identify the number of
            unique visitors we receive. This allows us to make sure we have enough
            capacity for the number of users that we get;</li>
            <li>customise elements of the promotional layout and/or content of the pages of the site;
            and</li>
            <li>collect statistical information about how you use the site so that we can improve
            the site and learn which parts of the website are most popular to
            visitors.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Some of the cookies used by our App are set by us, and some are set by third parties who
        are delivering services on our behalf. For example, social networking sites.</p>

        <p>Most web browsers automatically accept cookies but, if you prefer, you can change your
        browser to prevent that or to notify you each time a cookie is set. You
        can also learn more about cookies by visiting <a href="http://www.allaboutcookies.org/">www.allaboutcookies.org</a> which
        includes additional useful information on cookies and how to block
        cookies using different types of browser. Please note however, that by blocking
        or deleting cookies used on the site you may not be able to take full advantage
        of the App if you do so.</p>

        <p>In addition to
        cookies, tracking Gifs may be set by us or third parties in respect of your use
        of the site. Tracking Gifs are small image files within the content of
        our site or the body of our newsletters so we or third parties can understand what
        parts of the website are visited or whether particular content is of interest.</p>

        <p>Please also look at our privacy policy which gives details about how
        we use any personal information you give us.</p>
