<h1>Website and App Privacy and Cookies Policy</h1>
<br>
<p>This is the privacy and cookies policy
for www.yplanapp.com and the YPlan application. For the purposes of this
privacy policy, both the website and application shall be referred to as the
"<b>App</b><span>"</span>. The App is operated by LeanWorks Limited,
trading as YPlan<b> </b>(<b>we</b>, <b>us</b> and <b>our</b>). For the
purposes of the Data Protection Act 1998, we are the data controller.</p>

<p>We are committed to protecting your
privacy online. We appreciate that you do not want the personal information you
provide to us distributed indiscriminately and here we explain how we collect
information, what we do with it and what controls you have.</p>

<p>By using the App, you consent to the
collection and use of information in accordance with this privacy policy.</p>

<p>We reserve the right to change this
privacy policy from time to time by changing it on the App. This privacy
policy was last updated on August 31, 2012.</p>

<h3>Information we may collect from you</h3>

<p>We may collect and process the following
information about you:</p>

<ul>
<li>
information (such as your name, email address, postal address and telephone number) that
you provide by completing forms on the App, including if you register as a user
of the App, subscribe to any service, upload or submit any material via the App,
request any information or enter into any competition or promotion we may
sponsor;
</li>

<li>in connection with an account sign-in facility, your password and log-in details;</li>

<li>your preferences, which helps us provide you with more tailored offers;</li>

<li>details of any transactions made by you through the App;</li>

<li>communications you send to us, for example to report a problem or to submit queries, concerns
or comments regarding the App or its content;</li>

<li>information from surveys that we may, from time to time, run on the App for research
purposes, if you choose to respond to them;</li>

<li>details of your visits to the App, the resources you access and any data you download;</li>

<li>if you make any purchases, your financial information (like your credit or debit card
numbers);</li>

<li>your IP address and/or unique identifier linked to your mobile device; and</li>

<li>information obtained from your social networking profile, if you log-in via a social
networking site.</li>
</ul>

<p>You are under no obligation to provide any such information. However, if you should choose to withhold requested
information, we may not be able to provide you with certain services.</p>

<h3>Uses made of your information</h3>

<p>We will use the information you provide to:</p>

<ul>
<li>help us to build a profile of your preferences so we can offer you events and
services you are interested in;</li>

offered through the App and which you request;</li>

<li>administer your account with us;</li>

<li>verify and carry out financial transactions in relation to payments you make through

<li>share with third parties necessary to process your transactions with us, such as

<li>share with our merchants for the purposes of redeeming the tickets you purchase from
the App;</li>

<li>exchange information with other companies for fraud protection and credit risk
reduction;</li>

<li>contact you by post, phone or email when necessary to discuss the transactions entered

<li>disclose to lawful authorities when required to do so by law.</li>
</ul>

<p>We will also use information you provide
to us for the purposes of contacting you with information or offers regarding
upcoming events, products, services or surveys. This shall only be done with
your consent and our direct marketing policy which is explained in full below.</p>

<h3>Additional information</h3>

<p>When you visit the App, we may
automatically collect additional information about you, such as the type of phone
or operating system you use and, if you came to the website, the type of
internet browser you use and the website from which you have come to the site.
Also, depending on whether you access YPlan on your PC or via your mobile
device, we will collect your IP address (the unique address which identifies
your home computer on the internet) or the unique identifier (which is linked
to your mobile device) which are automatically recognised by our servers. You
cannot be identified solely from this information and it is only used to assist
us in providing an effective service on the App and to collect broad
demographic information for aggregate use.</p>

<p>The website uses cookies to store certain
information. Cookies are pieces of information that a website transfers to your
hard drive to store and sometimes track information about you. Although they do
identify a user's device, cookies do not personally identify users. Cookies are
specific to the server that created them and cannot be accessed by other
servers, which means they cannot be used to track your movements around the
internet.</p>

<p>For more information about how we use
cookies and other tracking devices, please refer to our <a href="#cookies_policy">Cookie Policy</a>.</p>

<h3>Information sharing</h3>

<p>We may disclose aggregate statistics
about visitors to the App, customers and sales in order to describe our
services to prospective partners, advertisers, potential merchants and other
reputable third parties and for other lawful purposes, but these statistics
will include no personally identifiable information.</p>

<p>We may disclose your personal information
to any of our affiliates, or to our agents or contractors who assist us in
providing the services we offer through the App, processing transactions,
fulfilling requests for information, receiving and sending communications,
updating marketing lists, analysing data, providing support services or in
other tasks, from time to time. Our agents and contractors will only use
your information to the extent necessary to perform their functions.</p>

<p>In the event that we undergo
re-organisation or are sold to a third party, you agree that any personal
information we hold about you may be transferred to that re-organised entity or
third party.</p>

<p>We may disclose your personal information
if required to do so by law or if we believe that such action is necessary to
prevent fraud or cyber crime or to protect the App or enforce the terms under
which you transact with us or enforce the rights, property or personal safety
of any person.</p>

<h3>Public forums</h3>

<p>The App may, from time to time, make
public forums available to its users. Any information that is disclosed
in these areas becomes public information and you should exercise caution when
using these and never disclose your personal information.</p>

<h3>External links</h3>

<p>The App may, from time to time, contain
links to external sites. We are not responsible for the privacy policies
or the content of such sites.</p>

<h3>Payment processing</h3>

<p>Payment details you provide will be
encrypted using industry standard 128 bit secure sockets layer (SSL) technology
before they are submitted to us or our payment partners over the internet. Payments
made on the App are made through our payment solutions provider, Braintree. 
You will be providing credit or debit card information directly to 
Braintree which operates a secure server to process payment details, encrypting your
credit/debit card information and authorising payment. We do not store your
financial information on our servers, though it may transit through our servers
as it passes to Braintree. Information
which you supply to Braintree is not
within our control and is subject to Braintree's
own privacy policy and terms and conditions.</p>

<h3>Marketing to you</h3>

<p>We may send you information we think you
may find useful or which you have requested from us by push notification and/or
(if you provide us with your e-mail address) by e-mail, including information
about the latest or upcoming events featured on the App, provided you have
indicated that you do not object to being contacted for these purposes and we
will always give you the option to opt-out of receiving further e-mails or push
notifications by following the unsubscribe instructions on any communications
sent to you.</p>

<p>Additionally we may allow, if you consent
by opting-in to receive such information and offers, carefully selected third
parties to send you information directly which you may find useful regarding
their products and services.</p>

<p>You can tell us not to contact you with
information regarding the products or services of third parties, or to share
your details with third parties so that they can directly send you information
regarding their products and services, either at the point such information is
collected on the App (by checking the relevant box), or where you do not wish
us to continue to use your information in this way by following the unsubscribe
instructions on any communications sent to you.</p>

<p>You can also exercise this right at any
time by contacting us using the contact details at the end of this privacy
policy.</p>

<p>When you purchase a ticket from YPlan,
you may at that time be offered an opportunity to purchase third party products
or services or enter third party promotions or loyalty programmes. If you
expressly consent to purchase those products or services or enter into the
promotions or programmes you authorise us to share your name, e-mail address
and, where necessary and only where you have consented for us to do so, your
financial and billing details with that third party merchant. The use of your
personal information will be governed by the terms of that merchant's own terms
of supply and privacy policy, so ensure that you read the relevant terms and
privacy policy carefully before you agree to purchase from, or participate with
that third party merchant.</p>

<h3>Your location data</h3>

<p>In order to get the most out of our
service and to allow us to provide you with tailored offers, we need to process
your approximate location from time to time. The types of location data that
will be processed are your latitude, longitude, cell tower ID, etc. Your
location data will only be processed for as long as necessary in order for us
to respond to your request for tailored offers. After this the data will be
deleted. The location data may be transferred to our merchants for the purpose
of providing you with the best offers at that time to match your
preferences.</p>

<p>You can choose not to allow us to process
your approximate location at the time you connect to the app, or any time after
that either by changing the settings on your mobile device or by contacting us
using the contact details at the end of this privacy policy. Please note that
if you choose not to allow us to process your location data, we will not have enough
data in order to provide you with the full benefit of our service (e.g. a list
of tailored offers matched to your approximate location).</p>

<h3>Security</h3>

<p>We place great importance on the security
of all personally identifiable information associated with our users. We
have security measures in place to attempt to protect against the loss, misuse
and alteration of personal information under our control. For example,
our security and privacy policies are periodically reviewed and enhanced as
necessary and only authorised personnel have access to personal
information. Whilst we cannot ensure or guarantee that loss, misuse or alteration
of information will never occur, we use all reasonable efforts to prevent it.</p>

<p>You should bear in mind that submission
of information over the internet is never entirely secure. We cannot guarantee
the security of information you submit via the App whilst it is in transit over
the internet and any such submission is at your own risk.</p>

<h3>Storage of your information</h3>

<p>Information that you submit via the App
is sent to and stored on secure servers located in the United Kingdom and other
European Economic Area countries. This is necessary in order to process the
information. Information submitted by you may be transferred by us to our other
offices and/or to the third parties mentioned in the circumstances described
above, which may be situated outside the European Economic Area and may be
processed by staff operating outside the European Economic Area. By
submitting information via the App, you agree to this storing, processing
and/or transfer.</p>

<h3>Your rights</h3>

<p>You have a legal right under the Data
Protection Act 1998 to a copy of all the personal information about you held by
us. On request, we will provide you with a copy of this information subject to
a fee not exceeding £10. You also have a right to correct any errors in
that information. As mentioned above, you have a right to prevent the use
of your personal information for direct marketing purposes.</p>

<h3 id="cookies_policy">YPlan Cookies Policy</h3>

<p>When you interact with the App, we try to make that experience simple and meaningful.
When you visit our App our Web server sends a cookie to your computer or mobile
device (depending on how you access the site). Cookies are small pieces
of information which are issued to your computer when you visit a website and
which store and sometimes track information about your use of the site. A
number of cookies we use last only for the duration of your web session and expire
when you close your App. These are known as session cookies. Other
cookies are used to remember you when you return to the App and will last for
longer. These are known as persistent cookies.</p>

We use cookies to:

<ul>
 <li>remember that you have visited us before; this means we can identify the number of
     unique visitors we receive. This allows us to make sure we have enough
     capacity for the number of users that we get;</li>
 <li>customise elements of the promotional layout and/or content of the pages of the site;
     and</li>
 <li>collect statistical information about how you use the site so that we can improve
     the site and learn which parts of the website are most popular to
     visitors.</li>
</ul>

<p>Some of the cookies used by our App are set by us, and some are set by third parties who
are delivering services on our behalf. For example, social networking sites.</p>

<p>Most web browsers automatically accept cookies but, if you prefer, you can change your
browser to prevent that or to notify you each time a cookie is set. You
can also learn more about cookies by visiting <a href="http://www.allaboutcookies.org/">www.allaboutcookies.org</a> which
includes additional useful information on cookies and how to block
cookies using different types of browser. Please note however, that by blocking
or deleting cookies used on the site you may not be able to take full advantage
of the App if you do so.</p>
