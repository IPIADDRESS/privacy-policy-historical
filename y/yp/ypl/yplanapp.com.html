      <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
      
  <h2>Website and App Privacy and Cookies Policy</h2>
  <p>This is the privacy and cookies policy
  for www.yplanapp.com and the YPlan application. For the purposes of this
  privacy policy, both the website and application shall be referred to as the
  "<b>App</b><span>"</span>. The App is operated by LeanWorks Limited,
  trading as YPlan<b> </b>(<b>we</b>, <b>us</b> and <b>our</b>). For the
  purposes of the Data Protection Act 1998, we are the data controller.</p>

  <p>We are committed to protecting your
  privacy online. We appreciate that you do not want the personal information you
  provide to us distributed indiscriminately and here we explain how we collect
  information, what we do with it and what controls you have.</p>

  <p>By using the App, you consent to the
  collection and use of information in accordance with this privacy policy.</p>

  <p>We reserve the right to change this
  privacy policy from time to time by changing it on the App. This privacy
  policy was last updated on November 23, 2012.</p>

  <h3>Information we may collect from you</h3>

  <p>We may collect and process the following
  information about you:</p>

  <ul>
      <li>
      information (such as your name, email address, postal address and telephone number) that
      you provide by completing forms on the App, including if you register as a user
      of the App, subscribe to any service, upload or submit any material via the App,
      request any information or enter into any competition or promotion we may
      sponsor;
      </li>

      <li>in connection with an account sign-in facility, your password and log-in details;</li>

      <li>your preferences, which helps us provide you with more tailored offers;</li>

      <li>details of any transactions made by you through the App;</li>

      <li>communications you send to us, for example to report a problem or to submit queries, concerns
      or comments regarding the App or its content;</li>

      <li>information from surveys that we may, from time to time, run on the App for research
      purposes, if you choose to respond to them;</li>

      <li>details of your visits to the App, the resources you access and any data you download;</li>

      <li>if you make any purchases, your financial information (like your credit or debit card
      numbers);</li>

      <li>
      non-personal data. For purposes of this privacy policy, “non-personal
      data” means information that does not directly identify you.
      Additionally, non-personal data means “aggregate” and
      “de-personalized” information, which is data we collect about the use
      of YPlan's services, from which any personally identifiable data has
      been removed. We may use tools or third party analytical software to
      automatically collect and use certain non-personal data that does not
      directly enable us to identify you. The types of non-personal data we
      may collect and use include, but are not limited to: (i) device
      properties, including, but not limited to IP address, Media Access
      Control (“MAC”) address and unique device identifier or other device
      identifier ("UDID"); (ii) device software platform and firmware; (iii)
      mobile phone carrier; (iv) geographical data such as post code and
      coarse location;  (v) other non-personal data as reasonably required
      by YPlan to enhance our products and services.
      </li>

      <li>information obtained from your social networking profile, if you log-in via a social
      networking site.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>You are under no obligation to provide any such information. However, if you should choose to withhold requested
  information, we may not be able to provide you with certain services.</p>

  <h3>Uses made of your information</h3>

  <p>We will use the information you provide to:</p>

  <ul>
      <li>help us to build a profile of your preferences so we can offer you events and
      services you are interested in;</li>

      <li>enable us to process your orders and to provide you with the services and information
      offered through the App and which you request;</li>

      <li>administer your account with us;</li>

      <li>verify and carry out financial transactions in relation to payments you make through
      the App;</li>

      <li>share with third parties necessary to process your transactions with us, such as
      credit card companies, banks and ticket dispatchers;</li>

      <li>share with our merchants for the purposes of redeeming the tickets you purchase from
      the App;</li>

      <li>exchange information with other companies for fraud protection and credit risk
      reduction;</li>

      <li>contact you by post, phone or email when necessary to discuss the transactions entered
      into by you on the App;</li>

      <li>audit the downloading of data from the App;</li>

      <li>improve the layout and/or content of the pages of the App and customise them for users;</li>

      <li>identify visitors to the App;</li>

      <li>share with social networking sites at your request; and</li>

      <li>disclose to lawful authorities when required to do so by law.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>We will also use information you provide
  to us for the purposes of contacting you with information or offers regarding
  upcoming events, products, services or surveys. This shall only be done with
  your consent and our direct marketing policy which is explained in full below.</p>

  <h3>Additional information</h3>

  <p>When you visit the App, we may
  automatically collect additional information about you, such as the type of phone
  or operating system you use and, if you came to the website, the type of
  internet browser you use and the website from which you have come to the site.
  Also, depending on whether you access YPlan on your PC or via your mobile
  device, we will collect your IP address (the unique address which identifies
  your home computer on the internet) or the unique identifier (which is linked
  to your mobile device) which are automatically recognised by our servers. You
  cannot be identified solely from this information and it is only used to assist
  us in providing an effective service on the App and to collect broad
  demographic information for aggregate use.</p>

  <p>The website uses cookies to store certain
  information. Cookies are pieces of information that a website transfers to your
  hard drive to store and sometimes track information about you. Although they do
  identify a user's device, cookies do not personally identify users. Cookies are
  specific to the server that created them and cannot be accessed by other
  servers, which means they cannot be used to track your movements around the
  internet.</p>

  <p>For more information about how we use
  cookies and other tracking devices, please refer to our <a href="#cookies_policy">Cookie Policy</a>.</p>

  <h3>Information sharing</h3>

  <p>We may disclose aggregate statistics
  about visitors to the App, customers and sales in order to describe our
  services to prospective partners, advertisers, potential merchants and other
  reputable third parties and for other lawful purposes, but these statistics
  will include no personally identifiable information.</p>

  <p>We may disclose your personal information to any of our affiliates,
  merchants, or to our agents or contractors who assist us in providing the
  services we offer through the App, processing transactions, fulfilling
  requests for information, receiving and sending communications, updating
  marketing lists, analysing data, providing support services or in other
  tasks, from time to time. Our agents and contractors will only use your
  information to the extent necessary to perform their functions.</p>

  <p>In the event that we undergo
  re-organisation or are sold to a third party, you agree that any personal
  information we hold about you may be transferred to that re-organised entity or
  third party.</p>

  <p>We may disclose your personal information
  if required to do so by law or if we believe that such action is necessary to
  prevent fraud or cyber crime or to protect the App or enforce the terms under
  which you transact with us or enforce the rights, property or personal safety
  of any person.</p>

  <h3>Public forums</h3>

  <p>The App may, from time to time, make
  public forums available to its users. Any information that is disclosed
  in these areas becomes public information and you should exercise caution when
  using these and never disclose your personal information.</p>

  <h3>External links</h3>

  <p>The App may, from time to time, contain
  links to external sites. We are not responsible for the privacy policies
  or the content of such sites.</p>

  <h3>Payment processing</h3>

  <p>Payment details you provide will be
  encrypted using industry standard 128 bit secure sockets layer (SSL) technology
  before they are submitted to us or our payment partners over the internet. Payments
  made on the App are made through our payment solutions providers, Braintree Payment Solutions LLC or DataCash Ltd (collectively, our "PSP").
  You will be providing credit or debit card information directly to the
  PSP which operates a secure server to process payment details, encrypting your
  credit/debit card information and authorising payment. We do not store your credit card number or security code
  on our servers, though it may transit through our servers as it passes to PSP. Information which you supply to our PSP is not
  within our control and is subject to PSP's own privacy policy and terms and conditions.</p>

  <h3>Marketing to you</h3>

  <p>We may send you information we think you
  may find useful or which you have requested from us by push notification and/or
  (if you provide us with your e-mail address) by e-mail, including information
  about the latest or upcoming events featured on the App, provided you have
  indicated that you do not object to being contacted for these purposes and we
  will always give you the option to opt-out of receiving further e-mails or push
  notifications by following the unsubscribe instructions on any communications
  sent to you.</p>

  <p>Additionally we may allow our merchants, and if you consent by opting-in
  to receive such information and offers, other carefully selected third
  parties, to send you information directly which you may find useful regarding
  their products and services.</p>

  <p>You can tell us not to contact you with
  information regarding the products or services of third parties, or to share
  your details with third parties so that they can directly send you information
  regarding their products and services, either at the point such information is
  collected on the App (by checking the relevant box), or where you do not wish
  us to continue to use your information in this way by following the unsubscribe
  instructions on any communications sent to you.</p>

  <p>You can also exercise this right at any
  time by contacting us using the contact details at the end of this privacy
  policy.</p>

  <p>When you purchase a ticket from YPlan,
  you may at that time be offered an opportunity to purchase third party products
  or services or enter third party promotions or loyalty programmes. If you
  expressly consent to purchase those products or services or enter into the
  promotions or programmes you authorise us to share your name, e-mail address
  and, where necessary and only where you have consented for us to do so, your
  financial and billing details with that third party merchant. The use of your
  personal information will be governed by the terms of that merchant's own terms
  of supply and privacy policy, so ensure that you read the relevant terms and
  privacy policy carefully before you agree to purchase from, or participate with
  that third party merchant.</p>

  <h3>Your location data</h3>

  <p>In order to get the most out of our
  service and to allow us to provide you with tailored offers, we need to process
  your approximate location from time to time. The types of location data that
  will be processed are your latitude, longitude, cell tower ID, etc. Your
  location data will only be processed for as long as necessary in order for us
  to respond to your request for tailored offers. After this the data will be
  deleted. The location data may be transferred to our merchants for the purpose
  of providing you with the best offers at that time to match your
  preferences.</p>

  <p>You can choose not to allow us to process
  your approximate location at the time you connect to the app, or any time after
  that either by changing the settings on your mobile device or by contacting us
  using the contact details at the end of this privacy policy. Please note that
  if you choose not to allow us to process your location data, we will not have enough
  data in order to provide you with the full benefit of our service (e.g. a list
  of tailored offers matched to your approximate location).</p>

  <h3>Security</h3>

  <p>We place great importance on the security
  of all personally identifiable information associated with our users. We
  have security measures in place to attempt to protect against the loss, misuse
  and alteration of personal information under our control. For example,
  our security and privacy policies are periodically reviewed and enhanced as
  necessary and only authorised personnel have access to personal
  information. Whilst we cannot ensure or guarantee that loss, misuse or alteration
  of information will never occur, we use all reasonable efforts to prevent it.</p>

  <p>You should bear in mind that submission
  of information over the internet is never entirely secure. We cannot guarantee
  the security of information you submit via the App whilst it is in transit over
  the internet and any such submission is at your own risk.</p>

  <h3>Storage of your information</h3>

  <p>Information that you submit via the App
  is sent to and stored on secure servers located in the United Kingdom and other
  European Economic Area countries. This is necessary in order to process the
  information. Information submitted by you may be transferred by us to our other
  offices and/or to the third parties mentioned in the circumstances described
  above, which may be situated outside the European Economic Area and may be
  processed by staff operating outside the European Economic Area. By
  submitting information via the App, you agree to this storing, processing
  and/or transfer.</p>

  <h3>Your rights</h3>

  <p>You have a legal right under the Data
  Protection Act 1998 to a copy of all the personal information about you held by
  us. On request, we will provide you with a copy of this information subject to
  a fee not exceeding £10. You also have a right to correct any errors in
  that information. As mentioned above, you have a right to prevent the use
  of your personal information for direct marketing purposes.</p>

  <h3 id="cookies_policy">YPlan Cookies Policy</h3>

  <p>When you interact with the App, we try to make that experience simple and meaningful.
  When you visit our App our Web server sends a cookie to your computer or mobile
  device (depending on how you access the site). Cookies are small pieces
  of information which are issued to your computer when you visit a website and
  which store and sometimes track information about your use of the site. A
  number of cookies we use last only for the duration of your web session and expire
  when you close your App. These are known as session cookies. Other
  cookies are used to remember you when you return to the App and will last for
  longer. These are known as persistent cookies.</p>

  We use cookies to:

  <ul>
      <li>remember that you have visited us before; this means we can identify the number of
      unique visitors we receive. This allows us to make sure we have enough
      capacity for the number of users that we get;</li>
      <li>customise elements of the promotional layout and/or content of the pages of the site;
      and</li>
      <li>collect statistical information about how you use the site so that we can improve
      the site and learn which parts of the website are most popular to
      visitors.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Some of the cookies used by our App are set by us, and some are set by third parties who
  are delivering services on our behalf. For example, social networking sites.</p>

  <p>Most web browsers automatically accept cookies but, if you prefer, you can change your
  browser to prevent that or to notify you each time a cookie is set. You
  can also learn more about cookies by visiting <a href="http://www.allaboutcookies.org/">www.allaboutcookies.org</a> which
  includes additional useful information on cookies and how to block
  cookies using different types of browser. Please note however, that by blocking
  or deleting cookies used on the site you may not be able to take full advantage
  of the App if you do so.</p>

  <p>In addition to
  cookies, tracking Gifs may be set by us or third parties in respect of your use
  of the site. Tracking Gifs are small image files within the content of
  our site or the body of our newsletters so we or third parties can understand what
  parts of the website are visited or whether particular content is of interest.</p>

  <p>Please also look at our privacy policy which gives details about how
  we use any personal information you give us.</p>

  <h3>Contacting us</h3>

  
  <p>Please submit any questions, concerns or
  comments you have about this privacy policy or any requests concerning your
  personal data by email to <a href="mailto:privacy@yplanapp.com">privacy@yplanapp.com</a>,
