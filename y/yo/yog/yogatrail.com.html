<h3>What is Covered Under this Privacy Policy</h3>
<p>This Policy applies to all of the Services offered by YogaTrail Inc. (“YogaTrail”, “we”, “us”, “ours”, “our Website”, "the Platform").

Personal information is any information about you that is personally identifiable (including your first and last name, telephone number, postal and e-mail addresses, username and password, IP address, etc.), and that is not commonly publicly available. This policy does not apply to practices of companies that are not owned or controlled by us, or to people who are not employed, or managed by us. </p>

<h3>Accessing Your Information</h3>
<p>We take all reasonable steps to ensure that your information is accurate, and complete.

YogaTrail disclaims any liability in relation to the deletion or retention (subject to the terms herein) of information or any obligation not to delete the information. </p>
<h3>Information Security and Confidentiality</h3>
<p>We want you to feel confident about using YogaTrail, and we are committed to protecting all the information we collect. </p>
<p>We have implemented appropriate administrative, technical, and physical security measures to protect the personal information you provide to us against unauthorized access and/or unauthorized alteration, disclosure, or destruction. We limit or restrict access to personal information about you to our employees (sometimes including our contractors or agents) who we believe reasonably need to be able to access that information to provide or develop services or to otherwise perform their jobs. </p>
<p>In addition, in order to help secure your personal information, access to your data on YogaTrail is password-protected, and sensitive data (such as credit card information) is protected by SSL encryption when it is exchanged between your web browser and the YogaTrail Website. We also employ firewalls and intrusion detection systems to help prevent unauthorized persons from gaining access to your information.</p>
<p>To protect any data stored on our servers, YogaTrail also regularly audits its system for possible vulnerabilities and attacks, and we use a tier-one secured-access data center. However, since the Internet is not a 100% secure environment, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to YogaTrail. There is no guarantee that information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards. It is your responsibility to protect the security of your login information. Please note that emails, direct messaging, and similar means of communication with other Users of YogaTrail are not encrypted, and we strongly advise you not to communicate any confidential information through these means. </p>

We may send you emails that inform you about the features of the Services, and we may also send you service messages relating to the functioning of the Services. We may also send you messages with promotional information directly or on behalf of our partners, unless you have opted out of receiving such information. You can change your e-mail and contact preferences at any time by logging into your account and changing the settings related to your email notification choices. </p>
<p>Please be aware that you cannot opt-out of receiving our critical service messages while you are a registered User. Also, if we send communications to you via the carrier service with which you have a mobile communications subscription or otherwise have access, you should understand that you will pay any service fees associated with your receipt of such messages on your mobile device (including text messaging charges). </p>
<h3>Children's Privacy</h3>
<p>YogaTrail is a general audience site and does not offer services directed to children. Should an individual whom we know to be a child under age 13 send personal information to us, we will delete or destroy such information as soon as reasonably possible. </p>

</h3><p>Parts of the YogaTrail Website contain links to other websites. Please be aware that those external websites do not operate under this Privacy Policy. We recommend that you examine the privacy statements posted on those other websites to understand their procedures for collecting, using, and disclosing personal information. </p>
<h3>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h3>
