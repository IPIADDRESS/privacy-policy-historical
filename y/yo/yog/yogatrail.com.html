We retain the right to review our data collection, storage, and processing practices to ensure that we only collect, store, and process the personal information needed to provide or improve our Services.  We take reasonable steps to ensure that the personal information we process is accurate, complete, and current, but it is incumbent upon our Users to update and/or correct their personal information whenever necessary.</p>

<ul><li>To satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process, or enforceable governmental request (which may include, but is not limited to, responding to subpoenas, court orders, or legal process, or establishing or exercising our legal rights or defending against legal claims or as otherwise required by law); in such cases we reserve the right to raise or waive any legal objection or right available to us;</li>

</ul><p>If you create a profile on YogaTrail, certain information on your profile (such as profile picture, name, location, reviews and other content contributed) will be publicly viewable and identifiable. Additionally, through our member-to-member communications programs, other registered YogaTrail Users may contact you by using YogaTrail as an intermediary. YogaTrail will not share your email address with any other members nor display it in any public manner. </p>
<p>In order to invite others to join our Website, you may use the Services to send invitations to email addresses of people you know if they are not registered Users of YogaTrail. The names and email addresses of people you invite will be used to send your invitations and reminders. Please note that when you send an invitation to connect to another User, that User will have access to your email address because it will be displayed in the invitation.</p>
<p>You should be aware that when you contribute any Content to YogaTrail, you may be identifiable by other Users of our Website. Any personally identifiable information you choose to provide there can be seen, collected, or used by other Users, as well as Developers and other third parties. YogaTrail is not responsible for the information you choose to submit when participating in any area of the Website. Also, some content on YogaTrail may be public and searchable on the Internet. If you would like us to remove one of your reviews, please <a href="http://www.yogatrail.com/contact-us-form">contacting us</a> and we will remove your review. However, please note that ideas you post and information you share may be seen and used by other Users, and we cannot guarantee that other Users have not made copies of or use the ideas and information that you share with others on YogaTrail.</p>
<p>Other than as set out above, you will be notified when personal information about you will be shared with third parties, and you will have an opportunity to choose not to allow us to share such information. </p>
<p>We also may share certain pieces of aggregated anonymous information with third parties, including Premium Members of YogaTrail, advertisers and investors. For example, we may tell our advertisers the number of visitors our website receives, or how many users click on a particular advertisement. This information does not contain any personal information, and is used to develop content and services that we hope you will find of interest. </p>
<h3>Accessing Your Information</h3>
<p>We take reasonable steps to ensure that your information is relevant to its intended use, accurate, and complete. You can access and edit your information by visiting your Profile administration page on the YogaTrail Website, at any time. You can request that your YogaTrail account be deleted at any time by <a href="http://www.yogatrail.com/contact-us-form">contacting us</a>. Please note that after you close an account, you will not be able to sign in or access any of your personal information. If you close your account, we have no obligation to retain your information, and may delete any or all of your account information without liability. Please also note that we may retain certain data contributed by you and information associated with your account in our archives, if we believe that it may be necessary to prevent fraud or future abuse, or for legitimate business purposes such as analysis of aggregated, non-personally identifiable data, account recovery, as well as for record-keeping integrity, or if required by law. For example, invitations you sent to other Users via YogaTrail, as well as your contributions to any part of the Website may remain visible to others after you have closed your account. Similarly, other information you have shared with other Users, or that other Users have copied, may also remain visible. YogaTrail disclaims any liability in relation to the deletion or retention (subject to the terms herein) of information or any obligation not to delete the information. </p>
<h3>Information Security and Confidentiality</h3>
<p>We want you to feel confident about using YogaTrail, and we are committed to protecting the information we collect. We have implemented appropriate administrative, technical, and physical security measures to protect the personal information you provide to us against unauthorized access to and/or unauthorized alteration, disclosure, or destruction. We limit or restrict access to personal information about you to our employees (including our contractors or agents) who we believe reasonably need to know that information to provide or develop services or to otherwise perform their jobs. </p>
<p>In addition, in order to help secure your personal information, access to your data on YogaTrail is password-protected, and sensitive data (such as credit card information) is protected by SSL encryption when it is exchanged between your web browser and the YogaTrail Website. We also employ firewalls and intrusion detection systems to help prevent unauthorized persons from gaining access to your information.</p>
<p>To protect any data stored on our servers, YogaTrail also regularly audits its system for possible vulnerabilities and attacks, and we use a tier-one secured-access data center. However, since the Internet is not a 100% secure environment, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to YogaTrail. There is no guarantee that information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards. It is your responsibility to protect the security of your login information. Please note that emails, direct messaging, and similar means of communication with other Users of YogaTrail are not encrypted, and we strongly advise you not to communicate any confidential information through these means. </p>
<h3>YogaTrail Communications</h3>
<p>As described in our <a href="http://www.yogatrail.com/terms-of-service">Terms of Service</a>, we will communicate with you through email, notices posted on our website, messages to your YogaTrail Message Account, or through other means available through the service, which may include mobile text messages. We may send you emails that inform you about the features of the Services, and we may also send you service messages relating to the functioning of the Services. We may also send you messages with promotional information directly or on behalf of our partners, unless you have opted out of receiving promotional information. You can change your e-mail and contact preferences at any time by logging into your account and changing the settings related to your email notification choices. </p>
<p>Please be aware that you cannot opt-out of receiving our service messages while you are a registered User. Also, if we send communications to you via the carrier service with which you have a mobile communications subscription or otherwise have access, you should understand that you will pay any service fees associated with your receipt of such messages on your mobile device (including text messaging charges). </p>
<h3>Children's Privacy</h3>
<p>YogaTrail is a general audience site and does not offer services directed to children. Should an individual whom we know to be a child under age 13 send personal information to us, we will delete or destroy such information as soon as reasonably possible. </p>
<h3>External Links
</h3><p>Parts of the YogaTrail Website contain links to other websites. Please be aware that those external websites do not operate under this Privacy Policy. We recommend that you examine the privacy statements posted on those other websites to understand their procedures for collecting, using, and disclosing personal information. </p>
<h3>Your Obligations</h3>
<p>As a User, you have certain obligations to other Users. Some of these obligations are imposed by applicable laws and regulations, and others are commonplace in user-friendly communities of like-minded members such as YogaTrail: </p>
<ul><li>You must, at all times, abide by the terms and conditions of the then-current Privacy Policy and <a href="http://www.yogatrail.com/terms-of-service">Terms of Service</a>. This includes respecting all intellectual property rights that may belong to third parties (such as trademarks or photographs);</li>
<li>You must not download or otherwise disseminate any information that may be deemed to be injurious, violent, offensive, racist or xenophobic, or which may otherwise violate the purpose and spirit of YogaTrail and its community of Users;</li>
<li>You must not provide to YogaTrail and/or other Users information that you believe might be injurious or detrimental to yourself or others;</li>
<li>You must keep your username and password confidential and not share it with others.</li>
</ul><p>Any violation of these guidelines may lead to the restriction, suspension, or termination of your account at the sole discretion of YogaTrail.</p>
<h3>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h3>
<p>We reserve the right to update and/or change this Privacy Policy in the future. We will notify our members about material changes to this Privacy Policy by either sending a notice to the e-mail address you provided to us or by placing a prominent notice on our Website. </p>
