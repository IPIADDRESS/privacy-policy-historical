    <p><strong>Information  Collection and Use</strong> </p>
    <p>YouHot.com is an online service that allows its users to  communicate and share videos, pictures, and other information.&nbsp; The personally identifiable information you  choose to provide on this Website is used to operate, maintain, and provide you  the features and functionality of the Website, as well as provide personalized  features to you.&nbsp; Please be aware that  any personal information or video content that you voluntarily disclose online  (on your profile page, in publicly accessible areas of the Website, in  discussion groups, messages, etc.) becomes publicly available and can be  viewed, read, collected, or used by others.&nbsp;  YouHot.com is not responsible for the personally identifiable  information you choose to submit in these online areas.</p>
    <p><em>Registration</em>:&nbsp; In order to use the YouHot.com Website, you  must first complete the registration form and create a user name and password,  which is used to protect your account from unauthorized access.&nbsp; During registration you are required to give  your email address, which we may use to send updates, a newsletter, or news  regarding the service.&nbsp; YouHot.com will  also communicate with you in response to your inquiries, to provide the  services you request, and to manage your account.&nbsp; YouHot.com will send you strictly  service-related announcements on rare occasions when it is necessary to do so.</p>

    <p><em>Log  Files</em>:&nbsp; We gather certain  non-personally identifiable information automatically and store it in log  files.&nbsp; This aggregate information  includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service  provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and  clickstream data.&nbsp; YouHot.com uses this  aggregate information, which does not identify individual users, to analyze trends,  to administer the Website, to track users’ movements around the Website and to  gather demographic information about our user base as a whole.</p>
    <p><em>Cookies</em>:&nbsp; A cookie is a small text file that is stored  on a user’s computer for record-keeping purposes. &nbsp;YouHot.com uses cookies on this Website.&nbsp; YouHot.com does not link the information we  store in cookies to any personally identifiable information you submit while on  our Website.&nbsp; If you reject cookies, you  may still use our Website, but your ability to use some areas of our Website,  such as <strong>[need a few examples]</strong>, will  be limited.&nbsp; Some of our advertisers use  cookies on our Website.&nbsp; YouHot.com has  no access to or control over these cookies. </p>
