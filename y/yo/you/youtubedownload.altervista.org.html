YTD may make changes to the Privacy Policy, any YTD Platform, content, or services at any time. The latest Privacy Policy will be posted or be available through <a href="/privacy.htm">http://youtubedownload.altervista.org/privacy.htm</a>, and You agree that You should and will always review it prior to using any YTDSite or Software or services.

If You do not cease using the (each and every) YTD Platform (i.e., Site, Software and service) right away and uninstall the Software right away, You will be conclusively   deemed to have accepted the change(s). Except as stated elsewhere, any amended Privacy Policy shall automatically be effective as soon as it is initially posted, except if YTD states that it is giving advance notice of any amended term to be effective on a date in the future. Please check the Privacy Policy and any guidelines periodically for changes. Except as posted by YTD to the <a href="/privacy.htm">http://youtubedownload.altervista.org/privacy.htm</a> page, this Privacy Policy may not be otherwise amended, and no term may be waived by YTD, except in a writing, hand signed by pen on paper (or as set forth below) by You and an authorized representative of YTD.

No YTD Platform is intended for children <strong>under the age of 13</strong>. YTD does not target its services or Platforms to children under 13. YTD does not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under the age of 13. IF YOU ARE UNDER 13 YEARS OF AGE, PLEASE DO NOT USE OR ACCESS ANY YTD PLATFORM AT ANY TIME OR IN ANY MANNER. IF YTD LEARNS THAT PERSONALLY-IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION OF PERSONS LESS THAN 13 YEARS OF AGE HAS BEEN COLLECTED ON OR THROUGH A YTD PLATFORM, YTD WILL TAKE THE APPROPRIATE STEPS TO DELETE THIS INFORMATION.
<br><br>

<strong>Third Party Sites, Third Party services, and Third Party Materials</strong>
<br><br>
Please be aware that the terms of our Privacy Policy do not apply to Third Party Sites, Third Party services or Third Party Materials that have links or are provided through any YTD Platform. Third party providers of such Third Party Sites, Third Party services or Third Party Materials, may collect (via tracking technologies like Cookies or web beacons) and use Anonymous Information regarding your interaction with the Third Party Sites, Third Party services or Third Party Materials that they deliver and with which you interact.
<br><br>
<strong>NOTICE TO EUROPEAN USERS</strong>
<br><br>
The information You enter on or through a YTD Platform or otherwise provide to YTD may be transferred outside of the European Union to the United States of America, which does not offer an equivalent level of protection to that required in the European Union. In particular, You are advised that the United States of America uses a sectoral model of privacy protection that relies on a mix of legislation, governmental regulation, and self-regulation. Article 26 of the European Union's Data Protection Directive (Directive 95/46/EC, 1995 O.J. (L 281) 31) allows for transfer of personal data from the European Union to a third country if the individual has unambiguously given his consent to the transfer of personal information, regardless of the third country's level of protection. By agreeing to the Terms and this Privacy Policy, You consent to the transfer of all such information to the United States of America, which may not offer an equivalent level of protection to that required in the European Union and to the processing of that information by YTD on its servers located in the United States of America as described in this Privacy Policy.
<br><br>
<strong>Security</strong>
<br><br>
We make reasonable efforts to protect your Personal information, but no company, including us, can fully eliminate security risks connected to handling information on the internet.
<br><br>
<strong>Privacy Policy Updates</strong>
<br><br>
This Privacy Policy may be amended at any time in accordance with the section titled "Updates" in the <a href="/terms.htm">Terms of Use</a>.
