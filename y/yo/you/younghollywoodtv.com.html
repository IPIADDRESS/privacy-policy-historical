WHAT INFORMATION WE COLLECT</strong><br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Information You Provide to Us</span><br><br> You don’t have to create an account to use some of our Services. However if you do choose to create an account and sign up for a Service, we may collect a variety of information from you for that Service based on what you provide to us, such as: name, birth date or age range, gender, and email or physical address. If you are paying for the Service, standard payment and billing information is required. We do not require users to provide their race, ethnicity, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, trade union membership, physical or mental health, sexual orientation or criminal record in their account. Please do not post or add personal data to your account that you would not want to be publicly available.<br><br> Depending on which Services you choose to use, additional information may be collected and stored, if necessary in order for us to provide a particular Service.

When you use the Service on a mobile platform, we may also collect and record your unique device ID (persistent / non-persistent), hardware type, media access control (“MAC”) address, international mobile equipment identity (“IMEI”), your device name, and your location (based on your IP address). We may also collect information regarding your activity on the Service (both individually and on an aggregate basis) and your interactions with other users of the Service.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Information from Third Parties and Advertisers</span><br><br> We work with third party advertisers, networks, and service providers who assist us in managing or providing the Service (e.g., payment processors) and who collect some of the information described above. These third parties also help us understand how users interact with our content or offerings. We may also collect contextual or demographic data about our users from third parties, in order to more effectively deliver the Service or content in which we think you would be interested. Unless you have been notified otherwise, all information collected through our authorized third party service providers remains governed by security and confidentiality obligations consistent with this Policy and applicable law.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Advertisements</span><br><br> Some of our Services allow advertisers and their networks to collect and use certain anonymous Information about you (e.g. click stream information, browser type, time and date, subject of advertisements clicked or scrolled over) in order to provide advertisements of interest to you. These companies typically use a cookie or third party web beacon to collect this information. To learn more about this behavioral advertising practice or to opt-out of this type of advertising, you can visit networkadvertising.org.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Cookies and Similar Technologies</span><br><br> We use cookies and similar technologies (e.g. web beacons, pixel tags, or other device identifiers) to store login information and recognize you and/or your device(s) on, off, and across different Services and devices. You can control cookies through your browser settings and other tools.&nbsp; Cookies are text files that contain a certain amount of information and are downloaded to your computer or mobile device when you visit a website. They are useful because they allow websites to recognize a user’s device. They are then returned to the original website on each subsequent visit or to any other website that recognizes them. For more information on cookies, go to http://www.allaboutcookies.org. &nbsp;<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Other</span><br><br> Our Services are dynamic, and we often introduce new features, which may require the collection of new information. If we collect materially different personal data or materially change how we use your data, we will notify you and may also modify this Privacy Policy.<br><br> In addition, the Websites use Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google, Inc. (“Google”).&nbsp; Google Analytics and Young Hollywood LLC's business partners use Cookies to help analyze how users use the Websites. The information generated by the Cookie about your use of the Websites will be transmitted to and stored by Google on servers in the United States. Google and Young Hollywood LLCs business partners will use this information for the purpose of evaluating your use of the Websites, compiling reports on activity for operators and providing other services relating to internet usage.&nbsp; Google and Young Hollywood LLC’s business partners may also transfer this information to third parties when required to do so by law, or where such third parties process the information on Google’s or Young Hollywood LLC’s business partners’ behalf.<br><br><strong>3. WHY WE COLLECT AND HOW WE USE YOUR INFORMATION</strong><br><br> How we use your Information will depend on which Services you use, how you use those Services and the choices you make in your settings. The primary reason we collect Information is to provide and improve our Services, manage your account and subscription to our Service, and to provide you with a more customized experience on our Services.<br><br> The following is a summary of more specific ways we may use your personal information:</p><ul style="margin-left: 20px;"><li style="list-style: outside;">To provide payment processing and account management, operate, measure and improve our Services, keep our Services safe, secure and operational, and customize Website content</li><li style="list-style: outside;">To contact you regarding your account, to respond to your requests or questions, to troubleshoot problems with your account, to resolve a dispute, to collect fees or monies owed or as otherwise necessary to provide you customer service</li><li style="list-style: outside;">To send you transactional communications. For example, we might send you emails about your purchase or to confirm your registration for an event. We might also contact you about this policy or our website terms</li><li style="list-style: outside;">To provide other services requested by you as described when we collect the Information</li><li style="list-style: outside;">For marketing purposes. For example, we might send you information about events or special promotions. We might also tell you about new features or products. To learn about your choices for these communications, read Section 8.2 below</li><li style="list-style: outside;">We may also use push notifications on our mobile apps to send you various alerts and updates</li><li style="list-style: outside;">To improve our Services, for example by reviewing information associated with stalled or crashed pages experienced by users allowing us to identify and fix problems and give you a better experience</li><li style="list-style: outside;">For security purposes. To prevent, detect, mitigate, and investigate fraud, security breaches or other potentially prohibited or illegal activities and/or attempts to harm our users</li><li style="list-style: outside;">To monitor and improve the information security of our Websites and mobile applications</li><li style="list-style: outside;">To enforce our <a href="http://www.younghollywood.com/info/terms-and-conditions.html">Terms of Use</a>, this Policy, or other policies, and to monitor for violations of our policies or applicable laws</li><li style="list-style: outside;">We also use Information as otherwise described in this Policy, permitted by law, or as we may notify you.</li></ul><p><strong>4. HOW YOUR INFORMATION IS SHARED</strong><br><br><strong>4.1 Sharing by you</strong><br><br> Certain Services offered are social by their very nature, so your participation in such a Service will allow others to see your name and/or username, profile picture, social profile, and any other content you upload or disclose through that profile.<br><br><strong>4.2 Sharing by us</strong><br><br> We share your Information with third parties as listed below and as otherwise described elsewhere in this Policy:<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Service Providers</span><br><br> We employ and allow third parties to perform tasks on our behalf, such as payment processing, data management and analytics, marketing, advertising, communication and IT services, and we need to share your Information with them in order for them to provide such products and services. Unless we tell you differently or you consent otherwise, these third parties do not have any right to use your Information beyond what is necessary to assist us in providing such products and services. Any uses of your Information by these third parties will remain governed by security and confidentiality obligations consistent with this Policy and applicable law.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Company Affiliates</span><br><br> Subject to applicable laws, we may share your Information with companies with whom the Company is affiliated or related to (e.g., parent company or subsidiaries), and will require such affiliated or related companies to use the Information solely in accordance with this Policy.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Business Transfers</span><br><br> We may choose to buy or sell assets. In these types of transactions, customer Information is typically one of the business assets that would be transferred. Also, if we (or our assets) are acquired or merged, or if we go out of business, enter bankruptcy, or go through some other change of control, Information would be one of the assets transferred to or acquired by a third party.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Protection of Company and Others</span><br><br> We reserve the right to access, read, preserve, and disclose any Information that we reasonably believe is necessary to comply with law or court order; enforce or apply our conditions of use and other agreements; or protect the rights, property, interests, or safety of our Company, our employees, our users, or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Aggregated and Anonymized Information</span><br><br> We also may share (within our affiliated entities or with third parties) aggregated or anonymized information that does not explicitly identify you or any individual user of our Services. From time to time, the Company may provide demographic and statistical information to prospective partners for the purposes of securing advertising and/or for general promotion of the Service. This disclosure will not share any personal information of individual users but is intended to give a broad overview of the Service’s membership.<br><br><strong>5. THE SECURITY OF YOUR INFORMATION</strong><br><br> The security of your Information is important to us. We take commercially reasonable security measures, including administrative, technical, and physical safeguards, to protect your Information from loss, theft, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction.<br><br> Your account is protected by a password for your privacy and security. You must prevent unauthorized access to your account and Information by selecting and protecting your password and/or other sign-on mechanism appropriately. To help protect your Information, you should not share your account information or password, reuse your password on other sites, or use a password you have used on other sites.<br><br> We endeavor to protect the privacy of your account and other Information we hold in our records, but we cannot guarantee complete security.

We attempt to notify users about legal demands for their personal data when appropriate in our judgment, unless prohibited by law or court order or when the request is an emergency. We may dispute such demands when we believe, in our discretion, that the requests are overbroad, vague or lack proper authority, but we do not promise to challenge every demand.<br><br><em>Effective: May 25, 2018</em></p></div></div></div></div><div id="system-message-container"></div><style>    .divtohi {

WHY WE COLLECT AND HOW WE USE YOUR INFORMATION</strong><br><br> How we use your Information will depend on which Services you use, how you use those Services and the choices you make in your settings. The primary reason we collect Information is to provide and improve our Services, manage your account and subscription to our Service, and to provide you with a more customized experience on our Services.<br><br> The following is a summary of more specific ways we may use your personal information:</p><ul style="margin-left: 20px;"><li style="list-style: outside;">To provide payment processing and account management, operate, measure and improve our Services, keep our Services safe, secure and operational, and customize Website content</li><li style="list-style: outside;">To contact you regarding your account, to respond to your requests or questions, to troubleshoot problems with your account, to resolve a dispute, to collect fees or monies owed or as otherwise necessary to provide you customer service</li><li style="list-style: outside;">To send you transactional communications. For example, we might send you emails about your purchase or to confirm your registration for an event. We might also contact you about this policy or our website terms</li><li style="list-style: outside;">To provide other services requested by you as described when we collect the Information</li><li style="list-style: outside;">For marketing purposes. For example, we might send you information about events or special promotions. We might also tell you about new features or products. To learn about your choices for these communications, read Section 8.2 below</li><li style="list-style: outside;">We may also use push notifications on our mobile apps to send you various alerts and updates</li><li style="list-style: outside;">To improve our Services, for example by reviewing information associated with stalled or crashed pages experienced by users allowing us to identify and fix problems and give you a better experience</li><li style="list-style: outside;">For security purposes. To prevent, detect, mitigate, and investigate fraud, security breaches or other potentially prohibited or illegal activities and/or attempts to harm our users</li><li style="list-style: outside;">To monitor and improve the information security of our Websites and mobile applications</li><li style="list-style: outside;">To enforce our <a href="http://www.younghollywood.com/info/terms-and-conditions.html">Terms of Use</a>, this Policy, or other policies, and to monitor for violations of our policies or applicable laws</li><li style="list-style: outside;">We also use Information as otherwise described in this Policy, permitted by law, or as we may notify you.</li></ul><p><strong>4. HOW YOUR INFORMATION IS SHARED</strong><br><br><strong>4.1 Sharing by you</strong><br><br> Certain Services offered are social by their very nature, so your participation in such a Service will allow others to see your name and/or username, profile picture, social profile, and any other content you upload or disclose through that profile.<br><br><strong>4.2 Sharing by us</strong><br><br> We share your Information with third parties as listed below and as otherwise described elsewhere in this Policy:<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Service Providers</span><br><br> We employ and allow third parties to perform tasks on our behalf, such as payment processing, data management and analytics, marketing, advertising, communication and IT services, and we need to share your Information with them in order for them to provide such products and services. Unless we tell you differently or you consent otherwise, these third parties do not have any right to use your Information beyond what is necessary to assist us in providing such products and services. Any uses of your Information by these third parties will remain governed by security and confidentiality obligations consistent with this Policy and applicable law.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Company Affiliates</span><br><br> Subject to applicable laws, we may share your Information with companies with whom the Company is affiliated or related to (e.g., parent company or subsidiaries), and will require such affiliated or related companies to use the Information solely in accordance with this Policy.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Business Transfers</span><br><br> We may choose to buy or sell assets. In these types of transactions, customer Information is typically one of the business assets that would be transferred. Also, if we (or our assets) are acquired or merged, or if we go out of business, enter bankruptcy, or go through some other change of control, Information would be one of the assets transferred to or acquired by a third party.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Protection of Company and Others</span><br><br> We reserve the right to access, read, preserve, and disclose any Information that we reasonably believe is necessary to comply with law or court order; enforce or apply our conditions of use and other agreements; or protect the rights, property, interests, or safety of our Company, our employees, our users, or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Aggregated and Anonymized Information</span><br><br> We also may share (within our affiliated entities or with third parties) aggregated or anonymized information that does not explicitly identify you or any individual user of our Services. From time to time, the Company may provide demographic and statistical information to prospective partners for the purposes of securing advertising and/or for general promotion of the Service. This disclosure will not share any personal information of individual users but is intended to give a broad overview of the Service’s membership.<br><br><strong>5. THE SECURITY OF YOUR INFORMATION</strong><br><br> The security of your Information is important to us. We take commercially reasonable security measures, including administrative, technical, and physical safeguards, to protect your Information from loss, theft, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction.<br><br> Your account is protected by a password for your privacy and security. You must prevent unauthorized access to your account and Information by selecting and protecting your password and/or other sign-on mechanism appropriately. To help protect your Information, you should not share your account information or password, reuse your password on other sites, or use a password you have used on other sites.<br><br> We endeavor to protect the privacy of your account and other Information we hold in our records, but we cannot guarantee complete security. Unauthorized entry or use, hardware or software failure, and other factors, may compromise the security of user information at any time.<br><br><strong>6. WHERE YOUR INFORMATION WILL BE HELD</strong><br><br> In order to provide the Service, the Information that we collect from you may be transferred to and stored at a destination outside of your country and the European Economic Area (“EEA”), and, in particular, the United States. It may also be processed by any service providers appointed by us who operate outside of the EEA and their staff.

Lawful bases include consent (where you have given consent), contract (where processing is necessary for the performance of a contract with you (e.g. to deliver the Services you have requested)) and “legitimate interests”.<br><br> Where we process Information based on consent, we will ask for your explicit consent. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">You may withdraw your consent at any time, but that will not affect the lawfulness of the processing of your personal data prior to such withdrawal.</span><br><br> Where we rely on contract, we will ask that you agree to the processing of personal data that is necessary for entering into or performance of your contract with us. We provide a voluntary service; you can choose whether or not you want to use the Services. However, if you want to use the Services, you need to agree to our <a href="http://www.younghollywood.com/info/terms-and-conditions.html">Terms of Use</a>, which set out the contract between the Company and you. As we operate in countries worldwide (including the US) and use technical infrastructure in the US to deliver the Services to you, in accordance with the contract between us, we may need to transfer your Information to the US and to other jurisdictions as necessary to provide the Services.<br><br> Where we rely on legitimate interests as a basis for Information processing, you have the right to object. We may process your personal data for the purposes of our legitimate interests or for the legitimate interests of third parties, provided that such processing shall not outweigh your rights and freedoms. For example, we may process your personal Information to:<br><br> Protect you, us, or others from threats (such as security threats or fraud)</p><ul style="margin-left: 20px;"><li style="list-style: outside;">Comply with laws that apply to us</li><li style="list-style: outside;">Enable or administer our business, such as for quality control, consolidated reporting, and customer service</li><li style="list-style: outside;">Manage corporate transactions, such as mergers or acquisitions</li><li style="list-style: outside;">Understand and improve our business or customer relationships generally</li><li style="list-style: outside;">Enable us and our users to connect with each other, view content, express opinions, exchange information, and conduct business</li><li style="list-style: outside;">If you have any questions about the lawful bases upon which we collect and use your Information, please contact our legal department at <script type="text/javascript"><!--

YOUR CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS</strong><br><br> Under California Civil Code Sections 1798.83-1798.84, California residents are entitled to ask us for a notice identifying the categories of personal Information that we share with our affiliates and/or third parties for marketing purposes, and providing contact information for such affiliates and/or third parties. If you are a California resident and would like a copy of this notice, please submit a written request to the following address: Young Hollywood LLC: Attn: Legal Department, 150 S. Rodeo Drive #3 Beverly Hills, CA 90212.&nbsp; We will respond to one request per California customer each year, and we do not respond to requests made by means other than as set forth above.<br><br> California Do Not Track Disclosure: Do Not Track is a privacy preference that users can set in their web browsers. When a user turns on the Do Not Track signal, the browser sends a message to websites requesting them not to track the user. At this time, we do not respond to Web browser “do not track” settings or signals. We deploy cookies and other technologies on our Service to collect information about you and your browsing activity, even if you have turned on the Do Not Track signal.<br><br><strong>15. LEGAL DISCLOSURES</strong><br><br> It is possible that we will need to disclose information about you when required by law, subpoena, or other legal process or if we have a good faith belief that disclosure is reasonably necessary to (1) investigate, prevent, or take action regarding suspected or actual illegal activities or to assist government enforcement agencies; (2) enforce our agreements with you, (3) investigate and defend ourselves against any third-party claims or allegations, (4) protect the security or integrity of our Service (such as by sharing with companies facing similar threats); or (5) exercise or protect the rights and safety of the Company, our users, personnel, or others. We attempt to notify users about legal demands for their personal data when appropriate in our judgment, unless prohibited by law or court order or when the request is an emergency. We may dispute such demands when we believe, in our discretion, that the requests are overbroad, vague or lack proper authority, but we do not promise to challenge every demand.<br><br><em>Effective:
