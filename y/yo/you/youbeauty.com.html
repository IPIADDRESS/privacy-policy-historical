        <h3>Want to look younger? Eat more Vitamin C.</h3>
        <p>Mom was right—you are what you eat. A high intake of vitamin C is tied to a younger appearance. In a survey of 4,025 women, low vitamin C levels were correlated with wrinkles and dryness. Vitamin C helps to build collagen, which strengthens your skin and gives it elasticity. How to start your younger-looking you diet? Eat oranges, guavas, kiwis and papayas, along with red and green bell peppers.</p>
