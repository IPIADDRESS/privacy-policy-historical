<h5>Data you give us:</h5>
<p>When you sign up for the Service, we ask for your username, password and email address. We need this data to identify you and to operate and provide the Service for you, and also to send you important messages about your account and the Service.

If you choose to, you can also give us additional information, like your real name or profile picture, to make your social experience better, but this is totally optional. We collect the content you provide to us when you use our Service. If you enroll to our Service as a teacher use, we also ask for your school name to make sure it’s a real place of education.</p>
<p>If you are in touch with our support agents about resolving issues in the Service or any other issues, we keep the information about your interactions with us to help us provide a better service. We also store all messages sent to our forums to help users find useful information about the Service.</p>
<p>Your payment data is needed to process the billing of your Service subscriptions and other purchases you make.</p>
<p>Sometimes, if we run special campaigns or sweepstakes, like giving out instruments, we may need some additional information from you, such as an address where we can ship the instrument. In these cases, we provide more details to you about why we are collecting the data and how we use it.</p>
<h5>Data we receive from our partners:</h5>
<p>If you decide to log in to our Service with Facebook, we receive from Facebook your Facebook username, real name, e-mail address and profile picture.

<h3>YOUSICIAN’S PARTNERS</h3>
<p>Instead of doing absolutely everything on our own, we have partners that provide services and data processing for us. We have listed the type of partners we use:</p>
<p>We use hosting providers like Amazon Web Services (AWS) to store and deliver our content. These people don’t have access to the data itself but provide the infrastructure we need to provide our services.</p>
<p>Our customer service uses platforms like Zendesk as a tool to provide the best support possible for our users.</p>
<p>Services like MailChimp help us make sure we send the right messages to the right people and only the types of messages you want to receive.</p>
<p>AppsFlyer we use to determine how you learned about us and our Service, and how we can improve our user acquisition.</p>
<p>We use partners and their technologies for our online advertising outside the Services. We run certain analytics ourselves, but we also use partners and their tools for running analytics. The Service includes social media interaction tools provided by our partners. These partners may provide us some data e.g. if you decide to link third party tool to the Service (such as Facebook login) or decide to share content from our Service in social media. These partners may access and collect some of your data and some of them operate under their own privacy policies, which we urge you to check to learn how they use your data. Please check&nbsp;<a href="https://yousician.com/privacy-notice-third-party">here for more information</a>.</p>
<p>Payment partners are the parties who actually process the billing for the Service and deal with banks and credit card companies on our behalf. As this is a big responsibility, we only use trusted, PCI-DSS certified partners.</p>
<p>We also share data with our subsidiaries and affiliates in other countries, like YS North America, which legally and technically are separate entities, although we are all the same group of companies. We may also share information to subsequent owners or their advisors in connection with a corporate merger or other corporate reorganization or a similar arrangement.</p>
<p>If we need to combat fraud or illegal activity, we may exchange data with other companies and organizations. We may also provide data to authorities to respond to their lawful requests.</p>

<p>We have social features in our Service, which means that other users may see your profile data and your activities in the Service, or comments or questions you post in our forums. You can manage the privacy of the social components of the Service through the privacy settings in the Yousician application.</p>

</ul>
</li>

</ul>
<h3>TRANSFERS OF DATA</h3>
<p>Since we also operate outside of Europe, we take additional measures to make sure that there are adequate safeguards in place to protect your data when personal data is transferred outside the European Economic Area (EEA). This includes having standard contractual clauses approved by the EU Commission in place, or that our US based partner is certified under the Privacy Shield to protect your data.</p>
<h3>DATA RETENTION</h3>
<p>We retain your data as long as your user account is active or as needed to provide the Service. You may end this relationship is by deleting your account. We will then delete all your personal data from our own and our partners’ systems, including backups within 30 days, unless there is a legitimate business interest to retain the data, such as to comply with our legal obligations, to enforce our agreements or to resolve disputes. We also periodically review and delete user accounts that have been inactive for five years.</p>
<h3>YOUR RIGHTS</h3>
<p>The&nbsp;<a href="https://www.eugdpr.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GDPR regulation</a>&nbsp;provides our users in the European Union new and important rights to control their own personal data. We comply with all of these new rights requirements. You have the right to access your personal data we store about you. You can send a request from the Privacy menu in the application or on your user profile page to obtain a copy of your data.</p>
<p>You also have the right to be forgotten. If you choose to delete your profile, we will delete all associated information and it will be like you never signed up in the first place (with the exceptions mentioned above, meaning that if we, for a legitimate reason, have the right to retain the data).</p>
<p>The right to rectification simply means that you have the right to correct or update your information. You may do this by editing your personal details on your profile if your information changes or happens to be incorrect. Or you can contact us at&nbsp;<a href="mailto:support@yousician.com">support@yousician.com</a>.</p>
<p>You also have the right to restrict or object to us processing your information, which means e.g. that you can ask us to stop using your information to send you marketing communications. You can opt out from marketing communications via the Yousician application privacy settings or by following the instructions in such communications.</p>
<p>For limiting interest based advertising, please check out your ad tracking settings of your mobile device or web browser. For your Android or iOS device, select “limit ad tracking” (Apple iOS) or “opt-out of interest-based ads” (Android). For opting out of targeted advertising on the web, you can adjust your browser settings to limit certain tracking by cookies or by visit&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youradchoices.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">www.youradchoices.com</a>&nbsp;and/or&nbsp;<a href="https://www.networkadvertising.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">www.networkadvertising.org</a>. See also more information&nbsp;<a href="https://yousician.com/privacy-notice-third-party">here</a>.</p>

We take these matters seriously and will look into all requests and complaints.</p>
<p>Users from European Union member states also have the right to lodge a complaint with the data supervising authorities of their country.</p>
<h3>DATA SECURITY</h3>
<p>Data security is a very big part of keeping your personal data secure in the digital world. We employ highly skilled engineers to manage our internal systems and take technical and organizational steps to make sure that we deliver our product in a secure way to our users. We expect the same level of dedication from our partners. We also make sure that only employees with a need to access personal data have the right to do so.</p>
<h3>COOKIES AND SIMILAR TECHNOLOGIES</h3>
<p>Cookies are small files stored on a user’s computer (or other internet enable device, such as smartphone) when an online service has been used. We and our partners use cookies and similar technologies to provide the Service and personalize it for you, to run analytics and target advertisements. Some of the cookies used in the Service are “first party” cookies, i.e. from the website itself, and others are third party (partner) cookies that belong to the advertising, analytics entities or social networks.</p>
<p>Users can adjust their browser settings to disable cookies or to delete cookies that have been saved in the browser, but this can result some parts of the Service not functioning properly.</p>
