We also retain some of your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, to resolve disputes, to enforce our agreements, to support business operations, and to continue to develop and improve our Services. Where we retain information for Service improvement and development, we take steps to eliminate information that directly identifies you, and we only use the information to uncover collective insights about the use of our Services, not to specifically analyze personal characteristics about you.</p><p><i><b>Information you share on the Services</b></i>: If your account is deactivated or disabled, some of your information and the content you have provided will remain in order to be able to restore your profile.</p><p><i><b>Marketing information</b></i>: If you have elected to receive marketing emails from us, we retain information about your marketing preferences for a reasonable period of time from the date you last expressed interest in our Services, such as when you last opened an email from us or ceased using your YouPic account.  We retain information derived from cookies and other tracking technologies for a reasonable period of time from the date such information was created.</p><p><i><b>Service Providers</b></i>: We work with third-party service providers to provide website and application development, hosting, maintenance, backup, storage, virtual infrastructure, payment processing, analysis and other services for us, which may require them to access or use information about you.  If a service provider needs to access information about you to perform services on our behalf, they do so under close instruction from us, including policies and procedures designed to protect your information.</p></div></div><div class="terms-item"><div class="terms-item-content"><h5>Basically,</h5><h4>We keep your information as long as you're a member.</h4></div></div></section><section class="terms-box"><div class="terms-item"><div class="terms-item-content"><h3>How to access and control your information</h3><p>You have certain choices available to you when it comes to your information. Below is a summary of those choices, how to exercise them and any limitations.</p><h5>Your Choices:</h5><p>You have the right to request a copy of your information, to object to our use of your information (including for marketing purposes), to request the deletion or restriction of your information, or to request your information in a structured, electronic format. Below, we describe the tools and processes for making these requests. You can exercise some of the choices by logging into the Services and using settings available within the Services or your account. Where the Services are administered for you by an administrator (see "Notice to End Users" below), you may need to contact your administrator to assist with your requests first. For all other requests, you may contact us as provided in the Contact Us section below to request assistance.</p><p>Your request and choices may be limited in certain cases: for example, if fulfilling your request would reveal information about another person, or if you ask to delete information which we are permitted by law or have compelling legitimate interests to keep. Where you have asked us to share data with third parties, for example, by sharing on third-party apps, you will need to contact those third-party service providers directly to have your information deleted or otherwise restricted. If you have unresolved concerns, you may have the right to complain to a data protection authority in the country where you live, where you work or where you feel your rights were infringed.</p><p><i><b>Access and update your information</b></i>: Our Services give you the ability to access and update certain information about you from within the Service. For example, you can access your profile information from your account. You can update your profile information within your profile settings and modify content that contains information about you using the editing tools associated with that content.</p><p><i><b>Deactivate your account</b></i>:  If you no longer wish to use our Services, you are able to deactivate your Services account. If you want to deactivate your own account, that setting is available to you in your account settings. Please be aware that deactivating your account does not delete your information.</p><p><i><b>Delete your information</b></i>: Our Services gives you the ability to delete almost all information about you. Please note, however, that we may need to retain certain information for record keeping purposes, to complete transactions or to comply with our legal obligations.</p><p><i><b>Opt out of communications</b></i>: You may opt out of receiving promotional communications from us by using the unsubscribe link within each email, updating your email preferences within your Service account settings menu, or by contacting us as provided below to have your contact information removed from our promotional email list or registration database.  Even after you opt out from receiving promotional messages from us, you will continue to receive transactional messages from us regarding our Services. You can opt out of some notification messages in your account settings.</p></div></div><div class="terms-item"><div class="terms-item-content"><h5>Basically,</h5><h4>You can access or change all your personal data in your account settings.</h4></div></div></section></section></div><footer class="LandingFooter"><div class="container"><section class="layout layout-wrap"><a href="/" class="LandingFooter-logo"><img width="110" height="42" src="/logo/logo.svg?color=black"></a><ul><li>Company</li><li><a href="/about">About</a></li><li><a href="/features">Features</a></li><li><a href="/press">Press</a></li><li><a href="/termconditions">Terms</a></li><li><a href="/privacy">Privacy</a></li></ul><ul><li>Product</li><li><a href="/mobile">Apps &amp; Plugins</a></li><li><a href="/pricing">Pricing</a></li><li><a href="/photographers">Photographers</a></li><li><a href="/academy">Academy</a></li><li><a href="/explore">Explore</a></li></ul><ul><li>Extras</li><li><a href="/contest">Contest</a></li><li><a href="/faq">FAQ</a></li><li><a>Contact us</a></li></ul><div class="LandingFooter-social layout layout-content-end"><a href="https://youpic.com/photographer/YouPicTeam/" target="_blank"><i class="icon-youpic"></i></a><a href="https://www.instagram.com/youpic/" target="_blank"><i class="icon-instagram"></i></a><a href="https://twitter.com/youpic/" target="_blank"><i class="icon-twitter"></i></a><a href="https://www.facebook.com/youpic/" target="_blank"><i class="icon-facebook"></i></a></div></section><div class="layout layout-content-between"><div class="LandingFooter-language"><a>Language: <!-- -->English<!-- --> <i class="icon-arrow_down"></i></a><div class="dropdown bottom dropdown-language"><div class="dropdown-content layout layout-wrap"><span class="dropdown-triangle-bottom"></span><a>English</a><a>Français</a><a>Deutsch</a><a>Español</a><a>Español Latino</a><a>한국어</a><a>Italiano</a><a>日本語</a><a>Nederlands</a><a>Polski</a><a>Português Brasil</a><a>русский</a><a>Српски</a><a>Türkçe</a><a>中文</a><a>עברית</a></div></div></div>© 2019 YouPic</div></div></footer></div></div></div>
