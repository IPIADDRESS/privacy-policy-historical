<h2>YTD™ Video Downloader Basic and YTD™ Video Downloader Pro (collectively, "YTD") Website and Software Privacy Policy</h2>
<br>
<strong>GreenTree Applications, SRL may be referred to herein as "GTA", "YTD", "WE", OR "US", whether in uppercase, lowercase, or a combination.</strong>
<br><br>
By continuing to access and/or use any YTD Site or Software or Platform or service following any update to this Privacy Policy, you are indicating and deemed to have agreed that that you have read, understand, and agree to its updates and modifications and the entirety of the updated Privacy Policy.
<br><br>
Thank You for accessing or having accessed any of YTD's Sites or Software or services, by way of the internet web sites, mobile device, smart-phone, tablet, reader, application or app, software, social media (such as Facebook and Twitter), a video service (such as YouTube or Vimeo) (none of which GTA is affiliated with), or any other device or method now known or developed in the future (individually and collectively, "the," "any," or "a" "YTD Platform" or "YTD Site" or "YTD service" or "YTD Software") (all sometimes collectively referred to as, "Platform). This Privacy Policy details certain policies implemented throughout every YTD Site, Software, Platform and service governing the use of personally identifiable information about users of our various Platforms and users of services available on or through each YTD Platform (the "services"). 
<br><br>
PRIVACY POLICY UPDATES
<br><br>
YTD may make changes to the Privacy Policy, any YTD Platform, content, or services at any time. The latest Privacy Policy will be posted or be available through <a href="/privacy.html">http://www.youtubedownloadersite.com/privacy.html</a>, and You agree that You should and will always review it prior to using any YTDSite or Software or services.
<br><br>
Because of the rapidly evolving nature of the internet, computers, mobile technologies, and other technologies, in our attempts to make our user experience better, and for other aesthetic and business reasons, YTD may change, update and modify the Privacy Policy from time to time. YTD will post its updated Privacy Policy at <a href="/privacy.html">http://www.youtubedownloadersite.com/privacy.html</a> so You may always be aware of what has changed. If any modification is unacceptable to You, You shall cease using the YTD Platform (i.e., Site, Software and service) right away and uninstall the Software right away. If You do not cease using the (each and every) YTD Platform (i.e., Site, Software and service) right away and uninstall the Software right away, You will be conclusively   deemed to have accepted the change(s). Except as stated elsewhere, any amended Privacy Policy shall automatically be effective as soon as it is initially posted, except if YTD states that it is giving advance notice of any amended term to be effective on a date in the future. Please check the Privacy Policy and any guidelines periodically for changes. Except as posted by YTD to the <a href="/privacy.html">http://www.youtubedownloadersite.com/privacy.html</a> page, this Privacy Policy may not be otherwise amended, and no term may be waived by YTD, except in a writing, hand signed by pen on paper (or as set forth below) by You and an authorized representative of YTD. For purposes of this provision, a "writing" does not include an email message, text, chat, or the like, sent from any device existing now or later developed and a signature does not include an electronic signature.
<br><br>
This YTD Privacy Policy ("Privacy Policy") is intended to inform you of YTD's policies and practices regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of your Personal Information through any (each and every) YTD Platform (i.e., Site, Software and service). We define Personal Information as information that allows someone to identify or contact you, including for example your name, address, telephone number, and email address.
<br><br>
By registering with us or accessing or using any YTD Platform (i.e., Site, Software and service), you expressly consent to the information handling practices in this Privacy Policy. If you reside outside the United States, you understand that your personal information may be processed in countries (including the United States) where laws regarding processing personal information may be less stringent than in your country.
<br><br>
This Privacy Policy is a part of our Software EULA <a href="/eula.html">http://www.youtubedownloadersite.com/eula.html</a> and Website Terms of Use <a href="/terms.html">http://www.youtubedownloadersite.com/terms.html</a>. If any term of this Privacy Policy is inconsistent or conflicts with any term of the EULA or Terms of Use, this Privacy Policy will control. Capitalized terms used in this Privacy Policy but not defined in this Privacy Policy have the meanings given to them in the EULA and Terms of Use.
<br><br>
<strong>Personal Information You Provide to us</strong>
<br><br>
When you register to use any YTD Platform (i.e., Site, Software and service), we may collect your name, e-mail address and e-mail preferences, and password for your account. We may also ask you to provide additional information on an optional basis in connection with setting up your account. You may also register by using your log-in credentials from social networking websites, including Facebook, Twitter, or LinkedIn. When you register in this way, we may collect Personal Information from the social networking websites that you have given us permission to collect or made publicly available. The information YTD obtains may depend on your privacy settings with the social networking website. When you purchase any materials, services, or Software from YTD, we may collect your name, phone number, e-mail address, mailing address, billing address, complete credit card information that enables us to receive your payment (however we do not retain your credit card number unless requested) and federal tax identification number or European Union VAT number as applicable. When you give us feedback, we may collect any information that is contained in your feedback. When you contact us by sending us an e-mail, fax, or letter, we collect your e-mail address, fax number, or mailing address, and any information contained in the e-mail, fax, or letter you send us.
<br><br>
<strong>Personal Information Collected via Technology</strong>
<br><br>
As you use any YTD Platform (i.e., Site, Software and service), some information may also be collected passively, including your Internet protocol address, browser type, access time, mobile phone model, and telecom carrier. We may also store a small text file called a "Cookie" on your computer or phone to store certain information about your use of any YTD Platform. We may use both session Cookies (which expire once you close your browser) and persistent Cookies (which stay on your computer or phone until you delete them). We may collect and store information locally on your device using mechanisms such as browser web storage and application data caches.
<br><br>
We may collect details of how you used any YTD Platform. We may share certain information with Google Analytics, for example. (Google's privacy policy is available at http://www.google.com/policies/privacy).
<br><br>
<strong>Use of Information</strong>
<br><br>
We use your Personal Information to provide the YTD Site, Software, and services to you, to respond to requests that you make, to personalize your experience on and using any YTD Platform, to improve any (each and every) YTD Platform, and to better tailor the features, performance, and support of each YTD Platform .
<br><br>
We may use your Personal Information to send you electronic newsletters or promotional e-mails, unless you have requested not to receive such promotional communications from us. We may also use your Personal Information to send you YTD services-related communications, and you may opt out of these communications if you terminate your account.
<br><br>
We may create Anonymous Information records from Personal Information. We reserve the right to use and disclose Anonymous Information at our discretion. "Anonymous Information" means information that is not associated with or linked to your Personal Information.
<br><br>
Any feedback you provide will be governed by the Terms of Use.
<br><br>
<strong>(Additional)Information About Cookies, Web Beacons, Pixels</strong>
<br><br>
Like most sites, We, our analytics providers, and/or our content and ad providers may set or access cookies, web beacons &amp; pixels on your computer (including "mobile" device). We may use such, including those for Google Analytics, to obtain information about your visits to &amp;/or uses of our sites (sometimes referred to as a Platform, and including re-direct sites) and our offerings (including offer windows or pages that may open, including when you choose to start a download &amp;/or installation process, and which may include interstitials or offers for Programs, services, &amp;/or products not mentioned when you choose to learn more about or initiate a download of an offer, Program, product, or service), and other sites. We consider the interstitials/offer windows to be a page that is part of our site or Platform and covered by this Privacy Policy, unless indicated otherwise in connection with an interstitial/offer. Cookies, beacons &amp; pixels help us,  Google, partners, and ad networks understand how our visitors (you) engage with our or their properties, sites, pages, or Platforms, and other sites. They may collect information and report usage data without personally identifying you to Google, such as how often you visit this site (and other sites) and open or proceed with offers, what pages you visit when you do so, and what other sites you visited or used prior to and after coming to this and other sites (including offer windows/pages). We use the information we get from Google Analytics and our cookies, beacons &amp; pixels to improve our sites, Platforms, offerings, and attempt to serve you more relevant ads. Although Google Analytics or we may place a cookie on your web browser or device to identify you as a unique user the next time you visit this site, or our other sites, or Platforms, the Google Analytics cookie cannot be used directly by anyone but Google, which allows us to access analytical information regarding our sites or Platforms. Google Analytics has its own <a href="http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Privacy Policy</a> and <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">currently available opt-outs</a>. You can stop cookies by disabling or removing them, however, this might log you out of websites or change website behavior. As is the case with most websites, simply visiting the website may be your consent to the automatic placing of cookies, pixels, and/or web beacons on your device, which you may clear by clearing your browser of cookies, history, etc. (Please consult the guide for your browser on how to do this.) You may read <a href="http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">here</a> how Google uses data when you visit or use our or partners' sites (including offer windows or pages) and apps,. More information about what may be collected, used, and stored by Us or Google may be found elsewhere within this Privacy Policy (or Privacy Statement) as well as on Google's sites (including <a href="https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/technologies/types/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">here</a> &amp; <a href="https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/analyticsjs/cookie-usage#gajs" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">here</a>). Google Analytics can also be used, together with some of the advertising cookies (which may be described elsewhere), to help show more relevant ads on Google properties (like Google Search) and across the web. 
<br><br>
<strong>Disclosure of Personal Information</strong>
<br><br>
Except as otherwise stated in this Privacy Policy, we do not trade, rent, or share your Personal Information with third parties, unless you ask or authorize us to do so.
<br><br> 
We may provide your Personal Information to specified third parties for sending you promotional e-mails relating to such third parties' products, unless you have requested us not to receive promotional communications from such third parties.
<br><br>

<br><br>
We may share some or all of your Personal Information with our Affiliates in which case we will require our Affiliates to honor this Privacy Policy.
<br><br>
We will not share any Personal Information with any of our app developer partners.
<br><br>

Accordingly, if we go out of business or enter bankruptcy, or if we are acquired, e.g., as a result of a transaction such as a merger, acquisition, or asset sale, your PII may be disclosed or transferred to the third-party acquirer in connection with the transaction.
<br><br>
<strong>Law Enforcement Compliance</strong>
<br><br>
We may be required by law, or by law enforcement officers acting under the color of law, to record some or all of your communications on or through any YTD Platform. We may, and you hereby authorize us to, disclose your Personal Information (including your account information) and your communications with us including through any (each and every) YTD Platform , if required by law or by law enforcement officers acting under the color of law, or if we believe in our sole and unfettered discretion that disclosure is necessary to: (1) satisfy or comply with relevant laws, regulation or legal process;  (2) respond to lawful requests,  or to respond to subpoenas or warrants or court orders served on us; or (3) to protect and defend ours, our Affiliates,' other users,' or your, rights, property or safety; and (4) to prevent or stop activity we consider to be illegal or unethical.	
<br><br>
<strong>Your Choices Regarding Your Personal Information</strong>
<br><br>

<br><br>
You may change your email address and password for the service by editing it in your account page. You may request deletion of your Personal Information by us, but please note that we may be required (by law or otherwise) to keep this information and not delete it (or to keep this information for a certain time, in which case we will comply with your deletion request, only after we have fulfilled such requirements). When we delete Personal Information, it will be deleted from the active database, but may remain in our archives.
<br><br>
<strong>Regarding Children</strong>
<br><br>
We do not intentionally gather Personal Information about Users who are under the age of 13. YTD recognizes the privacy interests of children and we encourage parents and guardians to take an active role in their children's online activities and interests. No YTD Platform is intended for children <strong>under the age of 13</strong>. YTD does not target its services or Platforms to children under 13. YTD does not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under the age of 13. IF YOU ARE UNDER 13 YEARS OF AGE, PLEASE DO NOT USE OR ACCESS ANY YTD PLATFORM AT ANY TIME OR IN ANY MANNER. IF YTD LEARNS THAT PERSONALLY-IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION OF PERSONS LESS THAN 13 YEARS OF AGE HAS BEEN COLLECTED ON OR THROUGH A YTD PLATFORM, YTD WILL TAKE THE APPROPRIATE STEPS TO DELETE THIS INFORMATION.
<br><br>
IF YOU ARE THE PARENT OR LEGAL GUARDIAN OF A CHILD THE AGE OF 13 WHO HAS BECOME A YTD PLATFORM USER, THEN PLEASE CONTACT YTD AT privacy@greentreeapps.ro TO HAVE THAT CHILD'S ACCOUNT TERMINATED AND INFORMATION DELETED.
<br><br>
The following are some resources that may help parents and legal guardians in monitoring and limiting your children's access to certain types of material on the internet. While YTD does not endorse these sites, services, or products, and disclaims any responsibility in connection with them, we provide information about them as a public service.

<strong>Third Party Sites, Third Party services, and Third Party Materials</strong>
<br><br>
Please be aware that the terms of our Privacy Policy do not apply to Third Party Sites, Third Party services or Third Party Materials that have links or are provided through any YTD Platform. Third party providers of such Third Party Sites, Third Party services or Third Party Materials, may collect (via tracking technologies like Cookies or web beacons) and use Anonymous Information regarding your interaction with the Third Party Sites, Third Party services or Third Party Materials that they deliver and with which you interact.
<br><br>
<strong>NOTICE TO EUROPEAN USERS</strong>
<br><br>
The information You enter on or through a YTD Platform or otherwise provide to YTD may be transferred outside of the European Union to the United States of America, which does not offer an equivalent level of protection to that required in the European Union. In particular, You are advised that the United States of America uses a sectoral model of privacy protection that relies on a mix of legislation, governmental regulation, and self-regulation. Article 26 of the European Union's Data Protection Directive (Directive 95/46/EC, 1995 O.J. (L 281) 31) allows for transfer of personal data from the European Union to a third country if the individual has unambiguously given his consent to the transfer of personal information, regardless of the third country's level of protection. By agreeing to the Terms and this Privacy Policy, You consent to the transfer of all such information to the United States of America, which may not offer an equivalent level of protection to that required in the European Union and to the processing of that information by YTD on its servers located in the United States of America as described in this Privacy Policy.
<br><br>
<strong>Security</strong>
<br><br>
We make reasonable efforts to protect your Personal information, but no company, including us, can fully eliminate security risks connected to handling information on the internet.
<br><br>
<strong>Privacy Policy Updates</strong>
<br><br>
This Privacy Policy may be amended at any time in accordance with the section titled "Updates" in the <a href="/terms.html">Terms of Use</a>.
<br><br>
Revised May 11th, 2016, by including clarifying information about Google Analytics, cookies, web beacons, pixels. Effective immediately.
