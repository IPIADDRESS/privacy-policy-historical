YOUNOODLE PRIVACY POLICY<p></p>
<p>Effective as of Sep 3rd, 2012</p>
<p>Welcome to YouNoodle! This document, our Privacy Policy, governs how the data we collect when you access and use the YouNoodle Services and how we use it. This includes both the social website at www.YouNoodle.com (“Social” or the “Site”), and Podium, our competition platform and administration tool.</p>
<p>This Privacy Policy is incorporated as part of the YouNoodle <a href="/terms">Terms of Service</a>. By using the YouNoodle Services you agree to the provisions of this policy. If you do not want to be bound by our Privacy Policy, please do not use the YouNoodle Services!</p>
<p>We take your privacy seriously. If you have any questions about this policy or about privacy at YouNoodle, please contact us at feedback@younoodle.com.</p>
<p>DATA COLLECTED DURING ACCOUNT CREATION</p>
<p>Users with Social Accounts: In order to become a member of YouNoodle Social and send messages to other users, you must create an account. When you create an account we require a username and password. We store this information on our servers along with any additional information you provide about yourself during the sign up process. If you have a Podium account, you can use the same name and password, or choose an different one. If you use the same name and password, your Podium data and Social data will be associated in our database.</p>
<p>You can also login to YouNoodle Social using your Facebook name and password by clicking the Facebook Connect button. By using Facebook Connect, you are allowing YouNoodle to access some Personal Information in your Facebook account pursuant to the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/legal/terms">Facebook Terms of Use</a>. Facebook Connect will pre-populate your account sign-up process with information from your Facebook account</p>
<p>Users with Podium Accounts: In order to participate in, judge or administer a competition that is powered by the Podium platform, you need to create an account on Podium. If you have a Social account, you can use the same name and password, or choose an different one. If you received an invitation to be a judge, you can choose whether to use the email address the invitation was sent to when creating the Podium account. Like in Social, if you use the same name and password, your Podium data and Social data will be associated in our database. The data collected by Podium will vary by competition. It will include personal information (such as your name, address, passport identification number, contact information, email, phone number, resume or biography), and competition information (such as a business plan, mission statement, charts and graphs, etc.).</p>
<p>You may receive an invitation to become a judge in a competition. If you accept, you will be directed to create a Podium account.</p>
<p>Limited Access Podium Accounts: Some competitions may support features that permit users to create accounts with limited functionality. These accounts will be created as Podium accounts and are governed by this policy unless explicitly stated in the Terms and Conditions associated with a specific competition.</p>
<p>YouNoodle Cookie Policy: We use cookies, small strings of numbers and letters that are placed on your browser. We use a persistent cookie that contains login information which automatically logs you in when you return to our website. This means that if you are logged into the Social site and visit Podium it will automatically log you in (and vice versa). We also use the Google analytics cookies to help us understand how users use our Site and to improve YouNoodle. If you login from Facebook Connect you also receive their cookie.</p>
<p>ALL DATA PUBLISHED USING YOUNOODLE SOCIAL ACCOUNTS IS PUBLIC</p>
<p>All Data is Publicly Available on YouNoodle.com: YouNoodle publishes all the data you share when creating a YouNoodle account except your password and your email address. This means that third parties who are not associated with YouNoodle and are not YouNoodle members can view your information on the YouNoodle website and on other websites– for example, in Google or Bing search results, in an iFrame on a Group website not associated with YouNoodle, as associated with a Facebook Like button, and in other places.</p>
<p>- You should assume all data you share with YouNoodle when creating a Social account is and will be made public, except for your email address and password.</p>
<p>Your Email Address is Only Available to Other Users When You Respond to Their Messages: When you send another user a message using the Social platform you will not see the recipient’s email address until they opt-in to sharing their email address by responding to the message. By responding to a Social message, You agree that YouNoodle will share your email address with the original sender of the message.</p>
<p>DATA COLLECTION AND USE WITH YOUNOODLE PODIUM ACCOUNTS:</p>
<p>ALL Data is Shared With Competition Administrators: Users should assume that all data submitted through the competition is available to the competition administrators and judges unless the terms of the competition state otherwise. Judges can download information off the service so they can judge while they are offline. Judges may be limited in their access to personal information about the competitors, but in some cases they will not.</p>
<p>YouNoodle Has No Liability for Breaches of Your Information by Competition Officials: YouNoodle Terms of Service that require competition judges and administrators to keep user data confidential. YoNoodle is not liable for any data breaches or disclosures by competition officials.</p>
<p>- Podium accounts and any data associated with the account CANNOT BE DELETED. This makes sense since we share and permit downloading of all competition data by the competition administrator.</p>
<p>SAFE HARBOR</p>
<p>YouNoodle complies with the U.S.-EU Safe Harbor Framework and the U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information from European Union member countries and Switzerland.

However, nothing in this Privacy Policy is intended to limit any legal defenses or objections that you may have to a third party’s, including a government’s, request to disclose your information.

We will require that your data when transferred be treated by the new owner under the terms described in this policy.</p>
