    <p class="headlineYel15">PRIVACY POLICY</p>
    <p class="copyWht11">The policy of Young America Corporation (YA) is to respect 
      the privacy of all web site visitors to the extent permitted by law. This 
      online privacy statement is intended to inform you of the ways in which 
      this web site collects information, the uses to which that information will 
      be put, and the ways in which we will protect any information you choose 
      to provide us. There are four types of information that this site may collect 
      during your visit: network traffic logs, web visit logs, cookies and information 
      voluntarily provided by you. </p>
    <p class="copyWht12">Network Traffic Logs – <span class="copyWht11">In 
      the course of ensuring network security and consistent service for all users, 
      YA employs software programs to do such things as monitor network traffic, 
      identify unauthorized access or access to nonpublic information, detect 
      computer viruses and other software that might damage YA computers or the 
      network, and monitor and tune the performance of the YA network. In the 
      course of such monitoring, these programs may detect such information as 
      e-mail headers, addresses from network packets, and other information. Information 
      from these activities is used only for the purpose of maintaining the security 
      and performance of YA's networks and computer systems. Personally identifiable 
      information from these activities is not released to external parties without 
      your consent unless required by law. </span></p>
    <p class="copyWht12">Web Visit Logs – <span class="copyWht11">YA web 
      sites routinely collect and store information from online visitors to help 
      manage those sites and improve service. This information includes the pages 
      visited on the site, the date and time of the visit, the internet address 
      (URL or IP address) of the referring site, the domain name and IP address 
      from which the access occurred, the version of browser used, and the capabilities 
      of the browser. This site makes no attempt to identify individual visitors 
      from this information; any personally identifiable information is not released 
      to external parties without your consent unless required by law. </span></p>
    <p class="copyWht12">Cookies – <span class="copyWht11">Cookies are pieces 
      of information stored by your web browser on behalf of a web site and returned 
      to the web site on request. This site may use cookies for two purposes: 
      to carry data about your current session at the site from one web page to 
      the next, and to identify you to the site between visits. If you prefer 
      not to receive cookies, you may turn them off in your browser, or may set 
      your browser to ask you before accepting a new cookie. Some pages may not 
      function properly if the cookies are turned off. Unless otherwise notified 
      on this site, we will not store data, other than for these two purposes, 
      in cookies. Cookies remain on your computer, and accordingly we neither 
      store cookies on our computers nor forward them to any external parties. 
      Unless otherwise notified on this site, we do not use cookies to track your 
      movement among different web sites and do not exchange cookies with other 
      entities. </span></p>
    <p class="copyWht12">Information Voluntarily Provided by You – <span class="copyWht11">In 
      the course of using this web site, you may choose to provide us with information 
      to help us serve your needs. For example, you may send us electronic mail 
      (through a mailer or a web form) to request information, you may sign up 
      for a mailing list, or you may send us your address so we may send you an 
      application or other material. Any personally identifiable information you 
      send us will be used only for the purpose indicated. Requests for information 
      will be directed to the appropriate staff to respond to the request, and 
      may be recorded to help us update our site to better respond to similar 
      requests. We will not sell, exchange or otherwise distribute your personally 
      identifiable information without your consent, except to the extent required 
      by law. We do not retain the information longer than necessary for normal 
      operations. Each web page requesting information discloses the purpose of 
      that information. If you do not wish to have the information used in that 
      manner, you are not required to provide it. </span></p>
    <p class="copyWht11">The YA web site may provide links to other World Wide 
      Web sites or resources. We do not control these sites and resources, do 
      not endorse them, and are not responsible for their availability, content 
      or delivery of services. In particular, external sites are not bound by 
      YA's online privacy policy; they may have their own policies or none at 
      all. Often you can tell you are leaving a YA web site by noting the URL 
      of the destination site. </p>
