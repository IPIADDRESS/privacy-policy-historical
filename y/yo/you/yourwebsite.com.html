                                    This information is used only in the case of transmission errors and, of course, to let

                                    <br> Yourwebsite.com occasionally offers interactive polls to users in order to enable the
                                    users to share their experience with other users as well as to improve Yourwebsite.com's
                                    services. The collected information, including user opinions, testimony and other submitted
                                    information is aggregated. This information is not identifiable to any particular user.
                                    However, Yourwebsite.com may employ action "tags" (also known as single pixel gifs or
                                    web beacons) to tag users after they have voted, in order to prevent the same user from
                                    voting multiple times on the same issue. This "tag" is not correlated with the subject
                                    user's individual information.

                                    our audience. We sometimes share the aggregated demographic information in these surveys
                                    with our sponsors, advertisers and partners. However, in doing so, we will never share
                                    specific user information with any third party.

                            <h4>2. Children</h4>
                            <p>Consistent with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 ("COPPA"), we will never
                                knowingly request personally identifiable information from anyone under the age of 13 without
                                first requesting parental consent.</p>

                            <h4>3. Usage tracking</h4>
                            <p>Yourwebsite.com tracks user traffic patterns throughout its various sites. However, we do not
                                correlate this information with specific data about individual users. Yourwebsite.com does
                                break down overall usage statistics according to a user's domain name, browser type, and
                                Multipurpose Internet Mail Extension ("MIME") type by gathering such information from the
                                browser string (information contained in every user's browser).</p>

                            <p>Yourwebsite.com sometimes tracks and catalogs the search terms entered by users in our Search
                                function. However, this tracking is never associated with individual users. We use tracking
                                information to determine which areas of our sites users like and don't like based on traffic
                                to those areas. We do not track what individual users read, but rather how well each page
                                performs overall. This helps us continue to improve our services for our users.</p>

                            <h4>4. Cookies</h4>
                            <p>We may place a text file called a "cookie" in the browser files of your computer. The cookie
                                itself does not contain personal information, although it will enable us to relate your use
                                of this site to information that you have specifically and knowingly provided. The only personal
                                information a cookie can contain is information supplied by the user. A cookie cannot read
                                data from the user's hard disk or read cookie files created by other sites. Yourwebsite.com
                                uses cookies to track user traffic patterns (as described above).</p>

                            <p>Our advertising system delivers a one-time cookie to improve tracking of advertisement impressions
                                and click rates.</p>

                            <p>You can refuse cookies by turning the cookie function off in your browser. If your browser is
                                set to provide a warning before the cookie is accepted, you will receive the warning message
                                with each cookie. You do not need to have cookies turned on to use Yourwebsite.com's site.
                                However, you will need to enable/accept cookies if you wish to actively participate in our
                                message boards, forums, polling and surveys.</p>

                            <h4>5. Use of information</h4>

                            <p>Yourwebsite.com uses information voluntarily submitted by our users to enhance the user experience
                                in our network of sites, whether by providing interactive or personalized elements on the
                                sites or by improving future content in response to the interests of our users.</p>

                            <p>As stated above, we use information that users voluntarily provide in order to send out electronic
                                newsletters and to enable users to participate in polls, surveys, message boards, and forums.
                                We send out newsletters to subscribers on a regularly set schedule corresponding with the
                                frequency of the particular publication, and occasionally send out special editions when
                                we think subscribers might be particularly interested in something we are doing. Yourwebsite.com
                                never shares newsletter mailing lists with any third parties, including advertisers, sponsors
                                or partners.</p>

                            <p>We use tracking information to determine which areas of our sites users like and don't like based
                                on traffic to those areas. We do not track what individual users read, but rather how well
                                each page performs overall. This helps us continue to build a better service for you. We
                                track search terms entered in Search function as one of many measures of what interests our
                                users. But we don't track which terms a particular user enters.</p>

                            <p>Yourwebsite.com creates aggregate reports on user demographics and traffic patterns for advertisers,
                                sponsors and partners. This enables our advertisers to advertise more effectively, and allows
                                our users to receive advertisements that are tailored to their needs. Because we don't track
                                the usage patterns of individual users, an advertiser or sponsor will never know which particular
                                user clicked their advertisement.</p>

                            <h4>6. Sharing of the information</h4>

                            <p>Yourwebsite.com uses the above-described information to tailor our content to suit your needs
                                and help our advertisers better understand its audience's demographics. This is essential
                                to keeping our select services free. We will not share information about individual users
                                with any third party, except in order to comply with applicable law or valid legal process
                                or to protect the personal safety of our users or the public.</p>

                            <h4>7. Security</h4>

                            <p>Yourwebsite.com operates secure data networks protected by industry standard firewall and password
                                protection systems. Our security and privacy policies are periodically reviewed and enhanced
                                as necessary. Only authorized individuals have access to the information provided by our
                                customers.</p>

                            <p>Our sites contain links to other sites. Yourwebsite.com is not responsible for the privacy practices
                                or the content of such other websites.</p>

                            <h4>8. Opt-out policy</h4>

                            <p>We give users options wherever necessary and practical. Such choices include:</p>

                            <ul class="list">
                                <li>The option to not register to receive our electronic newsletters;</li>
                                <li>The option to not participate in certain interactive areas, which completely obviates our
                                    need to gather any personally identifiable information from our users.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <h4>9. Your consent</h4>

                            <p>By using this site, you consent to the collection and use of this information by Yourwebsite.com.
                                If we decide to change our Privacy Policy, we will post those changes on this page so that
                                you are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances
                                we disclose it.</p>

                            <h4>10. Necessary disclosure</h4>

                            <p>We will not share your personal information except with a third party to assist us in the processing
                                or securing of your personal information or when we are required by law unless we have given
                                you notice and choice, in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary in order to
                                conform to the edicts of the law, or we must comply with a legal process served on our web
                                site. We may also need to give out your information if one of our partners requires it, but
                                these situations are rare.</p>

                            <h4>11. Personal information following termination of account</h4>

                            <p>When your Yourwebsite.com account is cancelled (either voluntarily or involuntarily) all of your
                                personally identifiable information is placed in "deactivated" status within our corresponding
                                databases. However, you should know that deactivation of your account does not mean your
                                personally identifiable information has been deleted from our database entirely. We will
                                retain and use your personally identifiable information if necessary in order to resolve
                                disputes or enforce our agreements.</p>
