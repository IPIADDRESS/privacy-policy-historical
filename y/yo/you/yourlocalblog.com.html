          <br>
          Your privacy is critically important to us. At YourLocalBlog, we have 
          a few fundamental principles:<br>
          <ul>
            <li>We don't share your personal information with anyone except to 
              comply with the law, develop our products, or protect our rights.<br>
            </li>
            <li>In our blogging products, we aim to make it as simple as possible 
              for you to control what’s visible to the public, seen by search 
              engines, kept private, and permanently deleted.</li>
          </ul>
          <br>
          Below is our privacy policy that incorporates these goals: <br>
          <br>
          It is YourLocalBlog’s policy to respect your privacy regarding any information 
          we may collect while operating our websites. <br>
          <br>
          <strong>Website Visitors</strong><br>
          Like most website operators, YourLocalBlog collects non-personally-identifying 
          information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make 
          available, such as browser type, language preference, referring site, 
          and the date and time of each visitor request. YourLocalBlog’s 
          purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better 
          understand how YourLocalBlog’s visitors use its website. From 
          time to time, YourLocalBlog may release non-personally-identifying information 
          in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage 
          of its website.
          <p>YourLocalBlog also collects potentially personally-identifying information 
            like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. YourLocalBlog does not use 
            such information to identify its visitors, however, and does not disclose 
            such information, other than under the same circumstances that it 
            uses and discloses personally-identifying information, as described 
            below.</p>
          <p><strong>Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</strong><br>
            Certain visitors to YourLocalBlog’s websites choose to interact 
            with YourLocalBlog in ways that require YourLocalBlog to gather personally-identifying 
            information. The amount and type of information that YourLocalBlog 
            gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we 
            ask visitors who sign up for a blog to provide a username and email 
            address. Those who engage in transactions with YourLocalBlog are asked 
            to provide additional information, including as necessary the personal 
            and financial information required to process those transactions. 
            In each case, YourLocalBlog or the transaction processor, collects 
            such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill 
            the purpose of the visitor’s interaction with YourLocalBlog. 
            YourLocalBlog does not disclose personally-identifying information 
            other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply 
            personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent 
            them from engaging in certain website-related activities.</p>
          <p><strong>Aggregated Statistics</strong><br>
            YourLocalBlog may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors 
            to its websites. For instance, YourLocalBlog may monitor the most 
            popular blogs on the YourLocalBlog.com site. YourLocalBlog may display 
            this information publicly or provide it to others. However, YourLocalBlog 
            does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as 
            described below.</p>
          <p><strong>Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information</strong><br>
            YourLocalBlog discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying 
            information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated 
            organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process 
            it on YourLocalBlog’s behalf or to provide services available 
            at YourLocalBlog’s websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to 
            disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated 
            organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using 
            YourLocalBlog’s websites, you consent to the transfer of such 
            information to them. YourLocalBlog will not rent or sell potentially 
            personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. 
            Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, 
            as described above, YourLocalBlog discloses potentially personally-identifying 
            and personally-identifying information only when required to do so 
            by law, or when YourLocalBlog believes in good faith that disclosure 
            is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of YourLocalBlog, 
            third parties or the public at large. If you are a registered user 
            of a YourLocalBlog website and have supplied your email address, YourLocalBlog 
            may occasionally send you an email to tell you about system enhancements, 
            upgrade opportunities, new features, to solicit your feedback, or 
            just keep you up to date with what’s going on with YourLocalBlog 
            and our products. If you send us a request (for example via a support 
            email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right 
            to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request 
            or to help us support other users. YourLocalBlog takes all measures 
            reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, 
            alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and 
            personally-identifying information.</p>
          <p><strong>Cookies</strong><br>
            A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor’s 
            computer, and that the visitor’s browser provides to the website 
            each time the visitor returns. YourLocalBlog uses cookies to help 
            YourLocalBlog identify and track visitors, their usage of YourLocalBlog 
            website, and their website access preferences. YourLocalBlog visitors 
            who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set 
            their browsers to refuse cookies before using YourLocalBlog’s 
            websites, with the drawback that certain features of YourLocalBlog’s 
            websites may not function properly without the aid of cookies.</p>
          <p><strong>Ads</strong><br>
            Ads appearing on any of our websites may be delivered to users by 
            advertising partners, who may set cookies. These cookies allow the 
            ad server to recognize your computer each time they send you an online 
            advertisement to compile information about you or others who use your 
            computer. This information allows ad networks to, among other things, 
            deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most 
            interest to you. This Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies by 
            YourLocalBlog and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.</p>
          <p><strong>Privacy Policy Changes</strong><br>
            Although most changes are likely to be minor, YourLocalBlog may change 
            its Privacy Policy from time to time, and in YourLocalBlog’s 
            sole discretion. YourLocalBlog encourages visitors to frequently check 
            this page for any changes to its Privacy Policy. Your continued use 
            of this site after any change in this Privacy Policy will constitute 
            your acceptance of such change. <br>
