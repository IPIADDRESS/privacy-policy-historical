</b></font><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2">YourProductSamples is not responsible 
for the information collection or privacy practices or the content of third party Web sites, including web sites operated by our Sponsors and 
advertisers. YourProductSamples may collect any or all of the following types of 
information: (a) traffic or clickstream data, (b) cookies, (c) Internet Protocol 
("IP") addresses, or (d) contact information and other personally identifying 
information. YourProductSamples collection and use of each type of data is described 
below, as well as the ways in which the data may be shared with third parties.</font></p>
<p style="margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt"><br>
<font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2"><b>(a) Traffic or Clickstream Data</b>. 
Data about traffic and usage is not personally identifying or identifiable, and 
is not supplemented or combined with personally identifying or identifiable 
information. YourProductSamples may share information it collects with certain selected 
third parties, but only in aggregated, anonymous form. For example, we may tell 
an advertiser or Sponsor that a certain number of people visited a certain area 
of our Web site or signed up for one of our Sponsor offers. YourProductSamples collects 
some information regarding use of the Service by observing browser functions and 
the files (pages) users access. For example, YourProductSamples's servers collect information about 
the site from which you entered to enable YourProductSamples to calculate and pay its 
affiliates, check for fraudulent behavior or other abnormalities and to ensure 
that our Service is technically superior. In addition to the foregoing 
applications, YourProductSamples uses the information (in aggregate form) to better 
design the Service.</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2"><b>(b) 
Cookies</b>. Like many sites, YourProductSamples collects information about online 
behavior using cookies. These cookies contain identification information that 
enables us to offer you the most relevant advertisements and other content. 
Cookies let us know about repeat visitors and if we are delivering quality 
products and services. YourProductSamples may also use cookies to identify which sites 
our repeat visitors are coming from, so that we can place more of our online 
advertising on these sites, and can, where necessary, pay our affiliates and 
other business partners. To YourProductSamples , using information within cookies is an 
anonymous way to survey how we are doing and to look for ways to improve the 
value of the Service to you. You may set your browser software to reject 
cookies, but you may not be able to use all of the features of the Service. 
YourProductSamples may share information about usage of the Service with third parties, 
but only in aggregated, anonymous form, including to report the results of 
advertising campaigns and the results of the campaigns to our Sponsors. 
Reporting and analyzing the performance of offers and advertisements improves 
our ability to serve the right offer at the right time, increasing the value to 
you.</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2"><b>(c) IP 
Addresses</b>. An Internet Protocol ("IP") address is a set of numbers that is 
automatically assigned to your computer each time you connect to the Internet. 
When you use your web browser to request a web page from another computer on the 
Internet, your web browser automatically gives that computer your IP address so 
that the data you request can be sent to your computer. Through your IP address, 
YourProductSamples may track your Internet usage. YourProductSamples may strip a portion of 
numbers from your IP address and provide such information to our third-party 
sponsors. This information collected by YourProductSamples though your IP address is not 
personally identifiable.</font></p>

Contact Information or Personally Identifying Information</b>. YourProductSamples may 
obtain access to your name, e-mail address, street address, phone number, 
wireless phone number, gender, marital status, and/or year of birth, and may 
obtain other contact and personally identifiable information when you: (1) 
register for the Service; (2) participate in a YourProductSamples survey; or (3) contact 
YourProductSamples in connection with problems, comments or requests.</font></p>

submitting your personal information to the Service, including in connection
