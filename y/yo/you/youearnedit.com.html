YEI shall provide the individual with the choice and means for limiting the use and disclosure of their Personal Data. Notice will be provided in clear and conspicuous language when individuals are first asked to provide Personal Data to YEI, or as soon as practicable thereafter, and in any event before YEI uses or discloses the Personal Data for a purpose other than for which it was originally collected. YEI may be required to disclose Personal Data in response to lawful request by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.</p>

YEI will offer individuals the opportunity to choose (opt out) whether their Personal Data is (1) to be disclosed to a third party or (2) to be used for a purpose other than the purpose for which it was originally collected or subsequently authorized by the individual. For Sensitive Personal Information, YEI will give individuals the opportunity to affirmatively or explicitly (opt out) consent to the disclosure of the informa­tion for a purpose other than the purpose for which it was originally collected or subsequently authorized by the individual. YEI shall treat Sensitive Personal Information received from an individual the same as the individual would treat and identify it as Sensitive Personal Information.</p>
<p>Agents, technology vendors and/or contractors of YEI may have access to your Personal Data on a need to know basis for the purpose of performing services on behalf of YEI or providing or enabling elements of the Service.
