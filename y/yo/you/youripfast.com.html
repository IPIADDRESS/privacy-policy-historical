<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

<h3>Website Visitors</h3>
<p>Like most website operators, Find Your IP Fast collects
<em>non-personally-identifying</em> information of the sort that web browsers and
servers typically make available, such as the browser type, your language
preference, the referring site, the date and time of each request, and any
Javascript errors that occur during your visit. Find Your IP Fast’s
purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better
understand how Find Your IP Fast’s visitors use its website so we
can make improvements and fix bugs. From time to time, Find Your IP Fast
may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by
publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.</p>


<p>
Find Your IP Fast avoids collecting potentially personally-identifying
information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses except to the extent
necessary to provide certain services.


For example, our site needs to collect an IP address from you for the sole
purpose of constructing a webpage containing that IP address and delivering it
back to your computer. In this instance your IP address is only stored on our
server in temporary memory (RAM) for only as long as is necessary to construct
the webpage and deliver it to your computer. We do not store IP addresses in
permanent memory (disk), nor are they viewed by any person at
Find Your IP Fast.

</p>






<h3>Aggregated Statistics</h3>
<p>Find Your IP Fast may collect statistics
about the behavior of visitors to its websites. For instance,
Find Your IP Fast may monitor the most popular pages on
findyouripfast.com sites. Find Your IP Fast may display this
information publicly or provide it to others. However, Find Your IP Fast
does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described
below.</p>

<h3>Google App Engine</h3>
<p>Some of Find Your IP Fast's services may be provided by Google App
Engine, a service operated by Google (a third party service provider). As such,
you should assume that any information you provide to Find Your IP Fast
may be available to Find Your IP Fast and to Google. For details about the
specific privacy guarantees made by Google in its capacity as a service
provider, please refer to <a href="http://code.google.com/appengine/privacy.html">code.google.com/appengine/privacy.html</a>.</p>

<h3>Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information</h3>
<p>Find Your IP Fast discloses potentially personally-identifying and
personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors
and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to
process it on Find Your IP Fast’s behalf or to provide services available
at Find Your IP Fast’s websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose
it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations
may be located outside of your home country; by using Find Your IP Fast’s
websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them.
Find Your IP Fast will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying
and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees,
contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above,
Find Your IP Fast discloses potentially personally-identifying and
personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court order
or other governmental request, or when Find Your IP Fast believes in good
faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights
of Find Your IP Fast, third parties or the public at large. If you are a
registered user of a Find Your IP Fast website and have supplied your
email address, Find Your IP Fast may occasionally send you an email to
tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date
with what’s going on with Find Your IP Fast and our products. We primarily
use our various product blogs to communicate this type of information, so we
expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If you send us a request (for
example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve
the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request
or to help us support other users. Find Your IP Fast takes all measures
reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use,
alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and
personally-identifying information.</p>

<h3>Javascript Errors</h3>
<p>Find Your IP Fast’s software products are complex. Occasionally, error
conditions which we did not anticipate may occur. If such an error condition
occurs on your computer, we may log a small amount of
non-personally-identifying information about the error in order to help our
engineers prevent it from occurring again.</p>

<h3>Business Transfers</h3>
<p>If Find Your IP Fast, or substantially all of its assets were acquired,
or in the unlikely event that Find Your IP Fast goes out of business or
enters bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is
transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers
may occur, and that any acquiror of Find Your IP Fast may continue to use
your personal information as set forth in this policy.</p>

<p>Ads appearing on any of our websites may be delivered to users by
advertising partners, who may set cookies. These cookies allow the ad server to

allows ad networks to, among other things, deliver targeted advertisements that
