<br>
<br>

</li>
</ul>
<h2>Location-Based Services</h2>
The device you use to access the Website or Service may provide your location to us. This information may be shared with Issuers in connection with the issuance of Credentials, where location is relevant to completion of the achievement recognized by the Credential.
<br>
<h2>Privacy Preferences</h2>
The Service allows you to customize the information about yourself that is made accessible to others. When you establish an account, the Service applies default settings. Default settings also apply to new features introduced on the Service.  Credentials issued to you will default to the “public” setting. You may activate a “private” setting such that the Credential will no longer be publicly accessed at any time, on a Credential-by-Credential basis. Until you terminate your use of the Service, the fact that you are a user, as indicated by the public display of your full name and avatar, is available to others on the Service.  Review your privacy settings regularly to ensure that they match your preferences.
<br>
<h2>Security</h2>
Credly takes appropriate and reasonable precautions to implement appropriate administrative and technical procedures to protect the security of Personal Information provided or generated through the Service. We permit persons working for us to access and use your information only in a manner consistent with this Privacy Policy.
<br>
<br>
We protect the security of your information during transmission by using Transport Layer Security (TLS) and Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software or other encryption technology, which encrypts information you input. Wherever appropriate, we obfuscate and/or encrypt information in our systems and/or during information transfer. Credly regularly reviews the cryptographic protocols it uses to protect the privacy and security of your Personal Information.
<br>
<br>
Because of the nature of internet and for other reasons, we cannot guarantee the security of your Personal Information, so you should take precautions to protect it when you are on the internet, such as changing passwords often, using a combination of letters and numbers when creating passwords, using a secure browser and being sure to log off the Service when finished using a shared computer.
<br>
<h2>Third-Party Sites</h2>
The Service may include hyperlinks to third-party website neither owned nor managed by us, and, as described above, you may use certain Third-Party Services in connection with the Credentials issued through the Service.

<h2>Use by Minors &amp; COPPA Compliance</h2>
Credly seeks to comply with all applicable laws, including the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (<strong>“COPPA”</strong>).  COPPA requires that online service providers obtain parental consent before they collect personally identifiable information online from children who are under 13. If you are an individual under 13, please do not send any personal information about yourself to us if you are not sure that your parent or guardian has provided consent to the Issuer of your Credential, and please do not send any personal information other than what we request from you in connection with the Services. If we learn we have collected personal information from an individual under 13 without parental consent being obtained or if we learn an individual under 13 has provided personal information beyond what we request from him or her, we will delete that information as quickly as possible. If you believe that an individual under 13 may have provided us personal information in violation of this paragraph, please contact us at
<a href="mailto:privacy@credly.com">privacy@credly.com</a>
with “Notice of Underage Person” in the subject line.
<br>
<br>
If you are an Issuer, you represent and warrant that you are responsible for complying with COPPA, meaning that you must obtain advance written consent from all parents or guardians whose children under 13 will be accessing the Services. When obtaining consent, you must provide parents and guardians with our Privacy Policy. You must keep a record of all consents on file and provide them to us if we request them. If you are a teacher, you represent and warrant that you have permission and authorization from your school or district to use the Services as part of your curriculum, and for purposes of COPPA compliance, you represent and warrant that you are entering into these Terms on behalf of your school and/or district. You can read more about COPPA through the website of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission,

<br>
