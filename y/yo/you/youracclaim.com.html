<h2>TYPES OF INFORMATION WE COLLECT AND HOW WE COLLECT IT</h2>
<p>
The information we collect about you, whether it is supplied directly to us by you or
information we may receive from Issuers’ and third parties about you, may or may not include
information that identifies you personally.  When we refer to information about you in this

specified, shares your information as described below:
</p>
<h3>Information We Receive Directly From You</h3>

questionnaires, or comment forms.  These requests may include demographic information (e.g.,

for our internal and research purposes and not for purposes of future marketing activities
unless otherwise explicitly stated.  By registering on our Site, you authorized Acclaim to
collect, use, process, and store your personal information in accordance with this Privacy
Policy.
</p>
<p>
We may use your information to provide you with support or other services that you have
requested and to respond to your inquiries.
</p>
<h3>Non-Personal Information</h3>
<p>
We may statistically aggregate in non-person-specific form information collected to improve
this Site, our quality controls, operations management, security processes, future marketing

understand our users’ interests and preferences.  In some cases, we may transfer this
information to our third party service providers.  By using this Site, you give your consent
to this non-person-specific data aggregation and the use and transmission of this aggregated
statistical data as outlined above.
</p>
<h3>Information We Receive From Internet Service Providers</h3>
<p>
This Site receives information that is automatically generated by a user’s Internet service
provider (ISP).  This information may include the IP address (a number automatically assigned
to a computer by the ISP), the associated URLs, domain types, the browser type used to access
the Site, the country, state and telephone area code, the location of the ISP’s servers, the
pages of this Site that the user views, any search terms entered on this Site, and the user’s
website address and email address. This information may be collected for system administration
purposes, to gather broad demographic information, and to monitor the level of activity on
this Site. Acclaim does not link IP addresses to personally identifiable information; however,
we reserve the right to link IP addresses and other information supplied by the ISP to
personally identifiable information in order to protect the integrity of our system and for
security purposes.
</p>
<h3>Cookies and Web Beacons</h3>
<p>
By using this Site, you agree to our use of cookies and our use of web beacons for the
collection of certain information in order to provide the products or services you have
requested and for improvement, as we deem appropriate in our sole discretion, related to our
products and services.
</p>
<p>
Cookies are small text files that a web server places on your computer or mobile device.
Cookies contain information that can later be read by the web server that originally placed
the cookie on your computer or mobile device.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Below is a list of the main types of cookies we use and what we use them for:</strong>
</p>
<ol>
<li>
<span class="underline">Strictly Necessary Cookes:</span>
These cookies are essential in order to enable you to move around the Site and use its
features, such as accessing secure areas of this Site. Without these cookies, services you
have asked for, like shopping baskets or e-billing, cannot be provided.
</li>
<li>
<span class="underline">Performance Cookies:</span>
These cookies collect information about how visitors use a website, for instance which
pages visitors go to most often, and if they get error messages from web pages. Some of the
performance cookies are analytics cookies using third party web analytics software, which
allow us to understand more about how our Site is used. For example, like many companies, we
use Google Analytics, which may use performance cookies. We use Google Analytics to obtain
web trend information about user interaction with this Site. We use this information for
system administration purposes and to identify problems and improve service. While Google
Analytics collects and reports information on an anonymous basis, Google Analytics uses
cookies and collects IP addresses to gather web trend information. For more information
about Google Analytics, and for links to Google’s privacy policy and an opt-out tool for
Google Analytics, go to
<a href="http://www.google.com/intl/en/analytics/privacyoverview.html">
www.google.com/intl/en/analytics/privacyoverview.html.
</a>
Performance cookies are not used to collect information that identifies a visitor. All
information these performance cookies collect is aggregated and therefore anonymous. The
aggregated data is only used by us to improve how our Site works. We might also use
performance cookies to highlight our products or services that we think will be of interest
to you based on your use of our Site.
<strong>By using this Site you agree we may place these types of cookies on your device.</strong>
</li>
<li>
<span class="underline">Functionality Cookies:</span>
These cookies allow the Site to remember choices you make (such as your user name, language,
or the region you are located in) and provide enhanced, more personal features. For
instance, these cookies can be used to remember changes you have made to text size, fonts,
and other parts of web pages that you can customize. They may also be used to provide
services you have asked for, such as watching a video or commenting on a blog. The
information these cookies gather is not used to track your browsing activity on other
websites. These cookies are known as “functionality cookies” and they help to improve a
user’s experience of a website by providing a more personalized service.
<strong>By using this Site you agree we may place these types of cookies on your device.</strong>
</li>
<li>
<span class="underline">Targeting or advertising cookies:</span>
These cookies are used to deliver advertising materials relevant to you and your interests.
They are also used to limit the number of times you see an advertisement as well as help
measure the effectiveness of the advertising campaign. They are usually placed by
advertising networks with the website operator’s permission. They remember that you have
visited a website and this information is shared with other organizations such as
advertisers. Quite often, targeting or advertising cookies will be linked to site
functionality provided by the other organization. Most of our Sites do not use targeting
cookies.
<strong>By using this Site you agree we may place these types of cookies on your device.</strong>

not and cannot control. Please check the third-party websites for more information about their
cookies and how to manage them.  You should always review these third-party websites privacy
