<h2>INFORMATION FROM CHILDREN.</h2>
<p>
We recognize the importance of protecting privacy where children are involved. We are committed to protecting children's privacy and we comply fully with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA). We do not knowingly collect Personally Identifiable Information from children under the age of 16. If a child under the age of 16 has provided us with Personally Identifiable Information, we ask that a parent or guardian contact us @
PearsonVUEContracts@pearson.com
<a href="mailto:PearsonVUEContracts@pearson.com">PearsonVUEContracts@pearson.com</a>
or 1 (952) 681-3918. If you are under 18, please be sure to read this Policy with your parent(s) or legal guardian(s) and ask questions about things you do not understand. Those that are under the age of 18 may only purchase products from our online stores with the permission of their parent(s) or legal guardian(s).

<h2>COOKIES AND WEB BEACONS.</h2>
<p>
<strong>Cookies.</strong>
Cookies are small text files that a web server places on your computer or mobile device. Cookies contain information that can later be read by the web server that originally placed the cookie on your computer or mobile device.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Here is a list of the main types of cookies we use, and what we use them for.</strong>
</p>
<ol>
<li>
<strong>Strictly Necessary Cookies:</strong>
These cookies are essential in order to enable you to move around the website and use its features, such as accessing secure areas of the website. Without these cookies services you have asked for, like shopping baskets or e-billing, cannot be provided.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Performance Cookies:</strong>
These cookies collect information about how visitors use a website, for instance which pages visitors go to most often, and if they get error messages from web pages. Some of these are analytics cookies, set using third party web analytics software, which allow us to understand more about how our website is used. These cookies do not collect information that identifies a visitor. All information these cookies collect is aggregated and therefore anonymous and does not affect your privacy. It is only used to improve how a website works. We might also use these cookies to highlight Pearson VUE products or services which we think will be of interest to you based on your use of our websites. For example, like many companies we use Google Analytics. We use Google Analytics to obtain web trend information about user interaction with this site. We use this information for system administration purposes and to identify problems and improve service. While Google Analytics collects and reports information on an anonymous basis, Google Analytics uses cookies and collects IP addresses to gather web trend information. For further information about Google Analytics, and for links to Google’s Privacy Policy and an opt-out tool for Google Analytics, go to http://www.google.com/intl/en/analytics/privacyoverview.html. By using Pearson VUE's website you agree we may place these types of cookies on your device.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Functionality Cookies:</strong>
These cookies allow the website to remember choices you make (such as your user name, language or the region you are in) and provide enhanced, more personal features. For instance, these cookies can be used to remember changes you have made to text size, fonts and other parts of web pages that you can customize. They may also be used to provide services you have asked for such as watching a video or commenting on a blog. The information these cookies collect may be anonymized and they cannot track your browsing activity on other websites. By using Pearson VUE’s website you agree we may place these types of cookies on your device.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Targeting or advertising cookies:</strong>
These cookies are used to deliver adverts more relevant to you and your interests. They are also used to limit the number of times you see an advertisement as well as help measure the effectiveness of the advertising campaign. They are usually placed by advertising networks with the website operator's permission. They remember that you have visited a website and this information is shared with other organizations such as advertisers. Quite often targeting or advertising cookies will be linked to site functionality provided by the other organization. Most of our websites do not use targeting cookies. By using Pearson VUE's website you agree we may place these types of cookies on your device.
</li>
</ol>
<p>
<strong>3rd Party Cookies and Social Networks.</strong>
If you click on a hyperlink from this Site to any third party websites (e.g. if you ‘share’ content from Pearson VUE's websites with friends or colleagues through social networks), you may be sent cookies from these third party websites. Third party websites will have their own privacy and cookie policies which we cannot control. Please check the third-party websites for more information about their cookies and how to manage them.
</p>
<p>
<strong>How to manage cookies.</strong>
If cookies aren't enabled on your computer, it will mean that your browsing or shopping experience on our websites will be limited. Some active content, movies and online shopping baskets, for example, may not work correctly.

<strong>Web Beacons.</strong>
Web Beacons are small strings of code that provide a method for delivering a graphic image on a web page for the purpose of transferring data. For example, when you visit a page on this Site, the code for the page being visited may be transferred to us. The information transmitted to us is used internally, and not shared with third parties, except as provided in this Policy. We use this information for the following purposes:
</p>
<ul>
<li>To allow us to better understand the traffic patterns within our websites and, subsequently, to adjust our content to better respond to visitor's interests; and</li>
<li>To use the information to suggest materials and resources that may be of interest to you based on your use of this Site.</li>
</ul>
<p>By using this Site, you agree to the our use of cookies and our use of web beacons for the collections of certain information in order to provide the products or services you have requested and for improvement, as we deem appropriate in our sole discretion, related to our products and services.</p>
<h2>LINKS TO OTHER SITES.</h2>
<p>This Site may contain links to other websites on the Internet that are owned and operated by third parties, or by NCS Pearson or its affiliates.

<h2>SECURITY.</h2>
<p>The security of your Personally Identifiable Information is important to us.

However, no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially reasonable means to protect your Personally Identifiable Information we cannot guarantee that your Personally Identifiable Information will never be disclosed in a manner inconsistent with this Policy (for example, as a result of unauthorized acts by third parties that violate applicable laws).</p>
