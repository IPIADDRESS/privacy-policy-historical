WHAT INFORMATION WE COLLECT</strong><br><br><u style="text-decoration: underline;">Information You Provide to Us</u><br><br>You don’t have to create an account to use some of our Services.

These third parties also help us understand how users interact with our content or offerings. We may also collect contextual or demographic data about our users from third parties, in order to more effectively deliver the Service or content in which we think you would be interested. Unless you have been notified otherwise, all information collected through our authorized third party service providers remains governed by security and confidentiality obligations consistent with this Policy and applicable law.<br><br><u style="text-decoration: underline;">Advertisements</u><br><br>Some of our Services allow advertisers and their networks to collect and use certain anonymous Information about you (e.g. click stream information, browser type, time and date, subject of advertisements clicked or scrolled over) in order to provide advertisements of interest to you. These companies typically use a cookie or third party web beacon to collect this information.

Google and Young Hollywood LLCs business partners will use this information for the purpose of evaluating your use of the Websites, compiling reports on activity for operators and providing other services relating to internet usage.&nbsp; Google and Young Hollywood LLC’s business partners may also transfer this information to third parties when required to do so by law, or where such third parties process the information on Google’s or Young Hollywood LLC’s business partners’ behalf.<br><br><strong>3. WHY WE COLLECT AND HOW WE USE YOUR INFORMATION</strong><br><br>How we use your Information will depend on which Services you use, how you use those Services and the choices you make in your settings. The primary reason we collect Information is to provide and improve our Services, manage your account and subscription to our Service, and to provide you with a more customized experience on our Services.<br><br>The following is a summary of more specific ways we may use your personal information:</p><ul style="margin-left: 20px;"><li style="list-style:outside">To provide payment processing and account management, operate, measure and improve our Services, keep our Services safe, secure and operational, and customize Website content</li><li style="list-style:outside">To contact you regarding your account, to respond to your requests or questions, to troubleshoot problems with your account, to resolve a dispute, to collect fees or monies owed or as otherwise necessary to provide you customer service</li><li style="list-style:outside">To send you transactional communications. For example, we might send you emails about your purchase or to confirm your registration for an event.

For example, we might send you information about events or special promotions. We might also tell you about new features or products. To learn about your choices for these communications, read Section 8.2 below</li><li style="list-style:outside">We may also use push notifications on our mobile apps to send you various alerts and updates</li><li style="list-style:outside">To improve our Services, for example by reviewing information associated with stalled or crashed pages experienced by users allowing us to identify and fix problems and give you a better experience</li><li style="list-style:outside">For security purposes.

HOW YOUR INFORMATION IS SHARED</strong><br><br><strong>4.1 Sharing by you</strong><br><br>Certain Services offered are social by their very nature, so your participation in such a Service will allow others to see your name and/or username, profile picture, social profile, and any other content you upload or disclose through that profile.<br><br><strong>4.2 Sharing by us</strong><br><br>We share your Information with third parties as listed below and as otherwise described elsewhere in this Policy:<br><br><u style="text-decoration: underline;">Service Providers</u><br><br>We employ and allow third parties to perform tasks on our behalf, such as payment processing, data management and analytics, marketing, advertising, communication and IT services, and we need to share your Information with them in order for them to provide such products and services. Unless we tell you differently or you consent otherwise, these third parties do not have any right to use your Information beyond what is necessary to assist us in providing such products and services. Any uses of your Information by these third parties will remain governed by security and confidentiality obligations consistent with this Policy and applicable law.<br><br><u style="text-decoration: underline;">Company Affiliates</u><br><br>Subject to applicable laws, we may share your Information with companies with whom the Company is affiliated or related to (e.g., parent company or subsidiaries), and will require such affiliated or related companies to use the Information solely in accordance with this Policy.<br><br><u style="text-decoration: underline;">Business Transfers</u><br><br>We may choose to buy or sell assets. In these types of transactions, customer Information is typically one of the business assets that would be transferred. Also, if we (or our assets) are acquired or merged, or if we go out of business, enter bankruptcy, or go through some other change of control, Information would be one of the assets transferred to or acquired by a third party.<br><br><u style="text-decoration: underline;">Protection of Company and Others</u><br><br>We reserve the right to access, read, preserve, and disclose any Information that we reasonably believe is necessary to comply with law or court order; enforce or apply our conditions of use and other agreements; or protect the rights, property, interests, or safety of our Company, our employees, our users, or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction.<br><br><u style="text-decoration: underline;">Aggregated and Anonymized Information</u><br><br>We also may share (within our affiliated entities or with third parties) aggregated or anonymized information that does not explicitly identify you or any individual user of our Services. From time to time, the Company may provide demographic and statistical information to prospective partners for the purposes of securing advertising and/or for general promotion of the Service. This disclosure will not share any personal information of individual users but is intended to give a broad overview of the Service’s membership.<br><br><strong>5. THE SECURITY OF YOUR INFORMATION</strong><br><br>The security of your Information is important to us. We take commercially reasonable security measures, including administrative, technical, and physical safeguards, to protect your Information from loss, theft, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction.<br><br>Your account is protected by a password for your privacy and security. You must prevent unauthorized access to your account and Information by selecting and protecting your password and/or other sign-on mechanism appropriately. To help protect your Information, you should not share your account information or password, reuse your password on other sites, or use a password you have used on other sites.<br><br>We endeavor to protect the privacy of your account and other Information we hold in our records, but we cannot guarantee complete security. Unauthorized entry or use, hardware or software failure, and other factors, may compromise the security of user information at any time.<br><br><strong>6. WHERE YOUR INFORMATION WILL BE HELD</strong><br><br>In order to provide the Service, the Information that we collect from you may be transferred to and stored at a destination outside of your country and the European Economic Area (“EEA”), and, in particular, the United States. It may also be processed by any service providers appointed by us who operate outside of the EEA and their staff. By submitting your data, you agree to this transfer, storing or processing outside of the EEA or your country and acknowledge that not all countries guarantee the same level of protection for your Information as the one in which you reside. Data transferred will be treated in accordance with this Policy and, where applicable, the EU General Data Protection Regulation.<br><br><strong>7.
