<h2>Privacy Statement</h2>
<p>This Privacy Policy applies to this website located at <a href="http://www.cookingli.com">http://www.yourmedicalnews.com</a> (the “Web Site”), which is owned and operated by Web Value, Inc. d/b/a Complete Sport News (“Yourmedicalnews”, “we” or “us”). This Privacy Policy describes what information is collected by us from any user of the Web Site (collectively or individually “User(s),” “yourself,” or “you”), as well as our use and disclosure of that information.&nbsp;Please read this Privacy Policy carefully, as it acts as an official Terms of Use statement, which governs Your use of the Web Site. Your use of our Web Site indicates to us that You have read and accepted our privacy practices, as outlined in this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Use.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>MINORS UNDER THE AGE OF 18 MUST NOT PROVIDE ANY PERSONAL INFORMATION, INCLUDING THEIR EMAIL ADDRESS, TO YOURMEDICALNEWS. IF YOURMEDICALNEWS IS NOTIFIED IT HAS PERSONAL INFORMATION ABOUT A MINOR UNDER THE AGE OF 18, THAT INFORMATION WILL BE PROMPTLY DELETED FROM OUR DATABASE.</p>
<h2>Applicability</h2>
<p>Please note that this Privacy Policy only applies to the Web Site owned and/or operated by, and upon which Yourmedicalnews has placed a “link” which, when “clicked”, transfers You to this Privacy Policy. It is not applicable to any web sites which are not owned and operated by Yourmedicalnews. While on our Web Site, You may encounter links to these web sites or online material. If You “click” on a link to such a third party, the “click” takes You off our Web Site and transfers You to a third party’s web site, which is beyond Yourmedicalnews’ control. These other web sites may set their own cookies, collect data, and/or have their own privacy policies. This Privacy Policy only covers information collected at the Web Site, and does not cover any information collected by any other web site. We encourage You to review the privacy policy of any other web site You visit.</p>
<p>In addition, please note that this Privacy Policy does not apply to any information You may disclose publicly in any chat rooms, message boards, or similar web pages. You should keep in mind that whenever You publicly disclose information about yourself online – for example, via message boards or chat rooms – that information could be collected and used by people that You do not know. In addition, certain message boards and similar user forums may display IP addresses (as defined below) along with the message poster’s name and message. Yourmedicalnews bears no responsibility for any action or policies of any third parties who collect any information users may disclose on the message boards, chat areas or other user forums, if any, on the Web Site.</p>
<h2>Information Yourmedicalnews Collects</h2>
<p><strong>Personally Identifiable Information:</strong>&nbsp;Personally identifiable information is information that could reasonably be used to identify You personally (such as Your name, address, birth date or e-mail address), which we refer to in this Privacy Policy as “PII.” Generally, You may browse our Web Site without providing us with PII. However, there may be times when we ask You to provide us with certain PII, such as when You choose to register with our Web Site and/or for newsletters or choose to participate in an online contest, sweepstakes, survey or voting procedure. we may also ask You to provide us with demographic information or information regarding Your interests, hobbies or similar information. Yourmedicalnews reserves the right, at any time, to add features to our Web Site that require You to register or otherwise provide PII, including credit card information, or to require registration to access our Web Site, or a portion of our Web Site. You can choose not to provide certain information, but You may not be able to take advantage of, or participate in, some of the Web Site’s features. We may combine the information we collect with information available from other sources, including information received from promotional partners or other third parties. We may provide You the opportunity to e-mail a friend an article, electronic greeting card or other special feature from our Web Site. The e-mail addresses You supply us for those activities will be used to send the requested e-mail and will not be used to send You or Your friend any other e-mail communications.</p>
<p><strong>The Web Site does not knowingly collect PII from children under thirteen (13) years of age:</strong>&nbsp;This is not a web site directed to children under the age of 13, and Yourmedicalnews does not knowingly collect any information from children under 13 years of age at the Web Site. If You are under 13 years of age, do not send any information about yourself to Yourmedicalnews. If Yourmedicalnews discovers that a child under the age of 13 has provided the Web Site with PII, Yourmedicalnews will delete that child’s PII from its system.<br>
<strong>Anonymous Information:</strong>&nbsp;When You visit the Web Site, our web servers automatically collect web site usage information. Web site usage information is anonymous information that describes how our visitors use and navigate our Web Site, and it includes the number and frequency of visitors to each web page and the length and depth of their stays. We collect the anonymous information automatically sent to us by Your web browser, such as browser type, referrer data that identifies the web page visited prior and subsequent to visiting our Web Site, and IP address. We also may determine what technology is available through Your browser in order to serve You the most appropriate version of a web page. For example, we may determine that You have installed a version of Flash, and we will then send You the appropriate Flash version of the web page rather than an HTML page.</p>
<p><strong>IP Addresses:</strong>&nbsp;An IP address is a number that is assigned to Your computer or network when You are on the Internet. When visitors request pages from our Web Site, our servers log the visitor’s IP address. We may collect IP addresses for a variety of internal purposes, such as system administration, to report aggregate information to our business partners or to audit the number of visits to different pages on our Web Site.

We do use cookies to store information, such as your personal preferences when you visit our site.  This could include only showing you a popup once in your visit, or the ability to login to some of our features, such as forums.</p>

<p>We also use third party advertisements on <b>http://yourmedicalnews.com</b> to support our site.  Some of these advertisers may use technology such as cookies and web beacons when they advertise on our site, which will also send these advertisers (such as Google through the Google AdSense program) information including your IP address, your ISP , the browser you used to visit our site, and in some cases, whether you have Flash installed.  This is generally used for geotargeting purposes (showing New York real estate ads to someone in New York, for example) or showing certain ads based on specific sites visited (such as showing cooking ads to someone who frequents cooking sites).</p>

<p><strong>DoubleClick DART cookies</strong>
We also may use DART cookies for ad serving through Google's DoubleClick, which places a cookie on your computer when you are browsing the web and visit a site using DoubleClick advertising (including some Google AdSense advertisements).  This cookie is used to serve ads specific to you and your interests ("interest based targeting").  The ads served will be targeted based on your previous browsing history (For example, if you have been viewing sites about visiting Las Vegas, you may see Las Vegas hotel advertisements when viewing a non-related site, such as on a site about hockey).  DART uses "non personally identifiable information".  It does NOT track personal information about you, such as your name, email address, physical address, telephone number, social security numbers, bank account numbers or credit card numbers.  You can opt-out of this ad serving on all sites using this advertising by visiting <a href="http://www.doubleclick.com/privacy/dart_adserving.aspx">http://www.doubleclick.com/privacy/dart_adserving.aspx </a></p>

<p>You can choose to disable or selectively turn off our cookies or third-party cookies in your browser settings, or by managing preferences in programs such as Norton Internet Security.  However, this can affect how you are able to interact with our site as well as other websites.  This could include the inability to login to services or programs, such as logging into forums or accounts.</p>

<p>Deleting cookies does not mean you are permanently opted out of any advertising program.  Unless you have settings that disallow cookies, the next time you visit a site running the advertisements, a new cookie will be added.</p>
