     <p><b>1.	We do not disclose the information placed in your 
        WebApp or GroupApp.</b></p>
      <p> yourwebapps.com honors the confidentiality of its customers' 
        private information placed in a WebApp or GroupApp.

<blockquote>   
   <p>
          a) yourwebapps.com reserves the right to reveal data in cooperation 
            with a request or investigation by any governmental body or governmental 
            agency, or in response to a subpoena issued by any governmental body 
            or governmental agency;</p>
      <p> b) yourwebapps.com reserves the right to examine any data

            or improper activity or that the data infringes rights of the third 
            party.</p>
      <p> c) yourwebapps.com reserves the right to disclose the identity 
            of a Customer, or information allowing identification of a Customer,

        commitments on behalf of our partners, we do encourage you to acquaint 
        yourself with their individual privacy policies as well.</p>
      <p><b>3. 	We use secure technology, privacy protection controls, 
        and restrictions on employee access in order to safeguard your personal 
        information.</b></p>
      <p>We use industry-standard technology to keep your personal 
        information and your billing and account information as secure as 
        possible. We also have put in place privacy protection control systems 
        designed to ensure that your personal data remain safe and private.</p>
      <p>Every Server Corporation employee is obligated to abide by the yourwebapps.com privacy policy. Employees who

        and including termination.</p>

        yourwebapps.com, and employees of our Service Provider, are permitted to have 
        access to your personal information and such access is limited by need.</p>
