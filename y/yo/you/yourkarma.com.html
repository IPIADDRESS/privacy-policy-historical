<p><strong>“Personal Data”</strong> means data that allows someone to identify or contact you, including, for example, your name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, as well as any other non-public information about you that is associated with or linked to any of the foregoing data. “Anonymous Data” means data that is not associated with or linked to your Personal Data; Anonymous Data does not, by itself, permit the identification of individual persons. We collect Personal Data and Anonymous Data, as described below.</p>

<p><strong>a) Information You Provide to Us</strong></p>

Persistent Cookies can be removed by following Internet browser help file directions.</li>

<li>We may use third party tracking services, such as Google Analytics, to track and analyze Anonymous Data from users of our Site.</li>
