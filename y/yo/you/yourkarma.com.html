<p>Your Personal Data may be processed in the country in which it was collected and in other countries, including the United States, where laws regarding processing of Personal Data may be less stringent than the laws in your country.</p>

<h4 id="4_use_of_your_personal_data">4. Use of Your Personal Data</h4>

<p><strong>“Personal Data”</strong> means data that allows someone to identify or contact you, including, for example, your name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, as well as any other non-public information about you that is associated with or linked to any of the foregoing data. “Anonymous Data” means data that is not associated with or linked to your Personal Data; Anonymous Data does not, by itself, permit the identification of individual persons. We collect Personal Data and Anonymous Data, as described below.</p>

<p><strong>a) Information You Provide to Us</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>We may collect Personal Data from you, such as your first and last name, gender, e-mail and mailing addresses and social network account credentials when you create an account to log in to our network (“Account”).</li>

<li>When you order Services on our Site, we will collect all information necessary to complete the transaction, including your name, credit card information, billing information and shipping information.</li>

<li>We retain information on your behalf, such as files and messages that you store using your Account.</li>

<li>If you provide us feedback or contact us via e-mail, we will collect your name and e-mail address, as well as any other content included in the e-mail, in order to send you a reply.</li>

<li>We may also collect Personal Data, such as at other points in our Site that state that Personal Data is being collected.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>b) Information Collected via Technology</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>To make our Site and Services more useful to you, our servers (which may be hosted by a third party service provider) collect information from you, including your browser type, operating system, Internet Protocol (IP) address (a number that is automatically assigned to your computer when you use the Internet, which may vary from session to session), domain name, and/or a date/time stamp for your visit.</li>

<li>We also use cookies and URL information to gather information regarding the date and time of your visit and the information for which you searched and which you viewed. “Cookies” are small pieces of information that a website sends to your computer’s hard drive while you are viewing a web site. We may use both session Cookies (which expire once you close your web browser) and persistent Cookies (which stay on your computer until you delete them) to provide you with a more personal and interactive experience on our Site. Persistent Cookies can be removed by following Internet browser help file directions.</li>

<li>We may use third party tracking services, such as Google Analytics, to track and analyze Anonymous Data from users of our Site.</li>

These third party companies may supply us with Personal Data. We may add this information to the information we have already collected from you via our Site in order to improve the Services we provide.</p>

<p><strong>e) Information Collected from Social Networking Sites.</strong> If you log on to the Service with your login credentials from a social networking site (e.g., Facebook or Twitter), we may receive Personal and/or Anonymous Data about you from such social networking site, in accordance with the terms of use and privacy policy of the third party provider of such social networking site. For example, Facebook may share your friend list with us, in order to help us establish your Account and find other Service users that you know.
