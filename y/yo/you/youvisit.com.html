	<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  	
    
<p align="left">This Privacy Policy applies to all of the  products and services offered by YouVisit LLC through its  website located at <a href="http://www.youvisit.com">www.youvisit.com</a> and through all other websites and platforms over which it delivers its products  and services, including all YouVisit mobile platforms, third-party websites, client  websites and those of their third party service providers (collectively, the  “Platforms”).&nbsp; </p>
<p align="left"><strong>Collection and Use of  Personal Information.</strong></p>
<p align="left">You are not required to provide us with personal  information to use the Platforms.&nbsp; You do,  however, have the option to provide us with certain limited personal  information including your name, the name of your school or college, your email  address, among other information.

This Privacy Policy applies  to all personal information that we collect and maintain about the users of our  Platforms.</p>
<p align="left"><strong>Log Files</strong></p>
<p align="left">We use log  files on certain of the Platforms to collect and store certain information that  your browser sends whenever you visit a website. These server logs may include  internet protocol addresses, browser type, internet service provider,  referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data. We  use this information, which does not identify individual users, for various  purposes including to analyze trends, to administer the Platforms, to track  users’ navigation around the Platforms and to gather demographic information.  We link this automatically collected data to personal information you provide  to us.&nbsp; </p>
<p align="left"><strong>Cookies &nbsp;</strong></p>
<p align="left">We use cookies  on certain of the Platforms for various purposes, including improving the quality  of our products and services and storing user preferences. A cookie is a small  file containing a string of characters that is stored on a user’s computer for  record-keeping purposes.

<p align="left">We may also use  third-party tracking services that use cookies to track non-personally  identifiable information about users of certain of the Platforms in the  aggregate, including information with respect to usage of the Platforms. <strong></strong></p>
<p align="left"><strong>Clear Gifs (Web  Beacons/Web Bugs)</strong></p>
<p align="left">We use clear  gifs on certain of the Platforms for various purposes, including to help us  better manage content across our Platforms by indicating to us what content is  effective.&nbsp; Clear gifs are tiny graphics  with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track  the browsing of users.&nbsp; In contrast to  cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer, clear gifs are embedded  invisibly on web pages. We tie the information gathered by clear gifs to personal  information you provide to us. </p>
<p align="left"><strong>How We Use Your Personal  Information.</strong></p>
<p align="left">We use your personal information for  various purposes, including to provide you with products or services that you  have requested, to respond to questions or communications from you, and to contact  you when necessary. In addition, we may send to you an e-mail offering products  or services which we think you may be interested in or to ask you to  participate in a survey.</p>
<p align="left"><strong>How We Share Your  Personal Information.</strong></p>
<p align="left">Except as otherwise expressly provided in  this Privacy Policy we will only share the personal information you provide us  (a) for the purpose(s) you provided it; (b) with your consent; (c) as may be  required by law or as we think necessary to protect our company or others from  injury (e.g., in response to a court order or subpoena, in response to a law  enforcement agency request or when we believe that someone is causing (or about  to cause) injury to or interference with the rights or property of another); and  (d) with other persons and entities including service providers and affiliated  entities with whom we contract to carry out internal site operations or other  business activities; and (e) with colleges, universities and other entities with  whom YouVisit has a customer or other contractual relationship. </p>
<p align="left">If we do share personal information with colleges,  universities or other entities, to the extent practical, we require that they  protect such information in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Policy.  We cannot, however, guarantee how these colleges, universities or other  entities will use your personal information.</p>
<p align="left"><strong>Personal Information Collected  Under Previous Versions of This Privacy Policy.</strong></p>
<p align="left">Personal information collected on the  Platforms will be governed by the version of the Privacy Policy in effect at  the time the information was collected. We will not retroactively make material  changes to the way we use personal information collected under previous  versions of this Privacy Policy without obtaining your consent.<br>
    <strong>&nbsp;</strong><br>
    <strong>Use and Disclosure of Non-Personally  Identifiable Information.</strong></p>
<p align="left">We may use the non-personally  identifiable information we collect to analyze how the Platforms are used for  various purposes, including to improve the design and content of the Platforms  and to assist us in personalizing the user experience. We may share non-personally  identifiable information with others, including affiliated and non-affiliated  companies.</p>
<p align="left"><strong>Receipt of  Communications; Opt-Out.</strong></p>
<p align="left">If you would prefer not to receive marketing  or promotional e-mails from us that may relate, for example, to new product or services  or offerings, you may opt-out of receiving these communications by&nbsp;writing  to us at privacy@youvisit.com or by using the opt-out mechanism that is  contained in an email.</p>
<p align="left">Following your opt-out, please be aware  that we, or our affiliates or clients, may continue to contact you by email or  postal mail or other means for administrative or informational purposes,  including, but not limited to, follow-up messages regarding the administration  of your account, any products, services, features or functions you have  affirmatively enrolled in or registered to use, goods, services or products you  have ordered or other transactions you have undertaken across the Platforms. </p>
<p align="left"><strong>Blogs, Discussion Groups  and Other Community Tools.</strong></p>
<p align="left">We may, from time to time, make blogs, discussion  groups and other community tools available to you on certain sections of the  Platforms. Any information that is disclosed in these areas becomes public  information for other users to view and for us to use as we deem appropriate.  You should carefully consider whether to disclose your personal information in  these areas, since anyone may access your publicly posted information. <br>
    <strong>&nbsp; </strong><br>
    <strong>Third  Party Advertisers</strong></p>
<p align="left">We may, in the  future, engage an advertising partner to serve advertisements across the  Platforms.&nbsp; If we elect to do so, we may share  information including usage information about users with such party for the  purpose of targeting the advertisements across the Platforms. </p>
<p align="left">A third party  ad server may use cookies and clear gifs on the Platforms, which would allow them  to recognize a user's cookie when a user visits certain of the Platforms. The  information that a third party ad server would collect and share through this  technology would not be personally identifiable.</p>
<p align="left"><strong>Links to Other Sites</strong></p>
<p align="left">The Platforms  contain links to other sites and platforms that are not owned or controlled by  YouVisit LLC, including those of our clients and third party service  providers. &nbsp;Please be aware that we are  not responsible for the privacy policies of such other sites and platforms.&nbsp; </p>
<p align="left">We encourage  you to take note when you leave one of our Platforms, and to read the privacy  policies of each and every site that collects personal information.&nbsp; </p>
<p align="left"><strong>Security of Information</strong></p>
<p align="left">The security of  your personal information is important to us.&nbsp;  We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal  information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it.&nbsp; No method of transmission over the Internet,  or method of electronic storage, is entirely secure, however.&nbsp; Therefore, while we strive to use  commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot  guarantee its absolute security.</p>
<p align="left"><strong>Transfer of Business  Assets.</strong></p>
<p align="left">In the event that YouVisit LLC  enters into a business transition such as a merger, acquisition, or a sale of  some or all of its assets, your personal information will likely be among the  assets that are transferred. <strong></strong></p>
<p align="left"><strong>International Users.</strong></p>
<p align="left">If you are visiting one of our Platforms  from a location outside of the United States,  your connection will be through and to servers located in the United States and all information you provide  will be processed and maintained on our servers and internal systems located  within the United States.  IN ADDITION, IF YOU ARE LOCATED OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES, YOU SHOULD NOTE THAT  YOUR INFORMATION WILL BE TRANSFERRED TO THE UNITED STATES, THE LAWS OF WHICH  MAY BE DEEMED BY OTHER COUNTRIES TO HAVE INADEQUATE DATA PROTECTION (see, for  example, European Union Directive 95/46/EC of 24 October 1995, a copy of which  can be found&nbsp;<a href="http://ec.europa.eu/justice_home/fsj/privacy/docs/95-46-ce/dir1995-46_part1_en.pdf">here</a>).  Users located in countries outside of the United   States who submit personal information do thereby consent  to the general use of such information as provided in this Privacy Policy and  to the transfer of that information to and/or storage of the information in the  United States. <strong></strong></p>
