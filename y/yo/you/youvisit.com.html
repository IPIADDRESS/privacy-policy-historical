<p>This Privacy Policy (the “Policy”) applies to all of the products and services offered by YouVisit LLC through its website located at&nbsp;<a class=" gtm_elm gtm_page_privacy_policy gtm_section_ gtm_tag_www.youvisit.com" href="https://www.youvisit.com/">www.youvisit.com</a>&nbsp;and through all other websites and platforms over which it delivers its products and services, including, but not limited to, all YouVisit mobile platforms, third-party websites, client websites and those of their third party service providers (collectively, the “Platforms”). This Policy explains what information we collect about you and what we do with it. We reserve the right to modify this Policy at any time, and we will notify you of any material changes to the Policy by posting the new Policy here and changing the “Effective Date” at the top. We may also use alternative methods to alert you to changes to the Policy. We encourage you to check this page periodically for any changes. By using or navigating any of the Platforms or any portion of the Platforms, you acknowledge that you have read, understand and agree to be bound by this Policy or any modified Policy as posted. If you do not agree to these terms, please do not use or visit any of the Platforms or any portion of the Platforms.</p>
<p><em>Collection and Use of Personal Information.</em></p>
<p>You are not required to provide us with personal information to use the Platforms. You do, however, have the option to provide us with certain limited personal information including, but not limited to, your name, the name of your school or college, your address, phone number, and email address. We may also collect information about you through a number of other methods including those outlined below. When you participate in special events such as sweepstakes, contests, surveys and polls, you may be asked to provide further personal information.</p>
<p>When you visit any of the Platforms, we may collect certain anonymous demographic information about you, including, but not limited to, your IP address, zip code and browser program. We may also collect information regarding your use of the Platforms through the use of cookies (see below for more about cookies).</p>
<p>If you choose to post messages, comments or other information in one or any of the Platforms, we may maintain on the Platforms such information about you as you choose to disclose in your posting.</p>
<p>If you send us personal correspondence, such as emails or letters, we may collect such information into a file specific to you. We may maintain a record or notes of communications with you regarding your account.</p>
<p><em>Log Files</em></p>
<p>We use Log Files/GPS data on certain of the Platforms to collect and store certain information that your browser sends whenever you visit a website. These server logs may include, but is not limited to, internet protocol addresses, browser type, internet service provider, referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data. We use this information, which does not identify individual users, for various purposes, including, but not limited to, to analyze trends, to administer the Platforms, to track users’ navigation around the Platforms and to gather demographic information. We may link this automatically collected data to personal information you provide to us.</p>
<p><em>Cookies</em></p>
<p>We use cookies on certain of the Platforms for various purposes, including, but not limited to, improving the quality of our products and services and storing user preferences.

<p><em>Clear Gifs (Web Beacons/Web Bugs)</em></p>
<p>We use clear gifs on certain of the Platforms for various purposes, including, but not limited to, to help us better manage content across our Platforms by indicating to us what content is effective. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the browsing of users. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on web pages. We tie the information gathered by clear gifs to personal information you provide to us.</p>
<p><em>How We Use Your Personal Information.</em></p>
<p>We use your personal information for various purposes, including, but not limited to, to provide you with products or services that you have requested, to respond to questions or communications from you, and to contact you.

<p>Where applicable, we may also use your information in order to process your credit card payments, to fulfill your orders and/or requests, to facilitate your viewing of our Platforms, to communicate with you, and to provide you with information about the Platforms, and some of our partners and third party companies in which we think you may be interested. We also use this information to compile broad demographic and usage information about our users in general that does not contain anything that could be used to identify you personally.</p>
<p>We may use IP addresses and anonymous demographic information to tailor your experiences at our Platforms by showing content in which we think you will be interested and displaying content according to your preferences. Anonymous demographic information is shared with advertisers and market researchers on an aggregate basis.</p>
<p>We use information collected to evaluate and improve our services. We may develop and use, in our sole discretion, consumer research, which may be based on your use of our services.</p>
<p><em>How We Share Your Personal Information.</em></p>
<p>In some cases, we will share information we collect (including personal information and/or anonymous demographic information) with third party companies, including, but not limited to, parties that may offer products or services in which we believe you may be interested, and with colleges, universities and other entities with whom YouVisit has a customer or other contractual relationship, or prospective relationship. We also share this information with third parties with whom we partner to carry out promotions or other business activities, including but not limited to, co-promoting and administering sweepstakes and contests.</p>
<p>We may also share information we collect with third party service providers to manage certain aspects of the services we provide, such as maintaining our servers and processing or fulfilling orders for products and services you purchase through the Platforms.</p>
<p>We may also disclose your information in special cases if required to do so by law, court order or governmental authority or when we believe in good faith that disclosing this information is otherwise necessary or advisable, including, for instance, to identify, contact, or bring legal action against someone who may be causing injury to or interfering with the rights or property of YouVisit, another user or anyone else that could be harmed by such activities.</p>
<p>In the event of a change in ownership or a merger with, acquisition by, or sale of assets to, another entity, we reserve the right to transfer all information collected in connection with the Platforms, including, but not limited to, email addresses and other personal information, to a separate entity.</p>
<p><em>Use and Disclosure of Non-Personally Identifiable Information.</em></p>
<p>We may use the non-personally identifiable information we collect to analyze how the Platforms are used for various purposes, including to improve the design and content of the Platforms and to assist us in personalizing the user experience. We may share non-personally identifiable information with others, including, but not limited to, but not limited affiliated and non-affiliated companies.</p>
<p><em>Receipt of Communications; Opt-Out.</em></p>
<p>If you would prefer not to receive marketing or promotional e-mails from us that may relate, for example, to new product or services or offerings, you may opt-out of receiving these communications by writing to us at privacy@youvisit.com or by using the opt-out mechanism that is contained in an email.</p>
<p>Following your opt-out, please be aware that we, or our affiliates or clients, may continue to contact you by email or postal mail or other means for administrative or informational purposes, including, but not limited to, follow-up messages regarding the administration of your account, any products, services, features or functions you have affirmatively enrolled in or registered to use, goods, services or products you have ordered or other transactions you have undertaken across the Platforms.</p>
<p><em>Your California Privacy Rights.</em></p>
<p>California residents who have an established business relationship with YouVisit may choose to opt out of YouVisit disclosing personal information about them to third parties for marketing purposes. If you do not want us to share your personal information with such third parties, please send us your name, email address, street address and phone number to privacy@youvisit.com. Your opt out request will be processed within 30 days of the date it was received.</p>
<p><em>Blogs, Discussion Groups and Other Community Tools.</em></p>
<p>We may, from time to time, make blogs, discussion groups and other community tools available to you on certain sections of the Platforms. Any information that is disclosed in these areas becomes public information for other users to view and for us to use as we deem appropriate. You should carefully consider whether to disclose your personal information in these areas, since anyone may access your publicly posted information.</p>
<p><em>Third Party Advertisers.</em></p>
<p>We may engage an advertising partner to serve advertisements across the Platforms. If we do so, we may share information, including, but not limited to, usage information, about users with such party for the purpose of targeting the advertisements across the Platforms.</p>
<p>A third party ad server may use cookies and clear gifs on the Platforms, which would allow them to recognize a user’s cookie when a user visits certain of the Platforms. The information that a third party ad server would collect and share through this technology would not be personally identifiable.</p>
<p><em>Links to Other Sites.</em></p>
<p>The Platforms may contain links to other Internet sites, resources and sources of YouVisit. By clicking on any banner advertisement or other link, you will be redirected off the Platforms and to third party websites. YouVisit is not responsible for the privacy policies or content of such websites. You should make sure that you read and understand the privacy policies of these sites and direct any concerns regarding external links to the site administrator or webmaster of that third party website.</p>
<p><em>Security of Information.</em></p>
<p>The security of your personal information is important to us. We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is entirely secure, however. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>
<p><em>Information Regarding Children.</em></p>
<p>We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If we learn that we have collected the personal information of a child under 13 we will take steps to delete the information as soon as possible.</p>
<p><em>International Users.</em></p>
<p>If you are visiting one of our Platforms from a location outside of the United States, your connection will be through and to servers located in the United States and all information you provide will be processed and maintained on our servers and internal systems located within the United States. IN ADDITION, IF YOU ARE LOCATED OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES, YOU SHOULD NOTE THAT YOUR INFORMATION WILL BE TRANSFERRED TO THE UNITED STATES, THE LAWS OF WHICH MAY BE DEEMED BY OTHER COUNTRIES TO HAVE INADEQUATE DATA PROTECTION (see, for example, European Union Directive 95/46/EC of 24 October 1995, a copy of which can be found here). Users located in countries outside of the United States who submit personal information do thereby consent to the general use of such information as provided in this Privacy Policy and to the transfer of that information to and/or storage of the information in the United States.</p>
<p><em>Changes to this Privacy Policy.</em></p>
<p>We reserve the right, at our discretion, to modify this Privacy Policy at any time so please review it frequently.</p>
<p><em>How to Contact Us.</em></p>
