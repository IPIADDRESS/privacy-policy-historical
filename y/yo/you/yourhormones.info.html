		  <h3>Privacy Policy</h3>
		  <p>All personal information transmitted or otherwise submitted  to the Society for Endocrinology via this web site shall only be used by the  Society to the extent permitted by applicable legislation, specifically the Data  Protection Act 1998.</p>
		  <h3>Information about our organisation and website</h3>
		  <p>Modern information and communication technologies play a  fundamental role in the activities of an organisation like the Society for  Endocrinology.</p>
		  <p>The Society is dedicated to ensuring that your privacy is  protected in accordance with the Data Protection Act 1998. </p>
		  <p>This statement explains the privacy practices of the Society,  and may change from time to time so please check back periodically. Whilst the  Society is committed to this privacy policy you may find that only parts of it  relate to you depending on what services you are dealing with.</p>
		  <h3><strong>What information is collected about me by the Society for  Endocrinology and how</strong>?</h3>
		  <p>The Society collects information about you for the following  purposes:</p>
		  <ul>
		    <li>Technical  administration of the website </li>
	        <li>Research  and development </li>
	        <li>Society  membership </li>
	        <li>Abstract  submission</li>
	        <li>Event  registration, booking and feedback </li>
	        <li>Formal  membership mailings – postal and email </li>
	        <li>Marketing  (where we have your consent for this purpose)</li>
	        <li>Contact  by the media (where we have your consent for this purpose).</li>
	    </ul>
		  <p>Information on the last two items will be collected upon  application.&nbsp; We will not ask for this  information on an annual basis but will rely upon you to let us know if your  choices change.</p>
		  <p>The Society therefore collects, uses and disseminates the  personal information that is provided to us only in accordance with the  policies outlined in this document. We may keep your information for a  reasonable period for these purposes.</p>
		  <p>We collect the personal data that you may volunteer while  using the following services: membership renewal, event registration,  submission of abstracts and every time you email us your details.</p>
		  <h3>What non-personally identifiable information does the Society collect?</h3>
		  <p>The Society may also collect non-personally identifiable  information (that is, information that does not specifically identify you),  such as aggregate use statistics. We may collect some basic information about  your computer and internet connections, including: your Internet Protocol Address,  your operating system (eg Windows or Mac), your browser software (eg Netscape  or Internet Explorer), your Internet Service Provider (eg AOL or AT&amp;T),  your geographic location. The Society collects this information to improve its  own website services, for example, to diagnose problems with our server, or  administering our website.</p>
		  <h3>As a member, how is my information stored by the Society for Endocrinology?</h3>
		  <p>The information you provide to the Society is stored on the  Society’s own internal system and database and on a secure remote server. These  systems are protected by industry-recognised secure methods and only Society  staff or others acting on our behalf will be authorised to access the  information you provide to us. </p>
		  <h3>What else should I know about my privacy when using other websites?</h3>
		  <p>Our membership websites enable Society members to  communicate with other members and to post information to be accessed by  members. The Society web site may contain links to other websites but the  Society is not responsible for their respective privacy practices, content or  data capture policies (eg cookies). </p>
		  <h3>Children's privacy</h3>
		  <p>We do not knowingly collect personal data from children. </p>
		  <h3>Disclosure</h3>
		  <p>We do not disclose your personal data to other organisations  other than as necessary for the purposes for which you have supplied your  information. However, for the purpose of data integrity, information may be  made available to other societies managed by BioScientifica Ltd, the Society  for Endocrinology’s trading company, including those outside the UK,  but only where they comply with similar data protection principles. An example  would be where you provide an address change of one society; this will be used  to update your address for any other society of which you are a member where  BioScientifica also handles membership. In certain circumstances BioScientifica  will offer you the means to disallow consent to disclosure throughout  BioScientifica services by indicating in a box at the point on the site where  personal data is collected or by contacting our Data Protection Officer.  Otherwise by providing us with your information you consent to such disclosure.</p>
		  <p>We may also engage third parties to process information on  our behalf subject to appropriate security protections being in place.</p>
		  <p>We may also disclose personal data in order to comply with a  legal or regulatory obligation or if necessary for legal proceedings.</p>
		  <p>In order for you to attend an event delivered by a partner  organisation, it may be necessary to exchange some contact information with  them.</p>
		  <h3>Confidentiality/security</h3>
	    <p>Unfortunately, no data transmission over the internet or any  wireless network can be 100% secure, although we do employ industry standard  techniques to secure your data. We have implemented security policies, rules  and technical measures to protect the personal data that we have under our  control from: </p>
		  <ul>
		    <li>unauthorised  access </li>
	        <li>improper  use or disclosure </li>
	        <li>unauthorised  modification </li>
	        <li>unlawful  destruction or accidental loss </li>
	    </ul>
		  <h3>Cookies</h3>

		  <h3>Members’ security precautions </h3>
		  <p>Your account information and profile are password-protected  so that you are the only member who has access to this information. </p>
		  <p>As a member of the Society, you will be able to view the  contact details of other members via the members’ directory.&nbsp; This directory is for members’ use only and  on no account may your password or any details be divulged to any other person.&nbsp; A breach of this will be referred to Council  of Management for their decision on appropriate action. </p>

		  <p>Ultimately you are solely responsible for maintaining the  secrecy of your passwords and/or any account information. </p>
		  <h3>How do I hide my details from other members? </h3>
		  <p>The terms and conditions of membership of the Society  require your details to appear in the members’ directory.</p>
		  <p>However, you may contact the secretariat if you wish to  discuss your concerns.</p>
		  <p>If you have provided a home address as your mailing address, only your  name and email address will appear to other members.</p>
