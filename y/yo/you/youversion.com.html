	 <h1>YouVersionPrivacy Policy (revised: 12/9/10)</h1>
	<p>YouVersion, a Website and Application
	owned and operated by LifeChurch.tv, knows you care how information
	about you is used and shared.  We hope the following statements
	will help you understand how YouVersion will collect, use and protect
	the information you provide to us on our site or app.  We will
	not use or share your information with anyone except as described in
	this Privacy Policy.</p>
	<h3>What we collect and how we
	use it</h3>
	<ol type="1">
	  <li><b>Information you
	  provide.</b> When you sign up for a YouVersion account, or another LifeChurch.tv
	  service or promotion that requires registration, we ask you for personal
	  information (such as your name, email address and an account password).
	  We may combine the information you submit under your account, with information
	  from other LifeChurch.tv services or third parties to provide you with
	  a better experience and to improve the quality of our services. For
	  certain services, we may allow you to opt out of combining such information. </li>
	  <li><b>Unique Device ID</b>.
	  When you access the YouVersion Bible Application, we may collect your
	  Unique Device ID (“UDID”) and/or IP address.  We use your UDID
	  to provide a tailored experience for you.  The UDID information
	  is collected in order to determine the aggregate number of unique devices
	  using our service or parts of our service, to track total usage, analyze
	  data, and communicate with you more effectively.  We may combine
	  your UDID with information from third parties to provide you with a
	  better experience and to improve the quality of our service.  We
	  do not share any personally identifiable information with third parties
	  in association with your UDID. </li>
	  <li><b>LifeChurch.tv cookies.</b>
	  When you visit <a href="http://www.youversion.com" target="_blank"><u>www.youversion.com</u></a>, we may send one or more cookies to your
	  computer, so that we may uniquely identify your browser. (A cookie is
	  simply a tiny text file containing a string of characters.) Accepting
	  our cookies allows you to keep your user preferences from session to
	  session. Although most browsers accept cookies by default, you can set
	  your browser to refuse all cookies, or to tell you when you're being
	  sent a cookie. Some YouVersion features and services may not function
	  properly if you have cookies disabled. </li>
	  <li><b>Log information.</b>
	  When you use LifeChurch.tv services, our servers automatically record
	  information that your browser sends when you visit one of our websites.
	  These server logs may include information such as your web request,
	  Internet Protocol address, browser type, browser language, the date
	  and time of your request, and one or more cookies that may uniquely
	  identify your browser. </li>
	  <li><b>User communications.</b>
	  Personal information or requests that you submit via <a href="http://www.youversion.com/live" target="_blank"><u>www.youversion.com/live</u></a> will be sent to the group administrator.
	  The group administrator and/or one of their members will have access
	  to this information.  When you send email or other communication
	  to any LifeChurch.tv owned website, we may retain those communications
	  to process your inquiries, respond to your requests and improve our
	  services. </li>
	  <li><b>Third party sites.</b>
	  This Privacy Policy applies only to sites and apps that are owned and
	  operated by LifeChurch.tv. LifeChurch.tv cannot regulate other sites
	  linked from within our various web sites and services. These other sites
	  may place their own cookies or other files on your computer, collect
	  data or solicit personal information from you. You should familiarize
	  yourself with their unique Privacy Policies, should you choose to visit
	  their sites. </li>
	</ol>
	<h3>How do we use your information?</h3>
	<p>When you sign up for a particular
	service that requires registration, we ask you to provide personal information.
	If LifeChurch.tv would like to use this information in a manner different
	than the purpose for which it was collected, then we will ask for your
	consent prior to such use. We will not collect or use sensitive information
	for purposes other than those described in this Privacy Policy and/or
	in the specific service notices, unless we have obtained your prior
	consent. You may decline to submit personal information to any of our
	services, in which case LifeChurch.tv may not be able to provide those
	services to you.</p>
	<h3>How do we share your information?</h3>
	<p>LifeChurch.tv does not share your
	personal information with other institutions outside of LifeChurch.tv.
	However, LifeChurch.tv may share your personal information only if we
	have a good faith belief that access, use, preservation or disclosure
	of such information is reasonably necessary to (a) satisfy any applicable
	law, regulation, legal process or enforceable governmental request,
	(b) enforce applicable Terms Of Use, including investigation of potential
	violations thereof, (c) detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud,
	security or technical issues, or (d) protect against imminent harm to
	the rights, property or safety of LifeChurch.tv, its users or the public
	as required or permitted by law.</p>
	<h3>Information Security</h3>
	<p>LifeChurch.tv takes appropriate
	security measures to protect against unauthorized access to or unauthorized
	alteration, disclosure or destruction of data. These include internal
	reviews of our data collection, storage and processing practices and
	security measures, as well as physical security measures to guard against
	unauthorized access to systems where we store personal data. We restrict
	access to personal information to LifeChurch.tv employees, contractors
	and agents who need to know that information to operate, develop or
	improve our services. These individuals are bound by confidentiality
	obligations and may be subject to discipline, including termination
	and criminal prosecution, if they fail to meet these obligations.</p>
	<h3>Data Integrity</h3>
	<p>LifeChurch.tv processes personal
	information only for the purposes for which it was collected and in
	accordance with this Privacy Policy or any applicable service-specific
	privacy notice. We review our data collection, storage and processing
	practices to ensure that we only collect, store and process the personal
	information needed to provide or improve our services. We take reasonable
	steps to ensure that the personal information we process is accurate,
	complete, and current, but we depend on our users to update or correct
	their personal information whenever necessary.</p>
	<h3>Accessing and updating personal
	information</h3>
	<p>When you use any LifeChurch.tv
	service, we make good faith efforts to provide you with access to your
	personal information and either to correct this data if it is inaccurate
	or to delete such data at your request if it is not otherwise required
	to be retained by law or for legitimate service purposes. We ask individual
	users to identify themselves and the information requested to be accessed,
	corrected or removed before processing such requests, and we may decline
	to process requests that are unreasonably repetitive or systematic,
	require disproportionate technical effort, jeopardize the privacy of
	others, or would be extremely impractical (for instance, requests concerning
	information residing on backup tapes), or for which access is not otherwise
	required. In any case where we provide information access and correction,
	we perform this service free of charge, except if doing so would require
	a disproportionate effort. Some of our services have different procedures
	to access, correct or delete users' personal information.</p>
	<h3>Enforcement</h3>
	<p>LifeChurch.tv periodically reviews
	its compliance with this Privacy Policy. When we receive formal written
	complaints regarding privacy issues, it is our policy to contact the
	complaining user regarding his or her concerns. We will cooperate with
	the appropriate regulatory authorities, including local data protection
	authorities, to resolve any complaints regarding the transfer of personal
	data that cannot be resolved between LifeChurch.tv and an individual.</p>
	<p><b>Questions</b></p>
	<p>Any questions about the privacy
	policy can be directed to: <a href="mailto:legal@youversion.com" target="_blank"><u>legal@youversion.com</u></a></p>
