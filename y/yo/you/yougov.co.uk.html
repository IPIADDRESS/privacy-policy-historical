<p><strong>1. Acknowledgement and acceptance</strong></p>

<p>1.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By ticking 'I agree' during the process to register your participation as a member of a YouGov Panel ("Member"), or by participating in a YouGov Activity or by simply accessing and using the YouGov WebPages, you agree to be bound by these Terms. Should you not wish to accept these Terms, you must exit the YouGov WebPages immediately and/or or cease participation in the YouGov Panel or YouGov Activities.</p>

<p>1.2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; YouGov reserves the right from time to time, to modify or amend these Terms or any part of them. You will be informed in advance of any changes in good time before they become effective and such changes will never vary your entitlement to points for surveys you have already completed prior to the effective date of the changes. Your continued use of the YouGov WebPages or continued participation in the YouGov Panel or the YouGov Activities once the changes take effect shall constitute an affirmative acknowledgement of any modification and your continued agreement to be bound by the modified Terms.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>2. Terms of participation</strong></p>

<p>2.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>YouGov Registration Process for YouGov Panel Members</strong></p>

<p>2.1.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To become a Member and to participate in a YouGov Panel, you need to register with YouGov and create a Panel Membership Profile following the registration process set out below (the "YouGov Registration Process").</p>

<p>2.1.2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Prospective Members must complete a YouGov registration form each time they wish to join a YouGov Panel. Registration forms include:</p>

<p>2.1.2.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The form available on the Website and App, but may also include registration forms hosted on third party websites;</p>

<p>2.1.2.2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Registration forms hosted by YouGov and accessed via third party websites; and</p>

<p>2.1.2.3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Registration forms accessed via links in an email sent to you by a third party or by YouGov where you have granted permission to receive such emails from these sources.</p>

<p>2.1.4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During each YouGov Registration Process prospective Members will be notified of any terms in addition to these Terms which shall apply to membership of the respective YouGov Panel.</p>

<p>2.1.5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You have to be 16 years or older to join the YouGov Panel.&nbsp;</p>

<p>2.2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Information you provide to us</strong></p>

<p>2.2.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In return for YouGov granting you access to the YouGov WebPages and/or the ability to participate in a YouGov Panel or YouGov Activity, you agree to:</p>

<p>2.2.1.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Provide true, accurate, current and complete information about yourself as prompted by the YouGov Registration Process;</p>

<p>2.2.1.2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Maintain and promptly update your personal membership details including the Panel Membership Profile (defined below) so as to keep it true, accurate, current and complete; and</p>

<p>2.2.1.3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Provide true, accurate, current and complete information about yourself as prompted by YouGov whilst participating in a YouGov Panel or YouGov Activity.</p>

<p>2.2.2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you provide any information that is untrue, inaccurate, not current, incomplete or inconsistent with prior answers to identical questions, or YouGov has reasonable grounds to suspect that such information is untrue, inaccurate, not current or incomplete, YouGov has the right to suspend or terminate your current access to, use of, and/or participation in the YouGov Panel or YouGov Activities. For example, if in YouGov’s reasonable judgement your participation in YouGov Activities persistently indicates a location of residence different to the one you provided during the YouGov Registration Process, we reserve the right to suspend or terminate your membership or your participation in the YouGov Panel. This is subject to your right to refuse to answer any Panels or YouGov survey or information request.</p>

<p>2.3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Your Panel Membership Profile and YouGov Account</strong></p>

<p>2.3.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once they have completed the YouGov Registration Process, Members will be provided with a profile ("Panel Membership Profile") and an account ("YouGov Account") for the YouGov Panel and those YouGov Activities for which Points (as defined below) is awarded.</p>

<p>2.3.2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Only one Panel Membership Profile is permitted per Member for the YouGov Panel and only one YouGov Account is permitted per Member for the YouGov Panel for which Points are awarded. Any Member found to have multiple Panel Membership Profiles and/or YouGov Accounts may have their primary and any secondary Panel Membership Profiles and/or YouGov Accounts deleted. Points earned via secondary YouGov Accounts may not be transferred. YouGov may demand proof of identity in the event of a dispute.</p>

<p>2.3.3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A unique email address must be used by each Member. (For example, this means that family members may not each have an account using a shared email address but must each have a separate account with a separate email address.)</p>

<p>2.3.4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Each Panel Membership Profile and YouGov Account must only be accessed by an individual Member, and may not be accessed by any other individual without the express permission and authorisation of YouGov. You agree to notify YouGov immediately you become aware of, or suspect any unauthorised use of your login information, Panel Membership Profile and/or YouGov Account, or any other breach of security.</p>

<p>2.3.5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the event of access to your YouGov Account by another individual, YouGov reserves the right to suspend your and/or that other individual’s account until a resolution has been reached. YouGov reserves the right to reclaim any Points or other incentive earned by access of the unauthorised user.</p>

<p>2.3.6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Members may earn points for their YouGov Account ("Points") in the prescribed manner detailed on the YouGov WebPages, including for completing the YouGov Registration Process and for participating in the YouGov Panel and related YouGov Activities for which Points are awarded. The amount of Points that can be earned for participation in a YouGov Panel or related YouGov Activity will be notified to Members via authorised communications.</p>

<p>2.3.7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unless otherwise specifically notified, Points can only be earned through following all and any instructions regarding earning Points. A Member's failure to correctly follow any required instructions or procedures may result in no Points being earned.</p>

<p>2.3.8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Points earned will be recorded in your YouGov Account, however no Points earned are ever available for redemption until the Member has (subject to paragraph 2.3.9 below) reached the specified fulfilment level advertised, together with details of the applicable reward(s) available, in the Account section of the Website.. If YouGov has suspended or terminated your YouGov Account for any of the reasons outlined in these Terms no Points that you have earned can be redeemed.</p>

<p>2.3.9.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; YouGov reserves the right to change the range of YouGov Activities and the YouGov Panel or related YouGov Activities for which Members may be eligible for Points and to vary the frequency of invitation to such activities. YouGov also reserves the right to alter the level of Points required before such Points can be redeemed.</p>

<p>2.3.10.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Points may not be transferred to other YouGov Accounts nor pooled together in any manner and the sale or barter of Points is strictly prohibited. Points has no monetary value, and cannot be used for any purpose other than redeeming the designated reward.</p>

<p>2.3.11.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; YouGov may from time to time adjust a Member's YouGov Account upwards or downwards in response to errors which Members acknowledge may arise or suspected fraud, for which we have full authority.</p>

<p>2.3.12.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; YouGov reserves the right to terminate any YouGov Account that has been dormant for a period of 12 months or more. By ‘dormant’ we mean, where the Member has not participated in the YouGov Panel or any related YouGov Activity within the preceding 12 month period. YouGov will attempt to contact the Member, via their nominated email address, if their YouGov Account is at risk of termination through inactivity. In the absence of a satisfactory response, the YouGov Account will be terminated, and any unused Points will be forfeited.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>2.4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Survey invitations</strong></p>

<p>2.4.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You acknowledge that:</p>

<p>2.4.1.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if you register to the YouGov Panel, it is integral to your participation that we are able to send you emails and notifications inviting you to participate in surveys for research projects, whether via the Website or App or in person; and</p>

<p>2.4.1.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if you wish to stop receiving such emails and notifications, you may terminate your membership in accordance with paragraph 6.1 of these Terms.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>3. Prize polls</strong></p>

<p>3.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; YouGov may ask you to participate in YouGov Activities which will enter you into a prize draw or may permit you to use your Points to enter into a prize draw. Such draws will be governed by the respective terms and conditions specified and displayed for each prize draw.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>4. Referral Links</strong></p>

<p>4.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You may be able to earn extra Points by referring friends and family to the YouGov Panel, provided they join using a unique link that we provide to you for making referrals (“Referral Link”). The conditions attached to the awarding of such extra Points are explained in the Account section of the Website and App. When referring new panel Members, you agree to not pose as or claim to represent YouGov and you will not attempt to mislead or deceive prospective Members into using your Referral Link to join. You agree to make clear to any prospective Members you refer that they will be using your unique Referral Link and that you will receive Points if they join the YouGov panel via your Referral Link.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>5.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Use of the YouGov WebPages and participation in YouGov Activities or the YouGov Panel may involve you submitting survey responses and other content to us ("User Content") which may be visible to other users of the YouGov WebPages.</p>

YouGov will terminate your account and cease to contact you within 7 days of receiving notice from you that you wish to terminate you membership. You therefore acknowledge and agree that if you terminate your membership you may receive emails from YouGov for a period of 7 days after the date of your notice. If you decide to terminate using the ‘Unsubscribe’ option on your YouGov Account page, you will retain any Points previously earned, you will cease to receive emails and notifications from YouGov and be unable to participate in the YouGov Panel or in any YouGov Activities unless and until you reactivate your YouGov Account.

<p>10.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>If a court finds part of these Terms illegal or otherwise invalid, the rest will continue in force</u>. Each of the paragraphs of these Terms operates separately. If any court or relevant authority decides that any of them are unlawful, the remaining paragraphs will remain in full force and effect.</p>

<p>10.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Reliance on these Terms</u>.&nbsp; We intend to rely on these written Terms and any document expressly referred to in them in relation to the subject matter of any agreement between us.&nbsp; We and you will be legally bound by these Terms.</p>

<p>10.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Events or circumstances beyond our reasonable control.</u>&nbsp; If we are prevented or delayed from complying with our obligations under these Terms by anything you (or anyone acting on your behalf) does or fails to do or due to events or circumstances beyond our reasonable control, our inability or delay in performing our obligations will not be deemed to be in breach of these Terms. Examples of such events and circumstances include fire, flood and other acts of God, strikes, trade disputes, lock outs, restrictions of imports or exports, riot, accident, disruption to energy supplies, civil commotion, acts of terrorism or war.</p>

<p>10.5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>References to ‘including’ and other similar expressions.</u>&nbsp; In these Terms, words that appear after the expression ‘include’, ‘including’, ‘other’, ‘for example’, ‘such as’ or ‘in particular’ (or any similar expression) will not limit the meaning of the words appearing before such expression.&nbsp;</p>

<p>10.6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>We may transfer this Agreement to someone else.</u> We may transfer our rights and obligations under these Terms to another organisation.

<p>10.9&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Language.</u>&nbsp; These Terms may be presented to you in more than one language. However, the English language version of these Terms shall prevail.&nbsp; Any agreement between us will be concluded in English.</p>

<p>10.10&nbsp; <u>Even if we delay in enforcing a Contract, we can still enforce it later.</u> If we do not insist immediately that you do anything you are required to do under these Terms, or if we delay in taking steps against you in respect of your breaking the Contract, that will not mean that you do not have to do those things and it will not prevent us taking steps against you at a later date.</p>

<p>10.11&nbsp; <u>The laws that apply to these Terms and where you may bring legal proceedings</u>. These Terms are governed by English law and you can bring legal proceedings in respect of them in the English courts.

<hr>
<p>YouGov is an ethical user of personal data. Without the trust of everyone who answers our questions, we could not produce the research that helps our clients make better decisions. The security of your personal data is important to us, too.</p>

<p>We’ve tried to make the privacy and cookies notice that follows as easy to read as possible. If anything in here is unclear, please contact us at <a href="mailto:dataprotection@yougov.com">dataprotection@yougov.com</a>, and we’ll be happy to clear it up.</p>

<p><strong>What this notice covers</strong></p>

<p>As an organisation that relies on the use of personal data, YouGov is responsible for collecting and using your data in a responsible and safe way, and that starts with clearly telling you how we collect, use and protect your personal data.&nbsp; This privacy and cookies notice sets out:</p>

<ul>
	<li>What kind of personal data we may collect from you;</li>
	<li>How and why we collect and use your personal data;</li>
	<li>Why we may share personal data within YouGov and with other organisations; and</li>
	<li>The rights and choices you have when it comes to your personal data.</li>
</ul>

<p>YouGov is made up of a number of companies, each of which separately controls the data provided to it by our panellists and those who otherwise participate in surveys or browse our website (“user”). &nbsp;If you are a user or panellist who registered in the UK, YouGov Plc (referred to as “we”, “us”, “our” or “YouGov”) is the controller of your personal data. This means we choose why and how that data is processed.&nbsp; We are based at 50 Featherstone St, London, EC1Y 8RT, United Kingdom.</p>

<p><strong>Personal data we collect</strong></p>

<p><strong><em>Data that we collect from you</em></strong></p>

<p>When you interact with our website or take part in YouGov surveys, you provide us with the data that powers our business.&nbsp; While there are certain data that you must provide to use some of our services, such as account details when you join YouGov, you control how much data you share with us.&nbsp; Whether you only want to complete certain surveys, or all of them – it’s your choice. &nbsp;</p>

<p>We will only retain your personal data for as long as we need to in order to fulfil the uses we describe in this notice (or until you exercise your right to erasure, which is explained in the <a href="#Your_rights">section about your rights</a>).</p>

<p><strong><em>Special categories of personal data</em></strong></p>

<p>Some of the data that you provide us will fall within what EU data protection law describes as ‘special categories of personal data’, such as your racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious beliefs or information concerning your health or sexual orientation.&nbsp; For example, during a survey we may ask you about your voting history or intention, or whether you regard yourself as belonging to a particular religion.&nbsp; We use this information in the same way we use all the other information we collect, but the law requires that we have your explicit consent to collect and use it.</p>

<p>You will be explicitly asked to consent to YouGov using those categories of data if you register to the YouGov panel. Each time we ask a question that falls into one of these categories, if you haven’t consented to our use of data in that category we’ll remind you that we need it.&nbsp; You will always have the option to skip these questions if you would prefer not to allow us to use that category of data, and you can always change your consent settings on your <a href="http://yougov.co.uk/account/permissions" target="_blank">Account page</a>.</p>

<p><strong><em>Personal data collected from other sources</em></strong></p>

<p>We may also use personal data you have shared with us to derive additional information from other sources:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Public sources: </strong>for example, we may compare your postcode against public registers to determine that you live within a certain catchment area for a particular local authority or electoral constituency.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Data matching partners: </strong>we may purchase data from companies which helps us to categorise our panellists’ data into groups or ‘segments’ based on a classification of consumers devised by the data matching partner. We add the segment information we purchase to the data we hold about you (<a href="#Segment_partners">click here for more information about how we share personal data with these companies to add these segments to our own data</a>).</li>
</ul>

<p>You may still receive invitations to participate in our research activities if you have not joined YouGov. &nbsp;In these cases we will have received your email address either from a client, or we’ll have acquired it from an organisation that maintains databases of contact details so that companies like YouGov can contact you.&nbsp; We <em>only</em> send emails where we have guarantees from those providing the email addresses that the recipient (that’s you) has agreed to receive third-party (e.g. from YouGov) communications, and we will always tell you where we’ve got your details from and give you the option to opt-out of receiving further emails from us.</p>

<p>YouGov is committed to the lawful, fair and transparent use of personal data. For every use of your personal data we have described so far, we process your personal data on the grounds that our processing is necessary for legitimate interests we pursue as a business, namely that our business relies entirely on the ability to use your personal data to produce research and insight for our clients.</p>

<p>If you have any questions about the grounds under which we process your personal data, or would like to find out more about the approach we take to determine that these grounds apply, please contact our Data Protection Officer using the contact details in the ‘Contact Us’ section at the bottom of the page.</p>

<p><strong>Transferring personal data outside the EEA</strong></p>

<p>We take all steps possible to ensure that your personal data remains within the European Economic Area (“EEA”).&nbsp; However, in some cases we need to share data with other YouGov group companies or third parties that are in countries outside the EEA, <a href="#How_use">as described earlier</a>.&nbsp; These countries may not have similar data protection laws to the UK and so they may not protect the use of your personal information to the same extent.</p>

<p>In these cases we put in place appropriate safeguards to make sure your personal data remains adequately protected.&nbsp; Specifically, we make use of one of the following:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Standard contractual clauses</strong>: we use standard contractual clauses for the transfer of personal data to organisations outside the EEA.&nbsp; These contractual commitments have been adopted by the European Commission and ensure adequate protection for personal data transferred to countries outside the EEA by binding recipients of personal data to certain data protection standards including obliging them to apply appropriate technical and security measures.&nbsp; We use standard contractual clauses when we transfer data to other YouGov Group companies and for transfers to recipients that are neither Privacy Shield certified nor located in a country covered by an adequacy decision (see below).</li>
	<li><strong>EU-US Privacy Shield:</strong> the Privacy Shield is a program agreed between the EU and US which aims to protect the personal data of anyone in the EU when it is transferred to the US by placing data protection obligations on US companies that receive personal data from the EU.&nbsp; YouGov may rely on these safeguards when transferring data to companies based in the US where those companies are Privacy Shield certified.</li>
	<li><strong>Adequacy decisions:</strong> where the&nbsp;European Commission has determined that a country outside the EU offers&nbsp;an adequate level of data protection, personal data may be sent to that third country without implementing any other safeguards mentioned above.&nbsp; YouGov may rely on adequacy decisions when transferring data to companies based in countries where such assurances have been given.</li>
</ul>

<p>Please contact us using the details at the end of this notice for more information about the protections that we put in place and to obtain a copy of the relevant documents.</p>

<p>We do everything we can to protect your personal data from loss or misuse, and from unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction.&nbsp; This section describes some of the measures we take to ensure that your personal data is secure:</p>

<ul>
	<li>We use data centres that have a high level of physical security measures to host and protect your data and our systems;</li>
	<li>We conduct independent penetration tests on an annual basis and are continuously scanning our systems and applications for vulnerabilities in our systems; if you ever think that you have found a security issue or vulnerability in one of our systems please let us know at <a href="mailto:security@yougov.com">security@yougov.com</a>;</li>
	<li>We use encryption to secure your personal data whilst it is in transit using TLS and in storage using AES256 encryption;</li>
	<li>We allow access to attributable data (by which we mean data that directly identifies you) only to those YouGov employees who need it to carry out their job responsibilities, for example our support team to allow them to respond to you when you contact us;</li>
	<li>We make security the responsibility of all our employees and we train our staff to identify security risks and protect your data.</li>
</ul>

<p>Our website may from time to time contain links to and from other websites. &nbsp;If you follow a link to any of those websites, please note that those websites ought to have their own privacy notices and that we do not accept any responsibility or liability for those websites. &nbsp;Please check those privacy notices before you submit your information to those websites.</p>

<p>If you register as a YouGov panellist, it is integral to your participation that we are able to send you emails and notifications inviting you to participate in research projects, which could be conducted online via survey, by downloading a mobile app, or in person. &nbsp;By its nature most of our research is time-sensitive, and without the ability to notify you that we would like your opinion you’ll be at a disadvantage to other panellists because you’ll miss out on opportunities to share your opinion and earn points.</p>

<p>If you would prefer not to receive these service messages, you will need to withdraw from the panel entirely.</p>

<p>Separately, we may want to send you emails and notifications when your opinions feature in the news, or to encourage you to refer your friends and family to join too. You can opt out of these communications at any time on your <a href="http://yougov.co.uk/account/permissions">Account page</a> on the website.</p>

<p>In relation to all the emails and notifications mentioned above, we rely on our legitimate interest in running our research operation – and ensuring our panellists are adequately informed about their account with us – as the legal grounds for this processing.</p>
