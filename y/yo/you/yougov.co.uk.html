<p class="body">In this YouGov Privacy Policy any defined terms will  have the same meanings given to them in the YouGov <a href="/Template/termsandconditions.asp?jID=0&amp;sID=2&amp;UID=" class="menuBody">Terms and Conditions of Use</a>.</p>

<p class="body">It is YouGov's policy to respect the privacy of its Members. </p>

<p class="body">YouGov will never edit, share or disclose any personal information about you without your prior consent. In the course of your membership of YouGov, YouGov may acquire personal data and information about you which you have provided in the course of registering with a YouGov Panel or participating in YouGov Activities. This information may include, your name, home address, email address, telephone number and other generic information provided in relation to your participation in specific YouGov Panels or YouGov Activities.

Such data will be supplied in anonymised, non-attributable form such that no third party could use the data to personally identify you, or to contact you by any means.</li> 
<li>Research results may also be released into the public domain. This is typically in aggregate form (e.g. 20% of respondents said blue was their favourite colour) and will not result in the disclosure of any personal identifying information.</li> 
<li>We will clearly state why we are collecting personal information and how it will be used. At your request we will allow you to inspect and edit any personal data relating to you.</li>

We reserve the right to and you hereby agree to allow us to disclose any information about you to law enforcement, government officials or to any court or court officials as we in our sole discretion believe necessary or appropriate.</li>
<li>Nothing in this Agreement relating to the confidentiality of information shall prevent or hinder YouGov from complying with its legal obligations as to disclosure or otherwise under the Data Protection Act 1988.</li>
<li>By becoming a YouGov Member you agree to allow YouGov to communicate with you in relation to your membership of the YouGov Panel(s) and opportunities to participate in YouGov Activities. These include but are not necessarily limited to communications relating to:
