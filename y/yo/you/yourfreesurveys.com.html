 <p class="ppheader">PRIVACY POLICY
 
 </p><p class="ppitem">This privacy policy discloses the privacy practices of
 Yesfree.com LLC ("Company") and all websites owned or operated
 by Company and its subsidiaries and corporate affiliates,
 including, but not limited to, yourfreesurveys.com and
 onlycashsurveys.com.
  Company (sometimes referred to herein as "us" or "we")
 collects your personal information for use in connection with
  the services Company provides.  The following sections
 describe how your information is collected by us, and how we
  use such information.
  
  </p><p class="ppheader">1.  ACCEPTANCE
  
  </p><p class="ppitem">1.1 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; By
  using a Company website(s) and registering for Company
  services, you become subject to this privacy policy and the
  applicable Terms of Use, including for any dispute regarding
  privacy. <b>BY USING OUR WEBSITE, YOU ARE ACCEPTING THE
  PRACTICES SET OUT IN THIS PRIVACY POLICY AND THE APPLICABLE
  TERMS OF USE.</b>
  
  </p><p class="ppitem">1.2  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  If
  we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those
  changes to our websites and any other places we deem
  appropriate so that you are aware of those changes. We
  reserve the right to modify this privacy policy at any time. 
  It is your responsibility to review the policy frequently in
  order to remain aware of any changes.  If we make material
  changes to this policy, we will notify you here, or by other
  means, such as e-mail, at our sole discretion.  Your
  continued use of any portion of our website following posting
  of the updated privacy policy will constitute your acceptance
  of such changes.
  
  </p><p class="ppheader">2.  INFORMATION COLLECTED
  
  </p><p class="ppitem">2.1  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
  Personal Information.  When you register to use our services,
  we collect a variety of information about you.  Generally, we
  use your information to tailor our services to you and send
  you the surveys most relevant to you.  We reserve the right
  to disclose your contact information (name, mailing address,
  e-mail address, etc.) to third parties.  However, we will
  keep strictly confidential all other information your provide
  us, including, without limitation, sexual preference, health
  information, and PayPal account information.
  
  </p><p class="ppitem">2.2  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  Log
  Files. Any time you visit any of our websites, our servers
  automatically gather information from your browser (such as
  your IP addresses, browser type, Internet service provider
  (ISP), referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp,
  and number of clicks) to analyze trends, administer the site,
  prevent fraud, track visitor movement in the aggregate, and
  gather broad demographic information. For example, we may log
  your IP address for system administration purposes.  IP
  addresses are logged to track a userâ€™s session.  We do not
  share the log files externally, and IP addresses are not
  linked to any personally identifiable information.
  
  </p><p class="ppitem">2.3  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
  Cookies. We use â€œcookiesâ€ to keep track of some types of
  information while you are visiting our website or using our
  services. Cookies are very small files placed on your
  computer, and they allow us to count the number of visitors
  to our website and distinguish repeat visitors from new
  visitors. They also allow us to save user preferences and
  track user trends. We rely on cookies for the proper
  operation of our website.  Therefore, if your browser is set
  to reject all cookies, the website may not function properly.
  Users who refuse cookies assume all responsibility for any
  resulting loss of functionality. We do not link the cookies
  to any of your personal information.
  
  </p><p class="ppitem">2.4  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  Web
  Beacons. â€œWeb beaconsâ€ (also known as â€œclear gifsâ€ and â€œpixel
  tagsâ€) are small transparent graphic images that are often
  used in conjunction with cookies in order to further
  personalize our website for our users and to collect a
  limited set of information about our visitors. We may also
  use web beacons in e-mail communications in order to
  understand the behavior of our customers. We do not link the
  web beacons to any personal information.
  
  </p><p class="ppitem">2.5  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
  E-mail Messages. We require an e-mail address from you when
  you register for our services. We use your e-mail for both
  transactional (e.g., notifying you when you have become
  eligible for payouts because of your credit level) and
  promotional (e.g., daily third-party offers) purposes. 
  E-mail messages we send you may contain code that enables our
  database to track your usage of the e-mails, including
  whether the e-mail was opened and what links (if any) were
  clicked.  We reserve the right to send you certain
  communications relating to the Company services, such as
  service announcements and administrative messages.  By
  signing up for our services, you agree to receive our
  newsletter and offers to take surveys and other money making
  opportunities. If you do not wish to receive these e-mails,
  you may opt-out at any time, by clicking on the opt-out link
  in the e-mail messages you receive. 
  
  </p><p class="ppheader">3.  THIRD-PARTY DISCLOSURES
  
  </p><p class="ppitem">3.1  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
  Disclosure Required By Law. You acknowledge and agree that we
  may disclose information you provide, if required to do so by
  law, at the request of a third party, or if we, in our sole
  discretion, believe that disclosure is reasonable to (1)
  comply with the law, requests or orders from law enforcement,
  or any legal process (whether or not such disclosure is
  required by applicable law); (2) protect or defend Companyâ€™s,
  or a third partyâ€™s, rights or property; or (3) protect
  someoneâ€™s health or safety.
  
  </p><p class="ppitem">3.2  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
  Disclosure to Trusted Third Parties. You acknowledge and
  agree that we may share your contact information with certain
  selected third parties, so that these parties can send you
  daily offers of goods and services that we believe may be of
  interest to our users.  This paragraph has no effect on our
  rights to use your information in connection with the
  provision of services through our websites.
  
  </p><p class="ppitem">3.3  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  Your
  Disclosure to Trusted Third Parties. While visiting our site,
  we may provide you with advertisements, promotions,
  sweepstakes, and offers from third party providers. If you
  choose to accept any such offers, you may directly provide
  your information in connection with the offer to such
  third-party provider.  Please refer to the third party
  providerâ€™s own privacy policy if you have any questions
  regarding how your information will be used by such
  providers.  Please be aware that these offers may be
  presented on pages framed by a Company website.  Although
  these offer pages have the look and feel of our websites, you
  will be submitting your information directly to the
  third-party advertiser.  You agree that we will not be
  responsible or liable for any loss or damage of any sort
  incurred as the result of any such dealings or as the result
  of the presence of such providers on a Company site.
  
  </p><p class="ppheader">4.  ADVERTISING
  
  </p><p class="ppitem">4.1  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  We
  may use third-party advertising agencies or other service
  providers to serve ads on our website on behalf of Company or
  third-party advertisers (e.g., retailers of goods or
  services). These companies may employ cookies and web beacons
  to measure advertising effectiveness. Any information that
  these third parties collect through the use of cookies and
  web beacons is completely anonymous.
  
  </p><p class="ppheader">5.  OPTING OUT
  
  </p><p class="ppitem">5.1  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
  Users who no longer wish to receive our newsletter or
  promotional materials from our partners may opt-out of
  receiving these communications by replying to us in an e-mail
  (at the address provided below) with "unsubscribe" in the
  subject line of the e-mail, or e-mail us at <a href="mailto:support@yesfree.com">support@yesfree.com.</a>
    (Some sites are able to offer opt-out
  mechanisms on member information pages and also supply a
  telephone or postal option as a way to opt-out.)
  
  </p><p class="ppheader">6.  AGE REQUIREMENTS
  
  </p><p class="ppitem">6.1  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  Our
  age restrictions for different services are set forth in the
  applicable Terms of Use.  We do not target our sites or
  services to children under the age of 13, and in compliance
  with the Childrenâ€™s Online Privacy Protection Act, any
  information we may receive from users we believe to be under
  the age of 13 will be purged from our database.
  
  </p><p class="ppheader">7.  SECURITY MEASURES
  
  </p><p class="ppitem">7.1  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  We
  have put in place certain security measures to protect the
  loss, misuse and alteration of the information stored in our
  database.  We will exercise reasonable care in providing
  secure transmission of information between your computer and
  our servers, but given that no information transmitted over
  the Internet can be guaranteed completely secure, we cannot
  ensure or warrant the security of any information transmitted
  to us over the Internet and hence accept no liability for any
  unintentional disclosure.
  
  </p><p class="ppheader">8.  LINKS TO OTHER WEBSITES
  
  </p><p class="ppitem">8.1  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  We
  are not responsible for the privacy policies or practices or
  the content of any other websites that may provide access to,
  or be linked to or from, our websites, including that of any
  third party advertisers whose offerings require you to
  navigate away from our websites.
