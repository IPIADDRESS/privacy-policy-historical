    <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p class="header2">YourSchoolMatch.com Privacy Policy – Your California Privacy Rights</p>
    <p><i>Last updated May 5, 2013</i></p>
    <p>This YourSchoolMatch.com Privacy Policy (this “Privacy Policy”) governs your use of YourSchoolMatch.com (the “Site”) operated by Your School Match LLC (the “Company”, “we”, or “us”). The Site, and any related features, promotions or content provided by the Company or its affiliates shall be referred to collectively as the “Services”. This Privacy Policy is incorporated as part of the Company’s Terms of Service Agreement, currently available at http://www.YourSchoolMatch.com/terms. The Company and the Services are based in the United States.</p>
    <p>This Privacy Policy applies to all users of the Services and describes the Company’s collection and use of user information.</p>
    <p>The Services are general audience, are not targeted to children, and we do not knowingly collect personal information from anyone under 13 years of age. If we learn that we have collected personal information from an individual under age 13, we will delete that information as quickly as possible. If you believe that we might have any information from someone under age 13, please contact us at privacy@YourSchoolMatch.com.</p>
    <p><b>COLLECTION OF INFORMATION</b></p>
    <p class="header2"><i>Information You Submit to Us</i></p>
    <p><b>Submitted Information.</b>  We introduce individuals like you to service providers that can provide you choices regarding educational services and products.  We collect information that you submit to us through the Site (“Submitted Information”), including personal information you may submit to us in connection with requesting information regarding educational products and services or contacting us directly by email. </p>
    <p>Your submission is voluntary and you have the choice not to disclose any information to us. In addition, the Company may supplement Submitted Information with other information collected or obtained from third parties.</p>
    <p>For the purposes of this Privacy Policy, Submitted Information, together with any other information we collect, including automatically-collected information as described below, shall be referred to as “Your Information.”</p>
    <p class="header2"><i>Automatically-Collected Information</i></p>
    <p>The Company also automatically collects and uses certain information during your use of the Services as described below.  On its own, this information is not personally identifiable, but could be linked with personally identifiable information that may identify a particular individual; if such a link actually occurs, we will treat this information as personally identifiable information for the purposes of providing the Services to you. </p>
    <p><b>Accessing and Using the Services.</b> When using the Services, certain non-personally identifiable information is collected, stored and used for business and marketing purposes, such as maintaining and improving the Services, conducting research, and displaying more relevant advertisements. This non-personally identifiable information includes, without limitation: IP address, unique identifier number, operating system, browser information, URLs visited, pages viewed, search queries entered, and other Services and hardware information. If you access the Services from a mobile or other device, we may collect a unique device identifier assigned to that device or other information for that device in order to serve content to it.  </p>
    <p><b>Tracking and Data Collection Technologies.</b> The Company may use browser cookies, web and DOM storage data, Adobe Flash cookies, pixels, beacons, and other tracking and data collection technologies, which may include an anonymous unique identifier. These technologies may be used to collect and store information about your use of the Services, including without limitation, web pages, features and content you have accessed, search queries you have run, referral URL information, links you have clicked on, and advertisements you have seen. This data is used for business purposes such as providing more relevant ads and content, and market research. The Company may also use these technologies and other similar tools to relate your use of the Services to personal information obtained from you or a third party. For example, cookie, click stream or other data about your activities using the Services may allow us to limit the offers and content provided to you through the Services to items we think you will find interesting and relevant to you, based on your prior online activities and preferences.</p>
    <p><b>Third Party Tracking and Data Collection.</b> Third parties that support the Services by serving advertisements or providing other services, such as tracking aggregate site usage or providing users with the ability to comment on or share content, may also use cookies, pixels and other tracking and data collection technologies described above to collect user information. The Company does not control these third parties and their use of these technologies is governed by the privacy policies of the third parties using such technologies.</p>
    <p>For more information about third party ad networks that use these technologies, see http://www.aboutads.info/. Most browsers are initially set to accept cookies, but you can change your settings to notify you when a cookie is being set or updated, or to block cookies altogether.

    <p><b>USE OF YOUR INFORMATION</b></p>
    <p><b>Third Party Providers.</b> When you provide us with Submitted Information in connection with a request for information regarding educational products and services, we will forward your Submitted Information to a network of participating educational services and product providers, or their respective agents, brokers, affiliates, third party finder or marketing companies (“Third Party Providers”), who may then forward your Submitted Information on to educational services and product providers that may provide your requested information.</p>
    <p>Please note that the use of your Submitted Information by Third Party Providers is not under our control and is subject to the privacy policies of those entities.  </p>
    <p><b>IF YOU SUBMIT A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION FROM THIRD PARTY PROVIDERS THROUGH THE SITE, THEY MAY CONTACT YOU DIRECTLY WITH INFORMATION VIA TELEPHONE AND EMAIL.

    <p><b>To protect the rights of the Company and our users.</b> There may be instances when the Company may disclose Your Information without providing notice or choice, including situations where the Company has a good faith belief that such disclosure is necessary in order to: (i) protect or defend the legal rights or property of the Company, our affiliated companies, or any of their employees, agents and contractors (including enforcement of our agreements); (ii) protect the safety and security of individuals; (iii) protect against fraud or for risk management purposes; or (iv) comply with the law or legal process.</p>
