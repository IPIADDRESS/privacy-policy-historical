			<p><i> Yoursearchweb </i>'s privacy policies explain how we treat your personal data and protect your privacy when you use our Services. By using our Services, you agree that&nbsp;<i> Yoursearchweb </i>&nbsp;can use such data in accordance with our privacy policies.
				<br>

			<p>We collect information to provide better services to all of our users - from figuring out basic stuff like which language you speak, to more complex things like which app you'll find most useful.

			<p>We use various technologies to collect and store information when you visit a&nbsp;<i> Yoursearchweb </i>&nbsp;service, and this may include sending one or more cookies or anonymous identifiers to your device. We also use cookies and anonymous identifiers when
				you interact with services we offer to our partners, such as advertising services or&nbsp;<i> Yoursearchweb </i>&nbsp;features that may appear on other sites.

			<p><b>How we use information we collect</b>

				<br>
			</p>
			<p>We use the information we collect from all of our services to provide, maintain, protect and improve them, to develop new ones, and to protect&nbsp;<i> Yoursearchweb </i>&nbsp;and our users. We also use this information to offer you tailored content - such as
				giving you more useful apps and information.
				<br>
				<br>
			</p>
			<p><b>We use information collected from cookies and other technologies, like pixel tags, to improve your user experience and the overall quality of our services.

			<p>Where we can provide information access and correction, we will do so for free, except where it would require a disproportionate effort. We aim to maintain our services in a manner that protects information from accidental or malicious destruction.
				Because of this, after you delete information from our services, we may not immediately delete residual copies from our active servers and may not remove information from our backup systems.

			<p>We also have security measures (such as firewall protection on our servers and PC's) installed to protect the loss, misuse and alteration of the user information under our control.
