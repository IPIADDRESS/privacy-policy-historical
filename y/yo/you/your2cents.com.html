                    <h4><p>Commitment</p>


</h4>

                    <p>Toluna SAS is an online data collection company focused on providing high quality data to the full-service marketing research industry, advertising agencies and consultancies. We build and maintain large online consumer Panels. You can be assured your privacy and the confidentiality of your information is our number one priority. All of the data that Toluna SAS collects in our research studies report as aggregate information, that is, information about groups - not individuals. Individual information is never reviewed or published without your consent, as it is irrelevant to the research conducted by our clients. All individual information provided is held confidential in accordance with the terms of this Privacy Policy.</p>

                <div>

                    <h4><p>The Information We Gather</p>


</h4>

                    <p>Toluna SAS gathers personal information when an individual registers to become a member of our panels. Your participation in any of our panels and surveys is voluntary. After registration we ask panel members to provide us with more personal information so that we may invite them to appropriate surveys. To become a panel member, we ask that you fill out a registration survey that gathers some personal and general consumer information. We ask for your email address so that we can send you email invitations to participate in our upcoming surveys. The other information we gather, such as your name, address, gender, birthday, and employment status, is for matching you with the appropriate marketing research projects. Your birthday is used to automatically update your age for us to target age-related marketing groups. We ask you for this information as a means to see if you might qualify for particular projects. All email contact from Toluna SAS will be sent to your primary email address that you gave to us upon registration. If you become a panel member, your information (name, address, city, state, and zip) is also used for the purposes of incentive fulfilment. When incentive points are deposited in your account and you wish to redeem them, this information is required so that we may send your reward to the appropriate recipient address. From time to time, a third party may be used for issuing checks or processing the delivery of rewards; your personally identifiable information will not be used for any other reason, but to mail you your reward.</p>

<p>In some circumstances, Toluna SAS may ask you to inform us of your sensitive personal data, unless we are permitted to process such sensitive personal data by law, we will ask for your consent. In general sensitive data that may be collected by Toluna SAS may cover: your racial or ethnic origin; your political opinions; your physical or mental health or condition; and your sexual life. This information is not shared with any third party, except as required by law and as part of a transfer of Toluna SAS's business.</p>

<p>If you take a survey or provide us with personal information without being a member of our panel, the only personally identifiable information we will preserve is your email address, gender, age, ethnicity and zip code, machine ID and IP address. We do this so we may contact you if you have won a prize or are entitled to an incentive, to match you to appropriate surveys and improve the user experience. Unless you elect to become a member of the Toluna SAS panel, we will not contact you for any reason other than to notify you that you have won a prize or are eligible for an incentive. If you are entitled to a prize or an incentive, we will collect and maintain such personally identifiable information, as we are required to maintain or report by virtue of any law or regulation.</p>

<p>If you use the Community Forum Area on our website to post blogs, bulletins or chat with fellow community members, you should be aware that any personally identifiable information you submit there can be read, collected, or used by other users of these forums, and could be used to send you unsolicited messages. We are not responsible for the personally identifiable information you choose to submit in these forums.</p>

                    <h4><p>The Use of Cookies and Local Shared Objects on Our Site and Digital Finger Printing</p>


</h4>

                    <p><strong>Cookies:</strong> One or more "cookies" will be placed on the hard disk of the computer(s) used by site visitors, panelists and survey takers in order to allow Toluna SAS to recognize the participant when they connect to the Toluna website, in order to facilitate the management of Toluna SAS, for statistical purposes (pages consulted, date and time of consultations etc.), and to enable us to provide the participant with surveys specifically tailored to his / her interests. This will not affect the performance of your computer but simply provide you with additional opportunities to receive more surveys relevant to your interests.</p>

<p>Only information collected by cookies as specified in this section of our privacy policy is automatically collected from users of the Site. In the event that we do collect any personal data about visitors to the Site it is available only to Toluna SAS.</p>

<p>By the use of the Site all Site users authorize cookies to be put in place and their use by Toluna SAS and Toluna SAS's clients and business partners. The cookies will expire after one year.</p>

<p>Site users may disable the installation of "cookies " or to delete cookies installed by Toluna SAS or its clients. To do so you should modify your browser settings click on the help section of your Internet browser and follow the instructions.</p>

<p><strong>Local Shared Objects:</strong> In order to enhance your experience as a panel member and to increase your opportunities to participate in surveys, Toluna would like to install an application on your computer that will collect limited data about certain websites you visit and certain advertisements that are displayed to you during your website browsing. The application consists of an HTML cookie and local shared object (LSO).</p>

<p>The application will signal when you visit a website that utilizes a participating internet advertising network. The signal emitted from the application identifies tags contained in certain on-line advertisements relating to our clients. It will update us when you interact with these ads so we can send you relevant surveys for you to complete. This will not affect the performance of your computer but simply provide you with additional opportunities to receive more surveys relevant to your interests.</p>

<p>In addition, it will be possible for clients to determine on which site the specific advertisement was viewed. We provide only limited non-personally identifiable information to our clients, including certain demographic information and a coded user identification number so that your personal information will not be tied to your browsing data. In addition, in the event of a merger or other sale of Toluna or its client or as required by applicable law, the anonymous data collected by the application may be shared with third parties.</p>

<p>LSOs are different from browser cookies because of the amount and type of data stored and how the data are stored. Cookie management tools provided by your browser and many anti-spyware applications will not remove Flash cookies, nor will the "Private Browsing" modes on your browser prevent their placement on your computer. You can, however, manage privacy and storage settings for local shared objects or disable their use entirely by visiting the website of Macromedia, the manufacturer of Flash Player, at the following link: <a href="http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager07.html" target="_blank">http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager07.html</a></p>

<p>Please note that the local shared object may restore a deleted HTML cookie in order to keep the application functioning properly.</p>

<p>If in the future you change your mind about participating in the application program, please contact: privacyna@toluna.com.</p>

<p>We will record your preference not to participate in the application. We and our client take commercially reasonable efforts to keep your data secure, including technical, physical and administrative safeguards. For example, all of our storage servers are protected by firewalls.</p>

<p><strong>Digital Finger printing:</strong> In general, digital fingerprinting technologies assign a unique identifier or "Machine-ID" to a user's computer to identify and track the computer. Toluna SAS will not use digital fingerprinting technology (the "Technology") to collect Personal Information, or track the online activities, of the user of a computer; and will not disrupt or interfere with the use or control of a computer or alter, modify or change the settings or functionality of a computer. Toluna SAS will use the Technology to assist Toluna SAS's clients in ensuring the integrity of survey results. The Technology will analyse publicly available information and data obtained from the computer's web browser and from other publicly available data points, including without limitation the technical settings of the computer, the characteristics of the computer, and the computer's IP Address, to create a unique identifier assigned to the computer. The unique identifier will be an alpha-numeric id. After creating the unique identifier, Toluna SAS does not retain the information 0d by the Technology to create the unique identifier. In furtherance of Toluna SAS's efforts to assist its clients in protecting and ensuring the integrity of survey results, Toluna SAS (a) may link or associate your unique identifier to you and any of your Personal Information; (b) may share your unique identifier with Toluna SAS's clients and with other sample or panel providers; and (c) may receive or obtain a unique identifier linked to you from a third party, including without limitation a sample or panel provider or a client of Toluna SAS. Any unique identifier(s) received or obtained by Toluna SAS and linked to a specific individual will be protected in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</p>

<p>Toluna SAS shall use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that the Technology is safe, secure and does not cause undue privacy or data security risks.</p>

<p>Toluna SAS shall use and distribute the Technology in a professional and ethical manner and in accordance with (a) Toluna SAS's privacy policy, (b) any statements and/or disclosures made by Toluna SAS to respondents, and (c) applicable Laws and Codes.</p>

<p>In the event that Toluna SAS discovers or learns of any unethical conduct in connection with the use of the Technology, or that the Technology is being used in a manner that is inconsistent with the statements and/or disclosures made by Toluna SAS to respondents or in violation of applicable Laws and Codes, Toluna SAS will take immediate action to prohibit such unethical conduct and to ensure the proper administration of the Technology.</p>
