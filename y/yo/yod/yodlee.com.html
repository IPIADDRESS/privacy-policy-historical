Additional information may be required to utilize value-added features of the My Yodlee Service, such as Auto-Registration and Password Reset, or to access specific third party Internet services using the My Yodlee Service. This information may include your passwords and user names for the third party web sites and Internet services. We will use this information for providing the services and accessing the web sites you select on your behalf, so that we can present the requested information to you.<br><br>

For example, Yodlee may share your personal information with a nonaffiliated third party to respond to a subpoena, to protect and defend the rights and property of Yodlee, or to offer you a new service on the My Yodlee web site that is provided jointly by Yodlee and an unaffiliated company. <br><br>

<b></b></p></li><li><b>Will I be contacted if I register for the My Yodlee Service?</b><br><br>
Yodlee will occasionally contact users by electronic mail to inform them of new features, or to request participation in market surveys. The My Yodlee Service offers an opt-out option to users when signing up for the My Yodlee Service for those who do not wish to receive such messages. However, in order to ensure the quality of the My Yodlee Service, Yodlee will send certain types of messages from which users will not be able to opt-out. These include a "Welcome Notice" to confirm new membership, "notifications" of password changes or "account lockouts" and other "customer satisfaction" and "customer service" issues.<p>

We use cookies for a variety of purposes intended to make the My Yodlee Service a better service for you.

We also use a cookie to maintain session information for logged in users, to prevent the need for re-entry of login information when browsing outside the My Yodlee Service.<br><br>
We reserve the right to use cookies to deliver content specific to your needs and interests. We may also use cookies to track user trends and patterns in order to better understand and improve areas of our sites that our users find valuable.<br><br>
