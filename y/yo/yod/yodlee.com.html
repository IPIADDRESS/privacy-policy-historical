My Yodlee has been certified by members of TRUSTe, VeriSign, and BBBOnline to help promote the principles of disclosure and informed consent on the Internet. Because Yodlee wants to demonstrate its commitment to your privacy, we have agreed to disclose our information practices and have our privacy and security practices reviewed for compliance by these recognized experts.

<b></b><li><b>What information does My Yodlee ask for and how is it used?</b><a name="1"><br><br>
When you register for our service, My Yodlee will ask you for basic registration information, such as a My Yodlee ID and password which you choose, and an e-mail address for Yodlee Support. Additional information may be required to utilize value-added features of the My Yodlee service, such as Auto-Registration and Password Reset, or to access specific third party Internet services using My Yodlee. We will use this information only for providing the services and accessing the sites you select on your behalf, so that we can present the requested information to you. The information provided by users is encrypted and protected at all times by our strict privacy and security measures.<br><br>
As with most online businesses, My Yodlee logs information about accesses to the My Yodlee site, including the IP addresses from which a member came to the site, in order to diagnose problems with the server, administer the My Yodlee site, and do aggregate statistical analysis. My Yodlee reserves the right to share aggregated information with third parties in which case, <b>a member's personally identifiable information will never be disclosed.</b><br><br>
<b>Note:</b> My Yodlee acts as your personal agent, communicating between
you and the web sites you use. My Yodlee does not accept responsibility for the
actions and policies of third party sites you access, either with regard to
the personal information you have provided to them, or which you authorize
My Yodlee to give to them for accessing their sites, or which they obtain
through your use of their sites directly and/or through the My Yodlee service.
You should be careful to review any privacy policies posted on those sites
before signing up with or using them.<br><br>
<b></b></a></li><li><a name="1"><b>Will I be contacted if I register for My Yodlee?</b></a><a name="2"><br><br>
My Yodlee will occasionally contact users by electronic mail to inform them of new features, to request participation in market surveys, or to inform users of My Yodlee and partner promotions. However, My Yodlee does offer an opt-out option to users when signing up for the service for those who do not wish to receive such messages. In order to ensure the quality of the service, My Yodlee will send certain types of messages from which users will not be able to opt-out. These include, "A Welcome Notice" to confirm new membership, "notifications" of password changes or "Account lockouts" and other "customer satisfaction" and "customer service" issues.<br><br>
Information users provide is used to better customize the experience for each member so that we can present new products and services that are better suited to the needs and interests of our members.<br><br>
<b></b></a></li><li><a name="2"><b>Does My Yodlee use cookies?</b></a><a name="3"><br><br>
My Yodlee stores a cookie on your computer if you have cookies enabled. If you do not have cookies enabled, you will be unable to use the My Yodlee service. A cookie is simply a text file, which indicates your My Yodlee ID or session identification number. This cookie will only be returned to our server if your browser is set to allow sending of cookies (you can also set it to check for permission before sending cookies). We use this cookie to identify existing members of the service when they enter the web site so that we are able to pre-fill their My Yodlee ID and so that they may receive a start page more optimized for current subscribers than for new members. We also use a cookie to maintain session information for logged in members, to prevent the need for re-entry of login information when browsing outside the My Yodlee service.<br><br>
We reserve the right to use cookies to deliver content specific to your needs and interests. We may also use cookies to track member trends and patterns in order to better understand and improve areas of our sites that our members find valuable.<br><br>
We reserve the right to use outside ad companies to display ads on our sites. These ads may contain cookies. Cookies received with banner ads are collected by our ad companies, and we do not have access to this information.<br><br>
<b></b></a></li><li><a name="3"><b>Do I get to choose what information I disclose?</b></a><a name="4"><br><br>
You will ONLY be required to disclose the information to My Yodlee that is required to voluntarily register for the service, or to access third party services you wish to track through My Yodlee.<br><br>
<b></b></a></li><li><a name="4"><b>Who has access to my personal information?</b></a><a name="5"><br><br>
Your individually identifiable information will never be sold or shared with any third parties unless it is required to be disclosed by law under a subpoena.<br><br>
Customer data is stored in encrypted format in our database, and is transmitted in that encrypted format within the network. This database is kept behind firewalls for added security. Your My Yodlee password is also encrypted in such a manner that no one has access to it. No Yodlee employee can view or retrieve your password. Should you forget your password, you will need to re-register for the service, unless you have enabled the automated password reset feature. The automated password reset feature prompts you with a series of questions, which, when answered correctly, causes the service to email your password to your email address.<br><br>
The Yodlee database is physically protected at a secure, third party site and is monitored by security personnel twenty-four hours a day. Only authorized personnel can access the data center, and they must submit to multiple forms of identification including biometric authentication (hand print scan).<br><br>
My Yodlee may under certain circumstances disclose information when we reasonably believe that such action is necessary to (1) conform with legal requirements or comply with legal processes; (2) protect and defend the rights and property of My Yodlee; or (3) protect the legal interests of our members or other third parties.<br><br>

<b></b></li><li><b>What if I need to change the personal information I previously disclosed?</b><a name="6"><br><br>
The My Yodlee site includes a member profile update form for reviewing or updating personal information needed for accessing sites. If you are unable to change this information through the member profile form provided, you can use our Contact Us form to request the change. We do not currently provide an interface for changing access information for third party sites via the My Yodlee site. To change this information you will need to follow the procedures set forth by the third party sites themselves.<br><br>
