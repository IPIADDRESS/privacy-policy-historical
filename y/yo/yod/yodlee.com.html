<dl class="expand">

This information may include your passwords and user names for the third party web sites and Internet services. We will use this information for providing the services you requested and accessing the web sites you select on your behalf, so that we can present the requested information to you but such information is not required to register for the Yodlee Services.<p></p>

<p><strong>D.

<dt><em>What categories of my Personal Information gathered through the Yodlee Services does Yodlee disclose?</em></dt>
<dd>Your personal information will not be sold, shared, rented or traded with any affiliated or unaffiliated third parties, except (i) to provide you with the Yodlee Services , (ii) pursuant to joint marketing arrangements described below, or (iii) as required or permitted by law. For example, in order to provide you with the Yodlee Services, Yodlee may disclose your username and passwords to third party web sites, such as web sites operated by a credit card company or a bank, in order to obtain the information that you requested be aggregated and displayed through the Yodlee Services.

For example, Yodlee may share your personal information with a nonaffiliated third party to offer you a new service on the Yodlee MoneyCenter web sites that is provided jointly by Yodlee and an unaffiliated company. Yodlee reserves the right to disclose your personal information as required by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on Yodlee. If Yodlee is involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, you will be notified via email and/or a prominent notice on our Web site of any change in ownership or uses of your personal information, as well as any choices you may have regarding your personal information.

The user may change the opt-out choice at any time by selecting Edit Personal Profile.

<dt><em>Will I be contacted if I register for the Yodlee Services?</em></dt>
<dd>Yodlee will occasionally contact users by electronic mail to send information or inform them of new features, or to request participation in market surveys. Out of respect for your privacy, we present the option to not receive these types of communications through an opt-out option when signing up for the Yodlee Services. This choice can be changed at any time by selecting Edit Personal Profile. However, in order to ensure the quality of the Yodlee Services, Yodlee will send you strictly service-related announcements on rare occasions when it is necessary to do so. These include a âWelcome Noticeâ to confirm new membership, ânotificationsâ of password changes or âaccount lockoutsâ and other âcustomer satisfactionâ and âcustomer serviceâ issues. Generally, you may not opt-out of these communications, which are not promotional in nature. If you do not wish to receive them, you have the option to deactivate your account.</dd>
<dt><em>Do the Yodlee Services use cookies?</em></dt>
<dd>The Yodlee Services stores a cookie on your computer if you have cookies enabled. If you do not have cookies enabled, you will be unable to use the Yodlee Services. A cookie is simply a text file, which indicates your Yodlee or session identification number. This cookie will only be returned to our server if your browser is set to allow sending of cookies (you can also set it to check for permission before sending cookies). We use cookies for a variety of purposes intended to make the Yodlee Services a better service for you. For example, we use this cookie to identify existing users of the Yodlee Services when they enter the web site so that we are able to pre-fill their Yodlee Services username (if desired) and so that they may receive a start page more optimized for current subscribers than for new users. We also use a cookie to maintain session information for logged in users, to prevent the need for re-entry of login information when browsing outside the Yodlee Services.We reserve the right to use cookies to deliver content specific to your needs and interests. We may also use cookies to track user trends and patterns in order to better understand and improve areas of our sites that our users find valuable. Information collected by Yodlee cookies is not linked to your personal information. We reserve the right to use unaffiliated third parties to provide services such as web analytics and to display ads on our sites. These types of services may utilize cookies. Cookies received with these services are collected by these unaffiliated third parties, and we do not have access to this information. These cookies will not be linked to personal information provided as the required information needed to register for the Yodlee Services. The use of cookies by our partners is not covered by this Privacy Policy. We do not have access or control over these cookies.<p></p>
<p><strong>Clear Gifs (Web Beacons/Web Bugs)</strong></p>
<p>Our third party service provider employs a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs), that help us better manage content on our site by informing us what content is effective. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a userâs computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on Web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. We do not tie the information gathered by clear gifs to our customersâ personal information.</p>
</dd>
<dt><em>How is my Personal Information protected and secured?</em></dt>
<dd>At Yodlee, our number one focus is customer trust. The security of your personal information is important to us. We understand the need for our customersâ personal data to be completely secure and private, and we have designed and deployed (as a part of the Yodlee Services) a state-of-the-art system to protect our customerâs personal information. Yodlee maintains physical, electronic and procedural safeguards that comply with federal standards to guard your personal information held by Yodlee relative to the Yodlee Services.

If your personal information provided to Yodlee changes, or if you no longer desire our service, you may correct or delete it by logging into your MoneyCenter Service and selecting the appropriate choice in Edit Personal Profile. If you are unable to change this information through the user profile form provided, you can use our Submit Service Request Feature to request the change. We will respond to your request within thirty (30) days.In the Edit Personal Profile section you may also review and update personal information needed for accessing other sites. We do not currently provide an interface for changing access information (such as passwords) for third party sites via the Yodlee Services. In addition, you cannot update or change personal information that is retrieved by the Yodlee Services from third party web sites and Internet services for display on the Yodlee Services websites. To change this access information and other personal information from third party websites, you will need to follow the procedures set forth by the third party web sites themselves.<p></p>
