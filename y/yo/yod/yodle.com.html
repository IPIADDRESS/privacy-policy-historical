<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Yodle, Inc. and its subsidiary ProfitFuel, Inc. (collectively, “Yodle”) are committed to protecting and respecting your privacy.&nbsp; Yodle has developed this Privacy Policy (the “Policy”) to advise you of (i) the information Yodle may collect from you on the Yodle.com website (the “Site”), via e-mail and via telephone calls and (ii) the ways in which Yodle may collect, use, share and protect that information.&nbsp; Any person (x) accessing, browsing or otherwise using the Site either manually or via an automated device or program or (y) communicating with Yodle agents, employees and/or affiliates by e-mail or by telephone shall be considered a “User.”</p>

<p>If you are interested in Yodle’s privacy practices with respect to its advertising services, please click here to review the <a href="http://www.yodle.com/legal/policies/advertiser-privacy-policy/">Advertiser Privacy Policy</a>.</p>

<h2>User Consent to Policy</h2>

<p>By accessing, browsing, or using the Site or by communicating with a Yodle agent, employee and/or affiliate by e-mail or by telephone, you consent to the collection, use, and disclosure of your information, including identifying and non-identifying information and anonymous browsing information (together, “Information”) pursuant to the terms of this Policy.&nbsp; If you do not consent to these terms and conditions, please do not access, browse, or use the Site or provide Information to Yodle agents, employees and/or affiliates via the Site, by e-mail or by telephone.</p>

<h2>Information</h2>

<h4>Information Yodle May Collect</h4>

<p>Yodle may collect different types of Information from Users, including identifying information, non-identifying information, and anonymous browsing information, collectively referred to as “Information” in this Policy.</p>

<p>A. Identifying Information.&nbsp; Yodle may collect identifying information provided by any User, including, but not limited to, a first and last name; a home, business, or other physical address; a telephone number; an email address, as well as any other identifying information that may be submitted via the Site, included in an e-mail or conveyed in a telephone call (collectively, “Identifying Information”).&nbsp; In general, Yodle collects Identifying Information from Site Users in connection with inquiries about Yodle’s services and notes the referring URL (e.g., the search engine that directed you to Yodle).&nbsp; If a User sends an email to a Yodle agent, employee and/or affiliate, Yodle may store the Information provided in connection with that e-mail.&nbsp; In addition, Yodle records and monitors User communications with Yodle agents, employees and/or affiliates via e-mail and telephone.&nbsp; By engaging in communications with Yodle agents, employees and/or affiliates via e-mail and/or telephone, you consent to such recording and monitoring.</p>

<p>B. Anonymous Browsing Information and Non-Identifying Information.&nbsp; Yodle may collect general, non-identifying, statistical information about the use of the Site, such as how many visitors visit a specific page on the Site, how long they stay on that page and which hyperlinks, if any, they “click” on.&nbsp; Yodle collects this information through the use of “cookies”, and Yodle may aggregate this information.&nbsp; A cookie is a small text file that a website transfers to an individual’s computer, mobile device, or tablet for record-keeping purposes.&nbsp; For example, Yodle may use cookies to collect information about Site activity.&nbsp; You may set most browsers to notify you if you receive a cookie, or you may choose to block cookies with your browser.&nbsp; Anonymous browsing and non-identifying information is not used, nor is it intended to be used, by Yodle to identify an individual.</p>

<h4>How Yodle May Use Information</h4>

<p>Yodle may retain and use Information collected from Users for quality assurance purposes, including: (i) facilitating a User inquiry or request; (ii) ensuring that Yodle agents, employees and/or affiliates have communicated with you in accordance with Yodle’s policies; (iii) confirming your understanding of the information communicated to you by Yodle agents, employees and/or affiliates; (iv) confirming the terms of any agreement with its customers; (v) enforcing its agreements with its customers; (vi) training its agents, employees and/or affiliates; (vii) preventing fraud and other prohibited or illegal activities; (viii) for other legally permissible purposes; and (ix) generally to ensure that Yodle complies with applicable laws.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Yodle reserves the right to send you certain communications relating to the Site or the services provided by Yodle, such as service announcements, e-mails related to your account, or similar administrative or transactional messages, without offering you the opportunity to opt-out of receiving them.</p>

<h4>Yodle Sharing of Your Information</h4>

<p>Yodle will only share Information that it collects or receives regarding its Users with third parties under the following circumstances:</p><ul>
<li>Consent:&nbsp; If Yodle has a User’s consent to share any Information, it may do so.</li>
<li>Agents:&nbsp; Yodle may utilize other companies and individuals to perform functions on its behalf such as sending postal and electronic mail to Users, processing payments, and delivering products and services.&nbsp; These third parties have access to Information needed to perform their functions, but may not use it for other purposes.</li>
<li>Aggregate Anonymous and Non-Identifying Information: Yodle may provide the aggregate statistics about our Users’ Site activity (i) to describe the use of the Site to existing or potential business partners, investors, or other third parties, (ii) in response to a government request or (iii) for analytics or similar activities.</li> 
<li>Protection of Yodle or Others:&nbsp; Yodle may disclose Information about our Users to others if we have a good faith belief that we are required or permitted to do so by law or legal process, to respond to claims, to protect the rights, property or safety of Yodle or others, or take action regarding illegal activities or suspected fraud.</li>
<li>Business Transfers: In the event of a sale, merger, liquidation, dissolution or sale or transfer of substantially all of the assets of Yodle, any and all Information collected about you from the Site or your communications with Yodle agents, employees and/or affiliates via email or telephone may be sold, assigned or transferred to the party acquiring all or substantially all of the equity and/or assets of Yodle.&nbsp; By using the Site and providing information to Yodle, you consent to the sale and transfer of your information as described herein.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Links to Other Sites</h2>

<p>The Site may provide hyperlinks that, when clicked, take you to other websites not controlled by Yodle.&nbsp; These hyperlinked websites may contain privacy provisions that are different from those provided herein. Yodle is not responsible for the collection, use, disclosure or protection of information collected through these websites, and Yodle expressly disclaims any and all liability related to such collection, use, or disclosure.</p>

<h2>Security</h2>

<p>Yodle takes commercially reasonable security measures to protect against unauthorized access to or unauthorized alteration, disclosure or destruction of Information.&nbsp; These include internal reviews of Yodle’s data collection, storage and processing practices and security measures, as well as physical security measures to guard against unauthorized access to systems where Information is stored.&nbsp; Yodle employees with access to Information are bound by confidentiality obligations and may be subject to discipline, including termination and criminal prosecution, if they fail to meet these obligations.</p>

<p>Yodle wants you to feel confident using the Site and providing Information to us.&nbsp; However, no system can be completely secure. Therefore, although Yodle takes commercially reasonable steps to secure your Information, we do not promise, and you should not expect, that your Information always will remain secure. In the event of a breach of the confidentiality or security of your identifying information, we will notify you if reasonably possible and as reasonably necessary so that you can take appropriate protective steps. We may notify you under such circumstances using the e-mail address(es), if any, we have on record for you. You should also take care with how you handle and disclose your identifying information. Please refer to the Federal Trade Commission’s Web site at <a href="http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/menus/consumer/data.shtm" target="_blank">http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/menus/consumer/data.shtm</a> for information about how to protect yourself against identity theft.</p>

<h2>Account</h2>

<p>If you become a Yodle customer, Yodle wants you to see Yodle’s performance and the return you’re getting from your investment.&nbsp; Yodle provides access to an online dashboard that shows your real-time results.&nbsp; You will have access to the information by entering a username and password, and your online account information shall be protected by your password. Yodle recommends that you do not disclose your password to any other person. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your password and account, and are fully responsible for all activities that occur under your password or account.&nbsp; Your use of Yodle’s services is governed by the <a href="http://www.yodle.com/legal/terms/yodle-service-agreement-terms-and-conditions/">Yodle Service Agreement Terms and Conditions</a>.</p>

<h2>Changes to Yodle’s Privacy Policy</h2>

<p>The terms of this Policy may change from time to time.&nbsp; We will notify you of any material changes to this Privacy Policy by posting a notice on the homepage of the Site for a reasonable period of time after such changes are made that this Privacy Policy has been updated and by changing the Effective Date at the top of this Policy.&nbsp; We encourage you to check this page periodically for any changes.&nbsp; Your continued use of the Site or engaging in any communication with Yodle agents, employees, and/or affiliates via e-mail or telephone following the posting of changes to these terms will mean you accept those changes.</p>

<h2>Governing Law and Venue</h2>

<p>This Policy is governed by the laws of the State of New York, excluding its conflict of laws principles.&nbsp; The exclusive venue for any dispute between you and Yodle shall be New York County, New York, and you hereby waive any jurisdictional, venue or inconvenient forum objections thereto.&nbsp; YOU EXPRESSLY WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL.&nbsp; Prior to initiating any legal action, you shall give Yodle 60 days’ prior written notice of your intent to file an action by e-mail to <a href="mailto:disputeresolution@yodle.com">disputeresolution@yodle.com</a>.&nbsp; During such notice period, you will endeavor to resolve any dispute or claim amicably by mutual discussion.&nbsp; </p>
