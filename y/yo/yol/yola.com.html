<h1>
Yola, Inc. Privacy Policy</h1><h3>Last updated March 26, 2009</h3><br>This privacy policy ("Policy") explains how personal information is collected, used, and disclosed by Yola, Inc., also doing business as SynthaSite, Inc., and SynthaSite (Pty) Ltd. (collectively "Yola") with respect to your use of the web site located at www.yola.com (the "Site") so you can make an informed decision about using the Site and the web site creation and hosting services offered by Yola. Please note that this Policy does not apply to, and we are not responsible in any manner for, any information you provide to third parties in connection with web sites hosted by Yola ("User Sites") or how the third parties who operate such User Sites may use the personal information you provide to them. Such information is subject to the privacy practices of such User Site, and we encourage you to become familiar with their privacy practices before disclosing information directly to them. Registration forms contain both mandatory fields (as indicated) and non-mandatory fields; if you choose not to complete the mandatory fields then Yola may not be able to respond to your request or activate your option choices. By using the Yola Toolset and/or the Yola Web Site, you consent to any transfer of personal information, collected by Yola, outside your country for the purposes of storing the information where Yola and/or its agents maintain their facilities.<br><br>We reserve the right to change this Policy at any time. If we make any material changes to our Policy, we will post a new policy on our Site and update the “last updated” date set forth above. Therefore, we encourage you to check our Policy whenever you use the service to see if it has been updated since your last visit. Your use of the Site after the revised Policy has been posted will constitute your consent to such revised Policy. If you are concerned about how your personal information is used, you should subscribe to our blog RSS feed at <a title="http://blog.yola.com" href="http://blog.yola.com" id="idtm">http://blog.yola.com</a> or e-mail us at <a title="support@yola.com" href="mailto:support@yola.com" id="jlmm">support@yola.com</a> . This will not prevent Yola from using your personal information for the administration or operation of the Site or other nonmarketing purposes described in this Policy.<br><br><h2>Our Postal Address is:</h2><br>51 Federal Street, Suite 401<br>San Francisco, CA 94107<br><br>We can be reached via e-mail at <a title="support@yola.com" href="mailto:support@yola.com" id="z_l3">support@yola.com</a>.<br>&nbsp;<br></div><h2>Personal Information<br></h2><br><div>We collect two basic types of information with our service, namely personal information and aggregate information. As used herein, the term “personal information” means information that specifically identifies an individual (such as a name and e-mail address), and demographic and other information about an individual when directly linked to personally identifiable information. A user name may be personal information if it includes personally identifying information such as a first and last name. Our definition of personal information does not include “aggregate” information. Aggregate information is data we collect about a group or category of services or users from which individual user identities have been removed. In other words, information on how you use our service may be collected and combined with information about how others use the service, but no personal information will be included in the resulting data. Aggregate data helps us understand trends in our users’ needs so that we can better consider new features or otherwise tailor our service. This policy in no way restricts or limits our collection and use of aggregate information, and we may share aggregate information about our users with third parties for various purposes, including to help us better understand and improve our service, and for advertising and marketing purposes.<br><br></div><div><h2>Data Collected<br></h2><h2>Active Collection<br></h2><br></div><div><div>Personal information may be collected in a number of ways when you visit our Site. We may collect certain information you voluntarily provide to us which may contain personal information. For example, we may collect your name, address, email address, user name and other contact and demographic information when you register and set up an account or contact us by e-mail or other means for any reason. We may also collect payment information if applicable. If In addition, from time to time we may collect demographic, contact or other personal information you voluntarily provide to us, such as in connection with your participation in surveys, sweepstakes, contests, games, promotional offers, and other activities on the Site.<br><br>For each registered user of the Site (each a "Registered User") to the Yola Web Site, our Web server automatically recognizes any header information that is shared with our Web server. Yola collects the IP address and header information, and may collect the following:<br><br>The e-mail address of Registered Users of our Web Site and the Yola Toolset;<br>The e-mail addresses of Registered Users who post messages to our bulletin board, communicate with us via e-mail, and/or make postings to our chat areas;<br>Aggregate information on what pages Registered Users access or visit;<br>Registered User-specific information on what pages Registered Users access or visit; and <br>Personal information may also be collected if you leave comments or other communications on the Site, such as on the Yola Bulletin Board and/or chat areas, and/or send email directly to Yola. By doing so your name and the content of your communication may be made public.<br><br></div><div><h2>Automatically Collected Information<br></h2><br></div><div>As mentioned above, we automatically receive certain types of information whenever you interact with us. For example, when you use the Web site, our systems may automatically collect your IP address and the type of operating system or browser you use. We may also collect information pertaining to your account activity, and standard access information, such as the time and date of your accessing the service and your usage of the service. We use such information for purposes such as compiling aggregated statistics about service usage.<br>We may also use cookie technology to collect information. Among other things, the use of cookies enables us to:<br><br><ul><li>Store Registered User’s preferences;</li><li>Record session information, such as items that visitors and Registered Users add to their shopping cart;</li><li>Record Registered User-specific information on what pages Registered Users access or visit;</li><li>Alert Registered Users to new areas that we think might be of interest to them when they return to our site;</li><li>Record past activity at a site in order to provide better service when visitors and Registered Users return to our site; and</li><li>Deliver advertising targeted to your interests and ensure that visitors and Registered Users are not repeatedly served the same messages or offers.</li></ul><br>A cookie is a small amount of data, often including an anonymous unique identifier, which is sent to your browser from a web site’s computers and stored on your computer’s hard drive. Most browsers automatically accept cookies as the default setting. You can modify the setting to reject cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the sites you visit by editing browser options. However, if a browser is set not to accept cookies or if a user rejects a cookie, some portions of the Site and the service may not function properly. For example, you may not be able to sign in and may not be able to access certain Site features or services.<br><br></div><div><h2>Information about Children<br></h2><br></div><div>Our service is not intended to be used by children under the age of 13, and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13 except in compliance with applicable law.<br><br></div><div><h2>Use and Sharing of Information<br></h2><br></div><div>In general, we use personal information we collect to process your requests or transactions, to provide you with information or services you request, to inform you about other information, events, promotions, products or services we think will be of interest to you, to facilitate your use of, and our administration and operation of, the Site, and for the purpose for which the information was provided.

We reserve the right to disclose or transfer such information to a third party (a) if you request us to do so or we otherwise have your consent, (b) if we believe in good faith that we are lawfully authorized or required to do so or that doing so is reasonably necessary or appropriate to comply with the law or with legal process or authorities, respond to any claims, or to protect the rights, property or safety of Yola, our users, our employees or the public, including without limitation to protect Yola or our users or the public from fraudulent, abusive, inappropriate or unlawful use of our Site, (c) if we believe in good faith that an emergency involving immediate danger of death or serious physical injury to any person, or other irreparable injury, including economic interests of Yola or a third party, requires disclosure of the information, and (d) in connection with an acquisition, merger, or sale of all or a substantial portion of our business.<br><br>We may also share personal information with vendors, consultants and other service providers (“Service Providers”) who are engaged by or working with us in connection with the operation of the Site or the Services and who need access to such information to carry out their work for us. In some cases, the Service Provider may be directly collecting the information from you on our behalf. We may also share personal information with other third parties when you request that we do so or otherwise give us your express or implied consent. We are not responsible for the actions of Service Providers or other third parties, nor are we responsible for any additional information you provide directly to these Service Providers or other third parties, and we encourage you to become familiar with their privacy practices before disclosing information directly to them. Note that nothing herein restricts the sharing of aggregate information, which may be shared with third parties without your consent.<br><br></div><div><h2>Network and Information Security<br></h2><br></div><div>We use reasonable efforts to prevent unauthorized release of or access to your personal data. However, we cannot guarantee that your information will not be disclosed or accessed by accidental circumstances or by the unauthorized acts of others. If Yola learns of a security systems breach, then we may attempt to notify you electronically so that you can take appropriate protective steps.
