information practices.&nbsp; This
privacy statement covers the Web site www.yola.com. Because this Web site wants

information practices and have its privacy practices reviewed for compliance by
TRUSTe.
<br>
<br>
If you have questions or concerns regarding
this statement, you should first contact </i><a href="mailto:support@yola.com" title="support@yola.com">support@yola.com</a><i>
.&nbsp; If you do not receive
acknowledgement of your inquiry or your inquiry has not been satisfactorily

<br>
<p class="MsoNormal">This privacy policy
("Policy") explains how personal information is collected, used, and
disclosed by Yola, Inc., also doing business as SynthaSite, Inc., and
SynthaSite (Pty) Ltd. (collectively "Yola") with respect to your use
of the web site located at www.yola.com (the "Site") so you can make
an informed decision about using the Site and the web site creation and hosting
services offered by Yola. Please note that this Policy does not apply to, and
we are not responsible in any manner for, any information you provide to third
parties in connection with web sites hosted by Yola ("User Sites") or
how the third parties who operate such User Sites may use the personal
information you provide to them. Such information is subject to the privacy
practices of such User Site, and we encourage you to become familiar with their
privacy practices before disclosing information directly to them. Registration
forms contain both mandatory fields (as indicated) and non-mandatory fields; if
you choose not to complete the mandatory fields then Yola may not be able to
respond to your request or activate your option choices. By using the Yola
Toolset and/or the Yola Web Site, you consent to any transfer of personal
information, collected by Yola, outside your country for the purposes of
storing the information where Yola and/or its agents maintain their facilities.<br>
<br>
We reserve the right to change this Policy at any time. If we make any material
changes to&nbsp; the way we use your
personally identifiable information, we will notify you here,&nbsp; post a new policy on our Site and
update the “last updated” date set forth above, or by email. Therefore, we
encourage you to check our Policy whenever you use the service to see if it has
been updated since your last visit. Your use of the Site after the revised
Policy has been posted will constitute your consent to such revised Policy. If
you are concerned about how your personal information is used, you should
subscribe to our blog RSS feed at <a href="http://blog.yola.com/" title="http://blog.yola.com">http://blog.yola.com</a> or e-mail us at <a href="mailto:support@yola.com" title="support@yola.com">support@yola.com</a> .
This will not prevent Yola from using your personal information for the
administration or operation of the Site or other nonmarketing purposes
described in this Policy.</p>

<h2>Our Postal Address is:</h2>
<br>
51 Federal Street, Suite 401<br>
San Francisco, CA 94107<br>
<br>
We can be reached via e-mail at <a title="support@yola.com" href="mailto:support@yola.com" id="z_l3">support@yola.com</a>.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
</div>
<h2>Personal Information
</h2>
<br>
We collect two basic types of
information with our service, namely personal information and aggregate
information. As used herein, the term “personal information” means information
that specifically identifies an individual (such as a name and e-mail address),
and demographic and other information about an individual when directly linked
to personally identifiable information. A user name may be personal information
if it includes personally identifying information such as a first and last
name. Our definition of personal information does not include “aggregate”
information. Aggregate information is data we collect about a group or category
of services or users from which individual user identities have been removed.
In other words, information on how you use our service may be collected and combined
with information about how others use the service, but no personal information
will be included in the resulting data. Aggregate data helps us understand
trends in our users’ needs so that we can better consider new features or
otherwise tailor our service. This policy in no way restricts or limits our
collection and use of aggregate information, and we may share aggregate
information about our users with third parties for various purposes, including
to help us better understand and improve our service, and for advertising and
marketing purposes.
<div>
<br>
<h2>Updating/Accessing/Amending
Personally Identifiable Information</h2>
<br>
<p class="MsoNormal">If your personally
identifiable information changes, or if you no longer desire our service, you
may update your profile or delete it by clicking on the Edit Profile link after
you log in or by emailing our Customer Support at support@yola.com. </p>
<br>
<h2>Data Collected</h2>
<br>
<h2>Active Collection</h2>
<br>
<p class="MsoNormal">Personal
information may be collected in a number of ways when you visit our Site. We
may collect certain information you voluntarily provide to us which may contain
personal information. For example, we may collect your name, address, email
address, user name and other contact and demographic information when you
register and set up an account or contact us by e-mail or other means for any
reason. We may also collect payment information if applicable. If In addition,
from time to time we may collect demographic, contact or other personal
information you voluntarily provide to us, such as in connection with your

We may also collect information pertaining to your account activity, and standard access information, such as the time and date of your accessing the service and your usage of the service. We use such information for purposes such as compiling aggregated statistics about service usage.<br>
We may also use cookie technology to collect information. Among other things, the use of cookies enables us to:<br>

A cookie is a small amount of data, often including an anonymous unique identifier, which is sent to your browser from a web site’s computers and stored on your computer’s hard drive. Most browsers automatically accept cookies as the default setting. You can modify the setting to reject cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the sites you visit by editing browser options. However, if a browser is set not to accept cookies or if a user rejects a cookie, some portions of the Site and the service may not function properly. For example, you may not be able to sign in and may not be able to access certain Site features or services.<br>

<h2><b>Third Party Cookies </b></h2>

<br>
If you click on a link to a third party site, you will leave the<a href="http://www.yola.com/"> Yola</a> site you are visiting and go to the site you selected. Because we cannot control the activities of third parties, we cannot accept responsibility for any use of your personally identifiable information by such third parties, and we cannot guarantee that they will adhere to the same privacy practices as Yola. If you visit a third party website that is linked to from a Yola site, you should read that website’s privacy statement before providing any personally identifiable information. <br>
<br>
