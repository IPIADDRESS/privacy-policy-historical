<p><font size="+1" color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial">Does YotaTech ask for personal information?</font>
</p><ul>
<li>
<font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial">
We do not require you to divulge any personal information to read the forums,
but in order to post you are required to enter a valid email address in
order to register.</font></li>

<li>
<font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial">
This is used&nbsp; for the boards own protection against spammers who make
bogus accounts and try to post info about their products, and to help us
keep track of malicious users.</font></li>

<li>
<font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial">
You can choose to not reveal your email address on the forum for anyone
else to see.</font></li>
</ul>
<font size="+1" color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial">Does YotaTech use any personal information it may gather?</font>
<ul>
<li>
<font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial">
The only information we need from the membership is a valid email address
so you can sign up, and so the board can email you a lost password if you
lose yours.</font></li>
</ul>
<font size="+1" color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial">Will YotaTech sell or disclose any of your personal information?</font>
<ul>
<li>
<font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial">
We will never give out your private information to a 3rd party or to anyone
unless you authorize it.</font></li>
</ul>
<font size="+1" color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial">What about kids?</font>
<ul>
<li>
<font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial">
The overall safety of children is very important to us here at YotaTech.
Children should get their patents permission before partaking in any type
of an online discussion.</font></li>

<li>
<font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial">
Children should also be encouraged to not give out any personal info while
online.</font></li>
</ul>
<font size="+1" color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial">Does YotaTech use cookies?</font>
<ul>
<li>
<font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial">
Cookies can be enabled or disabled by the members here. The benefit of
using cookies is that it will display the correct time on the forums posts
for you, and also the live clock that the forum uses.</font></li>

<li>
<font face="Arial" color="#FFFFFF">
They are also used for keeping track of which posts you have already viewed,
and for telling you which new posts have been composed since you were away
when you click on the "<a href="http://www.yotatech.com/search.php?s=&amp;action=getnew">View
new posts</a>" at the top right of the forums index page.</font></li>

<li>
<font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial">
Cookies are also used so you do not have to log in every time you open
up your browser and surf on over to YotaTech if you so choose to remain
logged in all the time.</font></li>

<li>
<font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial">
If you wish to log out of the forum if you will be away from your PC for
an extended period, you will find on the main </font> <a href="http://www.yotatech.com">

<font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial">
 in the lower right there is a place to log out.</font></li>
</ul>
<font size="+1" color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial">Does YotaTech use my IP address in anyway?</font>
<ul>
<li>
<font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial">
YotaTech may collect IP addresses for the purpose only of tracking a malicious
user who is abusing the system, or for the harassment of other members.
Then the IP can be used to block an abuser from posting on the forums.</font></li>
</ul>
<font size="+1" color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial">What else should I know about my privacy?</font>
<ul>
<li>
<font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial">
Any information you divulge on a public forum can be collected by a 3rd
party without your knowledge. For example any info you type in chat, email,
or on BBS's can be collected and used by others. If you post your email
address for example, a spammer could take your address and add it to his
list for future emailings.</font></li>

<li>
<font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial">
Like was mentioned earlier, you can in your setting in your Control Panel
turn off your email address from being visible. Members can still contact
you if you leave the option to receive Private Messages is turned on. I
would in my opinion at least have that feature enabled as a member may
want to contact you privately without the whole board seeing their message.</font></li>

<li>
<font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial">
Only you can protect your personal information is deciding what and how
much you want to post in your posts about yourself. Please be careful and
responsible whenever you're online.</font></li>
</ul>
<font face="Arial" color="#FFFFFF">
If you have any further questions, please feel free to contact any staff
member or </font> <a href="mailto:corey@yotatech.com?SUBJECT=Question on forum privacy"><font face="Arial" color="#FFFF00">email
me</font></a><font face="Arial" color="#FFFFFF">.</font>
