			<h1>Privacy</h1>
			<br>
			<h3>This Privacy Policy describes Yobongoâ€™s policies and procedures on the
			collection, use and disclosure of your information. Yobongo receives
			your information through our various mobile apps, web sites, services
			and third-parties ("Services"). When using any of our Services you
			consent to the collection, transfer, manipulation, storage, disclosure
			and other uses of your information as described in this Privacy
			Policy. Irrespective of which country that you reside in or create
			information from, your information may be used by Yobongo in the
			United States or any other country where Yobongo operates.
			If you have any questions or comments about this Privacy Policy,
			please contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@yobongo.com">privacy@yobongo.com.</a></h3>

			<h2>Information Collection and Use</h2>

			<h3>Information Collected Upon Registration: When you create or
			reconfigure a Yobongo account, you provide some personal information,
			such as your name, password, phone number, photo, and email address.
			Some of this information, for example, your name and photo, is listed
			publicly on our Services, including on your profile page and in search
			results.</h3>

			<h3>Additional Information: You may provide us with additional information
			to make public, such as a short biography. You may customize your
			account with information such as a cell phone number for the delivery
			of SMS messages or your address book so that we can help you find
			Yobongo users you know. We may use your contact information to send
			you information about our Services or to market to you. You may
			unsubscribe from these messages by following the instructions
			contained within the messages or the instructions on our web site. If
			you email us, we may keep your message, email address and contact
			information to respond to your request. Providing the additional
			information described in this section is entirely optional.</h3>

			<h3>Yobongo Messages: Our Services are primarily designed to help you
			share information with the people around you and the world. Most of
			the information you provide to us is information you are asking us to
			make public. This includes not only the messages you send and the
			metadata provided with messages, such as when you sent the message.
			Our default is almost always to make the information you provide
			public. You should be careful about all information that will be made
			public by Yobongo, not just your messages.</h3>

			<h3>Yobongo Private Messages: Private messages you send to others are just
			that, private. We will not share or view your private messages. They
			are safe and secure.</h3>

			<h3>Location Information: We do not share you specific location
			information publicly. However, we do use your location information to
			connect you with others on Yobongo.</h3>

			<h3>Log Data: Our servers automatically record information ("Log Data")
			created by your use of the Services. Log Data may include information
			such as your IP address, browser type, the referring domain, pages
			visited, and search terms. Other actions, such as interactions with
			advertisements, may also be included in Log Data.
			Links: Yobongo may keep track of how you interact with links in
			messages across our Services including third party clients by
			redirecting clicks or through other means. We do this to help improve
			our Services, including advertising, and to be able to share aggregate
			click statistics such as how many times a particular link was clicked
			on.</h3>
			
			<h3>Cookies: Like many websites, we use "cookie" technology to collect
			additional website usage data and to improve our Services, but we do
			not require cookies for many parts of our Services such as searching
			and looking at public user profiles or lists. A cookie is a small data
			file that is transferred to your computer's hard disk. Yobongo may use
			both session cookies and persistent cookies to better understand how
			you interact with our Services, to monitor aggregate usage by our
			users and web traffic routing on our Services, and to improve our
			Services. Most Internet browsers automatically accept cookies. You can
			instruct your browser, by editing its options, to stop accepting
			cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the websites
			you visit.</h3>

			<h3>Third Party Services: Yobongo uses a variety of services hosted by
			third parties to help provide our Services, such as hosting our
			various blogs and wikis, and to help us understand the use of our
			Services, such as Google Analytics. These services may collect
			information sent by your browser as part of a web page request, such
			as cookies or your IP request.</h3>

			<h2>Information Sharing and Disclosure</h2>

			<h3>Your Consent: We may share or disclose your information with your
			consent, such as when you use a third party web client to access your
			Yobongo account.</h3>

			<h3>Service Providers: We engage certain trusted third parties to perform
			functions and provide services to us. We may share your personal
			information with these third parties, but only to the extent necessary
			to perform these functions and provide such services, and only
			pursuant to obligations mirroring the protections of this privacy
			policy.</h3>

			<h3>Law and Harm: We may disclose your information if we believe that it
			is reasonably necessary to comply with a law, regulation or legal
			request; to protect the safety of any person; to address fraud,
			security or technical issues; or to protect Yobongo's rights or
			property.</h3>

			<h3>Business Transfers: In the event that Yobongo is involved in a
			bankruptcy, merger, acquisition, reorganization or sale of assets,
			your information may be sold or transferred as part of that
			transaction. The promises in this privacy policy will apply to your
			information as transferred to the new entity.</h3>

			<h3>Non-Private or Non-Personal Information: We may share or disclose your
			non-private, aggregated or otherwise non-personal information, such as
			your public Tweets or the number of users who clicked on a particular
			link (even if only one did).</h3>
			
			<h2>Modifying Your Personal Information</h2>

			<h3>If you are a registered user of our Services, we provide you with
			tools to access or modify the personal information you provided to us
			and associated with your account.</h3>

			<h2>Our Policy Towards Children</h2>
			
			<h3>Our Services are not directed to people under 13. If you become aware
			that your child has provided us with personal information without your
			consent, please contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@yobongo.com">privacy@yobongo.com.</a>. We do not knowingly
			collect personal information from children under 13. If we become
			aware that a child under 13 has provided us with personal information,
			we take steps to remove such information and terminate the child's
			account.</h3>

			<h2>Changes to this Policy</h2>
			
			<h3>We may revise this Privacy Policy from time to time. The most current
			version of the policy will govern our use of your information and will
			always be at <a href="http://yobongo.com/privacy">http://yobongo.com/privacy</a>. If we make a change to this
			policy that, in our sole discretion, is material, we may notify you
			via e-mail to the email associated with your account. By continuing to
			access or use the Services after those changes become effective, you
			agree to be bound by the revised Privacy Policy.</h3>

			<h3>This Privacy Policy is effective as of March 3 2011.</h3>

			<h3>Thoughts or questions about this Privacy Policy? Please, let us know.</h3>
