            <p>
                <b>1. INTRODUCTION</b></p>
            <p>
                Yontoo LLC (the "Company", "we" or "us") welcomes
                you to www.yontoo.com (the "Site") and the Yontoo Platform downloadable
                browser add-on (the "Platform"). Downloading the Platform enables you
                to access and use other browser add-on applications (the “Apps”) available for download
                at the Site. The Platform, Apps, and any other applications, products, services,
                features, content, promotions or games offered from time to time by the Company
                in connection with its business shall be referred to herein as the "Services".
                The Company is based in the United States and the Services are hosted in the United
                States.</p>
            <p>
                As set forth in the Company’s Terms of Service currently available at [<a href="http://www.yontoo.com/TermsOfService.aspx" target="_blank">http://www.yontoo.com/TermsOfService.aspx</a>], the Services
                are general audience, are not targeted to children, and do not knowingly collect
                personal information from children under 13 years of age. If we learn that we have
                collected personal information from a child under age 13, we will delete that information
                as quickly as possible. If you believe that we might have any information from a child
                under age 13, please contact us through our support page (<a href="http://www.yontoo.com/Support.aspx" target="_blank">www.yontoo.com/Support.aspx</a>).</p>
            <p>
                This Privacy Policy applies to all users, including those who use the Services without
                being registered with the Company and those who have registered with any Company
                Service. This Privacy Policy describes the Company’s collection and use of users’
                personal information (e.g., information that identifies a specific person, such
                as full name or email address) where that information is not otherwise publicly
                available on the Services. We also describe generally the Company’s practices for
                handling non-personally identifiable information (e.g., interests, demographics
                and site usage) to the extent such information is associated with a particular user
                or user account. Your access to and use of certain Services, including but not limited
                to certain Apps, may require you to accept additional terms and conditions or a
                privacy policy applicable to such Services.</p>
            <p>
                The Yontoo Platform and Apps are free to download and use. Most Apps are supported
                by advertising, which means you will see additional display ads when using these
                Apps. These ads are not associated with any underlying website, and further information
                about these ads is available by clicking the "About This Ad" link in the
                ad display frame. If you are interested in purchasing an ad-free upgraded version
                of certain Apps, please visit the Site for more information. Further information
                regarding App advertising is also available at the Site.</p>
            <p>
                <b>2. SUBMISSION AND COLLECTION OF INFORMATION</b></p>
            <p>
                <i>User Submitted Information</i></p>
            <p>
                <b>Registration Information</b> is the information that users must provide to the
                Company upon registration for certain Services (e.g., your user name, email address,
                and account password). Downloading the Platform does not require the submission
                of any registration information.</p>
            <p>
                <b>Public Information and Posts</b> consist of comments or content that you may
                voluntarily post on or through certain to the Services, Site, and the information
                about you that accompanies those posts or content, such as a user name and/or user
                picture. Public Information and Posts will always be public, which means it will
                be available to everyone and will be displayed in search results both on the Services
                and on external search engines.</p>
            <p>
                <b>Third Party Information and Content. </b>If you access the Services through a
                third party connection or log-in, your user submitted information may also include
                your user name associated with that third party service, any information or content
                you have permitted the third party to share with the Company, and any information
                you have made public in connection with that third party service (collectively,
                "Third Party Information and Content"). Third Party Information and Content
                obtained in this manner will be governed by this Privacy Policy and the terms and
                conditions applicable to use of the Services. In addition, the Company may supplement
                the information we collect with information we obtain from third parties to improve
                the quality of the Services.</p>
            <p>
                <i>Collected Information</i></p>
            <p>
                <b>Transactional and Site Activity Information.</b> When users access the Services,
                we collect certain non-personally identifiable information about those visits for
                marketing purposes. For example, in order to permit your connection to the Services,
                our servers receive and record information about your computer, operating system
                and browser, including your IP address, browser type, and other software or hardware
                information. If you access the Services from a mobile or other device, we may collect
                a unique device identifier assigned to that device or other transactional information
                for that device in order to serve content to it.</p>
            <p>
                <b>Tracking Technologies.</b>&nbsp; The Company may use cookies and other tracking
                technologies (such as browser cookies, pixels, beacons, and Adobe Flash technology),
                which are comprised of small bits of data that often include an anonymous unique
                identifier. Websites send this data to your browser when you first request a web
                page and then store the data on your computer so the website can access information
                when you make subsequent requests for pages from that site. These technologies may
                be used to collect and store information about your usage of the Services, such
                as pages you have visited, search queries you have run, links you have clicked and
                advertisements you have seen so that we can serve you more relevant ads when using
                the Services. The Company may also use cookies and similar tools to relate your
                use of Services to personal information obtained from you or a reputable third party.
                For example, if you have asked us to provide you information about our upcoming
                products or promotions, cookie and/or click stream data about your activities on
                the Company Website may allow us to limit the materials we provide you to items
                we think you will find interesting, based on your prior online activities and preferences.</p>
            <p>
                <b>Third Party Collection.</b> Third parties that support the Services by serving
                advertisements or providing other services, such as providing users with the ability
                to comment on content, allowing users to share content or tracking aggregate site
                usage statistics may also use cookies and other tracking technologies described
                above to collect similar information. The Company does not control these third parties
                and their use of these technologies is governed by the privacy policies of the third
                parties using such technologies. For more information about third party ad networks
                that use these technologies, see <a href="http://www.aboutads.info/" target="_blank">
                    www.aboutads.info</a>. Most browsers are initially set to accept cookies, but
                you can change your settings to notify you when a cookie is being set or updated,
                or to block cookies altogether. Please consult the "Help" section of your

                Please note that by blocking any or all cookies you may not have access to the Services

                <b>3. NOTICE AND MODIFICATIONS</b></p>
            <p>
                <b>Means of Notice and Privacy Policy Modifications. </b>This Privacy Policy is
                the means by which the Company provides you with notice about its collection and
                use of your personal information. The Company will not use your personal information
                in a manner different from what is described in this Privacy Policy. The Company
                may modify this Privacy Policy at any time, and each such modification will be effective
                upon posting on the Site. Your continued use of the Services following any such
                modification constitutes your acceptance of the Privacy Policy as so modified. It
                is therefore important that you review this Privacy Policy regularly. You may also
                receive a copy of this Privacy Policy by emailing us at <a href="mailto:PrivacyPolicy@Yontoo.com">
                    PrivacyPolicy@Yontoo.com</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Location of Data.</b> The Services are hosted in the United States. If you are
                a user located outside the United States, you understand and consent to having any
                personal information you provide transferred to, processed, and stored in the United
                States and other countries where data protection and other privacy laws may not
                offer the same level of protection as in your jurisdiction, such as the European
                Union. This includes the use of cookies and other tracking technologies as described
                above. As a result, please read this Privacy Policy with care.</p>
            <p>
                <b>Linked Services.</b> The Services may also be linked to sites or services operated
                by the Company’s affiliates or third parties, and may carry advertisements or offer
                content, functionality, games, rewards programs, newsletters, contests or sweepstakes,
                or applications developed and maintained by third parties including, any online
                store. The Company is not responsible for the privacy practices of any such third
                parties, and once you leave the Services via a link, enable a third party service,
                or click an advertisement, you should check the applicable privacy policy of the
                third party site. Users who visit a Company affiliated site should still refer to
                its separate privacy policy, which may differ in some respects from this Privacy
                Policy.</p>
            <p>
                <b>4. USE &amp; DISCLOSURE</b></p>
            <p>
                <i>Information Made Public Through Use of the Services</i></p>
            <p>
                Users' Public Information and Posts are always publicly available to anyone, including
                other users, search engines, advertisers, third party application developers, and
                anyone else with access to the Services.</p>
            <p>
                Third Party Information and Content may be publicly available according to the permissions
                you grant to the Company, the applicable policies of the third party and the terms
                and conditions and/or terms of use for the Services.</p>
            <p>
                <i>Company's Use and Disclosure of Information</i></p>
            <p>
                We only share your non-public personal information with non-affiliated third parties
                when we believe sharing is permitted by you or authorized by this Privacy Policy.
                In addition, the Company may share your personal information with our affiliated
                companies.</p>
            <p>
                We use the information we collect from and about users for the following purposes:</p>
            <p>
                <b>To provide and manage the Services</b>. We use the information we collect from
                and about users to provide the Services to you, to measure and improve the Services,
                to personalize your experience by delivering relevant content, advertising and marketing
                messages, to allow you to comment on content, participate in online games, contests,
                promotions or rewards programs, to enable you to communicate and share with other
                users or services, and to provide you with customer support and respond to inquiries.
                We may use aggregated, anonymous data about use of and activity on the Services
                to assist us in this regard and such data is not subject to this Privacy Policy.</p>
            <p>
                <b>To allow third party service providers to assist us in providing and managing the
                    Services.</b> The Company may make your non-public personal information available
                to certain third party service providers, such as contractors, agents or sponsors,

                personal information entrusted to them and not use it for any other purpose than
                the specific service they are providing to the Company.</p>
            <p>
                <b>To contact you.</b> The Company may periodically send promotional materials or

                <b>To protect the rights of Company and our users.</b> There may be instances when
                the Company may disclose user information without providing notice or choice, including
                situations where the Company has a good faith belief that such disclosure is necessary
                in order to: (i) protect or defend the legal rights or property of the Company,
                our affiliated companies or their employees, agents and contractors (including enforcement
                of our agreements); (ii) protect the safety and security of users of the Services
                or members of the public; (iii) protect against fraud or for risk management purposes;
                or (iv) comply with the law or legal process.</p>

                <b>To complete a merger or sale of assets.</b> If the Company sells all or part

                in a merger or transfer of all or a material part of its business, the Company may
                transfer your information to the party or parties involved in the transaction as

                <b>5. SECURITY</b></p>
            <p>
                The Company uses reasonable administrative, technical, personnel and physical measures
                to safeguard user information in its possession against loss, theft and unauthorized
                use, disclosure or modification. Unfortunately, no transmission of data over the
                Internet can ever be guaranteed to be completely secure. It may be possible for
                third parties not under our control to intercept or access transmissions or private
                communications unlawfully. While we strive to protect your personal information,
                the Company cannot ensure or warrant the security of any personal information you
                transmit to us. Any such transmission is done at your own risk. If you believe that
                your interaction with us is no longer secure, please notify us of the problem by
                emailing <a href="mailto:PrivacyPolicy@Yontoo.com">PrivacyPolicy@Yontoo.com</a>.</p>

                <b>6. USER CONTROL AND UNINSTALLING SOFTWARE</b></p>
            <p>
                You may uninstall the Platform, Apps or any other software related to the Services
                at any time by following the instructions provided in the Company’s Terms of Service
                currently available at [<a href="http://www.yontoo.com/TermsOfService.aspx" target="_blank">http://www.yontoo.com/TermsOfService.aspx</a>].
                Note that after you uninstall the Platform, certain related files may remain on
                your system. These remnant files are a record of your previous download of the Company's
                software, and are not executable programs. These files help the Company to prevent
                fraud on the Services and to better service you if you choose to download the software
                again. We will not use the files to track you or otherwise collect or store information
                about you. If you have registered a user account with the Company, you may cancel
                your account at any time on the Site, and unsubscribe to Company promotional materials
                by clicking the "unsubscribe" link at the bottom of the applicable e-mail.
                Remember that even after you uninstall software or cancel your account, copies of
                some information that is publicly viewable may remain viewable in circumstances
                where, for example, you have commented on content on the Services or if another
                person copied, stored or shared your information. We may also retain backup information
                related to your account on our servers for some time after cancellation for fraud
                detection or to comply with applicable law or our internal security policies.</p>
