<ul style="MARGIN-LEFT: 15px; LIST-STYLE-TYPE: decimal">
<li>process data exclusively for the purposes and according to the methods illustrated in the notice presented to users at the time of its collection; </li>
<li>use data for other purposes, with respect to those specified at the time of collection, only where the user has expressed its express consent to such use; </li>
<li>make data available to third party companies only for purposes that are strictly necessary to provide the requested service(s) and only where monitored by a data supervisor; not communicate, cede or transfer data to third parties for purposes exclusive to the third party unless the users have received prior warning and have granted their consent; </li>
<li>answer all requests for cancellation, variation and integration of personal data, opposition to data processing for the purpose of sending commercial information and advertising; </li>
<li>ensure that data processing is conducted fairly and legally, protecting user privacy and implementing appropriate measures for security and protection of the privacy, integrity and availability of the data provided by users.</li></ul><br><br><b>How and why we process your personal data</b><br><br>Personal data processing is conducted primarily by means of information systems and electronic devices by YOOX and other parties who, selected with care for their reliability and competence, conduct operations that are essential in order to achieve the purposes strictly related to the use of the web site, its services and sale of products via the web site (see below, â€˜Parties who may process your personal dataâ€™).<br>The specific purposes for which your personal data is processed are summarized each time you communicate your personal data, in the notice presented in compliance with art. 13 of Legislative Decree 196/2003. In general, data is processed in order to provide the following services available to those who visit our site:<br><br>
<ul style="MARGIN-LEFT: 15px; LIST-STYLE-TYPE: decimal">
<li>registration on the site, to enjoy the services we offer; </li>
<li>subscription to additional specific services, such as our YOOXNEWS newsletter, and other similar information bulletins about our activities, the creation of your Dream Box and sharing its content, inviting your friends to join the YOOX world, making yourself known to other users by sending us your photo and your comments;<lifulfilling orders="" and="" related="" tasks;<="" li=""> </lifulfilling></li>
<li>handling of your requests: be they technical, commercial, concerning progress reports on your orders and generally speaking all information requests; </li>
<li>contacting the managers of our services (Press Office, Business Development, Web Marketing, Buying Office, Customer Care); </li>
<li>evaluating requests on your behalf to be included in our personnel by submitting your CV. In processing personal data that may, directly or indirectly, identify you, we aim to abide by the principle of strict necessity. </li></ul><br>For this reason we have set up the site in such a way as to reduce use of your personal data to the absolute minimum: therefore, your personal data is not processed when the purpose of the specific activity can be achieved by using anonymous data (such as market surveys intended to improve services) or by means of other methods that make it possible to identify the person involved only if strictly necessary or at the request of authorities or the police (such as site traffic data, the time you spend visiting our site or your IP address).<br>In some cases, as expressly cited in the notice, your personal data will be processed, if you expressly grant your consent, to create a user profile based on your preferences and your purchases, so that we can send you information that is pertinent to your needs and interests. With the exception of the case specified at art. 130, paragraph 4, of Legislative Decree 196/2003 (authorising the data controller to use your data to send you advertising e-mails about products and services similar to those you have already purchased, unless you refuse your consent for such use), YOOX may use your personal data to send you advertising about its products and services only if you grant your consent. <br>Your personal data will be communicated to third parties only with your express consent, except for the cases when such communication is obligatory by law or is required for purposes envisaged by the law, for which the personâ€™s consent is not required; in these cases the personal data may be made available to third parties who will process the data autonomously and exclusively for such purposes (for example, in reply to a request from police or the courts or other competent authorities, or in order to fulfil duties that descend from a completed contract with you, such as communicating your personal data to <a href="https://www.sella.it/index.jsp" target="ioMain">Banca Sella S.p.A.</a> for payment of the products you have bought). <br>Some of the services provided through our site also include diffusion of your personal data to other registered users: this is the case if you decide to create a Public Dream Box or to join the Friends of MYOOX service.<br>Any other type of processing, other than related to the specific purpose for which you have communicated your personal data will be indicated in the information notice and will be carried out by YOOX only if you have expressly granted your consent (this is the case, for example, when a customer profile is created based on your preferences and buying habits).<br>There are, however, instances of data processing for which the law established that your consent is not required: for example, we wish to inform you that YOOX can process your personal data without your consent if this is necessary to comply with the provisions of the law or whenever this is necessary to fulfil the contractual obligations it may have entered into with you (for example, when you have bought products or have requested specific services through our web site).<br>Finally, we wish to inform you that your personal data will not be transferred abroad to countries that do not belong to the European Union that do not provide a sufficient level of privacy protection. If such a transfer should be necessary to provide you with the services or to conclude a contract with YOOX for purchasing our products, we wish to assure you that your personal data will not be transferred to countries that do not belong to the European Union and do not provide a sufficient level of privacy protection unless specific agreements are concluded by YOOX with such parties, in accordance with applicable laws and regulations. <br>It could happen that YOOX may find itself processing personal data of third parties, communicated directly to YOOX by its own users, such as when a user has bought a product to be delivered to a friend, or when the person who pays for a product is different from the addressee, or again, when a user wishes to inform a friend about a service or the sale of a specific product on YOOX.COM. <br>In these circumstances, YOOX will deliver the notice pursuant to art. 13 of Legislative Decree 196/2003 to the third party, when the personal data of the same is registered in its archives, it is however your own responsibility to obtain consent from this person before communicating his/her personal data to YOOX and to inform him/her about this Privacy Policy, because you will be the sole person responsible for communication of information and data about third parties without them having granted their consent or in the event that such data be used in an illicit or improper way. <br>We wish to inform you that the consent of these persons is not required when their data is communicated to YOOX in order to conclude a contract with YOOX in their favour. <br>YOOX reserves the right to eliminate MYOOX accounts and all related data if illicit contents is discovered that is harmful to the image of YOOX and/or its products or those of third parties or, in any case, may be considered offensive, may be seen to promote illegal or libellous activities, includes pornographic material, incite to violence, or promote discrimination based on race, gender, religion or sexual preferences.<br><br><b>Parties who may process your personal data</b><br><br>YOOX has chosen to call on other companies for processing your personal data, for certain specific activities. The companies that conduct such operations have been carefully selected and are experienced, capable and trustworthy, and offer sufficient guarantees that they abide by the applicable laws and regulations that regulate data processing, including the security profile of such data.<br>These companies have therefore been appointed data supervisors, and they conduct their activities according to the instructions and under the control of YOOX. We verify on a regular basis that they have fulfilled the duties assigned to them and that they continue to offer sufficient guarantees of compliance with the provisions that govern the protection of personal data.<br>Your personal data is also processed by our employees assigned to specific services; the categories of employees involved in these activities depend on the purposes for which the data was communicated and are always specified in the notice displayed when you communicate your personal data.<br><br><b>Cookies</b><br><br>Our site uses automatic systems to collect data that is not directly communicated by the user, such as cookies.

If you have activated cookie cancellation, YOOX cannot guarantee that you will have access to full visualization of certain web pages, or be entitled to obtain certain services, such as for example the memorisation and visualisation, on given web pages, of the products you have selected during the process of online buying.<br><br><b>Security measures</b><br><br>We adopt security measures that are sufficient to reduce the risks of destruction or loss of data â€“ even if accidental â€“ to a minimum, to impede unauthorised access, illicit types of processing and processing that is not in accordance with the purposes of collection as indicated in our Privacy Policy.<br>However, YOOX cannot guarantee its users that the security measures adopted to protect the site, data transmission and information on the site, limit or exclude any risk whatsoever of unauthorised access or dispersion of data via user devices: we advise you to ensure that your computer is equipped with appropriate software to protect data transmission on the network, both incoming and outgoing (such as up to date antivirus systems) and that your Internet service provider has also adopted adequate security measures to protect network data transmission (such as a firewall and antispamming filters). <br><br><b>Deep links to other web sites</b><br><br>Our site includes deep links to other web sites that may have no relation to us. <br>YOOX does not control or monitor such web sites or their contents. YOOX may not be held responsible for the contents of such sites and the rules they apply, even with regard to your privacy and processing of your personal data during your navigation on their pages.
