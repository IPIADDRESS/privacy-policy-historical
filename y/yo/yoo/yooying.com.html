We process AAI and IPI differently, and the following articles describe both AAI and IPI and indicate how each type of information is collected and used by Yooying.<br>            The Site make it possible to monitor certain information automatically, based on your behaviour. This information does not identify you personally. We use this information to improve the Content and functionality of the Site, and to better understand and satisfy our visitors.

Some of the Site’s functions require asking you for certain IPI, such as your instagram username, instagram password and/or other personal information.<br>            But we do not handle your Instagram passwords directly. We use Instagram's API and OAuth 2.0 protocol to authorize Our users. Our databases are secured with passwords to guard against unauthorized access of Our systems. Only engineer staff members may access data on a need-to-know basis.<br>            You may choose to provide IPI in order to access certain functions on the Site. You can always choose not to provide certain information, but in that case it may be that you cannot use certain of the Site’s functions.<br><br><strong>1.2 Shared information</strong><br>

We will disclose personally identifiable information upon receipt of a court order, or if required to co-operate with law enforcement, administrative or other governmental agencies. We reserve the right to report to law enforcement agencies any activities that We in good faith believe to be unlawful.<br>
