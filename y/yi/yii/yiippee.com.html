  that others have given you, is posted in public areas and available to all visitors. Please remember that any information <br>
  that is disclosed in these areas becomes public information, so please exercise caution. <br>
    <br>
  Security &amp; Disclosure <br>
  This site has security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse, and alteration of the information under our control. <br>
  All member data and activity is stored separately and is not directly accessible through a web browser. We use industry standard <br>
  procedures and processes to safeguard the confidentiality of your identifiable personal information, such as firewalls, <br>
  encryption, token authentication, monitoring technology, and adaptive analysis of network traffic to track abuse of our <br>
  network and its data. Unfortunately, when you submit information about yourself to yiippee over the Internet, the information <br>
  may travel over many systems that are not under the control of yiippee. The Internet is not 100% secure and others might <br>
  intercept the information that you are sending. Remember that your account is accessible only through the use of your <br>
  Password. <br>
    <br>
    <br>
  Who will have access to my personal information? <br>
  Our priority is to keep your personal information private and confidential. yiippee will not willfully disclose, rent, or <br>
  sell your personal information to third parties. However, certain personal information will be available to others in the <br>
  process of using yiippee. For example, visitors to yiippee may view your sign-in name, feedback rating, city, and items you <br>
  have for sale. <br>
    <br>
  Of course, once you provide personal information to a user, yiippee has no control over how that information might be used <br>
  by that individual. In addition, should you circumvent our on-site messaging system; yiippee will be unable to provide <br>
  assistance in transaction disputes. We recommend using our messaging system for any communications between you and other <br>
  potential users. <br>
    <br>
    <br>

    <br>
    <br>
  You consent to share your information. <br>

</p>
<p>Your actions on yiippee appear to be in violation of our policies (including, but not limited to, our Terms &amp; Conditions).<br>
</p>
<p>You post a classified ad which we believe, in our sole discretion, may create a liability for yiippee.<br>
</p>
<p>Nothing in this policy shall limit, prohibit, or otherwise deny the ability of yiippee to (1) transfer, assign, or sell our <br>
  assets to a third party without limitation, or (2) dispose of our assets in any manner, through bankruptcy or similar <br>
  proceeding. In addition, yiippee makes no warranties or claims regarding the accuracy or completeness of the information we <br>
  collect and disclose through our site, and disclaims any liability regarding its use. <br>

  Changes to this policy <br>
  Please note that this Privacy Policy may change from time to time. We will not reduce your rights under this Policy without <br>
  your explicit consent, and we expect most such changes will be minor. Regardless, we will post any Policy changes on this <br>
  page and, if the changes are significant, we will provide a more prominent notice (including, for certain services, email <br>
  notification of Policy changes). Each version of this Policy will be identified at the top of the page by its effective date,<br>
