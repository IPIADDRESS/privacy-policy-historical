			<h4></h4>
			<p>Yipit cares about your privacy and takes it very seriously. Please read the following to learn more about our privacy policy. By visiting the Yipit website, you are accepting the practices outlined in this Privacy Policy.</p>
			<h4>What does this Privacy Policy cover?</h4>
			<p>This Privacy Policy covers Yipit's treatment of personal information that Yipit gathers when you are on the Yipit website and when you use Yipit services.</p>
			<p>This policy does not apply to the practices of third parties that Yipit does not own or control, or to individuals that Yipit does not employ or manage.</p>
			<h4>What personal information about users does Yipit collect?</h4>
			<p>Our primary goal in collecting personal information is to provide you with a friendly, customized, and efficient experience. We only collect personal information that is relevant to the purpose of our website. We do not process this information in a way that is incompatible with the purpose for which it has been collected or subsequently authorized by you. </p>
			<p>Yipit collects personally identifying information during the registration process, including name, email address, address, gender, store preferences etc. Yipit also may, on occasion collect user preference information (such as items clicked from emails), to be used for internal research purposes. We may also store information users knowingly provide such as feedback forms, suggestions, and emails to the Yipit website. Yipit may use such information for its internal purposes, including, but not limited to, email and web design optimizations, new features, and editorial and feedback purposes. Information entered may be aggregated across all users in order to determine and target demographics for marketing and advertising purposes.</p>
			<p>All user information stored by Yipit is considered confidential and will not be shared with outside parties. Yipit may share aggregated results of preferences for all users for marketing and advertising purposes.</p>
			<p>If you object to such use for any reason, you can either let us know by sending us feedback, or you can unsubscribe from the Yipit email service.</p>

			<h4>Is information about me secure?</h4>
			<p>Your Yipit account information is protected by a password for your privacy and security. You need to work to protect against unauthorized access to your password and to your computer by logging off once you have finished using a shared computer.</p>
