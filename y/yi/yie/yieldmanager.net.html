<p>This privacy policy describes how the Right Media corporate website (the “Right Media Site”) collects and uses information from users. This site provides users, primarily consumers, current and prospective customers, and job seekers, with information about our company, products, services, and the ability to contact us for further information.</p><p>On July 11, Right Media was acquired by Yahoo! and will soon become a part of the Yahoo! network of products and services. Until further notice, information collected by Right Media will continue to be subject to the Right Media Privacy Policy.&nbsp;</p><p>If you are a user and want to learn more about the privacy principles for our advertising technology ad.yieldmanager.com, <a href="http://content.yieldmanager.com/ym_privacy.html">click here</a>.</p><h3>What Information Does the Right Media Site Collect?</h3><p><strong>Personally Identifiable Information</strong></p><p>Personally identifiable information is information that identifies a user as a specific individual, such as a name, email address, mailing address and phone number. </p><p>The Right Media Site collects personally-identifiable information about users only if a user voluntarily provides that information to the site.&nbsp; Personally-identifiable information is collected on the Right Media Site in the following instances:</p><ul>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <li> <em>Contact Us! function.</em>&nbsp; A site visitor, possibly a consumer, prospective client or job seeker, submits a query to Right Media through the site’s “Contact Us!” function, and provides his or her name, address, email address and/or telephone number so that Right Media is able to respond.</li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <li> <em>Blog post.</em>&nbsp; A user posts a comment in the blog section of this site, and elects to submit his or her email address in connection with the posting.</li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <li> <em>Subscription feed.</em>&nbsp; A user subscribes to the site’s subscription function by providing his or her email address.&nbsp; (In this context, the email address is directly forwarded to a Right Media’s subscription vendor.)</li>&nbsp;&nbsp; <li> <em>Forward to a friend.</em>&nbsp; A user forwards an article published on this site to a colleague through the “Forward to a Friend” function, in which case the user submits his or her email address and the email address of the colleague.</li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <li> <em>Inquiry about adware or spyware removal.</em>&nbsp; A user has an inquiry regarding adware or spyware removal, and submits his or her name and contact information so that Right Media is able to respond.</li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <li> <em>Yield Manager client.</em>&nbsp; A current Right Media client accesses the client-only portions of the site by submitting his or her username and password.&nbsp; (In this context, the user is automatically redirected to the Yield Manager site, my.yieldmanager.com, and the login information is not stored by the Right Media Site.)</li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <li> <em>Inquiry about the Right Media Network. </em> A publisher submits a request to join the Right Media Network, and includes publisher information such as its contact name, address, email address and/or telephone number.&nbsp; (In this context, the user is automatically redirected to the Yield Manager site, my.yieldmanager.com, and the request is not stored by the Right Media Site.)</li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <li> <em>Request for feedback.</em>&nbsp; From time to time, the Right Media Site may ask visitors for voluntary feedback that will help us improve our site.&nbsp; In connection with such feedback, you may choose to provide optional name and contact information.</li></ul><h3>Non-Personally Identifiable Information</h3><p>Non-personally identifiable information includes demographic information (such as age, gender, city or state) and a user’s click stream information.&nbsp; The Right Media Site collects non-personally identifiable information in the following instances:</p><ul><li> <em>Log files.</em>&nbsp; The Right Media Site collects information about users and stores it in log files maintained on Right Media equipment. This information includes non-personally identifiable information that your browser automatically sends whenever you visit this site, including information about your web request, your IP address, your browser type, browser language, date and time of the request.</li><li> <em>Cookies.</em>&nbsp; A cookie is a small text file that the Right Media Site generates and stores on the user’s computer.&nbsp; A cookie is associated with a specific site domain, a specific computer and a specific Internet browser program.&nbsp; The Right Media Site sets a cookie on the user’s machine when a user visits this site in order to analyze the pages or sections of this site that a user visits.&nbsp; The cookie enables Right Media to evaluate the performance and usefulness of this site by users.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Right Media Site cookie information is not combined with information from the Yield Manager ad serving cookie.&nbsp; Neither is the Right Media Site cookie or log file information linked with any PII you may have provided at the Right Media Site.</li><li> <em>Clear pixels.</em>&nbsp; Clear pixels (also called web beacons and one-by-one pixels) are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, that are used to remember the pages or sections of a site that a user visits.&nbsp; The Right Media Site uses clear pixels in order to analyze the performance and usefulness of this site.</li>&nbsp;</ul><h3>How Does Right Media Use the Information Collected by the Right Media Site?</h3><p><strong>Personally Identifiable Information</strong></p><p>Right Media uses the personally-identifiable information you provide to respond to your inquiries and requests, and to keep accurate records concerning the services you are requesting through the Right Media Site.</p><h3><strong>Non-Personally Identifiable Information</strong></h3><p>Right Media generally uses non-personally identifiable information in aggregated form to help us measure the Right Media Site’s performance and effectiveness, and to improve its usefulness.</p><p>With Whom Does Right Media Share the Personally-Identifiable Information Collected on the Right Media Site?</p><p>Right Media does not share the personally-identifiable information that you provide to the Right Media Site with any third party except as outlined below:</p><ul><li> Subscription feed.&nbsp; The email address submitted by a user for a subscription is automatically forwarded to Right Media’s subscription vendor.</li><li> Adware or spyware removal inquiry.&nbsp; If a user submits his or her name and contact information in connection with an inquiry about adware or spyware removal, Right Media may, with the user’s express permission, forward the inquiry and contact information to a third party better able to address the inquiry.</li></ul>Other Sharing<p>Right Media may transfer the information it collects on the Yield Manager Site to any successor in interest to Right Media (such as a company that acquires Right Media), or internally to one or more affiliates (such as a corporate subsidiary or parent).&nbsp; Right Media may also disclose personally identifiable information about a user if it determines that an applicable law, regulation or legal process requires it, or if Right Media determines that it needs to share such information to protect or enforce Right Media's rights or the rights of another user.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>What Else Should I Know About Privacy?</h3><p><strong>Security</strong></p><p>Right Media maintains safeguards to protect the security, integrity and privacy of the PII within our control.&nbsp; No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however.&nbsp; Therefore, while we strive to protect your information, please be advised that Right Media assumes no responsibility or liability for disclosure of your information due to errors in transmission, unauthorized third-party access or other causes beyond Right Media’s control.</p><p><strong>Links to Other Websites</strong></p><p>Right Media does not control the data collection policies of any website linked to the Right Media Site.&nbsp; If you click on a link or an advertisement, the privacy policy of the website that you link to will govern the collection and use of your information by that website's operators.&nbsp; Right Media assumes no responsibility or liability for the actions of such third parties with respect to their use of your information or otherwise.</p><h3>Collection of Information from Minors</h3><p>The Right Media Site is directed to, and intended for use by, adults only.&nbsp; We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under the age of thirteen.&nbsp; If we become aware that we have inadvertently received personally identifiable information from a user under the age of thirteen, we will delete such information from our records.</p><h3>Report Adware and Spyware Problems</h3><p>Right Media does not control or condone the creation or supply of these ads on your computer.&nbsp; Occasionally a website or software publisher will bundle our ads with spyware or adware without Right Media's knowledge or consent. In these cases we're doing everything we can to track down who's doing it and put an end to it.</p><p>Pop-up ads originate from two sources: websites that show pop-up ads to generate advertising revenue; or programs installed on your computer can show pop-up ads. Such ad-enabled programs are very often bundled with freeware/shareware and peer-to-peer sharing programs that you may have downloaded.</p><p>If you would like help in removing the adware or spyware please contact us using the <a href="/company/contact/contact-form/">Contact Form</a>, <a href="/company/contact/">e-mail</a>  or <a href="/company/contact/">phone</a>.</p><p>Also, in order to prevent this from happening again to you or others, we also request that you send us the click-through URL so that we may find the party responsible for this problem.</p><h3>Acceptance of Privacy Policy</h3><p>When you use the Right Media Site, you are accepting the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy, and Right Media will have the right to use your information as described in this Privacy Policy.&nbsp; If you do not agree to have your information used in any of the ways described in this Privacy Policy, you must discontinue use of the Right Media Site.&nbsp; Right Media reserves the right to modify this Privacy Policy at any time, and we will post the date on which the Privacy Policy was last updated.&nbsp; Your continued use of the Right Media Site after a change in the Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of those changes.&nbsp; If you have questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy, please click here for customer support or write to Right Media at Right Media Inc., Attention:&nbsp; Privacy Policies, 212 Fifth Avenue, 8th Floor, New York, NY&nbsp; 10010.</p>
