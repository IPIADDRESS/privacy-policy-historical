</p><p class="parag"><strong>3. Cookies, Pixels and Log File<br></strong>
We use cookies on this website to provide you with a more personal and interactive experience with Yieldify. A cookie is a text file sent by a web server to a web browser, and stored by the browser (session cookies) or stored on hard disc (Persistent cookies). The text file is then sent back to the server each time the browser requests a page from the server. This enables the web server to identify and track the web browser and lets us learn about your behavior and usage patterns when you are on our Service. 
</p><p>
We may send a Persistent cookie which may be stored by your browser on your computer’s hard drive. We may use the information we obtain from the cookie in the administration of this website, to improve the website’s usability and for marketing purposes.  We may also use that information to recognise your computer when you visit our website, and to personalise our website for you. We may also use session cookies. These cookies do not operate once you logoff completely from the website whereas persistent cookies remain on your hard drive for an extended period afterwards. We do not store Personally Identifiable Information in our cookies nor do we link the information in our cookies to our users’ Personally Identifiable Information.
<br><br>Log file information is automatically reported by your browser each time you access a web page on our Service. Yieldify may gather information such as IP address, internal session ID, user's domain, browser type, referring / exit pages and URLs, number of clicks, domain names, landing pages, pages viewed, and other such information. An "Internet protocol address" or "IP Address" is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer when you use the Internet. In some cases your IP Address stays the same from browser session to browser session; but if you use a consumer internet access provider, your IP Address probably varies from session to session. Such information will not identify you personally: it is statistical data about our visitors and their use of our site. This statistical data does not identify any personal details whatsoever. It is used only to provide statistical information regarding the use of our website.
<br><br>All computers have the ability to decline cookies. This can be done by activating the setting on your browser which enables you to decline the cookies. In order to use our services offered through the website, your web browser must accept Cookies. Please note that should you choose to decline cookies, you may be unable to access particular features of our website, and you may not be able to receive our complete services.
<br><br>Web beacons or pixels or clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, which track your online Web movement and which may be embedded virtually invisibly on Web pages. We employ Pixels to better manage content on our Sites. Clear Gifs are used to track the online usage pattern of our users anonymously.  The information is used to enable more accurate reporting, improve the effectiveness of our Service. But, we do not link the information gathered by Pixels/ clear gifs to our users' Personally Identifiable Information.
