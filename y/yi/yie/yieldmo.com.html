				<h2>YieldMo Privacy Policy</h2>

				<p><b>Overview</b></p>


				<p><span>Your privacy is
				important to us. Accordingly, we have adopted the following privacy policy
				("<b>YieldMo</b>", or "<b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal">we</b>", "<b>us</b>", and "<b>YieldMo Website</b>") and to
				YieldMo's products and services, including the advertising network operated by
				YieldMo (the "<b>YieldMo
				Service</b>"). Please read this policy carefully, and feel free to contact us
				at privacy@YieldMo.com or at the mailing address set forth below if you have
				any questions regarding its content. </span></p>

				<p><span></span></p>

				<p><span>The YieldMo Website
				may link to third party websites or applications. YieldMo is not responsible
				for such third parties' privacy practices. Users should consult the privacy
				policies of such third party websites or applications to learn about such third
				parties' privacy practices. </span></p>

				<p><span></span></p>

				<p><b>Use of YieldMo Website</b></p>

				<p><span></span></p>

				<p><b>Log Data</b></p>

				<p><span>Our servers may
				automatically record non-personally identifiable information ("<b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal">Log Data</b>") from anyone who visits
				the YieldMo Website. This Log Data may include the visitor's IP address,
				browser type, operating system and language settings, referring domain, pages
				visited, visit duration and submitted search terms. This data is used to
				monitor usage, conduct administration and troubleshooting, and assist in
				improvements to the YieldMo Service. We may vary and tailor the content the
				visitor receives in future visits to the YieldMo Website based on such
				visitor's preferences and activities as determined based upon such Log Data.</span></p>

				<p><b></b></p>

				<p><b>Registration and Account Data </b></p>

				<p><span>If you register to
				use the YieldMo Website as an advertiser or publisher, we ask for and store
				information you provide such as your email, first name, last name, company
				name, username, address and phone number (collectively, "<b>Registration Data</b>"). After you register to use the YieldMo Website,
				you may set up advertising campaigns and other account parameters ("<b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal">Account Data</b>"). We collect and
				retain this information so that we can provide the YieldMo Service to you and
				perform internal analysis, account maintenance and billing, and so that we can
				offer personalized features, including varying the content you receive in
				future visits to the YieldMo Website based on your preferences and activities.
				When you update information, we usually keep a backup copy of the prior version
				for a reasonable period of time. </span></p>

				<p><span></span></p>

				<p><b>Combination of Log Data and Registration Data </b></p>

				<p><span>Log Data may be
				combined with a visitor's Registration Data and Account Data once the visitor
				has registered or subsequently logged into the YieldMo Website. The combined
				data is used to provide, monitor and assist in improvements to the YieldMo Service,
				and to customize content and advertising displayed to the user on the YieldMo
				Website. </span></p>

				<p><span></span></p>

				<p><span>Log Data, Account
				Data, Registration Data, and combined data is not sold or rented to third
				parties. In addition, such information is not shared with third parties except
				in the case of third party service providers, legal processes and aggregate
				information, as noted below. </span></p>

				<p><span></span></p>

				<p><b>Cookies </b></p>

				<p><span>Use of certain
				features on the YieldMo Website requires that the visitor accept the use of
				cookies, which are small data files that the website sends to the visitor's
				browser for storage on such visitor's computer's hard drive. We use cookies to
				track activity at the YieldMo Website and better serve visitors' needs,
				preferences and interests as noted above. </span></p>

				<p><span></span></p>

				<p><b>End Users of the YieldMo Advertising Network</b></p>

				<p><b></b></p>

				<p><span>YieldMo partners with
				numerous companies to provide online advertisements to end users of websites,
				mobile websites and applications ("<b>End
				Users</b>"). </span></p>

				<p><span></span></p>

				<p><span>As an End User browses
				the Internet, he or she may visit Web pages that include references to the YieldMo
				Service. When this happens, an End User's browser or device may request
				advertisements from YieldMo's system. When YieldMo receives these requests, we
				may collect non-personally identifiable information about this interaction (as
				well as any further interaction with the advertisements provided by the YieldMo
				Service such as views, clicks, mouse movements, etc.) including the End User's
				IP address and time of request, information about the general geographical
				location from which an End User is viewing an advertisement, device type, and
				other information made available by the browser or device, such as operating
				system and language setting. Such non-personally identifiable information is
				stored on YieldMo's servers.<b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal"> </b>The
				information collected may be used to provide reports to advertisers and
				publishers who participate in YieldMo's advertising network, to schedule,
				deliver and optimize advertisements, to limit the number of times a specific
				advertisement is presented to the same browser or device (frequency capping), to
				detect and eliminate fraudulent activity and to administer the YieldMo Service.
				YieldMo does not sell or rent information it collects about End Users. </span></p>

				<p><span></span></p>

				<p><b>Advertisers and Publishers</b></p>

				<p><span>We may collect and
				use non-personally identifiable and personally identifiable information from
				advertisers and publishers who participate in YieldMo's advertising network, as
				specified under "Use of YieldMo Website" above, to provide customer support to
				the applicable advertiser or publisher, and to send to such party
				account-related information, including invoices, payments, technical notices,
				updates, security alerts, and support, administrative and promotional messages.
				</span></p>

				<p><span></span></p>

				<p><b>Legal Compliance </b></p>

				<p><span>We may disclose
				information to fulfill legal or regulatory requirements or if we believe, in
				good faith, that such disclosure is legally required or necessary to protect
				others' rights or to prevent harm. </span></p>

				<p><b></b></p>

				<p><b>Third Party Service Providers </b></p>

				<p><span>We retain certain
				third party service providers to perform functions and services for us. We may
				share information with these third party service providers, but only to the
				extent necessary to perform these functions and services, and only pursuant to
				obligations that are no less restrictive than those contained in this privacy policy.
				</span></p>

				<p><span></span></p>

				<p><b>Aggregate Information</b></p>

				aggregate and anonymous usage statistics regarding the YieldMo Service with the
				public or businesses with whom we work.</span></p>

				<p><span></span></p>

				<p><b>Security </b></p>

				<p><span>YieldMo uses
				reasonable administrative, technical, personnel and physical measures to
				safeguard personally identifying information in its possession against loss,
				theft and unauthorized use, disclosure or modification. Regardless of the
				precautions taken by you or by us, "perfect security" does not exist
				on the Internet. We cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information
				you transmit to us, and you transmit such information at your own risk. </span></p>

				<p><span></span></p>

				<p><b>Minimum Age </b></p>

				<p><span>The YieldMo Service
				and the YieldMo Website are not developed for, or directed at, children under
				the age of 13. We do not knowingly accept registrations or information from
				users that are under 13. We will delete accounts of any users that we find to
				be under-age. If you are aware that any child under the age of 13 has become a
				registered user or provided personally identifiable information to YieldMo,
				please inform us at privacy@YieldMo.com, so that we can confirm and take the
				appropriate steps to remove the account and any related information. </span></p>

				<p><b></b></p>

				<p><b>Communication </b></p>

				<p><span>YieldMo may send to
				registered users, advertisers and publishers service and/or account
				activity-related announcements from time to time. </span></p>
