	<h2>YAPPR PRIVACY POLICY</h2>

	
<div class="privacy-policy">
<p>
This Privacy Policy governs yappr.com's ("we",
"us" or "yappr") treatment of personally
identifiable information that yappr collects when you use the
yappr.com website (the "Site"), when you share information
about yourself on our Site as well as when you provide information to
us in any medium. This Privacy Policy is incorporated into and
subject to yappr's Terms of Use, which can be found at
<a href="/pages/terms_of_use">http://yappr.com/pages/terms_of_use</a>.
Each time that you use the Site and the services available to you on
the Site ("Services"), you signify that you agree to be
bound by the Terms of Use and this Privacy Policy. If you do not
agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy, you must discontinue using
the Site and terminate your registration with us. The Site is owned
by Real Time English, LLC d/b/a yappr.com. All references to yappr or
yappr.com will be deemed to include Real Time English, LLC. 
</p>
<p>
<b>ABOUT YAPPR</b></p>
<p>
yappr.com provides an online service to practice and
evaluate your English through activities such as watching videos,
playing games and by setting up unique personal profiles and, through
those profiles, to create an online network of other people on the
Site. Visitors to the Site can view your profile, and see your
activities and what you have posted on the Site. You can watch
videos, join in a chat and practice writing English while having fun
and making new friends. By registering you can communicate with other
registered users of the Site. You can post comments and messages,
chat, and send yappr messages to other registered users. We request
and display what you post on the Site to visitors, which allows our
users to identify each other and expand their network of friends on
the Site. You can change your profile information at any time and can
control how others communicate with you. 
</p>
<p>
<b>INFORMATION WE COLLECT </b>
</p>
<p>
User Provided Information. yappr collects personal
information from you when you register on the Site, update your
profile, interact with other users, and use various features of the
Site. To register with yappr, you must provide a user name, password,
native language, birth year, and email address. When you register you
may also provide your country (which will be represented by a country
flag in your profile), city, gender and how you heard about the Site.
Once you are a registered user of yappr you will be given the option
to add additional personal information about you to your profile. By
enabling the invisible mode you can limit what information will be
viewed by others. In invisible mode you will be able to send messages
to other users, chat with other users, and view and post comments and
messages, but other users will only be able to view your user name
and country flag. They will not be able to view other information in
your profile. However, while in invisible mode you cannot invite
other users to join your circle of friends, and they cannot invite
you to join theirs. Be aware that whether you are in invisible mode
or not, if you choose to make public posts, submit a comment, or
chat, then any personal information you actively include in such
submissions, and certain basic profile data that cannot be hidden,
such as your username and your country flag, will still be accessible
to all registered users and any visitors to the Site. By posting a
profile or disclosing personal information in our online forums,
directly to users in chat rooms or through messages, or otherwise,
your information is made public and you should not expect any privacy
in such an environment. We may also collect information regarding
your interaction with other users and your use of the Site, including
content you view linked from the Site and yappr points that you have
earned, which will also be displayed on the Site. From time to time
we may ask you to respond to surveys or other requests for
information, and we collect the information you provide. We may
collect information from you when you participate in sweepstakes and
promotions offered on the Site. We may also collect information about
you through other methods, including research surveys or information
we obtain from third parties, including verification services, data
services, as well as public sources. We use this information to
continually offer you the most value as a user of the Site. 
</p>
<p>
Tracking Technology.yappr logs IP addresses (a unique
number assigned to every computer on the Internet) in order to
improve security, analyze trends and administer the Site. We may
track your movement within the Site, the third-party website pages
from which you were referred, your use of the media player, access
times and browser types. We use this information to gauge the
effectiveness of our Site, track information for statistical purposes
and to improve the products and services we provide. We store
information that we collect through cookies, log files and other
tracking technology such as clear gifs. We use cookies on the Site. A
cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user's computer for
record-keeping purposes. We use session ID cookies and persistent
cookies. We use session cookies to make it easier for you to navigate
our Site. A session ID cookie expires when you close your browser. A
persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period
of time. You can remove persistent cookies by following directions
provided in your Internet browser's "help" file. Persistent
cookies are used to differentiate visitors of the Site from
registered users, to customize the content of certain sections of the
Site and to enable us to track and cater to the interests of users,
in order to enhance their experience on the Site. If you reject
cookies, you may still use the Site, but your ability to use some
areas of the Site may be limited and you may not be able to use
certain features of the Site. 
</p>
<p>
Supplemental Information. We may supplement the
information you provide us by acquiring commercially available
demographic and marketing information from third parties, for
instance, to update your information and to create a profile of your
preferences. We may tie your personally identifiable information to
information in the profile, in order to improve the content of the
Site for you or to inform you about products or services that we
think will be of interest to you. 
</p>
<p>
Third Party Links. This privacy statement applies only
to information collected by us on the Site and collected when you
subscribe to or use the yappr Service or purchase products from us.
We encourage you to be aware when you leave the Site and to read the
privacy statements of other websites you visit that collect
personally identifiable information. 
</p>
<p>
Advertisements. We may from time to time use various
outside ad-serving companies and affiliates to serve advertisements
on the Site. In the process of serving advertisements, the ad serving
companies may place a cookie in your browser's cookie file and may
use information about your visits to the Site and other websites in
order to provide advertisements on the Site about products and
services that may be of interest to you. By delivering ads on the
Site, the ad-server is able to record what ads a user -- identified
by the unique cookie -- has seen, and what pages the user was viewing
when the ads were delivered. This web usage information is combined
with other ad delivery information the ad-server has collected from
your visits to the Site and other websites not affiliated with yappr.
This non-personally identifiable information is used as part of the
ad-serving process for reporting and to select and direct the ads you
see online at the Site and other websites not affiliated with yappr. 
</p>
<p>
Surveys or Promotions. From time to time we may provide
you the opportunity to participate in sweepstakes, contests or other
promotions promoted on the Site, which might be sponsored or
conducted by yappr or by a third party. If you participate, we will
request certain personally identifiable information from you.
Participation in these promotions is completely voluntary and you
will have a choice whether or not to disclose this information. The
requested information typically includes contact information. If
there is a third party sponsor involved please make sure to review
that third party's privacy policy. 
</p>
<p>
<b>USE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION </b>
</p>
<p>
When you Register. When you register with yappr, you can
create your own profile. If your profile is visible, your profile
information, as well as your screen name, activities, and picture are
displayed to other registered users as well as visitors to the Site.
Your real name is never displayed on the Site (unless you use it as
your screen name). You can choose to allow others to search for you
by using your profile name or most other information you have entered
in your profile if you choose to make your profile visible. 
</p>
<p>
Please be aware that certain personal profile
information is displayed for all users and cannot be hidden.
Specifically, even if your profile is invisible, your screen name and
country flag entered on your profile are always displayed on the Site
and therefore, are viewable by all users if you post a comment or
participate in chat or message boards. In addition, because this
information is publicly displayed on the Site, it may appear in the
results of searches conducted on Internet search engines while you
are a registered user of the Site and potentially for some time
period after your account is terminated, depending upon the search
engine's indexing practices. 
</p>
<p>
User Content Posted Online. As a registered user, you
can share personal content, such as videos, journals and photos.
Please be aware that by using any of these features, your personally
identifiable information may be accessible to other users and
visitors to the Site, and yappr has no control over how those users
may use your personally identifiable information. We have the right,
but not the obligation, to monitor any activity and content
associated with the public and private forums and interactive areas
on our Site. Please review our Terms of Use for more information
regarding your appropriate use of these areas. 
</p>
<p>
Our Use. We receive and store any personal information
you enter on the Site or give to us voluntarily in any other way and
may use it to contact you from time to time. Specifically, by
registering on the Site, you agree that this action constitutes a
purchase, inquiry and/or application for purposes of telemarketing
laws. Regardless of the fact that your telephone and/or cell number
may be listed with the Federal Do-Not-Call Registry, or your local
State Do-Not-Call list, you expressly consent to receive future
information about products and services from us, and in, that regard,
you hereby consent to our contacting you pursuant to the business
relationship established using the information you provided to us.
This means we may contact you by email, phone and/or cell number
(including use of automated dialing equipment), text (SMS) message,
or any other means of communication that your wireless or other
telecommunications device may be capable of receiving (e.g. video
etc.). We may also send you information or offers from time to time
to a postal address or email address we have on file. If you provide
your name for a promotional offer to enter a sweepstakes or contest,
and win a prize, we will post a winner's list online, and will file
your name with state agencies if required by law. 
</p>
<p>
Vendors. We employ other companies and individuals to
perform functions on our behalf. Examples might include sending
email, removing repetitive information from customer lists, analyzing
data, providing marketing assistance, providing search results and
links and providing customer service. They have access to your
personal information needed to perform their functions, but may not
use it for other purposes. 
</p>
<p>
Third Party Offers. We may share personally identifiable
information with third parties in order to have them send you special
offers and promotions or other information we think you might find of
interest. We ourselves will also occasionally send you information on
products, services, special deals, promotions, or information which
we have found that may be of interest to our users and subscribers.
If you do not want us to use the information you provide in order to
inform you of products and services we think might interest you, or
provide your information to third party companies, it is your
obligation to please let us know, by contacting us at
<a href="mailto:customerservice@yappr.com">customerservice@yappr.com</a>.

</p>
<p>
Invite a Friend. If you do become a registered user, you
can also share links to videos on the Site with other individuals by
providing us with their email addresses. Using the information you
give us on these potential users, we will send them an email message
including a link to the Site, and we may include an invitation to
join yappr. The only way these individuals can become registered
users, however, is if they come to our Site and register themselves.
We do not use this information for other purposes
