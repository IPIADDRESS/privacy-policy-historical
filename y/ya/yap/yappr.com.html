		<h1>YAPPR PRIVACY POLICY</h1>

<p>
This Privacy Policy governs yappr.com's ("we", "us" or "yappr") treatment of
personally identifiable information that yappr collects when you use the
yappr.com website (the "Site"), when you share information about yourself on
our Site as well as when you provide information to us in any medium. This
Privacy Policy is incorporated into and subject to yappr's Terms of Use, which
can be found at
<a href="/help/TermsOfUse.action">http://en.yappr.com/help/TermsOfUse.action</a>. 
Each time that you use the Site
and the services available to you on the Site ("Services"), you signify that
you agree to be bound by the Terms of Use and this Privacy Policy. If you do
not agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy, you must discontinue using the
Site and terminate your registration with us. The Site is owned by Real Time
English, LLC d/b/a yappr.com. All references to yappr or yappr.com will be
deemed to include Real Time English, LLC.
</p>

<h2>ABOUT YAPPR</h2>

<p>
yappr.com provides an online service to practice and evaluate your English
through activities such as watching videos, playing games and by setting up
unique personal profiles and, through those profiles, to create an online
network of other people on the Site. Visitors to the Site can view your
profile, and see your activities and what you have posted on the Site. You can
watch videos, join in a chat and practice writing English while having fun and
making new friends. By registering you can communicate with other registered
users of the Site. You can post comments and messages, chat, and send yappr
messages to other registered users. We request and display what you post on
the Site to visitors, which allows our users to identify each other and expand
their network of friends on the Site. You can change your profile information
at any time and can control how others communicate with you.
</p>

<h2>
INFORMATION WE COLLECT
</h2>

<p>
User Provided Information. yappr collects personal information from you when
you register on the Site, update your profile, interact with other users, and
use various features of the Site. To register with yappr, you must provide a
user name, password, native language, birth year, and email address. When you
register you may also provide your country (which will be represented by a
country flag in your profile), city, gender and how you heard about the Site.
Once you are a registered user of yappr you will be given the option to add
additional personal information about you to your profile. By enabling the
invisible mode you can limit what information will be viewed by others. In
invisible mode you will be able to send messages to other users, chat with
other users, and view and post comments and messages, but other users will
only be able to view your user name and country flag. They will not be able to
view other information in your profile. However, while in invisible mode you
cannot invite other users to join your circle of friends, and they cannot
invite you to join theirs. You can enable or disable the invisible mode at any
time. To do this, just click on the "My Yappr" link listed throughout the Site
and then click on "My Account" to select or unselect the preference for
"invisible mode". However, enabling invisible mode will not affect information
that had been previously posted. Any previously posted information may still
be visible to other users. Also, disabling invisible mode will make
information about your previous activity on the Site, even while you were in
invisible mode, available to other users. Be aware that whether you are in
invisible mode or not, if you choose to make public posts, submit a comment,
or chat, then any personal information you actively include in such
submissions, and certain basic profile data that cannot be hidden, such as
your username and your country flag, will still be accessible to all
registered users and any visitors to the Site. By posting a profile or
disclosing personal information in our online forums, directly to users in
chat rooms or through messages, or otherwise, your information is made public
and you should not expect any privacy in such an environment. We may also
collect information regarding your interaction with other users and your use
of the Site, including content you view linked from the Site and yappr points
that you have earned, which will also be displayed on the Site. From time to
time we may ask you to respond to surveys or other requests for information,
and we collect the information you provide. We may collect information from
you when you participate in sweepstakes and promotions offered on the Site. We
may also collect information about you through other methods, including
research surveys or information we obtain from third parties, including
verification services, data services, as well as public sources. We use this
information to continually offer you the most value as a user of the Site.
</p>

<p>
Tracking Technology. yappr logs IP addresses (a unique number assigned to
every computer on the Internet) in order to improve security, analyze trends
and administer the Site. We may track your movement within the Site, the
third-party website pages from which you were referred, your use of the media
player, access times and browser types. We use this information to gauge the
effectiveness of our Site, track information for statistical purposes and to
improve the products and services we provide. We store information that we
collect through cookies, log files and other tracking technology such as clear
gifs. We use cookies on the Site. A cookie is a small text file that is stored
on a user's computer for record-keeping purposes. We use session ID cookies
and persistent cookies. We use session cookies to make it easier for you to
navigate our Site. A session ID cookie expires when you close your browser. A
persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period of time.
You can remove persistent cookies by following directions provided in your
Internet browser's "help" file. Persistent cookies are used to differentiate
visitors of the Site from registered users, to customize the content of
certain sections of the Site and to enable us to track and cater to the
interests of users, in order to enhance their experience on the Site. If you
reject cookies, you may still use the Site, but your ability to use some areas
of the Site may be limited and you may not be able to use certain features of
the Site.
</p>

<p>
Supplemental Information. We may supplement the information you provide us by
acquiring commercially available demographic and marketing information from
third parties, for instance, to update your information and to create a
profile of your preferences. We may tie your personally identifiable
information to information in the profile, in order to improve the content of
the Site for you or to inform you about products or services that we think
will be of interest to you.
</p>

<p>
Third Party Links. This privacy statement applies only to information
collected by us on the Site and collected when you subscribe to or use the
yappr Service or purchase products from us. We encourage you to be aware when
you leave the Site and to read the privacy statements of other websites you
visit that collect personally identifiable information.
</p>

<p>
Advertisements. We may from time to time use various outside ad-serving
companies and affiliates to serve advertisements on the Site. In the process
of serving advertisements, the ad serving companies may place a cookie in your
browser's cookie file and may use information about your visits to the Site
and other websites in order to provide advertisements on the Site about
products and services that may be of interest to you. By delivering ads on the
Site, the ad-server is able to record what ads a user -- identified by the
unique cookie -- has seen, and what pages the user was viewing when the ads
were delivered. This web usage information is combined with other ad delivery
information the ad-server has collected from your visits to the Site and other
websites not affiliated with yappr. This non-personally identifiable
information is used as part of the ad-serving process for reporting and to
select and direct the ads you see online at the Site and other websites not
affiliated with yappr.
</p>

<p>
Surveys or Promotions. From time to time we may provide you the opportunity to
participate in sweepstakes, contests or other promotions promoted on the Site,
which might be sponsored or conducted by yappr or by a third party. If you
participate, we will request certain personally identifiable information from
you. Participation in these promotions is completely voluntary and you will
have a choice whether or not to disclose this information. The requested
information typically includes contact information. If there is a third party
sponsor involved please make sure to review that third party's privacy policy.
</p>

<h2>
USE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION
</h2>

<p>
When you Register. When you register with yappr, you can create your own
profile. If your profile is visible, your profile information, as well as your
screen name, activities, and picture are displayed to other registered users
as well as visitors to the Site. Your real name is never displayed on the Site
(unless you use it as your screen name). You can choose to allow others to
search for you by using your profile name or most other information you have
entered in your profile if you choose to make your profile visible.
</p>

<p>
Please be aware that certain personal profile information is displayed for all
users and cannot be hidden. Specifically, even if your profile is invisible,
your screen name and country flag entered on your profile are always displayed
on the Site and therefore, are viewable by all users if you post a comment or
participate in chat or message boards. In addition, because this information
is publicly displayed on the Site, it may appear in the results of searches
conducted on Internet search engines while you are a registered user of the
Site and potentially for some time period after your account is terminated,
depending upon the search engine's indexing practices.
</p>

<p>
User Content Posted Online. As a registered user, you can share personal
content, such as videos, journals and photos. Please be aware that by using
any of these features, your personally identifiable information may be
accessible to other users and visitors to the Site, and yappr has no control
over how those users may use your personally identifiable information. We have
the right, but not the obligation, to monitor any activity and content
associated with the public and private forums and interactive areas on our
Site. Please review our Terms of Use for more information regarding your
appropriate use of these areas.
</p>

<p>
Our Use. We receive and store any personal information you enter on the Site
or give to us voluntarily in any other way and may use it to contact you from
time to time. Specifically, by registering on the Site, you agree that this
action constitutes a purchase, inquiry and/or application for purposes of
telemarketing laws. Regardless of the fact that your telephone and/or cell
number may be listed with the Federal Do-Not-Call Registry, or your local
State Do-Not-Call list, you expressly consent to receive future information
about products and services from us, and in, that regard, you hereby consent
to our contacting you pursuant to the business relationship established using
the information you provided to us. This means we may contact you by email,
phone and/or cell number (including use of automated dialing equipment), text
(SMS) message, or any other means of communication that your wireless or other
telecommunications device may be capable of receiving (e.g. video etc.). We
may also send you information or offers from time to time to a postal address
or email address we have on file. If you provide your name for a promotional
offer to enter a sweepstakes or contest, and win a prize, we will post a
winner's list online, and will file your name with state agencies if required
by law.
</p>

<p>
Vendors. We employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on our
behalf. Examples might include sending email, removing repetitive information
from customer lists, analyzing data, providing marketing assistance, providing
search results and links and providing customer service. They have access to
your personal information needed to perform their functions, but may not use
it for other purposes.
</p>

<p>
Third Party Offers. We may share personally identifiable information with
third parties in order to have them send you special offers and promotions or
other information we think you might find of interest. We ourselves will also
occasionally send you information on products, services, special deals,
promotions, or information which we have found that may be of interest to our
users and subscribers. If you do not want us to use the information you
provide in order to inform you of products and services we think might
interest you, or provide your information to third party companies, it is your
obligation to please let us know, by contacting us at
<a href="mailto:customerservice@yappr.com">customerservice@yappr.com</a>.
</p>

<p>
Invite a Friend. If you do become a registered user, you can also share links
to videos on the Site with other individuals by providing us with their email
addresses. Using the information you give us on these potential users, we will
send them an email message including a link to the Site, and we may include an
invitation to join yappr. The only way these individuals can become registered
users, however, is if they come to our Site and register themselves. We do not
use this information for other purposes
</p>

<p>
Other Uses. We may use your personal information to contact you about yappr's
products or services, or for other purposes in which you have expressed an
interest, for example, if you have contacted customer service or made an
inquiry.
</p>

<p>
Service Related Announcements. We will provide you with service and account
related announcements on occasions when it is necessary to do so. For
instance, if our service is temporarily suspended for maintenance, or the
delivery of a service or product is delayed we might send you an email, or
other message, or if there is some service issue with something you might have
ordered. Generally, you may not opt-out of these communications, which are not
promotional in nature. If you do not wish to receive them, you have the option
to cancel your registration on our Site by sending an email to us at
<a href="mailto:customerservice@yappr.com">customerservice@yappr.com</a>.
</p>

<p>

assets of the company. Information about our users, including personal
information, may also need to be disclosed in connection with a commercial
transaction where Real Time English, LLC, or an affiliate, seeks financing,
investment, support or funding. We also may have to release personally
identifying information when it is necessary to comply with judicial or other
government subpoenas, warrants, orders, or to protect the rights, property, or
safety of yappr, its users or others.
