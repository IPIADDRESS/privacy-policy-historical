		<p class="help_text"><b>About Yardbarker</b></p>
		<p class="help_text">Yardbarker is a social media network for sports fans. The site lets people discover relevant sports content submitted by other community members. To accomplish this, our users create their own profiles, which display some personal information to other members and visitors. This allows our users to identify each other and expand their personal network of contacts. Yardbarker members can change their profile information at any time and can control how other members and the service communicates with them.</p>
		<p class="help_text">Yardbarker cares deeply about online privacy. If you have any questions concerning this privacy policy, please email us at info@yardbarker.com.</p>

Email addresses are used for the purposes of inviting new friends to join Yardbarker, to add users to members' contacts networks, and to send notifications related to the service. With the exception of inviting friends, adding friends, and notifications, a user's email address is not shared or displayed to people within a user's personal network.

Recipients of invitations from Yardbarker may contact Yardbarker to request the removal of their information from our database. </p>
		<p class="help_text">You may prevent Yardbarker email invitations and other messages from being sent to any email address you control by sending a single email with the subject "BLOCK INVITE" to info@yardbarker.com. Please note that the email must come from the account you wish to block. </p>
