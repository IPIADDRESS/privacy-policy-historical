Heffler Claims Group is subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the FTC.</li>
    <li><b>Providing our services.</b> We engage contractors, service providers, and other third parties to support our business. These vendors are strictly for address verification, notification and funds distribution to the affected parties in claims administration settlements. Service providers are bound by contractual obligations to keep personal information confidential and use it only for the purposes for which we disclose it to them. Service providers may include marketing services to help us publicize and advertise our services or a particular claim administration.  We may share your personal information with said providers and support agencies in the course of facilitating our services to you.  Heffler Claims Group has the responsibility for the processing of personal information it receives under the Privacy Shield and subsequently transfers to a third party acting as an agent on its behalf. Heffler Claims Group shall remain liable under the Principles if its agent processes such personal information in a manner inconsistent with the Principles, unless the organization proves that it is not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Individuals located in the European Economic Area (EEA) and Switzerland</h3>

    <li><b>Request correction of the personal information that we hold about you.</b> This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate information we hold about you corrected.</li>
    <li><b>Request erasure of your personal information.</b> This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal data where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it.</li>
    <li><b>Object to processing of your personal data</b>, for example, if your personal information is being processed on the basis of legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your situation which makes you want to object to processing on this basis.</li>
    <li><b>Request the restriction of processing of your personal data.</b> This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of personal data about you, for example if you want us to establish its accuracy or the reason for processing it.</li>
    <li><b>Request the transfer of your personal data to another party</b> (right to data portability).</li>
</ol>
