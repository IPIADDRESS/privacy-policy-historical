<p align="left" style="text-align:justify"><font size="2" face="Arial">INFORMATION COLLECTED BY YAMAHA</font></p>

<p align="left" style="text-align:justify"><font size="2" face="Arial">Personally identifiable information about visitors to this Site (that is, information such

may be collected in connection with your visit to this Site if you request information, products or services; register for individual accounts, subscriptions or 
warranties; submit contact, request and suggestion information; or register for any sweepstakes, contests, games, or surveys.  We may also obtain 
information about you from our affiliates and business partners, based on information that has already been shared with or made available to them.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p align="left" style="text-align:justify"><font size="2" face="Arial">Information that you provide in public forums, such as user groups or chat rooms, 
and information that you submit to us as recommendations, requests for information and feedback are not considered or treated as personally identifiable 
or confidential information</font></p>

<p align="left" style="text-align:justify"><font size="2" face="Arial">WHAT IS DONE WITH PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION COLLECTED 
BY YAMAHA</font></p>

<p align="left" style="text-align:justify"><font size="2" face="Arial">We use the information you provide to deliver quality products and services to you.  For 
example, if you have ordered an item or requested a newsletter or updates about our services or products, we will use the information you provide to respond 
to that request or to provide other information about Yamaha and its services.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p align="left" style="text-align:justify"><font size="2" face="Arial">We may also disclose personally identifiable information if we are required to do so by law, 
or if in our good faith judgement, this disclosure is reasonably necessary to comply with legal process, to detect or prevent illegal, harmful or fraudulent use of 
this Site or linked sites, to respond to any claims or to protect the rights of Yamaha, its customers and the public. We may also share your information with 
our partner agencies and service providers who assist us in administering various site services and programs.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p align="left" style="text-align:justify"><font size="2" face="Arial">Sharing Personally Identifiable Information:  Yamaha may share personally identifiable 
information with other Yamaha companies or with some of our business partners who wish to send information about their products or services.  However, 
you have the opportunity to instruct us not to share personally identifiable information by following the procedures outlined below.   You may request that we 
withhold personally identifiable information from our service providers who work with us in processing your service or product requests, however this will result 
in the cancellation of your order or request.</font></p>

<p align="left" style="text-align:justify"><font size="2" face="Arial">POLICY CONCERNING LINKS AND CO-BRANDED SITES</font></p>

<p align="left" style="text-align:justify"><font size="2" face="Arial">This Yamaha web site may allow you to link directly to sites operated by our service 
providers or marketing partners.  Some of these sites may be “co-branded” with a Yamaha logo; even so, they are not operated or maintained by Yamaha.  
These sites may ask you for personally identifiable information.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p align="left" style="text-align:justify"><font size="2" face="Arial">Because these web sites are operated by business partners or third parties, you should 
remember that Yamaha is not responsible for the content or practices of such Web sites.  These links are provided for your convenience only and should be 
used with your discretion and prudent judgement.  Links from our Site to third party sites do not constitute sponsorship, endorsement, or approval by Yamaha 
of the content, policies, practices of such third party sites.  Yamaha is not responsible for any information these sites may obtain and does not oversee their 
policies or practices in collecting personally identifiable information.</font></p>

<p align="left" style="text-align:justify"><b><font size="2" face="Arial">The Privacy Policies of these other sites may differ from those of Yamaha.  Therefore, 
once you have left this Site via such a link, you must review each site’s privacy policies separately. You should make your own determination of the 
acceptability of each linked site.</font></b></p>

<p align="left" style="text-align:justify"><font size="2" face="Arial">This Site may also be linked to Web sites operated by companies affiliated with Yamaha. 
You are advised to refer to the privacy policies and practices of these sites before providing any personally identifiable information.</font></p>

<p align="left" style="text-align:justify"><font size="2" face="Arial">NON-PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION</font></p>

<p align="left" style="text-align:justify"><font size="2" face="Arial">When visitors come to this Site, Yamaha collects non-personally identifiable information 
or “aggregate” information concerning how its visitors use this Site, including the pages viewed and links used.  Collecting such information involves the logging 
of IP addresses, the visitor’s operating system, types of browser software and internet service providers used by each visitor to this or linked sites.  Although 
such information generally is not personally identifiable, it can be used to determine the IP address of the visitor’s Internet Service Provider and the geographic 
location of her/his point of connectivity to the internet.  This information allows us to analyze and improve the effectiveness of our services and those of our 
affiliates and service providers.</font></p>

<p align="left" style="text-align:justify"><font size="2" face="Arial">USE OF “COOKIES” AND TRACKING TECHNOLOGY</font></p>

<p align="left" style="text-align:justify"><font size="2" face="Arial">This Site and its service providers use current industry methods, including “cookies” and 
tracking technology (“clear gifs”, “web beacons”, “log files”, etc.), to enable Yamaha to make visits to this Site  and communications with our visitors more 
personalized and effective, and to analyze the services we provide through this Site. For example, “cookies” are tags sent to reside on the visitor’s computer, 
to enhance a visitor’s experience at our site, to allow repeat visitors to be served more quickly and efficiently, or to tell us where our visitors go and how our 
visitors use our Site and related sites.  Yamaha does not use cookies to obtain personally identifiable information about a user that was not previously provided.</font></p>

<p align="left" style="text-align:justify"><font size="2" face="Arial">Visitors may receive cookies from other third party sites that they visit, including service 
provider sites. Yamaha cannot control the content or use of these cookies or tracking technologies by third party sites or service providers.  Visitors should 
consult their browser’s manual for instructions on how to refuse or disable cookies. Refusing or disabling cookies may affect our ability to complete requests 
you have made for products or services from this Site. Yamaha may disclose non-personally identifiable information to affiliates or advertisers regarding content 
viewing, traffic levels or browser paths to their advertisements on this Site.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p align="left" style="text-align:justify"><font size="2" face="Arial">THE SECURITY OF YOUR INFORMATION</font></p>

<p align="left" style="text-align:justify"><font size="2" face="Arial">Yamaha uses current technologies to safeguard the confidentiality of your personally 
identifiable information.  We follow industry-standard methodologies, including the utilization of SSL (Secure Socket Layers) where appropriate, to protect 
against the loss, misuse and alteration of the data provided.  However, data transmission or storage on the internet can not be guaranteed to be 100% secure 
and Yamaha does not make such a guarantee.  You should take all precautions to safeguard your passwords and any account information that you may have 
or provide and to employ current virus-scanning or firewall software and other security safeguards.  You should also log out of your account and close your 
browser window when you are done.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p align="left" style="text-align:justify"><font size="2" face="Arial">&nbsp;<br>
YOUR CHOICES REGARDING PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION</font></p>

<p align="left" style="text-align:justify"><font size="2" face="Arial">If you would like to correct or modify personally identifiable information you have previously 
provided, such as your email address, phone number or other contact information, please contact us at
<a href="mailto:privacypolicy@yamaha.com">privacypolicy@yamaha.com</a>, or the address above.  If you would like to request that your personally 
identifiable information not be shared with third parties,  please notify us at
<a href="mailto:privacypolicy@yamaha.com">privacypolicy@yamaha.com</a>, or the address above.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p align="left" style="text-align:justify"><font size="2" face="Arial">If you would like to delete or remove from our system the personally identifiable information 
which you have previously provided, please contact us at
<a href="mailto:privacypolicy@yamaha.com">privacypolicy@yamaha.com</a>.  We will delete your personally identifiable information from our database if we 
reasonably can.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p align="left" style="text-align:justify"><font size="2" face="Arial">However, there may be residual information that will remain within our databases and logs 
that may or may not contain personally identifiable information or that is very difficult to locate and remove.  There may be information that has been transmitted 
already to third parties which is beyond our control.  Your request for deletion of this information may prevent or reduce our ability to service your earlier request 
to this Site or to access this web site in the future.  We will  follow the policy outlined here, but we are not responsible for any failure or shortcoming in deleting 
or controlling the disclosure of information you have made available through use of this Site or for the timing of our actions after your request.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p align="left" style="text-align:justify"><font size="2" face="Arial">For each of your requests, you should receive an email response from Yamaha, confirming 
receipt of the request.  If you do not receive such a response, you must assume that your request has not been received by our servers or processed. Your 
request should be repeated until receipt confirmation is received or, as an alternative, your request should be sent by regular mail to the address indicated above.</font></p>

<p align="left" style="text-align:justify"><font size="2" face="Arial">When you request modification to your data, you must provide us with all relevant existing 
data (name, address, email address, etc), along with the specific modifications,  necessary to identify you and make the changes you request.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p align="left" style="text-align:justify"><font size="2" face="Arial">INCORPORATION INTO TERMS OF SERVICE</font></p>

<p align="left" style="text-align:justify"><font size="2" face="Arial">If other terms and conditions apply to our relationship, based on your purchase of goods 
or services from Yamahagear.com or for other transactions, this Privacy Policy is incorporated into these terms by reference.</font></p>
