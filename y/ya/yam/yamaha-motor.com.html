            </p>
          <p><strong>4. Collection, Use &amp; Sharing of Passive &amp; Other  Information Beyond the Scope of Personal Information &nbsp;</strong> <br>
            <strong>Aggregate  Information.</strong>&nbsp; Yamaha may share aggregate  statistical information with business partners, sponsors or other third parties  without sharing your personal information. For example, we may tell an  advertiser that X number of visitors visited a certain area on a website, or  that Y number of men and Z number of women applied for extended service, but we  would not disclose anything that uniquely identifies those individuals.<br>
            </p>
          <p><strong>Cookies.</strong>&nbsp; Your browser software includes a feature  called "cookies." We may use "cookies" to enhance your  experience with our site. If enabled, cookies may store small amounts of data  on your computer about your visit to the Yamaha Website, including your page  preferences. Cookies tell us nothing about you personally, unless you  specifically give us additional information. Yamaha does not merge or associate  our cookie information with any personally identifiable information obtained by  us or from third parties. Cookies simply assist us in tracking which of our  features you like best and what content you may have viewed during past visits.  When you re-visit the Yamaha Website, cookies can enable us to customize our  content according to your preferences. We may use cookies to: (i) keep count of  your return visits to the Website; (ii) accumulate anonymous, aggregate,  statistical information on website usage; (iii) deliver content specific to  your interests or past viewing history; and (iv) save your password so you  don't have to re-enter it each time you visit our sites. You can also disable  cookies. By modifying your browser preferences, you can accept or reject all  cookies, or request a notification when a cookie is set.<br>
            </p>
          <p><strong>IP  Addresses.</strong>&nbsp; An Internet Protocol  ("IP") address is a number assigned to your computer whenever you  access the Internet. An Internet Service Provider ("ISP") typically  assigns a random dynamic IP address at the time of your dial-up. For local area  network ("LAN"), DSL, or cable modem users, a static IP address may  be permanently assigned to a particular computer. Yamaha may record IP  addresses of visitors to its Website. While an IP address may reveal your ISP  or geographic area, we cannot determine your identity solely based upon your IP  address. Other websites you visit have IP addresses, and we may collect the IP  addresses of those websites and their pages, but these IP addresses are never  associated with Internet users.<br>
            </p>
          <p><strong>Web  Beacons.</strong>&nbsp; The Website may contain  web beacons, which are electronic images (sometimes called "single-pixel  gifs") that allow us to count page views, or to access cookies. We may  also include web beacons in HTML-formatted newsletters containing graphics that  we may send to opt-in subscribers, to count the number of newsletters that have  been opened and read. Our web beacons do not collect, gather, monitor, or share  any personal information about our website visitors. They are used only to  compile our anonymous, aggregate statistics about website usage.<br>
            </p>
          <p><strong>Computer  Profiles.</strong>&nbsp; Yamaha may also collect  and accumulate other anonymous data that helps us understand and analyze the  Internet experience of our visitors. For example, we may accumulate visitor  data relating to referring domain names, the type of browsers used, operating  system software, screen resolutions, color capabilities, browser plug-ins,  language settings, cookie preferences, search engine keywords and JavaScript  enablement. None of this information is personally identifiable and we only  share this information in the aggregate, reflecting overall website or Internet  usage trends, as outlined in this Notice.<br>
            </p>
          <p><strong>Geolocation.&nbsp; </strong>Yamaha products and  connected device applications may collect, use, and share precise location  data, including the real-time geographic location of your Yamaha product or  connected device using a Yamaha application in order to provide location-based  services and features. Where available, geolocation features may use GPS,  Bluetooth, and your IP Address, along with crowd-sourced Wi-Fi hotspot and cell  tower locations, and other technologies to determine the approximate location  of your device and/or Yamaha product. Unless you provide consent, this location  data (if collected at all) is collected anonymously in a form that does not  personally identify you and is used by Yamaha, its affiliates and servicers  generally to provide and improve location-based products and services. For  example, your Yamaha application may share the geographic location of your  connected device or Yamaha product with Yamaha, its affiliates and servicers  when you opt in to geolocation features within applications or Yamaha products.&nbsp; Some geolocation features require combination  with personal information in order to function.&nbsp;  For example, some Yamaha products with geolocation features are combined  with product identification numbers that are tied to Personal Information.<br>
            </p>
          <p><strong>Performance  and Use of Your Yamaha Product.&nbsp; </strong>Yamaha  products and connected device applications may collect, use, and share data  related to your use of and the performance of your Yamaha Product.&nbsp; This data (if collected at all) is collected either  through your use of connected device applications or through diagnostic tools and  is used by Yamaha, its affiliates and servicers generally to provide more  effective service and maintenance of your Yamaha product, as well as to continue  to provide and improve quality products, features and services.<br>
            </p>
          <p><strong>5. Additional Information about the Yamaha Website and Yamahaâ€™s  Privacy Practices</strong> <br>
