                      Collect and Use?</b><br>
                      When you visit the Yamaha Website, we may collect passive 
                      information about your visit. Passive information is any 
                      form of aggregate data, navigational data, tracking data, 
                      click-stream data, or historical data, which does not on

                      you register a product, apply for extended service through 
                      our YES program, send us an email, subscribe to one of our 
                      newsletters, or submit other data through the Yamaha Website, 
                      we may also obtain and collect personally identifiable information. 
                      Personally identifiable information is information collected 
                      online that personally identifies you, such as by name, 
                      email address, or mailing address. Yamaha provides you with 
                      the ability to "opt-out" of certain uses of such 
                      personally identifiable information. </p>
                    <p class="commontext"><b>4. Maintenance &amp; Opt-Out of Information</b><br>
                      If you wish to opt-out of our use and disclosure of your 
                      personally identifiable information, other than as expressly 
                      permitted in this Privacy Policy, you will have the option 
                      to do so when you first submit your personally identifiable 
                      information via the Yamaha Website. Simply state your desire 
                      to opt-out where indicated. If you wish to amend or delete 
                      any personally identifiable information that you have previously 
                      provided without opt-out, please send us a message at <a href="mailto:privacy@yamaha-motor.com">privacy@yamaha-motor.com</a>. 
                      We will endeavor to provide a simple way to review, correct, 
                      update or remove personally identifiable information you 
                      have given us. If you wish to stop receiving a Yamaha newsletter

                      Information?</b><br>
                      If you have opted out of our general use of personally identifiable 
                      information, Yamaha will not use or disclose such information 
                      except as follows:</p>
                    <p class="commontext">- to communicate directly with you in 
                      connection with your specific requests;<br>
                      - to validate credit card numbers;<br>
                      - to permit our website designers to develop features and 
                      services that meet your needs;<br>

                      individually tailored content;<br>
                      - to comply with a lawful subpoena or court order;<br>

                      - to prevent harm to the property or rights of Yamaha or 
                      its customers.</p>

                      of our use and disclosure of your personally identifiable 
                      information, Yamaha may also use such information for its 
                      own marketing and survey purposes, and Yamaha may appoint 
                      third party agents in connection with such marketing and 
                      survey efforts, subject to a confidentiality agreement concerning 
                      the information. Yamaha will not, however, disclose any 
                      personally identifiable information for use in connection

                    <p class="commontext"><b>6. Aggregate Information</b><br>
                      Yamaha may share aggregate statistical information with 
                      business partners, sponsors or other third parties, but 
                      none of them receive personally identifiable information. 
                      For example, we may tell an advertiser that X number of 
                      visitors visited a certain area on a website, or that Y 
                      number of men and Z number of women applied for extended 
                      service, but we would not disclose anything that uniquely 
                      identifies those individuals.</p>

                      You</b><br>
                      Yamaha does not send unsolicited bulk emails to anyone who 
                      has requested that we do not contact them. We send newsletters 
                      only to those who have taken affirmative steps to subscribe. 
                      If you have inadvertently received one of our newsletters,

                      of data on your computer about your visit to the Yamaha 
                      Website, including your page preferences. Cookies tell us 
                      nothing about you personally, unless you specifically give 
                      us additional information. Yamaha does not merge or associate 
                      our cookie information with any personally identifiable 
                      information obtained by us or from third parties. Cookies 
                      simply assist us in tracking which of our features you like 
                      best and what content you may have viewed during past visits. 
                      When you re-visit the Yamaha Website, cookies can enable 
                      us to customize our content according to your preferences. 
                      We may use cookies to: (i) keep count of your return visits 
                      to the Website; (ii) accumulate anonymous, aggregate, statistical 
                      information on website usage; (iii) deliver content specific

                    <p class="commontext"><b>9. P3P (Platform for Privacy Preference) 
                      Conformance</b><br>
                      Our cookies conform to the emerging P3P privacy standard, 
                      developed by the World Wide Web Consortium. P3P provides 
                      a simple, automated way for users to control the use of 
                      personal information. Browsers like Microsoft Internet Explorer 
                      6.0 conform to the P3P standard. At its most basic level, 
                      P3P is a standardized set of multiple-choice questions, 
                      covering all the major aspects of a website's privacy policy. 
                      Taken together, they present a clear snapshot of how a site 
                      handles personal information. P3P-enabled browsers can "read" 
                      this snapshot automatically and compare it to the consumer's 
                      own set of privacy preferences. P3P places privacy policies 
                      where users can find them, in a form users can understand, 
                      and, most importantly, enables users to act on what they 
                      see. </p>
                    <p class="commontext"><b>10. IP Addresses</b><br>
                      An Internet Protocol ("IP") address is a number 
                      assigned to your computer whenever you access the Internet. 
                      An Internet Service Provider ("ISP") typically 
                      assigns a random dynamic IP address at the time of your 
                      dial-up. For local area network ("LAN"), DSL, 
                      or cable modem users, a static IP address may be permanently 
                      assigned to a particular computer. Yamaha may record the 
                      IP addresses of visitors to its Website. While an IP address 
                      may reveal your ISP or geographic area, we cannot determine 
                      your identity solely based upon your IP address. Other websites 
                      you visit have IP addresses, and we may collect the IP addresses 
                      of those websites and their pages, but these IP addresses 
                      are never associated with Internet users.</p>
                    <p class="commontext"><b>11. Web Beacons</b><br>
                      The Website may contain web beacons, which are electronic 
                      images (sometimes called "single-pixel gifs") 
                      that allow us to count page views, or to access cookies. 
                      We may also include web beacons in HTML-formatted newsletters 
                      containing graphics that we may send to opt-in subscribers, 
                      to count the number of newsletters that have been opened 
                      and read. Our web beacons do not collect, gather, monitor, 
                      or share any personal information about our website visitors. 
                      They are used only to compile our anonymous, aggregate statistics 
                      about website usage.</p>
                    <p class="commontext"><b>12. Computer Profiles</b><br>
                      Yamaha may also collect and accumulate other anonymous data 
                      that helps us understand and analyze the Internet experience 
                      of our visitors. For example, we may accumulate visitor 
                      data relating to referring domain names, the type of browsers 
                      used, operating system software, screen resolutions, color 
                      capabilities, browser plug-ins, language settings, cookie 
                      preferences, search engine keywords and JavaScript enablement. 
                      None of this information is personally identifiable and 
                      we only share this information in the aggregate, reflecting 
                      overall website or Internet usage trends, as outlined in 
                      this Privacy Policy.</p>
                    <p class="commontext"><b>13. Chat Rooms and Forums</b><br>
                      The Yamaha Website may in the future include chat rooms,

                      venues, which you do at your own risk. If you do so, you

                    <p class="commontext"><b>14. Security</b><br>
                      Some pages of the Yamaha Website use security measures to 
                      protect the loss, misuse and alteration of information that 
                      is transmitted through the Website. These pages use Secure 
                      Socket Layer ("SSL") connections with 128-bit 
                      encryption for certain transactions and confidential data. 
                      When you use a secure browser, all information you submit 
                      comes to us over the Internet in an encrypted form, with 
                      a digital certificate issued by a third-party certification 
                      authority such as VeriSign®. To view this certificate, 
                      click on the image of the closed lock or the solid key on 
                      the bottom bar of your browser window. We also maintain 
                      our servers in locked facilities with secure access. Unfortunately, 
                      no data transmission over the Internet or any wireless network 
                      can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while 
                      we strive to protect your personally identifiable information, 
                      we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information 
                      you transmit, and you do so at your own risk. Once we receive 
                      your transmission, we make our best effort to ensure its 
                      security on our systems. You can report network abuse and 
                      any risk of security violations to us by emailing privacy@yamaha-motor.com.</p>

                      The Yamaha Website complies with the Children's Online Privacy 
                      Protection Act of 1998 (COPPA). COPPA and its accompanying 
                      FTC regulation protects the privacy of children using the 
                      Internet. Yamaha does not knowingly collect contact or personally 
                      identifiable information from children under 13. The Yamaha 
                      Website is not intended to solicit information of any kind

                      acceptance of any such information, wherever age related 
                      information is requested. It is possible that by fraud or 
                      deception we may receive information pertaining to children 
                      under 13. If we are notified of this, as soon as we verify 
                      the information, we will immediately obtain parental consent 
                      or otherwise delete the information from our servers. If 
                      you want to notify us of our receipt of information by children 
                      under 13, please do so by emailing us at privacy@yamaha-motor.com.</p>
