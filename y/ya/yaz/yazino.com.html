    <div id="terms-service">
 <p>Yazino has created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate our firm belief and commitment to privacy.</p>
	<p>The following statement details what information we obtain from you, how we use it and how we fulfill our obligations to protect your privacy. Please read it carefully. By using the Yazino site and its services, you will be agreeing that you are happy for Yazino to gather and use your information in the ways stated in this privacy policy or in relevant parts of the website.</p>
    <h4 class="font-grey-head color-roul">Browsing the Sites</h4>
    <p>At Yazino we like to ensure that we will continue to meet the demands of our customers. To help us to understand your needs and improve the relevance of the services we offer you as an individual, we may collect anonymous information on your browsing activity while using Yazino's Services, such as IP address, browser type or referring URL.</p>
    <p>You cannot be identified personally as a result of the information we collect while you use our Services and we mainly examine browsing activity to monitor aggregated site traffic and analyse it.</p>
    <p>We may also provide anonymous statistics about user's activity to reputable third party vendors, but these will not include details that would allow the recipient to identify you.</p>
    <h4 class="font-grey-head color-roul">Cookies</h4>
    <p>Internet cookies are common and do not harm your system - they just store or gather site information. They help you do things online, like remembering logon details so you don't have to re-enter them when revisiting a site. We use cookies to recognise returning visitors and to deliver content specific to your interests. We don't use cookies to track people's Internet usage after leaving our Sites and we don't store personal information in them that others could read and understand. We will not sell or distribute cookie information without your prior consent.</p>
    <p>Most browsers allow you to refuse to accept cookies. This will, however, have a negative impact upon the usability of many sites, including this one.</p>
    <h4 class="font-grey-head color-roul">Joining Yazino</h4>
    <p>When you register with Yazino, subscribe to our Services, email notifications, newsletter, or request contact, there is certain information we collect to enable us to operate the Services. Details we may collect include name, address, telephone number and E-mail address.</p>
	<p>When you use Yazino on your social network site, we may record information regarding the use of the Service, and may collect other information visible on your social network pages in accordance with the terms of use associated with those pages.</p>
	<p>When you invite new members into your network or send messages through the Services, we may collect and maintain the information associated with those messages, including email addresses and content.</p>
	<p>Yazino will never offer a third party access to this information for any purpose save that we will pass your contact information to services you have requested to be put in touch with, and Yazino will only store information necessary to operate effectively.</p>
    <h4 class="font-grey-head color-roul">Personal Information</h4>
    <p>The personal information you submit to Yazino is held with the highest commitment to your privacy.</p>

Please contact Yazino to terminate your account or for any other questions about your personal information.</p>
	<p>If you wish to amend any of the data we hold about you, just contact us via the website.</p>
   <p>Please note that if you send messages or post material containing personal information, that information may be collected and used by others.</p>
   <p>You may instruct us to provide you with any personal information we hold about you, for which we may charge the statutory allowable fee for provision of this information.</p>
	<h4 class="font-grey-head color-roul">Transfer of Information</h4>
	<p>We reserve the right to transfer your personal information in the event of a transfer of ownership of Yazino or the acquisition of substantially all the assets of Yazino related to the business which collected such information, such as acquisition by or merger with another company. In such an event, Yazino will notify users who have provided email addresses when information about those users is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.
Others' Information</p>
   <p>You may decide to provide us with another person's email address so that person may be invited to join Yazino or so that we may facilitate your communication with other people through the Services.</p>
