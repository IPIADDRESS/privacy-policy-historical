	<h1>Bolt Privacy Policy</h1>
</div>

<div class="contentBlock">
	<div class="contentIndent">

		<p><strong>Policy Overview</strong></p>
		<p>This Privacy Policy pertains to the use of the Bolt web site at http://www.bolt.com. Safeguarding your privacy is serious business.  That's why Bolt's privacy policy is simple: : Bolt will not disclose, sell or rent any personally identifiable information without the user's proper consent except as provided in this statement.  The Bolt user is given final word on whether or not to share such information with Bolt.  Please use discretion, because Bolt cannot be held accountable for the use, collection or distribution of personal information freely provided by members with any of our tools, including profiles, message boards, chats and notes.  Be aware that information provided spontaneously by the user in such ways is not under the control of Bolt and might be observed, collected or utilized by third-party agencies and organizations.  If a member were to post a phone number in their profile (as an example) we cannot be held accountable for the consequences.  For questions or concerns about Bolt's information practices, contact the Bolt <a href="mailto:policy@boltinc.com">Policy Manager</a> as provided at the end of this policy.</p>
		
		
		<p><strong>Age Policy</strong></p>
		<p>Bolt is intended for users age 13 or older.  Bolt's registration process is intentionally designed for such an audience and we will not knowingly collect any information from children under 13.  Because of this age limit, this privacy policy makes no provision for children's use of Bolt.  If you are a parent or become aware of a child registered under the age of 13 please notify Bolt's <a href="mailto:policy@boltinc.com">Policy Manager</a> as provided at the end of this policy.</p>
		
		<p><strong>Note to Parents</strong></p>
		<p>If your child is under 13 and has become a Bolt member using a false age, please notify the <a href="mailto:policy@boltinc.com">Policy Manager</a> who will immediately close the account and nullify all personally identifiable information provided by them.  If your child is under the age of 18 and you would like to know more about our site, information practices, stored information on your child, or how to close your child's account, contact Bolt's <a href="mailto:policy@boltinc.com">Policy Manager</a>.</p>
		
		<p><strong>Information Retention</strong>
		</p><p>
		To preserve the integrity of website databases Bolt's procedure is to retain information submitted by members for an indefinite length of time.  By submitting information to Bolt you are consenting to store that information indefinitely.  If required by law, such as the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA,) Bolt will scramble and/or encrypt that information to make it unrecognizable.  Bolt will also respond to written member requests to scramble account information.  If you wish to make such a request, which will require you to verify your identity, contact the Bolt <a href="mailto:policy@boltinc.com">Policy Manager</a>.
		</p>
		
		<p>
		<strong>Information Collection and Use</strong>
		</p>
		<p>
		Bolt will only require personally identifiable information at the time of registration. This might include email address, gender, birth date, zip or postal code and the country of residence.  This information is used to identify you as a unique user within Bolt and will not be shared with any other party without your consent and notification.  Please be aware that your age, birth date and country will be visible in your profile.
		</p>
		<p>
		Information about members that is not personally identifiable may be used anonymously for purposes of advertising, demographic collection, market research data, anonymous reporting and to better tailor Bolt's content to the user's needs.  This type of information will not include any data that identifies members as an individual, such as email address, home address or telephone number.  If the user provides such information as part of an optional promotion, contest, survey or similar program they are subject to the separate privacy rules and expectations of each individual program.
		</p>
		<p>
		In addition to on-site advertising, Bolt may advertise products, companies and events that we think might interest you through the email address you provide if you choose to receive such solicitations.  The user is always able to ask Bolt not to contact them with such information again.  The user will not be included in promotions, contests, submission opportunities, solicitations or other programs unless they opt-in.  If you receive unsolicited email from a Bolt domain, please contact Bolt's <a href="mailto:policy@boltinc.com">Policy Manager</a>, as Bolt does not wish to provide users with unwanted information.
		</p>
		<p>
		Please note that Bolt may be required to share information with relevant authorities in order to investigate, prevent or enforce suspected or confirmed illegal activities, including with no limitation: fraud, threat or potential threat to the physical safety of any person, violation of Bolt's Terms of Service and/or User Agreement or as otherwise permitted or required by law.  Bolt may also be required to disclose such information in order to comply with subpoenas, warrants, court orders or legal process or to establish or exercise Bolt's legal rights or defend against legal claims.
		</p>
		
		<p><strong>Cookies and Tracking</strong></p>
		<p>
		Cookies are pieces of data stored by your web browser containing information related to your usage of Bolt.  They are most often used to quickly and easily connect you with your Bolt account information and do not contain personally identifiable information.  They may also be used to estimate Bolt's audience size for advertisers, to track the number of entries in Bolt promotions, sweepstakes and contests, to identify the areas of the site you visit, to hold session information and to track your user preferences.
		</p>
		<p>
		In addition, Bolt allows third-party advertisers on our site to place or recognize cookies on your browser.  Such cookies are subject to that organization's Privacy Policy and are not covered by Bolt's Policy.  For privacy information related to this usage consult the website and privacy policies of the advertiser in question.
		</p>
		<p>
		Using browser settings you can accept all cookies, reject all cookies, or request to be notified when a website attempts to place a cookie.  Please be aware that automatically rejecting all cookies may compromise the ease and convenience of your Bolt experience.
		</p>
		<p>
		We use a third party ad-serving technology to deliver ads on this website. Information about your visit to this site, such as the number of times you have viewed an ad (but not your name, address, or other personal information), is used to determine what ads to show you. In the course of serving advertisements to this site, the third-party ad serving technology may place or recognize a unique cookie on your browser. For more information about our third-party ad server, cookies, and how to "opt out," <br>please <a href="http://www.doubleclick.com/us/about_doubleclick/privacy/" target="_blank">click here</a>.
		</p>
		<p>
		Bolt employs a software technology called clear gifs to help better manage the content of html emails.  Clear gifs are small graphics with a unique identifier which serve a similar function to cookies.  Clear gifs are invisible on the page and very small but allow Bolt to track which emails are opened by recipients.  This allows Bolt to guage the effectiveness of marketing campaigns.  The clear gifs are not used in conjunction with other user information that is stored by Bolt.
		</p>
		
		<p><strong>IP Addresses</strong></p>
		<p>Your web browser automatically reports your current IP address each time you access a web page.  Your IP address may be stored in Bolt's database when you register.  Bolt may use your IP address to quickly address tech and usage concerns reported by our members, to tailor our advertising to specific geographic areas, to estimate the number of visitors from geographic areas and to uniquely identify Bolt visitors to aid in enforcement of our conduct policies.</p>
		
		<p><strong>Logging of User Information</strong>
		</p><p>Your browser automatically transmits information to the web sites you visit, including Bolt.  Such information may include referral data (what webpage sent you to Bolt) IP addresses and your browser version.  Bolt collects this information to help us improve our services and moderate the site.  All information automatically submitted by your browser is anonymous.  Bolt also logs the information you submit through registration, forms for optional programs, surveys and other entries, cookie data and communications transmitted through Bolt applications.  Only authorized Bolt staff members have access to your information in its entirety.  Other Bolt staff may have access to portions of this information as required by their duties.</p>
		
		<p><strong>Information Security, Editing and Deletion</strong></p>
		<p>
		Bolt members may change their account and profile information at any time, with the exception of Birth Dates, which must be verified by staff members to comply with our age policy.  When appropriate, users' transmissions to Bolt may be encrypted to provide information security.  Please note that while users may delete any information in their accounts, that information and the account itself may be kept intact on Bolt's servers for an indefinite period to ensure database integrity.
		</p>
		
		<p><strong>Notification of Changes</strong></p>
		<p>
		Bolt's security and privacy policy are periodically reviewed and enhanced as necessary. In the event that this Privacy Policy is updated, Bolt will post notification if there is any material change in its privacy practices.  Users are encouraged to review the Policy periodically.
		</p>
		
		<p><strong>Staff Contact</strong></p>

		<p>
		Bolt's <a href="mailto:policy@boltinc.com">Policy Manager</a> will respond to all requests sent through mail or email from members and parents interested in knowing more about what personal information is stored on the Bolt database, or if they want their personal information nullified, or have additional questions regarding privacy.
