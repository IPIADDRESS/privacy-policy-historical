<div class="contentWellStd">
<p>When you use our Site (see definition below), we collect and process personal information about you. This document helps you understand what personal information we collect about you, how we collect it, what we use it for, and what rights you have regarding it.</p>
<p>When we talk about "YTMonster®", "we", "us" or "our", we mean Monster Group and our partners. We also use "Policy" to refer to this Privacy Policy and "Site" to refer to our applications and all YTMonster® websites.</p>
<p>Monster Group is the entity responsible for processing your personal information.</p>
<hr>
<div class="lg-slim-text"><b>1. Personal information - what we collect and what we use it for</b></div>
<b>1.1	Master Data</b>
<p>When you create a profile on the Site, we automatically generate a personal account for you on YTMonster® ("Account") and collect the following personal information about you ("Master Data"):</p>
<p></p><ul><li>Your username (this may show publicly)*</li>
<li>Your encrypted password*</li>
<li>Your e-mail address*</li>
<li>IP address*</li>
<li>Your full name</li>
<li>Gender</li>
<li>Age</li>
<li>Interests</li></ul><p></p>
<p>Information marked with an asterisk (*) is mandatory, which means that it is not possible to use the Site without it.</p>
<p>If you choose to add additional personal information to your profile, this additional information will be included in your public profile and in your Master Data.</p>
<p>YTMonster® is an open exchange platform and when you launch campaigns on the Site, they will be visible to users who exchange with you. Therefore, please note that depending on the campaigns, the information you add to your profile, and the username you choose, you may or may not be anonymous.</p>
<x>
<b>1.2	Information in campaigns</b>
<p>When you start a campaign and publish it on our Site, we collect the information that you include in your campaign:</p>
<p></p><ul><li>The campaign name</li>

<li>The campaign thumbnail</li>
<li>View length</li>
<li>Custom comments</li></ul><p></p>

<x>
<b>1.3	Support</b>
<p>It is possible to get support via our Site, via Facebook / Messenger, via Twitter, or via email.</p>
<p>When YTMonster® is contacted via our Site, a ticket is created in our system, allowing us to see the username. We relate to what is stated by the user in the ticket and have direct contact with the user to provide the best support. In this connection, it may be necessary to examine the user's data and relevant campaigns. After providing support, we close the relevant ticket and the correspondence is stored in our system.</p>
<p>When YTMonster® is contacted via Facebook / Messenger, a ticket is also created in our system, and the user gets the answer on Facebook / Messenger. We communicate directly with the user via Messenger.</p>
<p>When YTMonster® is contacted via Twitter, a ticket is also created in our system, and the user gets the answer directly as a message on Twitter. When you choose to receive support via Twitter, this is done in an open forum where everyone using Twitter can see the messages.</p>
<p>When YTMonster® is contacted via e-mail, a ticket is also created in our system, and the user receives the reply as a direct e-mail.</p>
<p>We do not receive sensitive information in connection with our support. Should we receive sensitive information, it will be deleted immediately.</p>
<x>
<b>1.4	Information from other services, including social networks, such as YouTube</b>
<p>You can link your YTMonster® profile to your social network profile, e.g. YouTube ("Social Network"). We automatically collect selected information about you from your Social Network when you choose this option. The information we collect depends on what information you have made available on the Social Network and your privacy settings for sharing such information on the Social Network.</p>
<p>You can choose to disconnect the link between your Social Network profile and your YTMonster® profile on your Account. YTMonster® will immediately remove your unique Social Network ID and disconnect / remove YTMonster® from your Social Network.</p>
<x>

<hr>
<div class="legal-head">5.	Data processors and transfer of personal data outside the EU</div>
<p>We use external companies to maintain the technical operation of our Site and our services. These companies are Data Processors for the personal data for which we are Data Controllers. By accepting this Policy, you agree that we may also allow the information you are the Data Controller of to be processed by these Data Processors.</p>
<p>We have entered into Data Processing Agreements with the Data Processors, and it follows from these agreements that they must act exclusively in accordance with our instructions. By accepting this Policy, you authorize us to give such instructions to Data Processors to process information in accordance with this Policy when using our Site.</p>
<p>The Data Processors have taken reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect the information from accidental or illegal destruction, loss or deterioration, and to protect the information against disclosure to unauthorized persons, abuse, or other treatment in violation of data protection laws.
At your request - and possibly against remuneration at the Data Processors’ current hourly rates for such work - the Data Processors must provide sufficient information to you to demonstrate that the above mentioned technical and organizational security measures have been taken.</p>
<p>Some of these Data Processors are located outside the European Union, such as in the United States.

<hr>
<div class="legal-head">7.	Safety precautions</div>
<p>We use reasonable organizational, technical, and administrative measures to protect your personal information in our organization, and we regularly review our system for vulnerabilities. But since the Internet is not a 100% secure environment, we cannot guarantee or guarantee the security of the information you send to us. Emails sent through the Site may not be encrypted and we therefore advise you not to include any confidential information in your emails to us. We always work to improve our security procedures and we update this information as these practices evolve over time.</p>
