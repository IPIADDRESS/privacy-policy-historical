                            <span style="line-height: 1.2;">RETAILCOMMON Inc., the owner of yroo.com (“<span style="font-weight: bold;">yroo.com</span>,” “<span style="font-weight: bold;">us</span>” or “<span style="font-weight: bold;">we</span>”), owns and operates the yroo.com website (the “<span style="font-weight: bold;">Web Site</span>”) and the services related to or offered on the Web Site (the “<span style="font-weight: bold;">Services</span>”).</span>
                        </p>

                        <p>Your privacy and the respectful and responsible handling of your personal information is very
                            important to us. The purpose of this privacy policy (the
                            “<span style="font-weight: bold;">Policy</span>”) is to outline the types of information
                            that may be collected about you when visiting the Web Site, how that information will be
                            used and disclosed, and how you can control, correct and update the information.</p>

                        <p>Each visit to the Web Site or use of the Services constitutes your acknowledgement and
                            acceptance of the Policy. Providing personal information or authorizing a third party to
                            disclose personal information to us signifies your consent to yroo.com’s collection, use and
                            disclosure of your personal information in accordance with this Policy.</p>

                        <p>For the purposes of this Policy, “personal information” means information that can identify
                            an individual directly or through other reasonably available means. The meaning of “personal
                            information” shall be interpreted in a manner that conforms with the minimum requirements of
                            applicable provincial and federal privacy legislation.</p>

                        <h2>1. Our Privacy Principles</h2>

                        <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Type of Personal Information Collected</span></p>

                        <p>The type of information we collect is linked to the purposes. For instance, when you sign up
                            to be a Member, we may collect your name, email address, and other payment information as
                            well as information about the products or services you view or purchase. If you are part of
                            a referral program we keep track of who you refer and who refers you (as applicable). In
                            addition, we sometimes host contests, so we will collect information as set forth in the
                            contest rules.</p>

                        <p>
                            <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Identifying Purposes and Obtaining Your Consent</span>
                        </p>

                        <p>The purposes for which we collect personal information are mostly what you would reasonably
                            expect. Where it is not reasonably evident why we’re collecting information, we would
                            identify the purposes for collecting your personal information at or before the time it is
                            collected. We will not collect, use or disclose your personal information without your
                            informed consent, unless required or permitted to do so by law.</p>

                        <p>To provide to you a few example of why we collect personal information, we collect, use and
                            disclose personal information about you so we can:</p>

                        <ul>
                        <li>maintain and manage our membership;</li>

                        <li>account for reward points or cash back earned under your account;</li>

                        <li>allocate cash back;</li>

                        <li>process payments; and</li>

                        <li>target advertisements to make the Web Site and/or Services more personal and useful to
                            you.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>We may also use your personal information to communicate with you about new products,
                            Services, offerings or other information we reasonably believe may be useful to
                            you.</p>

                        <h2>2. Limiting Collection, Use and Disclosure of Your Personal Information</h2>

                        <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Information Gathered and Used</span></p>

                        <p>We collect personal information by fair and lawful means and limit collection to that
                            information which is reasonably necessary for the purposes identified in this
                            Policy.</p>

                        <p>The choice to provide us with your personal information, either directly or through a third
                            party, is always yours. However, your decision to withhold particular information may limit
                            our ability to provide you with some of our products or Services.</p>

                        <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">How your Information is Collected</span></p>

                        <p>Most of the personal information we collect will be done online. However, personal
                            information may also be collected in a number of ways, including: over the phone, by mail
                            or, yes, even by fax if necessary (and such fax machines exist). We may also collect
                            personal information from third parties who you have authorized to disclose personal
                            information to us (for instance, our Affiliate Stores will have information on your
                            purchases and that information may be provided to us if necessary to audit transactions and
                            ensure rewards are properly allocated).</p>

                        <p>We make every reasonable effort to ensure that those third parties that disclose your
                            personal information to us have first obtained your consent. If you believe that a third
                            party has inappropriately disclosed your personal information to us, please contact that
                            third party directly. If the third party does not sufficiently respond to your inquiries,
                            please let us know immediately.</p>

                        <p>Your personal information will only be used or disclosed in accordance with the purposes for
                            which it was collected, unless you have otherwise consented and except where required or
                            permitted by law.</p>

                            information to verify your identity and to properly assist you.</p>

                        <p>We require all of our employees to abide by yroo.com’s privacy standards. Our employees
