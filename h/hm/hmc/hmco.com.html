<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
<p>Welcome! You have arrived at an online service location (e.g., web site or mobile app) that is owned and/or operated by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt Publishing Company (collectively, "<strong>HMH</strong>," "<strong>we</strong>," "<strong>our</strong>" or "<strong>us</strong>"). This "<strong>Privacy Policy</strong>" governs your use of any online service location (e.g., web site or mobile app) that posts a link to this Privacy Policy (each a "<strong>Site</strong>") (including, without limitation, both mobile and online versions of the Site). It also applies to your use of interactive features, widgets, plug-ins, applications, content, downloads and/or other services that: (i) we own and control and make available through a Site; or (ii) that posts a link to the Privacy Policy (collectively with each Site, the "<strong>Service</strong>"). It applies regardless of how you access or use the Service, whether via personal computers, mobile devices or otherwise. It does not apply to data we receive from third parties except to the extent we combine such data with Personal Information (defined below) that we have ourselves collected under this Privacy Policy. Our statements under this Privacy Policy only apply to our privacy practices on the Service, and do not apply to any third parties that may independently interact with our Service.</p>
<p>This Privacy Policy does not apply to our data collection activities offline or otherwise outside of our Service (unless otherwise stated below). To the extent we provide you notice on our Service of different or additional privacy policies or practices (e.g., at the point of our collection), those additional terms shall govern such data collection and use. Due to the diverse nature of our businesses, companies within the Houghton Mifflin family of companies may have different privacy policies. In such cases, the privacy policy of the particular company or business unit will be posted, and will supersede the terms of this Privacy Policy in the event of a conflict.</p>
<p>In addition, please review the <a href="/terms-of-use/services">Service's&nbsp;Terms of Use</a>, which govern your use of the Service. By using our Service, you consent to our Privacy Policy and Terms of Use and our collection, use and sharing of your information and data, and other activities, as described below.</p>

</strong></p>
<p>In addition to any Personal Information or other information that you choose to submit to us via our Service, we and our third-party service providers may use a variety of technologies that automatically (or passively) collect or store certain information when you visit or interact with the Service ("<strong>Usage Information</strong>"). This Usage Information may be stored or accessed using a variety of technologies that may be downloaded to your personal computer, laptop, tablet or mobile phone (a "<strong>Device</strong>") when you visit or interact with our Service. Usage Information may be non identifying or may be associated with you. To the extent we associate Usage Information with your Personal Information, we will treat it as Personal Information.</p>
<p>This Usage Information may include:</p>
<ul>
            <li>your IP address, UDID or other unique identifier ("<strong>Device Identifier</strong>"). A Device Identifier is a number that is automatically assigned to your Device used to access the Service, and our computers identify your Device by its Device Identifier;</li>
            <li>your Device functionality (including browser, operating system, hardware, mobile network information);</li>
            <li>the URL that referred you to our Service;</li>
            <li>the areas within our Service that you visit and your activities there, including remembering you and your preferences;</li>
            <li>your Device location;</li>
            <li>your Device characteristics; and</li>
            <li>certain other Device data, including the time of day, among other information.</li>
        </ul>
<p>We may use various methods and technologies to collect or store Usage Information ("Tracking Technologies"). Tracking Technologies may set, change, alter or modify settings or configurations on your Device. A few of the&nbsp;<strong>Tracking Technologies</strong>&nbsp;include, without limitation, the following (and subsequent technology and methods later developed):</p>
<p><em>Cookies</em>. A cookie is a data file placed on a Device when it is used to visit the Service. A Flash cookie (or locally shared object) is a data file placed on a Device via the Adobe Flash plug-in that may be built-in to or downloaded by you to your Device. HTML5 cookies can be programmed through HTML5 local storage. Unlike Flash cookies, HTML5 cookies do not require a plug-in. Regular cookies may generally be disabled or removed by tools that are available as part of most commercial browsers, and in some but not all instances can be blocked in the future by selecting certain settings. Each browser you use will need to be set separately and different browsers offer different functionality and options in this regard. Also, these tools may not be effective with regard to Flash cookies or HTML5 cookies. For information on disabling Flash cookies go to Adobe's web site&nbsp;www.adobe.com.&nbsp;<em>Please be aware that if you disable or remove cookies, Flash cookies, or HTML5 cookies on your Device, some parts of our Service may not function properly, and that when you revisit our Service your ability to limit cookies is subject to your browser settings and limitations.</em></p>
<p><em>Web Beacons</em>. Small graphic images or other web programming code called web beacons (also known as "1x1 GIFs" or "clear GIFs") may be included in our Service's pages and messages. Web beacons may be invisible to you, but any electronic image or other web programming code inserted into a page or e-mail can act as a web beacon. Web beacons or similar technologies may be used for a number of purposes, including, without limitation, to count visitors to the Service, to monitor how users navigate the Service, to count how many e-mails that were sent were actually opened or to count how many particular articles or links were actually viewed.</p>
<p><em>Embedded Scripts</em>. An embedded script is programming code that is designed to collect information about your interactions with the Service, such as the links you click on. The code is temporarily downloaded onto your Device from our web server or a third-party service provider, is active only while you are connected to the Service, and is deactivated or deleted thereafter.</p>
<p><em>ETag, or entity tag</em>. A feature of the cache in browsers. It is an opaque identifier assigned by a web server to a specific version of a resource found at a URL. If the resource content at that URL ever changes, a new and different ETag is assigned. Used in this manner ETags are a form of Device Identifier. ETag tracking may generate unique tracking values even where the consumer blocks HTTP, Flash, and/or HTML5 cookies.</p>
<p>For information on why and how we use Tracking Technologies, see below.</p></div>

<p>We may receive information about you from your friends, colleagues and others that use the Service, such as when they submit content to us or post on the Service. Additionally, we may, from time to time, supplement the information we collect directly from you on our Service with outside records from third parties.

<p>The Service may include functionality that allows certain kinds of interactions between the Service and your account on a third-party web site or application. The use of this functionality may involve the third-party operator providing certain information, including Personal Information, to us. For example, when you register with the Service, you may have an option to use your Facebook, Google or other account information provided by a third-party site or application to facilitate the registration and log-in or transaction process on the Service, or otherwise link accounts. If we offer and you choose to use this functionality to access our Service, the third-party site or application may send Personal Information about you to the Service. If so, we will then treat it as Personal Information under this Privacy Policy, since we are collecting it as a result of your accessing of and interaction on our Service. In addition, we may provide third-party sites' interfaces or links on the Service to facilitate your sending a communication from the Service. For example, we may use third parties to facilitate emails, tweets or Facebook postings.

We may not control or have access to your communications through these third parties. Further, when you use third-party sites or services, you are using their services and not our services and they, not we, are responsible for their practices. You should review the applicable third-party privacy policies before using such third-party tools on our Service.</p></div>

A user's profile page may be, by default, set up to display information such as the user's display name, images, location (city/state/country), groups that the user has joined and optional information added by the user including, for example, the user's tagline, photographs and educational materials, etc. We may make it possible for users to see a report on other users that visited a profile page and this gives users access to such visitor's profile pages. Profile information is used by us primarily to be presented back to and edited by you when you access the Service and to be presented to others permitted to view that information on the Service. In some cases (e.g., posting to your page), other users of the Service may be able to supplement your profile. We may offer users the ability to manage their public profile and use profile preference settings as explained where profile features are offered, the functionality and features of which are subject to change from time-to-time so visit it frequently to confirm the settings reflect your then current preferences. Changing setting options may not result in immediate changes to the settings, which are subject to our operations and maintenance schedules. Users should carefully consider the use of such settings to improve information display options and to ensure the settings are properly set and functioning in the manner desired. Notwithstanding the availability of profile preference settings, you should be aware that these settings are for convenience only, and may not be error free. Further, other users that have access may repost or otherwise make public your information or content. Accordingly, discretion and good judgment should be exercised when posting information or content as part of your profile. We recommend that you do not post information or content as part of your profile that you are not prepared to make public.</p></div>

<p>The Service may contain content that is supplied by a third party, and those third parties may collect Usage Information and your Device Identifier when pages from the Service are served to you. In addition, when you are on the Service you may be directed to other sites that are operated and controlled by third parties that we do not control. We are not responsible for the data collection and privacy practices employed by any of these third parties or their services and they may be tracking you across multiple sites and may be sharing the results of that tracking with us and/or other sites. For example, if you "click" on a link, the "click" may take you off the Service onto a different site. These other sites may associate their Tracking Technologies with you, independently collect data about you, including Personal Information, and may or may not have their own published privacy policies.<br></p>
<p>Third-party applications may also be available via the Service. The owners of these applications may collect Personal Information and other data from you and may have their own policies and practices. We are not responsible for how these third parties or their applications collect or use your information and they may be tracking you across multiple sites and may be sharing the results of that tracking with us and/or others. These third parties may have their own terms of service, privacy policies or other policies and ask you to agree to the same. We are not responsible for these third-party privacy policies or the practices of these third parties. Be sure to review any available policies before submitting any personally identifiable information to a third-party application or otherwise interacting with it and exercise caution in connection with these applications. We also encourage you to note when you leave our Service and to review the third-party privacy policies of all third-party locations and exercise caution in connection with them.</p></div>

<p>The Service may use third parties such as network advertisers and ad exchanges to serve advertisements on and off of the Service and may use third-party analytics and other service providers to evaluate and provide us and/or third parties with information about the use of the Service and viewing of ads and of our content. Network advertisers are third parties that display advertisements based on your visits and activities across the Internet and mobile media ("<strong>Behavioral Ads</strong>"). In addition, we may serve ads on our Service based on your Usage Information from your activities on our Service ("<strong>Contextual Ads</strong>"). Behavioral Ads and Contextual Ads enable us to target advertisements to you for products and services in which you might be interested. If you object to Contextual Ads, do not use our Service. If you object to Behavioral Ads, you can learn more about your ability to limit Behavioral Ads below.</p>
<p>Our third-party ad network and exchange providers, advertisers, sponsors and/or traffic measurement services may themselves set and access their own cookies (including Flash cookies), web beacons and other Tracking Technologies on your Device and track certain behavioral Usage Information regarding users of your Device via a Device Identifier. These third-party Tracking Technologies may be set to, among other things: (a) help deliver advertisements to you that you might be interested in; (b) prevent you from seeing the same advertisements too many times; and (c) understand the usefulness to you of the advertisements that have been delivered to you. You acknowledge and agree that associated technology may access and use your Device and may set or change settings on your Device in connection with the associated operations. Note that any images (or any other parts of content) served by third parties in association with third-party ads or other content may serve as web beacons, which enable third parties to carry out the previously described activities.</p>
<p>Third-party Tracking Technologies are not controlled by us, even if they are used to serve our ads or interact with our Service. Statements regarding our practices do not apply to the methods for collecting information used by these third parties or the use of the information that such third parties collect. We do however work with third parties to make efforts to have you provided with information on their practices and any available opportunity to exercise choice. The relevant third party's terms of service, privacy policy, permissions, notices and choices should be reviewed regarding their collection, storage and sharing practices. We make no representations regarding the policies or practices of third-party advertisers or advertising networks or exchanges or related third parties.</p>
<p>Some third parties we work with may offer you certain choices regarding their practices, and information we have been informed of regarding such choices is available&nbsp;<a href="#body-10">here</a>. Further, while we and third party sites that display our ads may use a variety of companies to serve advertisements, you may wish to visit&nbsp;<a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/optout_nonppii.asp" target="_blank">http://www.networkadvertising.org/optout_nonppii.asp</a>, which provides information regarding this practice by Network Advertising Initiative ("NAI") members, and your choices regarding having this information used by these companies, including the "opt-out" procedures of NAI members. Opting out of one or more NAI members only means that those NAI members no longer will be allowed under their own rules to deliver Behavioral Ads to you, which will affect this and other sites, but does not mean you will no longer receive any targeted content and/or ads. Also, if your browsers are configured to reject cookies when you visit this opt-out page, or you subsequently erase your cookies, use a different Device or change web browsers, your NAI opt-out may not, or may no longer, be effective. Therefore, if you use multiple Devices or multiple browsers on a single Device, you need to opt-out for each browser that you use on your Device. Additionally, if you delete your cookies, change browsers, or use a different Device, you will need to opt-out again. Additional information is available on the NAI's web site accessible by the above link. Where we serve third-party Behavioral Ads on the Service we participate in the notice and opt-out program run by the Digital Advertising Alliance ("<strong>DAA</strong>"), and you can learn more about it and the opt-out choices it offers at&nbsp;<a href="http://www.aboutads.info/choices/#completed" target="_blank">http://www.aboutads.info/choices/#completed</a>. Where we serve our own Behavioral Ads on third party sites, we request that they comply with the DAA program so that you have the same notice and opt-out choice. Please note that similar limitations as described regarding NAI opt-out may apply to the DAA opt-out. In the event that we allow third parties to display advertisements that are directly targeted at users in the EU, please visit&nbsp;<a href="http://www.youronlinechoices.com" target="_blank">http://www.youronlinechoices.com</a>&nbsp;to learn more about your options. Similar limitations may apply to these opt-out methods. We are not responsible for effectiveness of, or compliance with, any third-parties' opt-out options or programs.</p></div>

<p>We understand the importance of protecting children's privacy in the interactive world. We do not use the Service to knowingly collect Personal Information from children under the age of thirteen (13) without verified parental consent or as otherwise permitted by applicable law. Furthermore, most of the portions of our Service that are directed to children 12 years and under are designed so that we do not collect Personal Information at all. In the event any of the Services designed for children 12 years and under, or designed for both such children and older users, do have aspects where we may collect Personal information we will comply with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act ("<strong>COPPA</strong>"), including its verified parental consent requirements. In addition, we will post a separate Children's Privacy Policy on such portions of the Services that explains further what types of Personal information may be collected, under what circumstances, for what purposes and what options parents have to approve or limit such collection.</p>
<p>In the event that we become aware that we have collected Personal Information from any child absent the parental consent required by COPPA, or as otherwise permitted by COPPA, we will dispose of that information in accordance with applicable law. If you are a parent or guardian and you believe that your child under the age of 13 has provided us with information without your consent, please contact us at&nbsp;<a href="mailto:privacy@hmhco.com">privacy@hmhco.com</a>&nbsp;and we will take reasonable steps to ensure that such information is deleted from our files.</p></div>
