<h1>Website Privacy Policy</h1>
<p>
</p></center>
<p>We believe in the importance of keeping your personal information private.
We will never use your information for any use beyond that stated or the
additional permissions that you give us.</p>
<h2>Cookies</h2>
<p>Our sites use temporary cookies where necessary to maintain information
(such as which language you have indicated that you prefer to use)
during a single browsing session.
Some of our advertisers may use other forms of cookies or similar
(see "Advertisers" below).</p>
<h2>Server Logs and Statistics</h2>
<p>Our servers, as with virtually all Web servers, will record your IP address
when you visit. We may also record and/or display non-personal statistics
such as current number of users and popular site items. We do
not use such information for tracking the activities of specific users.
We may use such information to avert misuse of resources such as
bandwidth.
</p><h2>Advertisers</h2>
<p>Our sites use third-party advertisers. We expect
them to respect your personal data in a broadly similar way to the
privacy policy described in this page.</p>
<p>Some advertisers may use behavioural tracking to help target their ads,
but in this case there should be a reasonable opt-out available.</p>
<h2>Email, Forms and other Feedback</h2>
<p>If you respond to us through any explicit feedback, for example by email,
we will not use your data in any way not advertised with that feedback
mechanism unless agreed with you.</p>
<h2>Changes</h2>
<p>Our policies may change from time to time, for example as laws are changed.
We will always attempt to protect your privacy, but you may wish to check
this page or its successors from time to time to remain up-to-date with
our policy.</p>
