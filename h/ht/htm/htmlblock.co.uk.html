<h1>Privacy Statement for www.htmlblock.co.uk </h1>
<p><strong>General Privacy Statement<br>
<br>
</strong>HTMLBlock has created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to privacy. The following discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices for this website: www.htmlblock.co.uk.<br>
<br>
We use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server, and to administer our website. Your IP address is used to gather broad demographic information.<br>
<br>
The www.htmlblock.co.uk website may use cookies, which are small text files on your computer. A cookie contains identifying information. The cookie is used to make the link between you and the information you have provided to the website. This allows your shopping basket to be kept separate from other users and enables us to automatically complete some of the forms when you subsequently use them. The creation of a cookie on your computer does not give the website any access to other information such as your email address.<br>
<br>
The European Union Directive on Privacy and Electronic Communications (the "Directive"), which came into force on 31st July 2002, recognises that cookies are a "legitimate and useful tool" for many activities, including verifying the identity of web site users. The Directive makes it compulsory for websites to inform users if cookies are being used, and to provide some information on how cookies are used. The www.htmlblock.co.uk website (in common with most other shopping websites) will not work without cookies.<br>
<br>
Our site's registration form requires you to provide us with some contact information (e.g. name and email address). We sometimes use this contact information from the registration form to send you information about our company and our products and services. This contact information is also used to contact you when necessary. If at any time you receive unwanted information from HTMLBlock please contact us and we will remove you from our records.<br>
<br>
This site contains links to other sites. www.htmlblock.co.uk is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such websites.<br>
<br>
In some cases, we work with other companies to provide products and services. In such cases we will never share your details directly with another company.<br>
<br>
Our site uses a form to help us manage requests. We collect contact information (like email address). Contact information is used to respond to enquiries, or get in touch with you when necessary.<br>
<br>

<br>
We run competitions on our site in which we ask for contact information (like email address). We use contact information from competitions to send information about our company. Contact information is also used to contact you when necessary. Any other information is shared only within HTMLBlock.<br>
