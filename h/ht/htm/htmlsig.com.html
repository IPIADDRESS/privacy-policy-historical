        <h3>Payments</h3>
        <p>We may provide paid products and/or services within the Service. In that case, we use third-party services for payment processing (e.g. payment processors).</p>
        <p>We will not store or collect your payment card details. That information is provided directly to our third-party payment processors whose use of your personal information is governed by their Privacy Policy. These payment processors adhere to the standards set by PCI-DSS as managed by the PCI Security Standards Council, which is a joint effort of brands like Visa, Mastercard, American Express and Discover. PCI-DSS requirements help ensure the secure handling of payment information.</p>
        <p>The payment processors we work with are:</p>
        <ul>
                        <li>
                <p><strong>Stripe</strong></p>
                <p>Their Privacy Policy can be viewed at <a href="https://stripe.com/us/privacy">https://stripe.com/us/privacy</a></p>
            </li>
                                                </ul>


        <h2>Links to Other Sites</h2>
        <p>Our Service may contain links to other sites that are not operated by us. If you click on a third party link, you will be directed to that third party's site. We strongly advise you to review the Privacy Policy of every site you visit.</p>
        <p>We have no control over and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies or practices of any third party sites or services.</p>


        <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>Our Service does not address anyone under the age of 18 ("Children").</p>
        <p>We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from anyone under the age of 18. If you are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your child has provided us with Personal Data, please contact us. If we become aware that we have collected Personal Data from children without verification of parental consent, we take steps to remove that information from our servers.</p>
