       YOUR RIGHTS
      </strong>
      <br>
      <br>
      By law, you have a number of rights (subject to
        certain conditions) when it comes to your information. Further
        information and advice about your rights can be obtained from the data
        protection regulator in your country. You can exercise any of these
        rights by contacting us through our contact information below.
      <br>
      <ul style="padding-left: 40px">
       <li>
        <strong>
         The
        right to object to processing.
        </strong>
        You have the right to object to certain
        types of processing, including processing for direct marketing (i.e.
        receiving emails from us notifying you about other services which we
        think will be of interest to you or being contacted with varying
        potential opportunities).
       </li>
       <li>
        <strong>
         The right to be informed
        </strong>
        . You have the
        right to be provided with clear, transparent and easily understandable
        information about how we use your information and your rights. This is
        why we’re providing you with the information in this Policy.
       </li>
       <li>
        <strong>
         The
        right of access
        </strong>
        . You have the right to obtain access to your information
        (if we’re processing it), and certain other information (similar to that
        provided in this Privacy Policy). This is so you’re aware and can check
        that we’re using your information in accordance with data protection
        law.
       </li>
       <li>
        <strong>
         The right to rectification
        </strong>
        . You are entitled to have your
        information corrected if it is inaccurate or incomplete. You can request
        that we rectify any errors in information that we hold.
       </li>
       <li>
        <strong>
         The right
        to erasure.
        </strong>
        This is also known as ‘the right to be forgotten’ and, in
        simple terms, enables you to request the deletion or removal of your
        information that we hold.
       </li>
       <li>
        <strong>
         The right to restrict processing
        </strong>
        . You
        have rights to ‘block’ or supress further use of your information. When
        processing is restricted, we can still store your information, but will
        not use it further. We keep lists of people who have asked for further
        use of their information to be ‘blocked’ to make sure the restriction is
        respected in the future.
       </li>
       <li>
        <strong>
         The right to data portability
        </strong>
        . You have
        rights to obtain and reuse your information for your own purposes across
        different services. For example, if you decide to switch to a new
        provider, this enables you to move, copy or transfer your information
        easily between our IT systems and theirs safely and securely, without
        affecting its usability. This is not a general right however and there
        are exceptions.
       </li>
       <li>
        <strong>
         The right to lodge a complaint
        </strong>
        . You have the right
        to lodge a complaint about the way we handle or process your information
        with your national data protection regulator.
       </li>
       <li>
        <strong>
         The right to withdraw
        consent
        </strong>
        . If you have given your consent to anything we do with  your
        information (i.e. we rely on consent as a legal basis for processing
        your information), you have the right to withdraw your consent at any
        time (although if you do so, it does not mean that anything we have done
        with your personal data with your consent up to that point is unlawful).
        You can withdraw your consent to the processing of your information at
        any time.
       </li>
      </ul>
      Where your personal information is collected within the
        European Economic Area (EEA), you can contact us through the contact
        information of HTC Europe Co. Ltd to exercise any of those rights
        described above.

       INFORMATION CHOICES AND CHANGES
      </strong>
      <br>
      <br>
      Our marketing emails tell you how
        to “opt out” of receiving further marketing emails. If you opt out, we
        may still send you non-marketing emails. Non-marketing emails include
        emails about your accounts and our business dealings with you, and may
        include a request that you participate in surveys related to your use
        of, and satisfaction with, the Services. You may send requests about
        your personal information to us through our contact information below.
        You can request to change contact choices or marketing choices and to
        update, access, delete or make other changes regarding your personal
        information or content that you post on the Services in line with your
        rights above. We may not honour all such requests unless required by
        law. When you use our Services, we and third parties may give you
        choices about use of certain mechanisms for tracking, including tracking
        of your online activities over time and across different websites,
        applications and online services. We may provide settings on your device
        that allow you to change how we, and others, collect certain information
        about you. Read your product manual for more information about settings
        on your device. Many browsers are set to accept cookies unless and until
        you change your settings. Removing or rejecting our cookies could affect
        how our websites and Services work for you and could delete or disable
        opt-out cookies set by us and third parties. Some of our third party ad
        service providers also provide choices for use of cookies to deliver ads
        tailored to your profile and preferences.

      While we and others give you certain choices, as further outlined in this Policy, there are
        many ways in which Web browser signals and similar mechanisms can

       PROTECTION OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION

        access, use, processing or alteration of the personal information that

        of such personal information, such as anonymization, pseudonymization,
        encryption (such as encrypted by Transport Layer Security (httpS) during
        transmission), restricted access, etc.. Although we take steps to use
        and improve various safeguards, no system or technology is completely
        secure. If you become aware of a technical vulnerability affecting HTC
