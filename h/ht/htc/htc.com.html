                        <p>In the course of serving you as an individual client 
                          or as someone associated with a corporate or institutional 
                          client, Goldman Sachs may obtain personal information 
                          about you. Obtaining this information is important to 
                          our ability to deliver the highest level of service 
                          to you, but we also recognize that you expect us to 
                          treat this information appropriately.<br>
                          <br>
                          This Policy describes the types of personal information 
                          we may collect about you, the purposes for which we 
                          use the information (including those with whom we may 
                          share it), and the steps that we take to safeguard the 
                          information to protect your privacy. As used throughout 
                          this Policy, the term "Goldman Sachs" refers 
                          to The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. and its affiliates 
                          worldwide. </p>
                        <p> <b>The Sources of Information</b> <br>
                          <br>
                          The personal information we collect about you comes 
                          primarily from the account applications or other forms 
                          and materials you submit to Goldman Sachs during the 
                          course of your relationship with us. We may also collect 
                          information about your transactions and experiences 
                          with Goldman Sachs relating to the products and services 
                          Goldman Sachs provides. In addition, depending on the 
                          products or services you require, Goldman Sachs may 
                          obtain additional information about you, such as your 
                          credit history, from consumer reporting agencies.<br>
                          <br>
                          Finally, in the provision of financial services to you 
                          and subject to strict compliance with all applicable 
                          laws and regulations, information may be collected about 
                          you indirectly from monitoring or other means (e.g., 
                          recording of telephone calls and monitoring e-mails). 
                          In these circumstances, the information is not accessed 
                          on a continuous or routine basis but it may be used 
                          for compliance or security purposes. </p>

                          to you if you access Goldman Sachs products or services

                            our services. Generally, identification and authentication 
                            take place through the use of your user name and a 
                            password, or with an RSA SecurID<sup>*</sup> Card 
                            and a Personal Identification Number ("PIN").

                            of our machines to system intrusion detection capabilities. 
                            Within such private sites, Goldman Sachs uses industry 
                            standard encryption technologies to protect your information 
                            from external compromise. <br>
