HTC is committed to protecting the privacy of www.htc.com's users and has created this statement to outline www.htc.com's information collection practices.  If you have any questions or concerns about this statement, please send an email to          .</p>

	  <h3>Anonymous Use</h3>
      <p class="bodyText">The majority of materials provided under <a href="http://www.htc.com" target="_blank">www.htc.com</a> 
        are provided for information purposes and you will be able to use <a href="http://www.htc.com" target="_blank">www.htc.com</a> 
        without informing HTC who you are or providing HTC with any personal data 
        basically. However, HTC might need to information about you with respect 
        to your use of <a href="http://www.htc.com.tw" target="_blank">www.htc.com.tw</a>.</p>
      <br>
      <h3>Information Collection</h3>
      <p class="bodyText">When requesting to be contacted by HTC relevant personnel, 
        users are asked to provide information about themselves and their companies. 
        This information enables HTC relevant personnel to respond promptly and 
        effectively to customer questions and requests. HTC may track the domain 
        names of users and analyze this data. Subject to the provisions of this 
        statement, HTC may use the accumulated data for several purposes, including, 
        but not limited to, marketing analysis, service evaluation, and planning. 
        Through the aforementioned website, HTC may conduct surveys or other studies 
        for marketing and planning purposes. With respect to information collected 
        from such surveys or studies, and in the event that responses are to be 
        publicly disclosed, users will be notified about their participation, 
        and HTC will disclose only aggregate information regarding its users and 
        not personal information identifying any specific individual. Notwithstanding 
        the foregoing, in cases where surveys allow users to submit written comments, 
        and where HTC advises users of the possibility of such disclosure at the 
        time they take the survey, HTC reserves the right to disclose text information 
        provided by any user through such a survey, provided that no personal 
        information identifying that user is disclosed. Participation in such 
        surveys is entirely voluntary. Circumstances under which the HTC would 
        publicly disclose such aggregate information include, but are not limited 
        to, sharing survey results with the site population, providing data to 
        <a href="http://www.htc.com" target="_blank">www.htc.com</a> advertisers on user preferences 
        and/or demographics, and publicizing overall usage data in press communications.

        include directions for how a user may remove himself or herself from the 
        list, or a URL where the user may find such directions. If you no longer

        security has been compromised or user non-public information has been 
        disclosed to unrelated third parties as a result of external activity, 
        including but not limited to external security attacks, HTC shall take 
        reasonable measures that it deems appropriate, including but not limited 
        to internal investigation and reporting and notification to and cooperation 
        with law enforcement authorities, notwithstanding other provisions of 
        this Statement. If HTC becomes aware that a user's personal information 
        provided to www.htc.com has been disclosed in a manner not permitted by 
        this Privacy Statement, HTC shall make reasonable efforts to notify the 
        affected user, as soon as reasonably possible and as permitted by law, 
        of what information has been disclosed, to the extent that www.htc.com 
        knows this information. HTC reserves the right to disclose information 
        contained in our access logs concerning any user, as we reasonably feel 
        is necessary to protect our systems or business. In particular, HTC reserves 
        the right to disclose such when a user is in violation of our current 
        or later Terms of Use or other published guidelines, or initiates or participates 
        (or is reasonably believed to do so) in any illegal activity, even without 
        a subpoena, warrant, or other court order, and to disclose such information 
        in response to court and governmental orders, civil subpoenas, discovery 
        requests, and as otherwise required by law. </p>

Some factors beyond our control may result in disclosure of data. As a consequence, HTC disclaims any warranties or representations relating to maintenance or nondisclosure of private information. </p>
