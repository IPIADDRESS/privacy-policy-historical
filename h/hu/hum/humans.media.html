The law (at Civil Code Section 1798.83) gives California users the right to prevent us from disclosing their Personal Information to third parties that use such information for their direct marketing purposes.  The law also requires certain companies to respond to California users requests to disclose business’ practices related to disclosing Personal Information to third parties for those direct marketing purposes. &nbsp;As an alternative, companies subject to the “Shine the Light Law” can have in place a policy of not disclosing Personal Information for such marketing purposes.<br><br>We don’t share any such Personal Information.

That law requires companies of certain websites and online services (i.e., us) to allow registered users who are under the age of 18 and residents of California to request removal of User Content they post.  Companies can delete it or make it invisible to others.<br><br>As noted elsewhere in this Privacy Policy, we will remove such Content in response to any user’s request to remove User Content (and also Personal Information), provided, of course, that we can validate you are who you say you are.  Please understand that someone might have copied User Content you have already posted and we will not be able to remove such copies.  We might also choose simply to render that User Content invisible to other users and the public (rather than deleting it).  We might also have to archive it for legal purposes as we explain in this Privacy Policy below.   &nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ul></div></div></section><section class="section_1bizhy9" data-reactid="89"><div class="container_1u9w7u6-o_O-medium_t9xjph-o_O-gutter_1ixr1j0" data-reactid="90"><h1 class="title_sv4e1e" data-reactid="91">2.

Information We Receive and How We Receive It</h1><div class="text_pgkqfl" data-reactid="100"><p>We receive information about you—which is defined below as “Personal Information”—and your use of our Services—which is “Technical Information”—that comes from systems that measure use of our Services and also from Cookies on your browser (explained below).  This Section 4 explains the information received and how it is received.  The next section, Section 5, explains our use. Section 8 explains how you can protect your Personal Information and control what we receive and use.<br></p><ul><li><b>4.1	Personal Information<br></b><br></li><ul><li><b>A. Definition:</b> Applicable laws define personal information in numerous ways.  Some of those definitions extend to information well beyond what we receive.  We do not receive (or use) all that much.  However, we have adopted the definition of “Personal Data” set forth in the General Data Protection Regulation of the European Union (“GDPR”) and called it “Personal Information.”  Personal Information means: any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person; an identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person.<br><br></li><li><b>B. Some Examples</b><br><br></li><ol><li><b>Just Visiting?</b> Then we do not receive “Personal Information” but only “Technical Information,” which we have defined below (typically from Cookies).  In some jurisdictions the Technical Information could fall within the above definition of Personal Information, so we are careful with its use, too.  <br><br></li><li><b>Creating an Account?&nbsp;</b>If you create an account or log into an existing account or use other features (described in more detail below), then we would receive the following:  your name and username;  your password;  your email address;  and limited information from Stripe through “Stripe Connect,” which is used to enable login.  If you log in through a social network, then that network might provide us with some Personal Information.<br><br></li><li><b>Posting User Content?&nbsp;</b>If you post User Content and it includes information about you (such as your physical features or political or religious positions) we receive that information because we have to post the User Content and archive it but we do not use it.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br></li></ol><li><b>C.&nbsp;How We Receive Personal Information:&nbsp;</b>Generally speaking, you provide us with Personal Information  by: (1) logging into, or creating, an account;  (2)  providing feedback to us;  (3)  posting a review or making other comments on any public forums available on the Sites;  (4)  entering a contest or sweepstakes or filling out a survey;  or  (5)  submitting other user-generated or submitted content (#2 through 5 are defined as “User Content”). We also may receive Personal Information from Site usage to help us improve Site performance, content selection, product design, and usability.<br><br></li><ol><ol><li><b>Using Social Media for Access:&nbsp;</b>You can create an account or log in using social media such as Facebook or Twitter.  Personal Information that these social media platforms collect as a function of your using them to access any of our Sites is subject to privacy policies of the social media platform that you use for access.<p>Personal Information from such social media platforms will be shared with us in accordance with their privacy policies and your privacy settings on the relevant social media platform.  We will treat this Personal Information shared with us in accordance with this Privacy Policy.  Alternatively, we offer the option to create an account without any connection to any social media platform – with your email and a personal password.<br><br></p></li><li><p><b>Providing Us with Personal Information through User Content:&nbsp;</b>You might end up providing us with Personal Information when you submit User Content, including your use of any public forums we may offer such as newsfeeds, blogs, message boards or similar tools, and articles, videos, posts or comments you make.  If you include in your posts, etc., your location, ethnicity, gender and other such information then you are making such Personal Information available to any visitors to any or our Sites.  We do nothing with such information.  We don’t scan for it or do anything else.  As you can understand, that Personal Information could end up elsewhere by other users.<br><br></p></li></ol></ol></ul><li><b>4.2&nbsp;Technical Information<br></b><br></li><ul><li><b>A. Definition: </b>When you visit a Site, it automatically recognizes: your domain name; IP address and region or geographical area; browser version; operating system; the website you passed through to reach our Site; and usage information such as the number and frequency of visitors to each Site and its various web pages or content.  We also may receive certain Technical Information through Cookies and similar tools as further described in the section below.  We define this information as “Technical Information.”<br><br></li><li><b>B.&nbsp;How We Receive Technical Information:&nbsp;</b>We receive Technical Information through Cookies, Web Beacons and Pixel Tags, each of which is defined below.<br><br></li><ol><li><b>Cookies:</b>&nbsp;Cookies are pieces of information that many websites transfer to your browser and that are then stored in your computer’s system. The Cookies then provide information, as noted above, on matters such as your domain name, IP address and so forth.  We use our own Cookies and information from third party Cookies.  Third party Cookies are typically inserted into your computer when you visit websites of third parties (i.e., not one of our Sites) long before you visit one of our sites. We do not control when or how third parties place Cookies on your computer.<br><br></li><li><b>Web Beacons and Pixel Tags:&nbsp;</b>Web beacons, also known as “clear gifs”, “one-pixel gifs”, “web bugs”, “Internet tags” or “pixel tags”, are small graphic images (usually invisible) that can be embedded in content and advertising on a website or in an email. These may be embedded on our Sites or on advertisements there or on third party sites you visit from our platform.  Web beacons can recognize certain types of information on your browser, check whether you have viewed a web page or email message, and determine, among other things, the time and date that you viewed the web beacon, the IP address of your computer, and the URL of the web page from which the web beacon was viewed. We use web beacons to improve your experience, including to provide you with content customized to your interests.<br></li></ol></ul></ul></div></div></section><section class="section_1bizhy9" data-reactid="101"><div class="container_1u9w7u6-o_O-medium_t9xjph-o_O-gutter_1ixr1j0" data-reactid="102"><h1 class="title_sv4e1e" data-reactid="103">5.

We need to communicate with you about your account (if you have one), User Content and our Services.

In some situations we have agreed with you (through the <a href="https://vocal.media/terms-of-use" target="_blank">Terms of Use</a>) to pay you.  In that case, we obviously need to use your Personal Information.  Or, perhaps we need to communicate with you about the User Content you have uploaded.<br><br></i></li></ul><li><b>B. What We Do Not Do:&nbsp;</b>We’re proud of the limits we have adopted to our use of your Personal Information because it strengthens our commitment to our users as members of a community.  So here is a brief list:<br><br></li></ul><ol><ol><li>We don’t license, sell or give away your Personal Information—e.g., to someone who will market to you.</li><li>We don’t profile you.</li><li>We don’t keep your Personal Information beyond the time-frame we need for our Services and our obligations under contract with you.<br><br></li></ol></ol><ul><li><b>C. Sharing of Personal Information:&nbsp;</b>Except as otherwise described in this section, we do not share your Personal Information with third parties for their own use.  In particular, we do not provide it to third parties for them to market to you.<br><br></li></ul><ol><ol><li><b>Processing for Your Account, etc.:&nbsp;</b>The main sharing of your Personal Information comes when you want to establish an account, so we have to transmit your Personal Information to a third party that manages those accounts, which is currently Stripe.  You are redirected to Stripe, where you establish your account, which is called the “Stripe Connect” service that generates the Stripe Access Token, Refresh Token, Publishable token, Account Type and user ID.<br><br></li><li><b>Re-publication of User Content:&nbsp;</b>From time to time, we receive requests from other media companies to license some User Content they have seen on one or more of our Sites.  <i>We never provide it to them without first obtaining the express consent of the user that created that User Content.</i>  If that user does not consent, then we do not share the relevant Personal Information with that media company.<br><br></li><li><b>When You Use Social Media for Access:&nbsp;</b>When you log-in to a Site through social media platform (e.g., with Log In With Facebook) Personal Information can be exchanged based on the Sites you visit or other Services you use.  We recommend that you familiarize yourself with those services’ privacy policies and privacy controls.  In addition, when you visit the Site while logged into one of those services, that service might be able to identify you and associate the Technical Information with other information the service already has about you.<br><br></li><li><b>Government Requests and Other Actions:&nbsp;</b>We may also share Personal Information in the following circumstances:  (a)  upon receipt of a governmental request for information;  (b)  in response to a subpoena or a court order;  (c)  to comply with relevant laws;  (d)  in response to an investigation of fraud regarding a specific individual, and to detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues;  (e)  in an effort to safeguard the person or property of a Company employee or a third party;  (f)  when we believe it is necessary to protect our interests, or we believe in good faith that the law requires the sharing of your Personal Information; or  (g)  to enforce this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Use.<br><br></li><li><b>Future Business Structure:&nbsp;</b>We may, in the future, decide to sell, merge, or otherwise reorganize our business or assets. We reserve the right to transfer and disclose Personal Information in these circumstances to an entity acquiring the company or relevant assets. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of us or our assets may continue to use your Personal Information as set forth in this Privacy Policy or in a different policy that they elect to adopt).<br><br></li><li><b>Aggregated Information:&nbsp;</b>Finally, we may also share de-identified aggregate information with third parties and advertisers so they can measure the effectiveness of any advertisements viewed in connection with our Sites and understand their audiences.  For example, we may tell advertisers the number of users who clicked on a particular advertisement.  We might also use such aggregated information to modify our Services for better performance or other reasons.<br><br></li></ol></ol><li><b>5.2 How We Use Technical Information:&nbsp;</b>The Technical Information we receive (e.g., from Cookies) is used to enable your use of the Services such as storing your login information to accelerate that process or to respond to your preferences.  We also use Technical Information to customize our infrequent newsletters, as well as advertising and Site content based on browser type and user profile information.  The Technical Information may also provide measurements of overall and specific activity on our Sites in the use of other Services, allowing us to modify the look-and-feel, content and performance of our Services.<br></li></ul></div></div></section><section class="section_1bizhy9" data-reactid="105"><div class="container_1u9w7u6-o_O-medium_t9xjph-o_O-gutter_1ixr1j0" data-reactid="106"><h1 class="title_sv4e1e" data-reactid="107">Third Party Services and Advertising</h1><div class="text_pgkqfl" data-reactid="108"><ul><li><b>A.

What You Can Do about the Information We Have</h1><div class="text_pgkqfl" data-reactid="116"><p></p><ul><li><b>A. Finding out about and Changing the Personal Information:&nbsp;</b>As noted in the summary above, we believe in providing our users with rights to control the Personal Information we have.

For users in the EU, Norway, Lichtenstein and Iceland please go to our privacy policy for your <a href="https://www.iubenda.com/privacy-policy/14961855/legal" target="_blank">Vocal GDPR Privacy Terms</a>.<br><br></li><ul><li>Under this Privacy Policy you have the right:<br><br></li><ol><li><b>To be informed about our Privacy Policy</b>—which means what it says, i.e., the details of what we receive and how it is used.<br><br></li><li><b>Of access to your Personal Information</b>—which also means what it says:  Ask us and we’ll show it to you.<br><br></li><li><b>To rectify errors in your Personal Information</b>—which means that we will try to correct errors in that Personal Information for truthfulness and accuracy.<br><br></li><li><b>To erasure of your Personal Information</b>—which means we will delete your Personal Information (except for those copies we need for purposes we describe in this Privacy Policy).<br><br></li><li><i>To restrict&nbsp;“processing” (our storage and use) of your Personal Information</i>—which mean that you can tell us about limits on the use.<br><br></li><li><b>To data portability of your Personal Information</b>—which means that we will provide you with a copy of the Personal Information we have.<br><br></li><li><b>To object to our Privacy Policy</b>—which means what it says:  Tell us what you do not like and we’ll consider changes.<br><br></li><li><b>To control automated decision making and profiling (which we do not do, anyway)</b>—which means that there are certain additional rules where no human intervention as to your data occurs as to making decisions or profiling you.  We do not do, either, so it is not relevant.<br><br></li></ol><li>Of course, we’ll have to verify you are who you are when you make the requests.  Please also understand that we might not comply with your requests if we believe that the changes you wish to make are fraudulent or not truthful or accurate.  In addition, we will not remove Personal Information that is archived for legal purposes, such as responding to government requests.<br><br></li></ul><li><b>B. Consequences:&nbsp;</b>Some of your requests above will have certain consequences that might be negative to you.  For example, if you wish to have your Personal Information erased, then you will not be able to use your account and other Services that rely on access to your Personal Information.<br><br></li><li><b>C. What to Do:&nbsp;</b>If you want to do any of the above, then please email us at:&nbsp;<a href="mailto:privacy@vocal.media">privacy@vocal.media</a> (and include something informative in the subject line).<br><br>We will reply to you to confirm your request (and as far as we can tell, to determine if you are you) and then respond to your request.
