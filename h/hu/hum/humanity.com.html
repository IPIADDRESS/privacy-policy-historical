Information may include number of unique visitors, the frequency with which they visit, and the areas on the Website that they favor. These statistics are very much like television ratings that tell the networks how many people tuned in to a program. We only use this type of data in the aggregate, on a collective basis, in summary form, rather than on an individual basis. This data helps us determine the extent to which our users use certain parts of our Website, which, in turn, enables us to make it as appealing and user friendly as possible. We may also share aggregate data of users’ collective use of our Website with advertisers, sponsors, and other companies with which we do business (“Affiliates” or “Business Partners”).

Your best protection is to understand the limits to privacy on the Internet and use common sense in all of your online activities.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Be aware that e-mail is an inherently insecure form of communication. Remember that third parties are sometimes able to illegally intercept your unencrypted messages, including online greetings.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Anytime you visit a chat room or post a message to an online bulletin board, your e-mail address can be accessed by advertisers looking to compile lists for unsolicited commercial e-mail (also known as spam). Be sure that you only disclose your e-mail address in circumstances in which it is safe to do so. You should also be aware that any information you provide in these areas may be read, collected, and used by others who access them. To request removal of your personal information from our blog or community forum, contact us at <a href="mailto:info@humanity.com">info@humanity.com</a>. In some cases, we may not be able to remove your personal information, in which case we will let you know if we are unable to do so and why.
