                        <h2>Privacy Shield</h2>
                        <p>The EU-U.S. and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Frameworks were designed by the U.S. Department of Commerce, and the European Commission and Swiss Administration, respectively, to provide companies on both sides of the Atlantic with a mechanism to comply with data protection requirements when transferring personal data from the European Union and Switzerland to the United States in support of transatlantic commerce.</p>
                        <p>Humanity participates in and has certified its compliance with the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework and the Swiss-U.S Privacy Shield Framework. Humanity is committed to subjecting all personal data received from European Union (EU) member countries and Switzerland, in reliance on each Privacy Shield Framework, to the Framework’s applicable Principles. To learn more about the Privacy Shield Frameworks, and to view our certification, visit the U.S. Department of Commerce’s Privacy Shield List. [<a href="http://www.privacyshield.gov/list">www.privacyshield.gov/list</a>]</p>
                        <p>Humanity is responsible for the processing of personal data it receives, under each Privacy Shield Framework, and subsequently transfers to a third party acting as an agent on its behalf. Humanity complies with the Privacy Shield Principles for all onward transfers of personal data from the EU and Switzerland, including the onward transfer liability provisions.</p>
                        <p>With respect to personal data received or transferred pursuant to the Privacy Shield Framework, Humanity is subject to the regulatory enforcement powers of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission. In certain situations, Humanity may be required to disclose personal data in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.</p>
                        <p>Under certain conditions, more fully described on the Privacy Shield website [<a href="https://www.privacyshield.gov/article?id=How-to-Submit-a-Complaint">https://www.privacyshield.gov/article?id=How-to-Submit-a-Complaint</a>], you may be entitled to invoke binding arbitration when other dispute resolution procedures have been exhausted.</p>
                        <p>In compliance with the Privacy Shield Principles, Humanity commits to resolve complaints about our collection or use of your personal information. EU individuals with inquiries or complaints regarding our Private Shield policy should first contact Humanity at <a href="mailto:info@humanity.com">info@humanity.com</a>.</p>

                        <h2>Cookies and Tracking Technologies</h2>
                        <p>Many cookies contain a so-called cookie ID. A cookie ID is a unique identifier of the cookie. It consists of a character string through which internet pages, servers or apps can be assigned to the specific app or server in which the cookie was stored.</p>
                        <p>Through the use of cookies or similar technologies, Humanity and its partners can provide the customers of this website and applications with more customer-friendly services that would not be possible without the cookie setting.</p>
                        <p>By means of a cookie, the information and offers on our website and applications can be optimized with the customer in mind. Cookies allow us, as previously mentioned, to recognize our website and applications customers. The purpose of this recognition is to make it easier for customers to utilize our website and applications. The website and applications customer that uses cookies, e.g. does not have to enter access data each time the website and applications is accessed, because this is taken over by the website and applications, and the cookie is thus stored on the customer’s computer system.</p>
                        <p>We may use “session ID cookies” to enable certain features of the Service, to better understand how you interact with the Service and to monitor aggregate usage and web traffic routing on the Service. You can instruct your browser, by changing its options, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the websites you visit. If you do not accept cookies, however, you may not be able to use all aspects of the Application.</p>
                        <p>Some web browsers may transmit “do-no-track” signals to websites with which the browser communicates. Our website does not currently respond to these “do-not-track” signals.</p>
                        <p><b>Strictly necessary cookies</b></p>
                        <p>These cookies are essential, as they enable you to move around the Site and use its features, such as accessing secure areas. Without these cookies, some services you have asked for such as payment submission can’t be provided.</p>
                        <p><b>Performance cookies</b></p>
                        <p>These cookies collect information about how you use the Site, for example which pages you go to most often and if you get error messages from certain pages. These are used to improve how the Site works.</p>
                        <p><b>Functionality cookies</b></p>
                        <p>These cookies allow the Site to remember choices you make (such as your user name, language or the region you’re in). For instance, the Site uses functionality cookies to remember your language preference. These cookies can also be used to remember changes you’ve made to text size, font and other parts of pages that you can customize. They may also be used to provide services you’ve asked for such as watching a video or commenting on a blog.</p>
                        <p><b>Targeting cookies</b></p>
                        <p>These cookies are used to deliver advertisements that are more relevant to you and your interests. They are also used to limit the number of times you see an advertisement as well as help measure the effectiveness of an advertising campaign. They remember that you have visited a website and this information may be shared with other organizations such as advertisers. This means after you have been to the Site you may see some advertisements about our services elsewhere on the Internet.</p>
                        <p>The data subject may, at any time, prevent the setting of cookies through our website and application by means of a corresponding setting of the browser or app, and may thus permanently deny the setting of cookies. Furthermore, already set cookies may be deleted at any time. If the data subject deactivates the setting of cookies in the browser or app, then not all functions may be entirely usable.</p>
                        <p>We use automatically collected information and other information collected during the Services through cookies and similar technologies to:</p>
                        <ol>

                        <h3>Sensitive Information</h3>
                        <p>We do not believe in intrusive collection of your personal details and will not collect information that is considered highly personal or highly sensitive about you without your prior consent.</p>
                        <h2>Data Retention and Data Deletion</h2>
                        <p>We only retain the personal information collected from a Customer for as long as the Customer’s email address is active on our mailing list, or otherwise for a limited period of time as long as we need it to fulfil the purposes for which we have initially collected it, unless otherwise required by law.</p>
                        <p>In some cases, it is not possible for us to specify in advance the periods for which your personal data will be retained. In such cases, we will determine the period of retention based on the 2-year criteria, after your relationship with us ends.</p>
                        <p>Notwithstanding the other provisions of this Article, we may retain your personal data where such retention is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which we are subject, or in order to protect your vital interests or the vital interests of another natural person.</p>
                        <h3>Your rights</h3>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>Some of the rights are complex, and not all of the details have been included in our summaries. Accordingly, you should read the relevant laws and guidance from the regulatory authorities for a full explanation of these rights.</p>
                        <p>Your principal rights under data protection law are:</p>
                        <ol type="a">
                        <li>the right to access;</li>
                        <li>the right to rectification;</li>
                        <li>the right to erasure;</li>
                        <li>the right to restrict processing;</li>
                        <li>the right to object to processing;</li>
                        <li>the right to data portability;</li>
                        <li>the right to complain to a supervisory authority; and</li>
                        <li>the right to withdraw consent.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>You have the right to confirmation as to whether or not we process your personal data and, where we do, access to the personal data, together with certain additional information. That additional information includes details of the purposes of the processing, the categories of personal data concerned and the recipients of the personal data. Providing the rights and freedoms of others are not affected, we will supply to you a copy of your personal data. The first copy will be provided free of charge, but additional copies may be subject to a reasonable fee.</p>
                        <p>You have the right to have any inaccurate personal data about you rectified and, taking into account the purposes of the processing, to have any incomplete personal data about you completed.</p>
                        <p>In some circumstances you have the right to the erasure of your personal data without undue delay. Those circumstances include: [the personal data are no longer necessary in relation to the purposes for which they were collected or otherwise processed; you withdraw consent to consent-based processing; you object to the processing under certain rules of applicable data protection law; the processing is for direct marketing purposes; and the personal data have been unlawfully processed]. However, there are exclusions of the right to erasure. The general exclusions include where processing is necessary: for exercising the right of freedom of expression and information; for compliance with a legal obligation; or for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims.</p>
                        <p>In some circumstances you have the right to restrict the processing of your personal data. Those circumstances are: you contest the accuracy of the personal data; processing is unlawful but you oppose erasure; we no longer need the personal data for the purposes of our processing, but you require personal data for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims; and you have objected to processing, pending the verification of that objection. Where processing has been restricted on this basis, we may continue to store your personal data. However, we will only otherwise process it: with your consent; for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims; for the protection of the rights of another natural or legal person; or for reasons of important public interest.</p>
                        <p>You have the right to object to our processing of your personal data on grounds relating to your particular situation, but only to the extent that the legal basis for the processing is that the processing is necessary for: the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of any official authority vested in us; or the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by us or by a third party. If you make such an objection, we will cease to process the personal information unless we can demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for the processing which override your interests, rights and freedoms, or the processing is for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims.</p>
                        <p>You have the right to object to our processing of your personal data for direct marketing purposes (including profiling for direct marketing purposes). If you make such an objection, we will cease to process your personal data for this purpose.</p>
                        <p>You have the right to object to our processing of your personal data for scientific or historical research purposes or statistical purposes on grounds relating to your particular situation, unless the processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out for reasons of public interest.</p>
                        <p>To the extent that the legal basis for our processing of your personal data is:</p>
                        <ol type="a">
                        <li>consent;</li>
                        <li>that the processing is necessary for the performance of a contract to which you are party or in order to take steps at your request prior to entering into a contract,</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>and such processing is carried out by automated means, you have the right to receive your personal data from us in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format. However, this right does not apply where it would adversely affect the rights and freedoms of others.</p>
                        <p>If you consider that our processing of your personal information infringes data protection laws, you have a legal right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority responsible for data protection. You may do so in the EU member state of your habitual residence, your place of work or the place of the alleged infringement.<br>
                        To the extent that the legal basis for our processing of your personal information is consent, you have the right to withdraw that consent at any time. Withdrawal will not affect the lawfulness of processing before the withdrawal.</p>
                        <p>You may exercise any of your rights in relation to your personal data by written notice to us.</p>
