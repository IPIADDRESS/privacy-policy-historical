  <p>DNS Park, LLC ("DNS Park") is committed to the online
  privacy of your personal information.  Please take a moment to read the
  following policy to understand how your personal information will be used
  as you make use of our services.  This policy may change from time to time
  so please refer back here periodically.</p>

  <ol>
  <li><a name="personalinfo">
  <b>What personal information does DNS Park collect from me?</b></a>
  <p>When you register to become a part of the DNS Park, you are no longer
  an anonymous user to DNS Park.  During the registration process, DNS Park
  will ask for your name, email address, postal address, and telephone.</p>
  </li>

  <li><a name="cookies">
  <b>What are cookies and how does DNS Park use them?</b></a>
  <p>As part of providing a personalized service, DNS Park uses
  <a href="http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/C/cookie.htm">cookies</a> to store and
  sometimes track information about you.  A cookie is a small amount of data
  that is sent to your browser from a web server and stored on your
  computer's hard drive. All sites on DNS Park where you are prompted to
  sign-in require that you accept cookies.</p>

  <p>We generally use cookies to remind us of who you are and to access your
  account information (stored on our computers) in order to deliver your
  personalized services.  This cookie is set when you "Sign In" and
  is modified when you "Sign Out" of our services.</p>

  <p>DNS Park also uses your IP address for system administration functions.</p>  </li>

  <li><a name="how"><b>How does DNS Park use my information?</b></a>
  <p>DNS Park's primary goal in collecting personal information is to
  provide a personalized service to you, the user.  None of this information
  is shared with business partners or other third parties.</p>
  </li>

  <li><a name="who"><b>Who is collecting information?</b></a>
  <p>When you are on a DNS Park site and are asked for personal
  information, you are sharing that information with DNS Park alone.</p>
  </li>

  <li><a name="whom"><b>With whom does DNS Park share my information?</b></a>
  <p>DNS Park will not disclose any of your personal information except
  when we have your permission or under special circumstances, such as when
  we believe in good faith that the law requires it.  Please see our Terms
  of Service for more detailed information about how your personal
  information may be shared.</p>
  </li>

  <li><a name="choices">
  <b>What are my choices regarding collection, use and distribution of
  my information?</b></a>
  <p>DNS Park may, from time to time, send you email regarding our
  services if you indicated that you wished to receive such notices upon
  registration.  Only DNS Park will send you thses direct mailings.  If you
  do not want to receive such mailings, simply tell us when you give us
  your personal information.  At any time you can edit your
  <a href="https://www.dnspark.net/account.php">DNS Park Account Information</a>
  to no longer receive such offers and mailings.  You will need your DNS
  Park ID and Password in order to access your
<a href="https://www.dnspark.net/account.php">DNS Park Account Information</a>.</p>

  <p>You also have choices with respect to cookies. By modifying your browser
  preferences, you have the choice to accept all cookies, to be notified when
  a cookie is set, or to reject all cookies. If you choose to reject all
  cookies you will be unable to use those DNS Park services that require
  registration in order to participate.  You can still use many other DNS Park
  sites even if you do not accept cookies.</p>

  <li><a name="update">
  <b>What is DNS Park's policy on allowing me to update, correct, or delete my personal information?</b></a>
  <p>You may edit your
  <a href="https://www.dnspark.net/account.php">DNS Park Account Information</a>
  at any time by using your DNS Park ID and password.  If you have forgotten
  your password, you can change it by filling out the
  <a href="https://www.dnspark.net/forgot.php">Forgot Password</a>. By filling in
  your email address, and your postal address, then clicking
  the 'Retrieve Password' we will send you a new password via email.
  You may send email to <a href="mailto:parkrangers@dnspark.com">parkrangers at dnspark dot com</a>
  if you are having other problems with your account.</p>

  <p>Your DNS Park account can de deleted or deactivated, but doing so will
  result in not being able to access any account specific areas of the DNS
  Park site.  Please contact
  <a href="mailto:parkrangers@dnspark.com">parkrangers at dnspark dot com</a> for
  further instructions about deleting or deactivating your DNS Park account.

  </li>


  <li><a name="security">
  <b>What security measures are in place to protect the loss, misuse, or alteration of my information?</b></a>
  <p>Your DNS Park Account information is password-protected so that you
  and only you have access to this personal information.  We use SSL
  technologies when transmitting your personal information and passwords
  to further protect your account information.</p>

  <p>We recommend that you do not divulge your password to anyone.  DNS Park
  will never ask you for your password in an unsolicited phone call, or via
  an unsolicited email.  Also remember to log out of your DNS Park account and   close your browser window when you have finished your work.  This is to
  ensure that others cannot access your personal information and
  correspondence if you share a computer with someone else or are using a
  computer in a public place like a library or Internet cafe.</p> 
  <p>Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet or any wireless
  network can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive
  to protect your personal information, DNS Park cannot ensure or warrant the
  security of any information you transmit to us or from our online services,
  and you do so at your own risk. Once we receive your transmission, we make
  our best effort to ensure its security on our systems.</p>
