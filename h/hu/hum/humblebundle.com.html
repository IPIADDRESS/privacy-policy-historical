We may require proof of or need to verify your identity before we can give effect to these rights.</p>
  </div>
</div>

<p>You may directly take steps to change your preferences as follows:</p>
<p><em>Access to Your Personal Information.</em> Upon request Humble Bundle will provide you with information about whether we hold any of your personal information. You may access, correct, or request deletion of your personal information by logging into your account or contacting us through our <a href="https://dsar.humblebundle.com/" target="_blank">DSAR Portal</a>.  We will respond to your request within a reasonable timeframe.
</p>

<p><em>Your Newsletter and Email Subscriptions.</em> You can opt out or unsubscribe to a newsletter or other email list at any time by following the instructions at the end of the newsletters or emails you receive. Please allow five to ten business days for changes to take effect. On some parts of the Service, member service-related communications are an integral part of such Services to which you subscribe and you may continue to receive emails as part of that particular portion of the Services unless you cancel your account, even if you opt out of the newsletters or email list.  If you have provided more than one email address to us, you may continue to be contacted unless you request to unsubscribe each email address you have provided.</p>

<p><em>Push Notifications.</em> We send you push notifications from time-to-time in order to update you about any events or promotions that we may be running. If you no longer wish to receive these types of communications, you may turn them off by adjusting the permissions in your mobile device.  Please note that your opt out is limited to the device used and will not affect subsequent subscriptions or non-promotional communications, such as those about your account, transactions, servicing or Humble Bundle's ongoing business relations.</p>

<p><em>Mobile Applications.</em> There are a variety of tracking technologies that may be included in mobile applications, and these are not browser-based like cookies and cannot be controlled by browser settings. Some use device identifier, or other identifiers such as "Ad IDs" to associate app user activity to a particular app and to track user activity across apps. You can stop all collection of information via our mobile applications by uninstalling them. Also, you may be able to exercise specific privacy choices, such as enabling or disabling certain location-based services, by adjusting the permissions in your mobile device (which is usually located in the Settings area of your device).</p>

<p><em>Unlinking your Humble Bundle Account from Third Party Services.</em>  If you have linked your Humble Bundle account with certain third party services, such as Steam, Twitch, or Battle.net, you may unlink your accounts at any time by visiting your Humble Bundle account settings. Please note that unlinking your accounts will not affect any information previously shared through the linking, and Humble Bundle may continue to use and share that information in accordance with this Privacy Policy. Humble Bundle is not responsible for any third party data practices, and we recommend that you carefully review their online policies. Steam (which is owned and operated by Valve Corporation) has a privacy policy available <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/privacy_agreement/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

Please be aware that, even if you are able to opt out of certain kinds of interest-based advertising, you may continue to receive other types of ads. Opting out only means that those selected members should no longer deliver certain interest-based advertising to you, but does not mean you will no longer receive any targeted content and/or ads (e.g., from other ad networks). Humble Bundle is not responsible for effectiveness of, or compliance with, any third-parties' opt-out options or programs or the accuracy of their statements regarding their programs.</p>

<p><em>Cookies and Pixel Tags.</em> You may stop or restrict cookies and pixel tags on your computer or purge cookies from your browser by adjusting your web browser preferences. However, if you "turn off," purge, or disable cookies or pixel tags, although you may still use the Services, you may not be able to use all of the features, functions, or services available on the Services.</p>

<p><em>California Residents.</em> In accordance with the California Online Privacy Protection Act, we may collect Personal Information about your online activities when you use the Services. While we give our users many avenues to opt out of providing Personal Information, we do not respond to Web browsers' "do not track" signals. California's "Shine the Light" law, Civil Code Section 1798.83, permits our users who are California residents to periodically request and obtain certain information about any Personal Information disclosed to third parties for direct marketing purposes. If you are a California resident and wish to make such a request or if you wish for us to refrain from gathering your Personal Information, please submit your request in writing to the contact details set out in Section 17 below.</p>

<p><em>EU Residents.</em> GDPR provides certain rights for EU residents. You may decline to share certain information with us, in which case we may not be able to provide some of the features and functionality of the Services. These rights include, in accordance with applicable law, the right to object to or request the restriction of processing of your information, and to request access to, rectification, erasure and portability of your own information. Where we process your information on the basis of your consent, you have the right to withdraw that consent (noting that such withdrawal does not affect the lawfulness of any Processing performed prior to the date on which we receive notice of such withdrawal, and does not prevent the Processing of your Personal Information in reliance upon any other available legal bases).  Requests should be submitted by contacting us using the <a href="https://dsar.humblebundle.com" target="_blank">DSAR Portal</a>. If you are an EU resident and have any unresolved privacy concern that we have not addressed satisfactorily after contacting us, you have the right to contact the appropriate EU Supervisory Authority and lodge a complaint.</p>
