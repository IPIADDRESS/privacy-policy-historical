<h3>Personal Information</h3>

<p>At Humana Inc., and our wholly owned subsidiaries, we are very aware of the privacy concerns of our customers and others who visit the Humana Website. In fact, we share your concerns. Humana will not solicit personal information from you as you browse our site, though you may provide that information voluntarily. If you do elect to provide personal information to us, in no case will we sell, license, or transmit that information outside of Humana Inc. for any reason, unless you authorize us to do so.</p>
<p>There are instances in which Humana Inc. might use the personal information you voluntarily submit internally. These instances include identifying and registering you for the password-protected area of our Website. In addition, we may disclose your personal information – as described below – to our agents, third-party partners, affiliates, and subsidiaries to enable them to perform certain functions for us. We may also use your Secret Prompt, Secret Response, and birth date in case you forget or misplace your password. By learning a little about you, Humana can deliver more relevant content and product offerings in an effort to provide you with better service.</p>
<p>Personally identifiable information is data that is unique to an individual, such as a name, address, telephone number, Social Security number, and date of birth (DOB). At times, we may request personal information from you through our Websites so we can deliver materials you requested, respond to your questions, or deliver a product or service. Members, providers, employers, business partners, and agents have the ability to register for access to the secured area of our Website. For the secured Website, you may need to provide additional information such as organization names, addresses, group numbers, and tax identification numbers. The purpose of the registration is to validate members, providers, employers, business partners, and agents requesting access to our secured area. Registration also enables us to tailor the information you receive. We use contact forms only to deliver materials you request and respond to your questions.</p>
<p>By providing an e-mail address, you are indicating that publications can be sent to your e-mail address. You are not required at any time to submit your e-mail address for the purpose of receiving recurring informational or promotional e-mails from Humana Inc. or third parties. To opt out of receiving publications by e-mail, call a Customer Care representative using the toll-free number on your Humana ID card or indicate your preference on our Website.</p>
<p>When you log in to the secured section of our Website, you have the option to change your password and e-mail address. In case you forget or misplace your password, we will use your secret prompt and secret response to identify you before you can regain access to the site. To change your personally identifiable information, call Customer Care using the toll-free number on your member ID card.</p>
<p>We also collect information about you and your use of our site through the use of "cookies." Cookies are small computer files that we transfer to your computer's hard drive. Cookies grant you access to both secured and unsecured areas and are only used for session tracking. Cookies are required to gain access to the secured areas of our site. Access to these secured areas will not be granted if the cookie is rejected. This Website's cookies are not tied to personally identifiable information.</p>
<p>Information that is automatically logged for the purpose of producing reports containing hit volumes are: Query String, Status, Bytes Sent, User-Agent (Browser Type), and Cookie Referrer.</p>
<p>Personally identifiable information provided to Humana may be subject to disclosure to judicial or other government subpoenas, warrants, or orders.</p>

<h3>Internal Security Procedures</h3>
<p>Information that you share with us is kept strictly confidential and fully secure. Your encrypted (encoded) information is protected using "Secure Socket Layers (SSL)" as it passes between your browser and the Humana Inc. servers. Only authorized persons are permitted to access your personal information. All authorized persons must abide by security, privacy, and confidentiality agreements.</p>

					<div class="module dashed"><div class="content">
<h3>E-mail</h3>
<p>If you send questions, comments, and a job inquiry to an e-mail address on this Website, we will share your correspondence with a Customer Care representative or the associate most capable of addressing your questions and concerns. We will retain your communication until we have done our very best to provide you with a complete and satisfactory response. Ultimately, we will either discard your communication or, in some cases, archive it. We will not keep your e-mail address for secondary purposes.</p>
<p>All information and correspondence you share with us will be handled in the strictest confidence.</p>
<p>Please note that the e-mail addresses on the unsecured areas of our Website – meaning areas that don't require a password – do not provide the same level of security as secured e-mail. For that reason, please do not use unsecured e-mail to communicate information to us that you consider to be confidential. Secured messaging is available in the password-protected areas of our Website, including <i>My</i>Humana. Once you log in, you can use this feature to communicate confidential or private information to us.</p>
