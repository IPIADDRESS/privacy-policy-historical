<h3>Personal Information</h3>

<p>At Humana Inc., and our wholly owned subsidiaries, we are very aware of the privacy concerns of our customers and others who visit the Humana.com web site. In fact, we share your concerns. Humana will not solicit personal information from you as you browse our web site, though you may provide that information voluntarily. If you do elect to provide personal information to us, in no case will we sell, license, or transmit that information outside of Humana for any reason, unless you authorize us to do so.</p>
<p>There are instances in which Humana might use the personal information that you voluntarily submit internally. These instances include identifying and registering you for the secured area of the Humana web sites. In addition, we may disclose your personal information – as described below – to our agents, third-party partners, affiliates, and subsidiaries to enable them to perform functions on our behalf. These functions may include order or service fulfillment, e-mail campaign provider, and/or credit card processing service. These companies are only permitted to share, store and/or use personally identifiable information for contracted business purposes. </p>
<p>We may also use your security question and response, and birth date in case you forget or misplace your password. By learning a little about you, Humana can deliver more relevant content and product offerings in an effort to provide you with better service.</p>
<p>Personally identifiable information is data that is unique to an individual, such as a name, address, telephone number, social security number, and date of birth (DOB). At times, we may request personal information from you through our web site so that we can deliver materials you requested, respond to your questions, or deliver a product or service.</p>
<p>Members, medical providers, employers, business partners, and agents have the ability to register for access to the secured area of our web site. To access the secured web site, you may need to provide additional information such as organization names, addresses, group numbers, and tax identification numbers. The purpose of the registration process is to validate members, medical providers, employers, business partners, and agents requesting access to our secured area. Registration also enables us to tailor the information you receive.</p>
<p>By providing an e-mail address, you are indicating that publications can be sent to your e-mail address. You are not required at any time to submit your e-mail address for the purpose of receiving recurring informational or promotional e-mails from Humana Inc. or third parties. To opt out of receiving publications by e-mail, call the Customer Care representative using the toll-free number on your Humana member identification card or indicate your communications preferences within the secured portion of the Humana.com web site.</p>
<p>When you log in to the secured section of the web site, you have the option to change your password, e-mail address, security question and response and communication preferences. In case you forget or misplace your password, we will use your security question and response to identify you before you can regain access to the site. To change your personally identifiable information, call Customer Care using the toll-free number on your Humana member identification card.</p>

<h3>Technology Use on the Humana.com Web Site</h3>

<p>Humana collects information about you and your use of our web site through the use of session cookies. Session cookies are small text files that are stored within your computer's temporary memory. These temporary files are used to facilitate your navigation throughout the web site. Cookies grant you access to both secured and unsecured areas and are only used for session tracking. Cookies are required to gain access to the secured areas of our web site. Access to these secured areas will not be granted if the cookie is rejected. This web site's cookies are not tied to personally identifiable information. Information that is automatically logged for the purpose of producing reports containing hit volumes are: Query String, Status, Bytes Sent, User-Agent (Browser Type), and Cookie Referrer.</p>
<p>As is true of most web sites, Humana gathers certain information automatically and stores that information within our web site log files.  This information includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data.</p>
<p>We use this information, which does not identify individual users, to analyze trends, to administer the web site, to track users’ movements around the site and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole.  We do not link this automatically-collected data to personally identifiable information.</p>
<p>Humana may use a third-party tracking service that uses cookies, web beacons and log files to track non-personally identifiable information about visitors to our site in the aggregate.</p>
<p>Personally identifiable information provided to Humana may be subject to disclosure to judicial or other government subpoenas, warrants, court order or any other legal process. Humana reserves the right to disclose the personally identifiable information that was provided by you, as required by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on our web site.</p>

<h3>Internal Security Procedures</h3>
<p>Information that you share with Humana is kept strictly confidential and fully secure. Your encrypted (encoded) information is protected using "Secure Socket Layers (SSL)" as it passes between your browser and the Humana Inc. servers. We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it.  No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however.  Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. Only authorized persons are permitted to access your personal information. All authorized persons must abide by security, privacy, and confidentiality agreements.</p>
</div></div>
				
							
	
	
				
					<div class="module dashed"><div class="content">
<h3>E-mail</h3>

<p>If you send questions, comments, and a job inquiry to an e-mail address on this web site, we will share your correspondence with a Humana associate most capable of addressing your questions and concerns. We will retain your communication until we have done our very best to provide you with a complete and satisfactory response. Ultimately, we will either discard your communication or, in some cases, archive it. We will not keep your e-mail address for secondary purposes. All information and correspondence you share with us will be handled in the strictest confidence.</p>
<p>Please note that the e-mail addresses on the unsecured areas of our web site (unlike those areas that require a sign-on and are password-protected) do not provide the same level of security as secured e-mail. For that reason, please do not use unsecured e-mail to communicate information to us that you consider to be confidential. Secured messaging is available within the secured portion of this web site, including <i>My</i>Humana. Once you log in, you can use this feature to communicate confidential or private information to Humana.</p>

<p>This Internet Privacy Statement is effective as of July 2000 and was last updated in September 2009. This Internet Privacy Statement is not intended to and does not create any contractual or other legal rights in or on behalf of any party.  If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes to this Internet Privacy Statement, the home page, and other places we deem appropriate so that you are aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it.  Humana reserve the right to modify this privacy statement at any time, so please review it frequently.</p>
