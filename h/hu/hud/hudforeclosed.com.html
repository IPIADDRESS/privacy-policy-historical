<p><strong>Privacy Statement:</strong><br>
We have developed this Privacy Policy to inform you  of the data gathering and dissemination practices applicable to 

our web site  (Site). By visiting, registering or using services obtained through our Site,  you agree to the terms of this 

Privacy Policy.&nbsp;  If you do not agree with any terms of this Policy, please do not use or  submit any personal information 

to this Site.</p>
<p><strong>HUDforeclosed.com Privacy Pledge:</strong> We do not collect any personal information from you that 

you do not volunteer, and we are the sole owner of all information collected on this site. We fully disclose our privacy 

policy in this document. If you have any questions or comments, you are invited to <a href="/contact-us.html">contact 

us</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Information We Collect:</strong><br>
We collect Personally Identifiable Information when you register to use this Site; when you use, participate or purchase 

products and services through this Site; and when you ask to be provided additional services.  The type of personal 

information that we collect may include full name, email, telephone number, address, payment information, profession, 

company name, company website address, business telephone number and photo. This personal information is 

generally required if you wish to enroll or participate in our services. We may use, sell or distribute certain individual 

personal information to other companies, including related interests or vendors so as to provide you with important 

offers. We may keep all information collected in accordance with this Privacy Policy indefinitely.</p>
<p><strong>Personally Identifiable Information:</strong><br>
Personally Identifiable Information refers to any information that can be used to identify you as an individual in any way. 

Enrollment in any HUDforeclosed.com service is contingent upon your agreeing to the Terms and Conditions of 

membership and providing Personally Identifiable Information as described above.</p>
<p><strong>Anti-SPAM Policy:</strong><br>
The HUDforeclosed.com marketing program has a strict policy regarding unsolicited email. Because email is an 

integral part of our services, your signup ensures that you'll receive information relative to your interests at the time of 

your enrollment from HUDforeclosed.com. If you later wish to cease participation in this portion of our services, you 

may do so at any time by clicking the unsubscribe link or button found within such message.</p>
<p>Please note that opting not to receive email does not exempt you from receiving administrative and informational 

emails from us, which include but are not limited to, notices about membership status changes and alterations to our 

Terms.</p>
<p><strong>Aggregate Data:</strong><br>We may, from time to time, contact you regarding opportunities that may 

be of interest to you. In that process, we may use a third party service provider to manage our database and 

communication system in order to send that correspondence to you on our behalf. If you respond to a communication 

to take advantage of an offer you may see or receive, you share your Personally Identifiable Information with a third 

party. From time to time, we do share non-personally identifiable information collected in aggregate, anonymous form 

with third parties so that they may better evaluate what products and services are most appealing to different segments 

of our member base.</p>
<p><strong>Automatically Collected Information:</strong><br>
When you log on to our Site, our server may automatically recognize you by an encrypted member key, also referred 

to as a "cookie." This cookie acts as a unique identifier.</p>
<p>We may use third party cookies and clear pixels (also referred to as "web beacons") to measure page views and 

email responses. These devices allow us to identify unique visitors to our Site and act as a counter for ongoing 

monitoring of Site, email and corresponding future transaction activity related to a specific offer.</p>
<p><strong>Third-Party Websites and Services:</strong><br>
We are not responsible or liable for the content or data practices of any third-party site, including those of our 

advertisers, affiliates, partners, or vendors. We recommend that you read the privacy policy of all third-party sites 

carefully before sharing your Personally Identifiable Information with them.</p>
<p>Occasionally, you may be offered the opportunity to participate in an offer or service that, by its very terms, will 

require us to forward your Personally Identifiable Information to the advertiser or partner so that they can provide the 

service to you.  As always, it is your choice to participate.</p>
<p>We do not guarantee the content or information practices of any third-party site. You alone are responsible for 

determining the appropriateness of sharing your Personally Identifiable Information with our advertisers.</p>

<p>We have your consent to share collected personally identifiable information (including email addresses) with third parties for commercial purposes, such as advertising. </p>

<p><strong>Communication:</strong><br>We are available to you during normal business hours to answer any 

privacy-related questions or concerns you might have. Simply <a href="/contact-us.html">contact us</a> and we will 

respond in a timely manner.</p>
<p>You sign up for our marketing program when you submit the information on the first page of our sign-up process, 

and our marketing partners or we may contact you via email with offers we think you will like. We have a strict Anti-

SPAM policy, and you may unsubscribe at any time while still participating in our services.</p>
<p>We do not collect or use any information about you for marketing purposes, except for information that you have 

provided to us or authorize us to obtain, or is publicly available, and this information is used solely to make our 

programs and services more relevant to your interests.</p>
<p><strong>Security:</strong><br>
HUDforeclosed.com has established company-wide  security policies and practices designed  to protect your and 

others information from unauthorized intrusion. These  practices include, but are not limited to, firewall security, the use 

of  appropriate encryption technology, and the use of multiple levels of password  security. All HUDforeclosed.com 

employees are required to familiarize themselves  with, and abide by, these safeguards. &nbsp; However,  please note that 

no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be  100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect 

your personal information,  we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us  or from our 

online products or services, and you do so at your own risk. Our  policy does not extend to anything that is inherent in 

the operation of the Internet,  and therefore beyond our control, and is not to be applied in any manner  contrary to 

applicable law or governmental regulation. </p>
<p><strong>A Special Note Regarding Individuals Under 18 Years Old:</strong><br>The Site is not directed to 

individuals under the age of eighteen (18), and we request that such individuals not provide personal information 

through the Site. If you are under 18 years of age, you may browse our Site; however, you may not provide personal 

information to us such as name, address, or email address, and you may not register for, enroll in, and/or make 

product purchases.</p>
<p><strong>CHANGE IN BUSINESS OPERATIONS:</strong><br>
Please note that if HUDforeclosed.com  or any lines of its business are sold or disposed of as a going concern,  

whether by merger, liquidation, sale of assets or otherwise, its customer  database could, in whole or in part, be sold 

or otherwise transferred to a  third party as part of that transaction. There may be instances when we may  disclose 

your information without providing you with a choice in order to protect  our legal rights or those of our affiliates, or those 

of our or our affiliates'  employees, agents and contractors; to protect the safety and security of  visitors to our web sites; 

to protect against fraud or for risk management  purposes; or to comply with the law or legal process.</p>
<p><strong>International Visitors:</strong><br>
Your information may  be transferred to, stored and processed in the United States or any other  country where we 

have facilities, and by providing us with your information,  you consent to the transfer, storage and processing of such 

information outside  of your country.</p>
<p><strong>Your California Privacy Rights:</strong><br>
  Pursuant to Section 1798.83 of the California Civil Code, residents of California have the right to request from a 

business, with whom the California resident has an established business relationship, certain information with respect 

to the types of personal information the business shares with third parties for those third parties direct marketing 

purposes and the identities of the third parties with whom the business has shared such information during the 

immediately preceding calendar year. To exercise your rights, you may make one request each year by US Mail at 

3835 R East Thousand Oaks Blvd #431 Westlake Village, CA 91362 Please  include your name and the address to which you would like us to respond. </p>
