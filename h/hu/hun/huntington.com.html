The collection of this Aggregate Information enables us to measure the number of visitors to various portions of the Site, diagnose problems with our Site, administer the Site, and track visitor activity.

                  <br>Cookies or other similar technologies may be used to gather information. Cookies are electronic files that your internet browser places on your hard drive to retain information relating to visits to and use of a website. We use cookies to improve the functionality of our Site. We do not use cookies to store or transmit Personal Information. We use cookies to enable our customers to navigate more easily within our Site during an online session. We use "persistent" cookies to allow you to set and maintain your preferences for using our Site. Persistent cookies remain on your computer's memory after you close your internet browser.</p>
               <p xmlns:o="urn:www.microsoft.com/office" xmlns:st1="urn:www.microsoft.com/smarttags" xmlns:w="urn:www.microsoft.com/word">We also use 1x1 pixel "action tags," which are types of tracking technology associated with cookies. Action tags help us know how many visitors link to our Site from a third-party website, which areas of our Site visitors use most often, and how much time visitors spend at our Site. We provide this type of Aggregate Information to a nonaffiliated application service provider that compiles statistical information for us. Collection of this data enhances Huntington's ability to meet the needs of online users and make improvements to the online experience.</p>
               <p xmlns:o="urn:www.microsoft.com/office" xmlns:st1="urn:www.microsoft.com/smarttags" xmlns:w="urn:www.microsoft.com/word">We engage third party advertising companies to serve ads on Huntington's behalf across the internet. Huntington is not providing, and these companies do not collect, your Personal Information. These companies may use behavioral information obtained from action tags, such as how you navigate websites, to provide Huntington advertisements to you. In addition, we may engage these companies to track and report performance of advertising and marketing campaigns to and from Huntington. These companies may not use your behavioral information for any purpose other than to deliver Huntington ads on the internet.</p>
