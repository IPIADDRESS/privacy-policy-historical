<p><em><strong><a name="otherinformation" id="otherinformation"></a></strong>Other Uses of Information</em><br>
We may use the personal information you provide on the Sites for our internal purposes. These purposes include administration of the Sites, data analytics and compliance with our legal obligations, policies and procedures.</p>
<p><em><strong><a id="personalinfoautomated" name="personalinfoautomated"></a>Personal Information We Collect by Automated Means</strong></em><br>
We collect certain information by automated means when you visit our Sites, such as how many users visited our Sites and the pages accessed. By collecting this information, we learn how to best tailor the Sites to our visitors. We may collect this information through various means such as “cookies” and “web beacons,” as explained below.</p>
<p><em><strong><a name="cookies" id="cookies"></a></strong>Cookies</em><br>
Like many companies, some of our Sites may use “cookies.” Cookies are bits of text that are placed on your computer’s hard drive when you visit certain websites. We may use cookies to tell us, for example, whether you have visited us before or if you are a new visitor and to help us identify site features in which you may have the greatest interest. Cookies may enhance your online experience by saving your preferences while you are visiting a particular site.</p>
<p>Most browsers will tell you how to stop accepting new cookies, how to be notified when you receive a new cookie, and how to disable existing cookies. Please note, however, that without cookies you may not be able to take full advantage of all our Site features.</p>
<p><em><strong><a name="webbeacons" id="webbeacons"></a></strong>Web Beacons</em><br>
Certain pages on our Sites may contain “web beacons” (also know as Internet tags, pixel tags and clear GIFs). These web beacons allow third parties to obtain information such as the IP address of the computer that downloaded the page on which the beacon appears, the URL of the page on which the beacon appears, the time the page containing the beacon was viewed, the type of browser used to view the page, and the information in cookies set by the third party.</p>
<p><em><strong><a name="ipaddresses" id="ipaddresses"></a></strong>IP Addresses</em><br>
An IP address is a unique identifier that certain electronic devices use to identify and communicate with each other on the Internet. When you visit our Sites, we may view the IP address of the device you use to connect to the Internet. We use this information to determine the general physical location of our website visitors. We also may use this information to enhance our Sites.</p>
<p><em><strong><a name="sharedinformation" id="sharedinformation"></a></strong></em><strong>Information We Share</strong><br>
We do not sell, rent, trade or otherwise disclose personal information visitors submit through our Sites, except as described in this Privacy Notice. We may share the information with service providers we have retained to perform services on our behalf (for example, to process online registration forms for events or to administer our blogs). These service providers are not authorized by us to use or disclose the information except as necessary to perform services on our behalf or to comply with legal requirements. In addition, we may disclose information about you (i) if we are required to do so by law or pursuant to legal process, (ii) in response to a request from law enforcement authorities or other government officials, or (iii) when we believe disclosure is necessary or appropriate to prevent physical harm or financial loss or in connection with an investigation of suspected or actual illegal activity.</p>
<p>We reserve the right to transfer any information we have about you in the event we sell or transfer all or a portion of our business or assets. Should such a sale or transfer occur, we will use reasonable efforts to try to require that the transferee use personal information you have provided through this website in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Notice.</p>
<p><em><strong><a id="links" name="links"></a></strong></em><strong>Links to Other Sites</strong><br>
Occasionally we provide links to other websites for your convenience and information. These websites operate independently from our Sites and are not under our control. These sites may have their own privacy notices or terms of use, which we strongly suggest you review if you visit any linked websites. We are not responsible for the content of these sites, any products or services that may be offered through these sites, or any other use of the linked sites.</p>
<p><em><strong><a name="howweprotect" id="howweprotect"></a></strong></em><strong>How We Protect Personal Information</strong><br>
