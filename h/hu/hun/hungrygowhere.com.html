			<p>HungryGoWhere has provided this Privacy Policy because we value your right to privacy. This policy is effective as of 1 November 2006 and governs the collection of personal information through this website on or after this date. </p>
                <p>This policy describes the types of information HungryGoWhere collects from its users and how that information is used. Please read this policy carefully before providing us with any personal information. If you have questions about this policy, e-mail us at contact@hungrygowhere.com. </p>
              <p><span class="font_subtitle">Information we collect </span><br>
                    <strong>Unregistered Users</strong><br>
                If you do not register with us, then the information we collect from you is limited. We log your IP address in order to help diagnose problems with our server, administer our Web site and track usage statistics.</p>
              <p>We also place a small file known as a "cookie" on your computer's hard drive. A cookie may contain information that allows us to track your path through our Web site and to determine whether you have visited us before. However, unless you register with us, it contains no personally identifiable information that would allow us to identify you. You may refuse to accept a cookie from us by following the procedures specific to your Web browser. </p>
              <p>If you visit our site by "clicking-through" from a site operated by one of our partners, and you have registered with that partner, then certain information about you that you have provided to that partner may be transmitted to us. You should review the privacy policy of the Web site from which you reached our site in order to determine what information was collected and how you agreed that our partner could use that information. Regardless of what information was transmitted to us, however, we don't keep it unless you register with us.</p>
              <p><strong>Registered Users</strong><br>
                If you choose to register with us, you'll be able to add content to our site. For example, you may post your own reviews and participate in our discussion forums. You will also be able to email HungryGoWhere content to yourself and others. In addition, you will benefit from the ability to personalize your HungryGoWhere site experience.</p>
              <p>We will collect personal information from you in addition to the non-personal information described above. That personal information may include your name, email address, mailing address, telephone number, dining preferences, user name and password. The information we collect may vary, but we only collect the information that you manually enter into our forms. We may store all or some of that information in a cookie file on your hard drive, so that our system will recognize you each time you visit our site. In that way, we can save your preferences from visit to visit and present you with a customized Web site, without requiring you to log into our site every time you visit. To improve services and enhance personalization, we may periodically obtain information about you from other independent third-party sources and add it to your registration information. Additionally, authorized HungryGoWhere personnel may update your registration information to accurately reflect any new information included in communications received from you. </p>
              <p>If you visit our site by "clicking-through" from a site operated by one of our partners, and you have registered with that partner, then certain information about you that you have provided to that partner may be transmitted to us. You should review the privacy policy of the Web site from which you reached our site in order to determine what information was collected and how you agreed that our partner could use that information. We may or may not retain that information; if we do, then we will only use it in accordance with our privacy policy, regardless of the policy of the partner site from which you came to us. </p>
              <p>If you reach our site through one of our partners (whether or not you have registered with our partner), and you choose to register with us, we may be required to give our partner some or all of your registration information. We will only do so in accordance with this policy, but we cannot control how our partner uses the information. If you have questions about our partner's privacy policy, you should review their policy before providing information to us. Of course, you can ensure that the personal information you provide to us is not shared with our partners (except in accordance with this policy), by visiting us directly instead of clicking-through from one of our partners. </p>
              <p><span class="font_subtitle">How we use the personal information we collect </span><br>
                We use the personal information we collect to help both of us! As we mentioned above, registering with us allows you to personalize our Web site so that it is most useful to you.  We may also use this information to periodically contact you with news or important information from HungryGoWhere or to request your feedback on our site. In addition to these periodic updates, we may email you additional materials, but only if you specifically request them. </p>
              <p> In addition to these communications, if you have provided an email address, we may use your personal information to send you notifications about special offers or to tell you about opportunities available from our partners. You may opt-out of any or all marketing communications from HungryGoWhere in any commercial e-mail we send or at any time, as well as access and update your personal information, by visiting http://www.hungrygowhere.com and logging into your profile. </p>
              <p>You can cancel your registration with us by e-mailing cancel@HungryGoWhere.com, and placing your email address in the subject of the e-mail. We will send you an e-mail to confirm your request. After we receive confirmation, we will remove your information from our active database, but some information may remain in our archives. We may not be able to remove your information from our partners' databases, if we have transmitted any information to them. </p>
              <p><span class="font_subtitle">Disclosure of your personal information</span><br>
                HungryGoWhere does not sell or rent any personal information to any third party, other than our partners, as discussed in this policy. We may aggregate personal information from all of our users and provide that information in the aggregate to other parties, including advertisers, for marketing and promotional purposes. However, if we do so, that information will not be in a form that will allow any third party to identify you personally.</p>
              <p><span class="font_subtitle">How you can review and update your personal information</span><br>
                You can review and update the personal information you have provided through our website http://www.hungrygowhere.com and logging into your profile. </p>
              <p><span class="font_subtitle">Steps we take to protect your personal information</span><br>
                HungryGoWhere has implemented security procedures to help protect the personal information stored in our systems. For example, we limit access to personal information about you to employees who we believe reasonably need to come into contact with that information. We also employ processes to protect against unauthorized access to your personal information. </p>
              <p><span class="font_subtitle">Changes to this privacy policy </span><br>
                We reserve the right to change this policy should we deem it advisable to do so. If we make material changes that will affect personal information we have already collected from you, we will make reasonable efforts to notify you of the changes and to give you the opportunity to amend or cancel your registration.</p></td>
