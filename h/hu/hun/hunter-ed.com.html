		<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
		<div class="group">
			<div class="primary">
				<p><strong>Hunter Ed</strong> is committed to protecting the privacy of its users. Because <strong>Hunter Ed</strong> gathers information about the users that choose to take the online state certification exams, we believe you should fully understand the terms and conditions surrounding the use of the information we collect. This privacy statement discloses what information we gather and how we use it. Please review the following policy to understand how the information you provide <strong>Hunter Ed</strong> will be treated.</p>
				
				<h2>Information We Collect</h2>
				<p>First, we only collect specific information on those users who choose to take the online certification exam.</p>
				<p>You are free to visit the hunter safety course pages, take the Chapter Review quizzes and take the Practice Test without identifying yourself. However if you opt to take the Certification Exam, we will request certain personal information, including your name, birthday, gender, city and state, e-mail address and, if required by the state, Social Security Number. This information is required by the state agencies responsible for hunter safety to issue your hunter safety certification card. In addition, you will be required to pay for the Certification Exam by supplying a valid credit card number, expiration date and name.</p>
				
				<h2>What Hunter Ed Does with the Information We Collect</h2>
				<p>The personal information you supply to <strong>Hunter Ed</strong> will not be disclosed outside of <strong>Hunter Ed</strong>, except to securely transfer the personal data to the agency in your state which is responsible for hunter safety in order to issue your hunter education certificate. Your credit card information will be used only for processing your fee(s) related to taking the online certification exam.</p>
				<p><strong>Hunter Ed</strong> will not use the personal information we collect for any other purpose other than to help you obtain your hunter safety certification.</p>
				<p> The online hunter safety courses on this site contain links to other sites. <strong>Hunter Ed</strong> is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such Web sites; however, we make our best effort to only provide links to reputable sites with acceptable content. Please remember that any information that is disclosed in these other sites may become public information and you should exercise caution when deciding to disclose your personal information.</p>

				<h2>With Whom Information Is Shared</h2>
				<p>We do not share, sell or otherwise distribute information about individual users taking the online hunter safety exam with any third party, or any outside companies or organizations except the agency in your state which is responsible for hunter safety.</p>

				<h2>Security</h2>
				<p>All of your personal and credit card information is collected using SSL (Secure Socket Layer) which allows your information to be securely transferred to us using Verisign Secure Server Digital ID. Hunter Ed has been approved by VeriSign to protect your credit card and other confidential information with industry leading SSL encryption. The VeriSign Secured Seal is a trust mark available for display on any website that protects its customers' confidential information using VeriSign services. After collection, your information is then stored on our servers at a location designed specifically to ensure that no unauthorized individuals have access to the server or its data.</p>

				<h2>Children and privacy</h2>
				<p><strong>Hunter Ed</strong> encourages parents and guardians to spend time with their children online, and to be familiar with the sites their children visit. <strong>Hunter Ed</strong> fully complies with the Federal Trade Commission's COPPA Act Children's Online Privacy Protection Act and follows state guidelines for compliance for each state hunter education course we offer.</p>
