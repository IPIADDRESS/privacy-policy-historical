If you are an European Economic Area (EEA) resident, please note that we process your Personal Information to the extent necessary to carry out our legitimate business purposes and interests as listed above or otherwise, unless we are required by law to obtain your consent to process your Personal Information in a specific way, in which case we will rely on any consent obtained from you in order to carry out that processing. Depending on how you use our Services, processing of your Personal Information may also be necessary in order for us to fulfil contractual obligations to you (such as where you have placed an order with us), and we will rely on this as the basis for carrying out that processing. We may also process your Personal Information in order to comply with a legal obligation, protect your vital interests, or as may be required of us for the public good.
</p>
<p>
When Personal Information is disclosed by us to our related entities or third parties as listed above, Personal Information will only be disclosed to that party to the extent necessary for the disclosure purpose identified in the list above to be carried out by that party.
</p>
<p>
Where we determine it is commercially viable to do so, we will attempt to carry out any of the above listed purposes without using Personal Information or by de-identifying Personal Information first, so that an individual cannot be recognised by that information.
</p>
<p>
Except where retention is required by law, we will take reasonable steps to de-identify or destroy any Personal Information where it is no longer needed for the purposes provided for in this policy.
</p>
<h3>
Other Information &amp; Third Parties
</h3>
<p>
Whilst you are using our Services, we, our advertisers, business partners and other third parties may also collect and hold other information by using cookies or other technologies. Cookies allow tracking and storage of information about your use of the internet and our Services either directly or through third parties, such as Google Analytics.
</p>
<p>
In some cases, you can choose not to provide us with information by setting your browser to refuse cookies, however this may restrict your ability to fully interact with our Services. Where cookies are not mandatory in order for our Services to be provided, we will request your consent to our use of cookies when you first use our Services.
</p>
<p>
Cookies are used by us for various reasons including to:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>store your username and password for any account you hold with us on a device so you do not have to re-enter it;</li>
    <li>generate statistical information and reports about your use of the internet and our Services;</li>
    <li>to understand your interests, demographic and location details to provide you with a more customised experience when using our Services;</li>
    <li>to personalise advertising to suit your interests and prevent the same advertisement appearing to you repeatedly; and</li>
    <li>to combine information about your usage patterns with similar information obtained from other users to help enhance our Services (e.g. to learn which pages are visited most or what features are most attractive).</li>
</ol>
<p>
We may also implement other technologies to obtain information for reasons similar to those above. This information may occasionally be shared with our advertisers and business partners, but this does not include Personal Information. However, please note that we cannot control or be responsible for the use of cookies or other technologies implemented by third parties.
</p>
<p>
Comments, promotional offers, blogs, advice, opinions or any other content or website that is created or hosted by a third party, but is accessed by you via our Services (through embedding, hyperlink or otherwise), may be subject to that third party’s own privacy and data collection policies and practices which may vary from our own.
</p>
<p>
If you voluntarily disclose Personal Information via a publicly accessible feature of our Services (such as a message board), you do so at your own risk, as this information may be publicly available around the world and third parties may access and use this Personal Information to send you unsolicited material or otherwise use your Personal Information in a manner we cannot control.
</p>
<p>
You may interact with third parties in connection with our Services. Any services or content provided by a third party may be subject to that party’s own privacy and data collection policies and practices which may vary from our own.
</p>
<p>
Please do not provide us with Personal Information of a third party unless requested by us. If you provide us with Personal Information about a third party, you warrant that you have the consent of that third party to provide that Personal Information.
</p>
<p>
We may use automated decision making or profiling technologies from time to time. This is to allow us to show you content or marketing which is more personalised. If you are an EEA resident, please note that these technologies will not be used in a way that would have a significant effect on you, unless such use is necessary to fulfil a contractual obligation we have to you, your consent to such use has been obtained or we are required to use those technologies in that manner by law.
</p>
