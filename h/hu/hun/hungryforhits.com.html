    <p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size:22px"><span style="font-family:verdana,geneva,sans-serif"><strong>2. The Information We Collect:</strong></span></span></p>
    
<p>We collect different types of information from or through the Service. The legal bases for Hungry For Hits' processing of personal data are primarily that the processing is necessary for providing the Service in accordance with Hungry For Hits' Terms of Service and that the processing is carried out in Hungry For Hits' legitimate interests, which are further explained in the section "How We Use the Information We Collect" of this Policy. We may also process data upon your consent, asking for it as appropriate when needed.</p>
<p><strong>2.1 User-provided Information</strong>. When you use the Service, as a User or as a Visitor, you may provide, and we may collect Personal Data. Examples of Personal Data include name, physical address, phone number, email address, payment processor address. Personal Data also includes other information, such as a timestamp and geographic area or preferences, when any such information is linked to information that identifies a specific individual. You may provide us with Personal Data in various ways on the Service. For example, when you register for an Account, use the Service, post Client Data, interact with other users of the Service through communication or messaging capabilities, or send us customer service-related requests.</p>
<p><strong>2.2 "Automatically Collected" Information</strong>. When a User or Visitor uses the Service, we may automatically record certain information from the User's or Visitor's device by using various types of technology, including cookies, "clear gifs" or "web beacons". This "automatically collected" information may include IP address or other device address or ID, web browser and/or device type, the web pages or sites visited just before or just after using the Service, the pages or other content the User or Visitor views or interacts with on the Service, and the dates and times of the visit, access, or use of the Service. We also may use these technologies to collect information regarding a Visitor or User's interaction with email messages, such as whether the Visitor or User opens, clicks on, or forwards a message. This information is gathered from all Users and Visitors.</p>
<p><strong>2.3 Integrated Services</strong>. You may be given the option to access or register for the Service through the use of your user name and passwords for certain services provided by third parties (each, an "Integrated Service"), such as through the use of your Facebook account, or otherwise have the option to authorize an Integrated Service to provide Personal Data or other information to us. By authorizing us to connect with an Integrated Service, you authorize us to access and store your name, email address(es), date of birth, gender, current city, profile picture URL, and other information that the Integrated Service makes available to us, and to use and disclose it in accordance with this Policy. You should check your privacy settings on each Integrated Service to understand what information that Integrated Service makes available to us, and make changes as appropriate. Please review each Integrated Service's terms of use and privacy policies carefully before using their services and connecting to our Service.</p>
<p><strong>2.5 Information from Other Sources</strong>. We may obtain information, including Personal Data, from third parties and sources other than the Service, such as our partners, advertisers, credit rating agencies, and Integrated Services. If we combine or associate information from other sources with Personal Data that we collect through the Service, we will treat the combined information as Personal Data in accordance with this Policy.</p>
<br>

    <p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size:22px"><span style="font-family:verdana,geneva,sans-serif"><strong>3. How We Use the Information We Collect</strong></span></span></p>
    
<p>We use the information that we collect in a variety of ways in providing the Service and operating our business, including the following:</p>

<p><strong>3.1 Operations</strong>. We use the information - other than Client Data - to operate, maintain, enhance and provide all features of the Service, to provide the services and information that you request, to respond to comments and questions and to provide support to users of the Service. The site administrator may log in to your account at any time. We process Client Data solely in accordance with the directions provided by the applicable Client or User.</p>

<p><strong>3.2 Improvements</strong>. We use the information to understand and analyze the usage trends and preferences of our Visitors and Users, to improve the Service, and to develop new products, services, feature, and functionality. Should this purpose require Hungry For Hits to process Client Data, then the data will only be used in anonymized or aggregated form.</p>

<p><strong>3.3 Communications</strong>. We may use a Visitor's or User's email address or other information - other than Client Data - to contact that Visitor or User (i) for administrative purposes such as customer service, to address intellectual property infringement, right of privacy violations or defamation issues related to the Client Data or Personal Data posted on the Service or (ii) with updates on promotions and events, relating to products and services offered by us and by third parties we work with. You have the ability to opt-out of receiving any promotional communications as described below under <strong>"Your Choices."</strong></p>

<p><strong>3.4 Cookies and Tracking Technologies</strong>. We use automatically collected information and other information collected on the Service through cookies and similar technologies to: (i) personalize our Service, such as remembering a User's or Visitor's information so that the User or Visitor will not have to re-enter it during a visit or on subsequent visits; (ii) provide customized advertisements, content, and information; (iii) monitor and analyze the effectiveness of Service and third-party marketing activities; (iv) monitor aggregate site usage metrics such as total number of visitors and pages viewed; and (v) track your entries, submissions, and status in any promotions or other activities on the Service. You can obtain more information about cookies by visiting <a href="http://www.allaboutcookies.org/" target="_blank">http://www.allaboutcookies.org</a>.</p>

<p><strong>3.5 Security</strong>. Upon registration and each login your IP address and a timestamp is recorded. We use this information to provide our services and features to you, to improve those services, and to provide you with customer support. Recording the timestamp is absolutely essential for the protection of user accounts because without the timestamps of login attempts, it is impossible to identify password guessing attempts targeting specific user accounts and to take action to protect those accounts. We also gather statistics on how many ads you view, how many prizes you win or what earnings you make.</p>

<p><strong>3.6 Analytics</strong>. We use Google Analytics to measure and evaluate access to and traffic on the Public Area of the Site, and create user navigation reports for our Site administrators. Google operates independently from us and has its own privacy policy, which we strongly suggest you review. Google may use the information collected through Google Analytics to evaluate Users' and Visitors' activity on our Site. For more information, see <a href="https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/6004245" target="_blank">Google Analytics Privacy and Data Sharing</a>.</p>
<p>We take measures to protect the technical information collected by our use of Google Analytics. The data collected will only be used on a need to know basis to resolve technical issues, administer the Site and identify visitor preferences; but in this case, the data will be in non-identifiable form. We do not use any of this information to identify Visitors or Users.</p>
<br>

    <p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size:22px"><span style="font-family:verdana,geneva,sans-serif"><strong>4. To Whom We Disclose Information</strong></span></span></p>

<p><strong>4.3 Non Personally Identifiable Information</strong>. We may make certain automatically-collected, aggregated, or otherwise non-personally-identifiable information available to third parties for various purposes, including (i) compliance with various reporting obligations; (ii) for business or marketing purposes; or (iii) to assist such parties in understanding our Clients', Users' and Visitors' interests, habits, and usage patterns for certain programs, content, services, and/or functionality available through the Service.</p>

<p><strong>4.4 Law Enforcement, Legal Process and Compliance</strong>. We may disclose Personal Data or other information if required to do so by law or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with applicable laws, in response to a facially valid court order, judicial or other government subpoena or warrant, or to otherwise cooperate with law enforcement or other governmental agencies.</p>

<p><strong>4.5 Change of Ownership</strong>. Information about Users and Visitors, including Personal Data, may be disclosed and otherwise transferred to an acquirer, successor or assignee as part of any merger, acquisition, debt financing, sale of assets, or similar transaction, as well as in the event of an insolvency, bankruptcy, or receivership in which information is transferred to one or more third parties as one of our business assets and only if the recipient of the User or Visitor Data commits to a Privacy Policy that has terms substantially consistent with this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>Client Data may be physically or electronically transferred to an acquirer, or successor or assignee as part of any merger, acquisition, debt financing, sale of assets, or similar transaction, as well as in the event of an insolvency, bankruptcy, or receivership in which information is transferred to one or more third parties as one of our business assets, for the sole purpose of continuing the operation of the Service, and only if the recipient of the Client Data commits to a Privacy Policy that has terms substantially consistent with this Privacy Policy.</p>

Please note that while any changes you make will be reflected in active user databases instantly or within a reasonable period of time, we may retain all information you submit for backups, archiving, prevention of fraud and abuse, analytics, satisfaction of legal obligations, or where we otherwise reasonably believe that we have a legitimate reason to do so.</p>
<p>You may decline to share certain Personal Data with us, in which case we may not be able to provide to you some of the features and functionality of the Service.</p>
<p>At any time, you may object to the processing of your Personal Data, on legitimate grounds, except if otherwise permitted by applicable law. If you believe your right to privacy granted by applicable data protection laws has been infringed upon, please contact Hungry For Hit's Data Protection Officer at <a href="mailto:hungryforhits@gmail.com">hungryforhits@gmail.com</a>.
