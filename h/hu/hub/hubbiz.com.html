<p><strong></strong>The information which the Company collects through the Website may include personally identifiable information (“<strong>Personal Information</strong>”) which refers to information that helps it identify users or viewers of the Website (collectively, “<strong>Users</strong>” and each a “<strong>User</strong>”).&nbsp; The Personal Information includes data such as a User’s name, street address, phone number, facsimile number, email address, username and password, demographic information about the User such as his age and/or gender, and/or any information submitted by a User that is a business for purposes of creating or maintaining a business profile on the Website.&nbsp; Personal Information shall also include any other information submitted by the User to the Website including, without limitation, where the User is the owner of a business, any information he submits to the Website for purposes of verifying and/or claiming its business on the Website.&nbsp; In addition, the Company may collect and store information relating to the User’s geographic location, which shall also be included in “Personal Information.” Users are responsible for keeping all Personal Information current and may change any previously entered information through the Website in the manner set forth below.</p>
<p>The Website may also collect data that cannot be traced back to a specific individual (“<strong>Anonymous Information</strong>”).&nbsp; For example, the Company may be able to keep count of how many Users have viewed the Website and specific content therein, key words utilized to find the Website or key words utilized to search within the Website, but this information does not necessarily include information regarding Users’ names, street addresses, phone numbers or email addresses.&nbsp; Users who view Website but do not enter their Personal Information are generally anonymous Users.&nbsp; Only Anonymous Information will be intentionally collected by the Company from anonymous Users.</p>
<p>The Website may use browser cookies to collect Anonymous Information.&nbsp; The Website may also incorporate web beacons or similar tracking technologies to allow the Company to track how the Website is used.&nbsp; Such technologies are used to collect Anonymous Information, e.g. the name of the User’s internet service provider, the IP address of the User’s computer, User’s browser software and operating system, the identity of any linked-form or linked-to website and other similar information.</p>
<p>The Company may combine a User’s Anonymous Information with similar information collected from other Users to help improve the Website and the Company’s products and services.&nbsp; Advertisers advertising on or through the Website, if any, may have access to Anonymous Information for purposes of determining how often a User sees a particular advertisement.</p>
