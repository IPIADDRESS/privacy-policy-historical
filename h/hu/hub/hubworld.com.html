</p><h2>WELCOME!</h2>
<br>
<p></p>
<p>Welcome to <a href="http://www.hubworld.com">www.hubworld.com</a> ("Hubworld"), a Hasbro, Inc. ("Hasbro") website that brings you the coolest information about The Hub!
</p>
<p>
Hasbro respects the privacy rights of its online visitors and is committed to providing you with a secure online environment. We have adopted an online privacy policy ("Privacy Policy") that guides how we collect, store and use the information you provide us online through Hubworld.
</p>
<p>
This Privacy Policy only covers information that is collected online through Hubworld. This Privacy Policy <span style="font-weight:bold;">does not</span> cover information that may be collected through other Hasbro websites or through offline methods. 
</p>
<p>
Also, please note that this Privacy Policy applies to Hubworld, as operated by Hasbro from its offices within the State of Rhode Island, United States of America, and not to Web sites operated by other companies or organizations to which we may link. When you link to any other sites from Hubworld, this policy no longer applies, and Hasbro does not control the activities of those sites.
</p>
<p>
If you have questions or concerns regarding this Privacy Policy, you should first contact the Website Administrator at <a href="mailto:hasbroregistration@hasbro.com">hasbroregistration@hasbro.com</a>.
</p>
<p>
</p><h3 style="padding-bottom:4px;">What information does Hasbro collect?</h3><p></p>
<p>
Hasbro does not collect any personal information from you through Hubworld. Hasbro uses cookies and clear GIFs to enhance your experience on Hubworld. These cookies and clear GIFs let us know how many people are coming to Hubworld, how frequently, and how they are using Hubworld, allowing us to make updates to content and improve navigation as appropriate. 
</p>
<p>
</p><h3 style="padding-bottom:4px;">How will this information be used?</h3>
<p></p>
<p>
<span class="showtitle">Cookies and Clear GIFs</span><br>
Cookies are pieces of information that we place on your computer to help us accurately understand how many consumers are visiting Hubworld, how often they visit Hubworld, and what content they are most interested in. For example, a cookie will allow us to remember certain things based on your Internet Protocol or "IP" address (an IP address is the string of numbers that identifies each sender or receiver of information that is sent across the Internet), such as the time and duration of your visits, how you navigated through our content and where you exited Hubworld. We do not use cookies to retrieve information from your computer that we did not originally send in a cookie. 
Clear GIFs, sometimes called "Web bugs," are file objects, usually a graphic image such as a transparent one pixel-by-one pixel GIF (Graphics Interchange Format, one of the two most common file formats for images on the Web), that are placed on a Web page to monitor user behavior. The GIF tells us the IP address of the computer that fetched our page, the URL of the page the GIF is on, the time the page was viewed, the type of browser used, and can tell us a previously set cookie value. This anonymous information is returned by the clear GIF to Hasbro and we use this information to accurately count visitors to Hubworld and understand how they navigate and use Hubworld. 
</p>
<p>
<span class="showtitle">Log Files</span><br>
Other information passively collected by Hasbro is in the form of logs - files that record website activity and gather statistics about web users' browsing habits. These entries are generated anonymously, and help Hasbro determine (among other things) how many and how often users have visited Hubworld, which pages they've visited, and other similar data. We also use the log file entries for our internal marketing and demographic studies, so we can constantly improve the online services we provide you. Log files are used internally only, and are not associated with any particular user, computer, or browser.
</p>
<p>
<span class="showtitle">Linking to third party sites and other Hasbro sites</span><br>
To provide you with information not found on Hubworld that we think you may be interested in, Hasbro may provide links to third party Web sites or to other Hasbro sites (such as, for example, Hasbro.com). Hasbro will notify users when they are leaving Hubworld. Your use of third party Web sites is subject to the third partiesâ€™ privacy policies, which may be different from this Privacy Policy. For this reason, we encourage you to read the third party sites' privacy policies before submitting personal or other information or using applications on these third party sites.
</p>
<p>
Please note that, while Hasbro also operates Web sites such as Hasbro.com and HasbroToyShop.com, these other Hasbro Web sites have different practices and policies regarding how they collect and use information from you through those sites. Your use of these other Hasbro Web sites is subject to the privacy policies found on those other Hasbro sites, which may be different from this Privacy Policy. For this reason, we encourage you to read the privacy policies of these other Hasbro Web sites before submitting personal or other information or using applications on these other Hasbro Web sites.
</p>
<p>
<span class="showtitle">Questions and Complaints</span><br>
Any questions or complaints about Hubworld or this Privacy Policy can be addressed by contacting us at <a href="mailto:support@hubworld.com">support@hubworld.com</a>.
</p>
<p>
If we decide to change our Privacy Policy, we will post those changes to this Privacy Policy page, the home page, and other places we deem appropriate so that you are aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it.
</p>
<p>
We reserve the right to modify this Privacy Policy at any time, so please review it frequently. If we make material changes to this Privacy Policy, we will notify you here, by e-mail, or by means of a notice on our home page. For additional information about our Web site, please see our Terms and Conditions of Use.
