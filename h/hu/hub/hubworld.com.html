	<p>Hasbro, Inc. is a licensee of the TRUSTe Web and Children's Online Privacy Seal Program. TRUSTe is an independent, non-profit organization whose mission is to build user's trust and confidence in the Internet by promoting the use of fair information practices. This privacy statement covers the Web sites <a href="http://www.hubworld.com">www.Hubworld.com</a>, www.Hasbro.com, www.HasbroToyShop.com and other promotional sites that have this privacy statement linked from it (the "Hasbro Web sites"). Because these Web sites want to demonstrate their commitment to your privacy, they have agreed to disclose their information practices and have their privacy practices reviewed for compliance by TRUSTe.</p>
	<p>If you have questions or concerns regarding this statement, you should first contact the Website Administrator at <a href="mailto:support@hubworld.com" target="_blank">support@hubworld.com</a> (for Hubworld.com related questions) or <a href="mailto:hasbroregistration@hasbro.com" target="_blank">hasbroregistration@hasbro.com</a> (for Hasbro.com or HasbroToyShop.com related questions). If you do not receive acknowledgment of your inquiry or your inquiry has not been satisfactorily addressed, you should contact TRUSTe at <a target="_blank" href="http://watchdog.truste.com/pvr.php?page=complaint&amp;url=">http://watchdog.truste.com/pvr.php?page=complaint&amp;url=</a>. TRUSTe will then serve as a liaison with us to resolve your concerns.</p>
	<p>The TRUSTe Web and Children's Online Privacy programs only covers information that is collected through the Hasbro Web sites, and <strong>does not</strong> cover information that may be collected through any software downloaded from these Web sites. In addition, this Privacy Policy applies only to the information that Hasbro collects online, not offline.</p>
	<p>Please note that this Privacy Policy applies only to the Hasbro Web sites, as operated by Hasbro from its offices, which are located within the State of Rhode Island, United States of America ("US"), and not to Web sites operated by our international affiliates (e.g., Hasbro UK) or other companies or organizations to which we link. When you link to any other sites from the Hasbro Web sites, this policy no longer applies and Hasbro does not control the activities of those sites.</p>

		<big><strong>What information does Hasbro collect?</strong></big>
	</div>
	<div>
		<p>In order to give you the most exciting Internet experience possible, Hasbro may request and/or collect information from you on a voluntary basis when you: (1) register with us; (2) shop at any of our online stores (when available); (3) participate in contests, events or promotions; (4) send questions or comments via e-mail to Hasbro customer support; (5) submit your resume to us online; and/or, (6) fill out online surveys. The requested information may include personal information such as your name, e-mail address, telephone number, and home address. For some activities, we may also ask you to create a password and to provide demographic information such as your age, the gender and birthdates of children in your household, and toy and game ownership and preferences. If demographic information is collected for an activity that also requires personal information, we may combine the demographic information with your personal information. This allows us to tailor the notices we send you and the content we provide you according to your preferences and interests.</p>
		<p>If you are under the age of 13, only your parent or guardian can provide any personal information to us for purposes of registration and other online activities. Kids, if you are ever unsure about anything you are seeing on this site, ask your parent or guardian for help. See <a href="#note-to-parents">Note To Parents</a> below for more information.</p>
		<p><strong>Registration</strong></p>
		<p>If you wish to register with one of our sites or register a Hasbro product, you may be asked to supply personal information such as your full name, e-mail address, and (in the case of product registration) mailing address. We may also ask you to provide demographic information such as your birthdate, gender, the birthdates and genders of children in your household, the postal code and country in which you live, and information on products you own or of interest to you. Hasbro uses such information to periodically contact you with product information news, special offers and relevant announcements (including service announcements) and to provide other exclusive benefits to those who register their products on our sites.</p>
		<p><strong>Online Store</strong></p>
		<p>In the event we provide an online store, visitors purchasing goods and services through such store will need to provide a valid credit card number and expiration date, in addition to name, mailing address, phone number and e-mail address.</p>
		<p><strong>Promotions/Contests</strong></p>
		<p>To participate in some of our promotions, you may be asked to provide an e-mail address or screen name, so that we can let you know if you won a prize. Please do not use your real name for these promotions. For other Hasbro promotions, we may request your name and home address in order to send you products or information by regular mail. All promotions on the Hasbro Web sites are administered by Hasbro. Your personal information is not shared with any third parties, except with entities who use it solely to provide support for the operations of the Hasbro promotion/contest.</p>
		<p><strong>E-mail</strong></p>
		<p>By allowing you to send e-mail to us, we are not attempting to collect any personal information about you. We will only use personal information (such as name, mailing address and e-mail address) contained in your e-mail to respond to your specific inquiry or comments in the e-mail. Although we may retain your e-mail for a period of time, we will not use any personal information contained in your e-mail for any purpose other than responding to your specific inquiry or comments.</p>
		<p>By allowing you to send postcards or pages to friends, we are not attempting to collect any personal information about you or the person you are e-mailing. We will use the personal information supplied (such as your friend's name and e-mail address) only to send the postcard or page as you request and allow the recipient to respond to you. This is a one-time e-mail initiated by the user of the site and this information is not stored or used by Hasbro, other than to execute the e-mail.</p>
		<p><strong>Resumes</strong></p>
		<p>Some of our sites allow for the online submission of resumes. Personal information collected from resumes is not subject to this Privacy Policy. However, we can assure you that such information will be used solely for the purpose of accepting and evaluating candidate submissions for job postings.</p>
		<p><strong>Online Surveys</strong></p>
		<p>In order to improve the user experience at our Web sites, we may employ online surveys for visitors to volunteer anonymous demographic information about themselves and provide us feedback about why they visit our sites and what we can do to make them better. Information collected through these surveys is anonymous; we cannot identify who is submitting the information or tie it to other personally identifiable information a user may have provided us through another means.</p>
		<p>Whatever the activity may be, we will only collect information to the extent deemed reasonably necessary to fulfill your requests and our legitimate business objectives. If you do not want to submit personal information when requested, you will not be able to access certain areas on our site. However, you do not need to provide personal information to Hasbro in order to use our Web sites.</p>
	</div>
</div>

<div>
	<div>
		<big><strong>Who is collecting my information and how will it be used?</strong></big>
	</div>
	<div>
		<p>Hasbro collects the personal information you provide on our sites. We will use the information you submit to our Web sites to send you advertising or promotional materials, including information about new products, contests, features and enhancements, special offers and other events of interest. We also use your personal information for our internal marketing and demographic studies, so we can constantly improve the products and services we provide you and can better meet your needs.</p>
		<p>The demographic information (e.g., age and gender) you provide us is collected by Hasbro and may be disclosed in aggregate to third parties. This aggregate demographic information cannot be used to personally identify you or your computer.</p>
	</div>
</div>

<div id="personal">
	<div>
		<big><strong>With whom does Hasbro share my personal information?</strong></big>
	</div>
	<div>
		<p>From time to time, Hasbro may employ and share its customers' personal information (including that of children under 13) with entities who use it solely to provide support for the internal operations of the Hasbro website (e.g., online product fulfillment, online registration and email services, or technical support). These entities will not use your personal information for any other purpose, and have agreed to maintain the confidentiality, security, and integrity of the personal information they obtain from us.</p>
		<p>Similarly, some of our support provider entities may collect your personal information directly, such as when applying for a job through our Careers section or when submitting photos and/or videos for posting. In these instances, even though the pages where you enter your personal information have the look and feel of the Hasbro Web site, the support provider will be prominently identified by a "Powered by" logo. The Hasbro privacy statement will apply to personal information you submit to these third party sites. These entities will not use your personal information for any purpose other than that stated when you submit the information, and have agreed to maintain the confidentiality, security, and integrity of the personal information they obtain from you.</p>
		<p>We may disclose personal information (including that of children under 13) in the good faith belief that we are required to do so by law, including but not limited to disclosure to law enforcement or other government officials in connection with an investigation of fraud, intellectual property infringements, or other activity that is illegal or may expose you or us to legal liability.</p>
		<p>Hasbro does not sell, rent, or otherwise disclose personal information collected from and about its users (including children under 13) to third parties for promotional purposes. However, in the event of a merger, acquisition, reorganization, bankruptcy, or other similar event, Hasbro's customer information may be transferred to Hasbro's successor or assign, if permitted by and done in accordance with applicable law. Please see our "Questions and Complaints" section below for instructions on how we will notify you of such an event.</p>

<div id="cookies">
	<div>
		<big><strong>Cookies and Clear GIFs</strong></big>
	</div>
	<div>
		<p>Hasbro uses cookies and clear GIFs to enhance your experience at our Web sites. These cookies and clear GIFs let us know how many people are coming to individual sites, how frequently, and how they are using the sites, allowing us to make updates to content and improve navigation as appropriate.</p>
		<p>Cookies are pieces of information that we place on your computer to help us accurately understand how many consumers are visiting a particular site, how often they visit that site, what content they are most interested in, and how they prefer to shop for our products. For example, a cookie will allow us to remember certain things, such as your Internet Protocol or "IP" address (an IP address is the string of numbers that identifies each sender or receiver of information that is sent across the Internet), your login information, the time and duration of your visits, how you navigated through our content and where you exited a particular site. To save you the time of re-entering your login information every time you come back to our Web sites, Hasbro may link information contained in a cookie to your email address (including that of registered children under 13). We do not use cookies to retrieve information from your computer that we did not originally send in a cookie.</p>
		<p>Clear GIFs, sometimes called "Web bugs," are file objects, usually a graphic image such as a transparent one pixel-by-one pixel GIF (Graphics Interchange Format, one of the two most common file formats for images on the Web), that are placed on a Web page or in an e-mail message to monitor user behavior. The GIF tells us the IP address of the computer that fetched our page, the URL of the page the GIF is on, the time the page was viewed, the type of browser used, and can tell us a previously set cookie value. This anonymous information is returned by the clear GIF to Hasbro and we use this information to accurately count visitors across multiple Hasbro sites and understand how they navigate and use our network of sites. Hasbro does not combine information gathered through clear GIFs with your personal information.</p>

	<div><big><strong>Flash LSOs</strong></big></div>
	<div>
		<p>Third parties with whom we partner use local shared objects, also known as Flash cookies, to store display content based upon what you view on our site(s) to personalize your visit and to provide certain features on our site(s).</p>
		<p>Flash cookies are different from browser cookies because of the amount of, type of, and how data is stored. Cookie management tools provided by your browser will not remove Flash cookies.

<div>
	<div><big><strong>Log Files</strong></big></div>
	<div>
		<p>Other information passively collected by Hasbro is in the form of logs - files that record website activity and gather statistics about web users' browsing habits. These entries are generated anonymously, and help Hasbro determine (among other things) how many and how often users have visited our Web sites, which pages they've visited, and other similar data. We also use the log file entries for our internal marketing and demographic studies, so we can constantly improve the online services we provide you. Log files are used internally only, and are not associated with any particular user, computer, or browser.</p>
	</div>
</div>

<div>
	<div><big><strong>Linking to third party sites</strong></big></div>
	<div>
		<p>To provide relevant information not found on our Web sites, to facilitate online shopping, and to allow you to interact with other Web sites on which you may have accounts (such as Facebook and other social media sites), Hasbro may provide links or embed third-party applications that allow login from our Web sites to third party Web sites. Hasbro will notify users when they are leaving a Hasbro Web site or otherwise indicate that you will be going to a third-party's site. Your use of these Web sites and/or applications is subject to the third parties' privacy policies, and we encourage you to read the third party sites' privacy policies before submitting personal or other information or using the applications.</p>
		<p>To provide users with the ability to comparison shop and purchase online, Hasbro has affiliate relationships with some of our retail affiliates. We may use cookies and/or clear GIFs (described above) to track shopping behavior on our sites and on our retail affiliates' sites. No personally identifiable information is tied to this shopping behavior. Tracking this behavior helps us better understand user preferences and plan product listings with our affiliates.</p>
	</div>
</div>

<div>
	<div><big><strong>Opt-out</strong></big></div>
	<div>
		<p>If you do not want Hasbro to send you e-mail or regular mail about our products and/or services, you can opt-out at the time of registration or at the time of information collection. If you are receiving e-mails or regular mail and at a later date you choose to opt-out and have your name removed from Hasbro's e-mailing list, you can do so by using the link included with a Hasbro e-mail or by sending an e-mail to <a href="mailto:hasbroregistration@hasbro.com" target="_blank">hasbroregistration@hasbro.com</a>.</p>
		<p>Please note that "welcome" and service e-mail communications are not promotional in nature and, therefore, an opt-out is not provided. These are simply to notify the user of a service they recently signed up for or to notify the user of Web site issues.</p>

		<p>Hasbro has developed its Web sites to be an enjoyable experience for children (and adults) of all ages.

Please discuss this statement with your children so that they will better understand how to use the sites and the information they may be asked to provide. Hasbro strongly believes that providing its visitors with accurate and adequate notice about the Hasbro Web sites will lead to informed choices and decisions about how to use the site, as well as protect its users' privacy.

		<big><strong>Children Under 13</strong></big>
	</div>
	<div>
		<p><strong>Collection and Use of Children's Personal Information</strong></p>
		<p>Hasbro may collect and store personal information about children under 13 ("children" or "child") if it is submitted by the parent or guardian in connection with any of our website registrations. To determine who is younger than 13 years old and whether parental consent is required, we ask all users who wish to register to submit their date of birth. Those users that indicate they are less than 13 years of age are taken through a parental consent process. If provided by the parent or guardian, Hasbro may collect and store the following types of personal information about a child under 13: name, email address, parent's or guardian's name, and parent's or guardian's email address. Hasbro may also collect the child's mailing address when necessary to fulfill a transaction, such as sending the winner of a contest or sweepstakes the awarded prize. Hasbro may also collect demographic information about a child such as the child's date of birth, gender, and other preferences; and, combine such information with the child's personal information. Hasbro will only collect this information if it is voluntarily submitted to us by the child's parent or guardian. For information on how we use cookies and other information collection tools, please see our section on <a href="#cookies">"Cookies and Clear GIFs"</a> (above).</p>
		<p>Once collected, a child's registration information may be used to: (a) fulfill a transaction, such as sending the winner of a contest or sweepstakes the awarded prize and, (b) allow us to send the child requested promotional materials, including information about new products, contests, features and enhancements, special offers, and other events of interest (e.g., Birthday Club e-mails). We may also use the information for our internal marketing and demographic studies, so that we can constantly improve the products and services we provide our visitors and to better meet their needs.</p>
		<p>Please note that we are prohibited from conditioning a child's participation in an activity - like contests - on the child's disclosure of more personal information than is reasonably necessary to participate in the activity. This means that if we don't need a specific piece of information (like the child's phone number) to allow the child to participate in a contest, we simply won't ask for it. To read about the steps Hasbro takes to protect the confidentiality, security, and integrity of children's personal information, please see our section on <a href="#safeguarding">"Safeguarding your personal information"</a> (above).</p>
