  </li><li>We do not use your email address, mobile number or any other personally identifiable information to send commercial or marketing messages without your consent or except as part of a specific program or feature for which you will have the ability to opt-in or opt-out. We may, however, use your email address without further consent for non-marketing or administrative purposes (such as notifying you of major Hubdub.com changes or for customer service purposes). <br>

Hubdub.com does not have access to or control of the cookies that may be placed on the computer of any Member or other user of the Hubdub.com website by the third-party ad servers or ad networks. </p>
