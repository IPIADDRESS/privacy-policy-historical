                  <p>Except where permitted or required by law, personal information 
                    will only be provided to third parties for the purposes of 
                    allowing them to provide goods or services to Husky. If any 
                    third party acts in a manner inconsistent with the principles 
                    in this Privacy Statement, this will be considered to be a 
                    serious issue for which appropriate action may be taken by 
                    Husky.
                  </p><p>Personal information may also be transferred to another company

                    an agreement under which the collection, use and disclosure 
                    of the information is protected. Personal information may 
                    also be disclosed by and between Husky affiliates in the course 
                    of their business activities. <br>

                    and technical security with respect to its operations so as 
                    to prevent any loss, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure, 
                    or modification of your personal information. <br>
                    <br>
                    Personal information will be retained by Husky for as long 
                    as Husky believes it is necessary to fulfill the purpose for 
                    which it was collected and as required by applicable laws. 
                    Husky has records management protocols that outline the procedures 
                    for the retention and destruction of Husky records, including 
                    personal information. <br>
                    <br>
                    Where permitted or required by law, Husky will allow you to 
                    access and review your personal information held by Husky.

                    <br>
                    <u>(c) Consent</u><br>
                    <br>
                    Husky has developed this Privacy Statement to inform you of 
                    its practices regarding the collection, use and disclosure 
                    of personal information about you and to ensure that Husky 
                    has your consent to its personal information practices. If 
                    at any time you do not consent to our practices as set out 
                    in this Privacy Statement, you may refuse to provide your 
                    personal information to Husky. Alternatively, you may withdraw 
                    your consent to Husky's collection, use and disclosure practices 
                    regarding your personal information, subject to applicable 
                    legal, contractual or regulatory restrictions and to reasonable 
                    notice to Husky. Unless you contact Husky to refuse or withdraw 
                    your consent, Husky assumes that you have consented to Husky's 
                    collection, use and disclosure practices as set out in this 
                    Privacy Statement.
                  </p><p>If you do refuse or withdraw your consent, this may affect 
                    certain aspects of your relationship with Husky, including 
                    being eligible for certain payments, benefits, goods or services 
                    provided by Husky, to the extent the personal information 
                    affected by the refusal or withdrawal of your consent was 
                    necessary to process such payments or benefits or provide 
                    such goods or services. Further, certain personal information 
                    is collected, used and disclosed by Husky as a result of legal, 
                    contractual, or regulatory requirements, and your general 
                    ability to withdraw or refuse to consent to the collection, 
                    use or disclosure of your personal information by Husky does 
                    not imply or confer upon you the right to withdraw or refuse 
                    your consent where to do so would interfere with such legal, 
                    contractual or regulatory requirements. Finally, where permitted 
                    or required by law, Husky may collect, use or disclose personal 
                    information without your consent. <br>
