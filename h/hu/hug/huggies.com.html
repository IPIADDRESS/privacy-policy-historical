						<p><span class="text">This web site is owned and operated by Kimberly-Clark 
						Corporation. Here at Kimberly-Clark, we recognize that many visitors to our site 
						are concerned about the information they provide and how we treat that 
						information. Our Privacy Policy addresses those concerns. We may update the 
						Policy from time to time, so please check in occasionally. Regulations enacted 
						in April 2000 under the U.S. Children's Online Privacy Protection Act give 
						children under 13 years of age greater privacy protection online. Please see our 
						policy under <a class="lyr" href="#children">"Children"</a> below. 
						</span></p><p><span class="text"><b>Our Policy</b></span> 
						</p><p>At our site, we don't collect personally identifiable information from you 
						unless you provide it to us voluntarily and knowingly. You can visit our sites 
						without telling us who you are or revealing information about yourself. However, 
						if you specifically agree to provide us with identifiable information, such as 
						by asking to be put on our mailing list, we may contact you from time to time. 
						</p><p>There are some features of our site that require you to sign up to use. And 
						if you do sign up, we use the information you supply for the purpose of 
						providing the products, product information or services you request. Because of 
						the volume of requests we receive, however, we may have to give your name, 
						e-mail and postal addresses to a fulfillment house or distributor of our 
						products who partner with us. On our behalf our partners will provide you with 
						the information or products in which you expressed an interest. Our partners 
						have agreed to keep the personal information they receive from us confidential 
						and secure unless you have given your consent to it being shared with other 
						product manufacturers. 
						</p><p>Our site sometimes includes notices of sweepstakes or other promotions we are 
						conducting, and we may permit you to send your entry electronically in some 
						cases. If that occurs, we will use the information you provide for the purpose 
						of conducting the promotion (i.e., to contact you if you're a winner). 
						</p><p><span class="text"><a name="children"><b>Children</b></a></span> 
						</p><p>Children's privacy is of primary concern to us, and our Policy and practices 
						reflect applicable laws and regulations on children's privacy. We do not 
						knowingly collect personal information from children under 13 years of age. Any 
						communication we get that is identified as being from a child under 13 will not 
						be kept by Kimberly-Clark. 
						</p><p><span class="text"><b>Cookies</b></span> 
						</p><p>Like many companies, we sometimes use "cookie" technology on our web site. 
						These cookies are stored on your computer by your browser. When you log in, this 
						type of cookie tells us whether you've visited us before or are a new visitor. 
						The cookie doesn't obtain any personal information about you or provide us with 
						any way to contact you, and the cookie doesn't extract any information from your 
						computer. We do use the cookie to help us identify site features in which you 
						have the greatest interest, so that we can provide more of what you may want. 
						</p><p>We use the services of NetIQ/WebTrends to track the paths our customers take 
						through our site. In doing so, we are better able to see where our customers go 
						within our site and ensure our site is easy to navigate. If you have any 
						questions concerning NetIQ/WebTrends, then you should refer to the <a class="lyr" href="http://ondemand.webtrends.com/privacypolicy.asp" target="blank">NetIQ/WebTrends Reporting Service Privacy Policy</a> to learn how 
						they collect and use information, particularly the section of the Policy on 
						Privacy Statement for Visitors to Sites Tracked by WebTrends on Demand.
						</p><p>We use pixels, or transparent GIF files, to help manage online advertising. These 
						GIF files are provided by our ad management partner, DoubleClick. These files enable 
						DoubleClick to recognize a unique cookie on your Web browser, which in turn 
						enables us to learn which advertisements bring users to our website. The cookie 
						was placed by us, or by another advertiser who works with DoubleClick. With 
						both cookies and Spotlight technology, the information that we collect and 
						share is anonymous and not personally identifiable. It does not contain 
						your name, address, telephone number, or email address. For more information 
						about DoubleClick, including information about how to opt out of these
