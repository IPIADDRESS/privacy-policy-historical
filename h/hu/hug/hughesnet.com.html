        <p>Hughes reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to modify the terms of this Privacy Policy at any time. In the event of any material changes to the Privacy Policy, Hughes will provide notice over the Service that the Privacy Policy is being modified, and invite you to review the modified Privacy Policy at this Website. Your continued use of the Service after such notice constitutes your acceptance of the changes. You should visit this page to review the current Privacy Policy on a regular basis.

        <p><strong>Information Collection and Use</strong></p>

        <ul>
          <li>To enforce our Subscriber Agreement, Terms of Service, and/or other legal agreements;
          </li><li>To outsource any of the tasks referenced in this Privacy Policy (e.g., billing, responding to inquiries);
          </li><li>In response to a subpoena, court order, or other legal process;
          </li><li>To establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims;
          </li><li>To credit reporting agencies for reporting purposes or to obtain credit review services;*
          </li><li>To a company controlled by, or under common control with, Hughes for any purpose permitted by this Privacy Policy;

          </li><li>In the future, we may sell some or all of our assets or reorganize our corporate structure. In such transactions, customer information generally is one of the transferred business assets. In the event of a sale or reorganization of our assets, including our database, customer information may be transferred.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Notice Regarding Hughes’ Position on Child Pornography</strong></p>
        <p>Hughes takes its commitment to protect children from exploitation over the Internet extremely seriously. Consequently, Hughes is working hand-in-hand with the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC) and other law enforcement agencies on this important project. One of the efforts that Hughes has undertaken in this regard is to establish a specially designated email address, <a href="mailto:cp-abuse@hughes.net">cp-abuse@hughes.net</a>, for complaints about child pornography. Hughes further commits that all complaints received shall be investigated promptly, generally within three (3) business days or less. No Hughes facilities or services may be used by in any fashion for the transmission or dissemination of images containing child pornography.</p>
        <p><strong>Security</strong></p>
        <p>Hughes employs reasonable measures to protect your personal information against acquisition by unauthorized persons.</p>
        <p><strong>Questions</strong></p>
        <p>Please direct questions, concerns, or comments about this Privacy Policy to our email address at guest.services@hughes.com.</p>
        <p>*&nbsp;This provision will only apply if you subscribe to the HughesNet Service after the effective date of this revision as listed below, or if you are currently a HughesNet subscriber, it will only apply after October 1, 2015.</p>
