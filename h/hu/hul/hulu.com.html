<div style="width:845px;margin: 10px;color:#555;line-height:1.5">

<div class="section-header">Effective as of October 28, 2007</div>
<p>Hulu, LLC ("Hulu," "we" or "us") knows that you care how information about you is used and shared, and we appreciate your trust that we will do so carefully and sensibly. We take your privacy very seriously and make it a priority to protect personally identifiable information, such as your name, email address, mailing address and telephone number, that we obtain from and about individuals both online and off-line. Please take a moment to review this Privacy Policy ("Privacy Policy") which describes how Hulu collects, uses and shares such information.</p>
<p>Hulu provides an online video service offering a selection of television shows, movies, clips and other content (collectively, "Content") available on the <a href="http://www.hulu.com">Hulu.com</a> website (the "Hulu Site"), Hulu�s affiliate and distribution partner websites ("Distribution Sites"), and other websites where users may embed the Content (these websites, together with the Hulu Site and Distribution Sites, are referred to collectively as the "Sites"). Our video service, including the Content and our video player, and any other features, tools, applications, materials or other services offered from time to time by Hulu in connection with its business on any of the Sites are referred to collectively as the "Hulu Services." We are a website based in the United States.</p>
<p>By visiting the Hulu Site (whether or not you are a registered member) or using any of the Hulu Services on any of the Sites, you are accepting this Privacy Policy. If you do not want information about you to be used in the manner set forth in this Privacy Policy, please do not use the Hulu Services.</p>
<p>The Hulu Site is not intended for children under 13 years of age. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13 years of age.</p>

<div class="section-header"><a name="collect" class="anchor-title">Why does Hulu collect personally identifiable information about me?</a></div>
<p>Hulu collects personally identifiable information in order to establish and enhance our relationship with you. Also, it helps us deliver a first class user experience. When we collect personally identifiable information from you it is because you are voluntarily submitting the information to us in order to enjoy certain Hulu Services or because you want us to furnish you with certain content, services or information. We also may obtain personally identifiable information from reputable third parties.</p>

<div class="section-header"><a name="cookies" class="anchor-title">What are cookies, and how are they used to collect information?</a></div>
<p>Cookies are small bits of information placed on the hard drive of your computer. Cookies remember information about your activities on a website. For example, cookies can store your session for easy logon to a website you have previously visited. They enable us to make your visits to the Hulu Site more enjoyable. Information about your activities on the Hulu Site and other non-personally identifiable information about you may also be used to limit the online ads you encounter to those we believe are consistent with your interests.</p>
<p>Third party advertisements displayed in connection with the Hulu Services may also contain cookies set by internet advertisers. We do not control these cookies and users of the Hulu Services should check the privacy policy of the advertiser to see whether and how it uses cookies (for more information on this topic, please refer to the section titled "Are there other parties collecting information about me that I should be aware of while using the Hulu Services?").</p>
<p>We may use cookies and similar tools to relate your use of the Hulu Services to personally identifiable information obtained from you or a reputable third party, and to obtain anonymous aggregated data (as described below). For example, if you have asked us to send you information about our upcoming services or promotions, cookie or click stream data about your activities using the Hulu Services may allow us to limit the materials we send you to items that we think you will find interesting, based on your prior online activities and preferences.</p>
<p>You can program your computer to warn you each time a cookie is being sent or to refuse cookies completely. However, without cookies you will not have access to certain Hulu Services.</p>

<div class="section-header"><a name="aggregated" class="anchor-title">Do you collect anonymous aggregated data, and what do you do with it?</a></div>
<p>Anonymous data is information (originally personally identifiable or non-personally identifiable) that subsequently is used in aggregate form. We may use anonymous data for purposes of research or analysis. We may conduct research on our customer demographics, internet usage, and interests and behavior based on personal data we gather. Although anonymous data may be based in part on personal data, it does not identify you personally. Hulu may share this type of anonymous data with a variety of third parties, including its affiliates, advertisers and other current and prospective business partners.</p>
<p>We may use anonymous data collected for website administration, advertising and promotional purposes, and we may share such information with various affiliated and unaffiliated entities for such purposes. For example, IP addresses are used for the purposes of system administration and to provide anonymous aggregated data to advertisers about the volume of use on the Hulu Services. We may also enter into agreements with outside companies that possess the technology that allows us to customize the advertising and marketing messages you receive while using the Hulu Services. Your non-personally identifiable information and click stream data about your activities may be shared with these companies so this customization can be accomplished. Our agreement with these companies prohibits them from sharing your information with any third party or using it for any other purpose. Anonymous click stream and demographic information may also be shared with our advertisers and business partners.</p>

<div class="section-header"><a name="choice" class="anchor-title">Do I have a choice in how Hulu uses my personal information?</a></div>
<p>This Privacy Policy is our primary disclosure to you of when and how your information may be used. At times, however, we may choose or be required by law to provide you with additional notice. You will be given an opportunity to notify Hulu how it may use your personally identifiable information (for more information on specific uses for which you will have consent rights, please refer to the section titled �How does Hulu use my personally identifiable information?�). We will not use the personally identifiable information you provide to us for purposes inconsistent with this Privacy Policy, unless you have given us permission.</p>

<div class="section-header"><a name="use" class="anchor-title">How does Hulu use my personally identifiable information?</a></div>
<p>We will use the personally identifiable information you provide to us in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>If you have given Hulu consent, we may use your personally identifiable information to provide you with information about Hulu's features, services and other offerings that may be of interest to you. We also may send information or offers to groups of users on behalf of other businesses. When we do this, we do not give those businesses your name or address. Under certain circumstances (for example if you win a contest) we may post your personally identifiable information on the Hulu Site. However, we will notify you of this possibility when collecting personally identifiable information or we will obtain your consent.</p>
<p>If you have given Hulu consent, we may also share your personally identifiable information with advertisers, business partners, and other entities that are not affiliated with Hulu who would like to send you information about their products and services.</p>
<p>Hulu's employees, agents and contractors must have a legitimate business reason to obtain access to your personally identifiable information. We may share your personally identifiable information with companies that provide services to us, including outside contractors or agents who help us manage our information activities (for example, contest and sweepstakes administration). But they may only use your personally identifiable information to provide us with a specific service and not for any other purpose. Similarly, we may share your personally identifiable information with other people or entities in order to provide goods or services that you have requested or to complete a transaction at your request.</p>
<p>There may be instances when we may disclose personally identifiable information without providing you with a choice in order to protect the legal rights of Hulu or its affiliates, and each of their respective investors, directors, officers, employees, agents and suppliers; to protect the safety and security of users of the Hulu Services or to enforce our Terms of Use; to protect against fraud or for risk management purposes; or to comply with or respond to the law or legal process, whether or not legally required. If you submit a Notice of Copyright Infringement pursuant to the Terms of Use, we will send a copy to the person or entity who uploaded, stored or transmitted the material addressed by the communication. If we sell all or part of our business, or make a sale or transfer of assets, or are otherwise involved in a merger or business transfer, we may transfer your personally identifiable information to a third party as part of that transaction.</p>

<div class="section-header"><a name="secure" class="anchor-title">Is the personal information collected about me secure?</a></div>
<p>We use reasonable administrative, technical, personnel and physical measures to safeguard personally identifiable information in our possession against loss, theft and unauthorized use, disclosure or modification. For example, passwords and other sensitive information are encrypted in transit.</p>

<div class="section-header"><a name="other" class="anchor-title">Are there other parties collecting information about me that I should be aware of while using the Hulu Services?</a></div>
<p>The Hulu Services may be linked to internet websites operated by other companies. Some of these websites may be co-branded with our name or logo, even though they are not operated or maintained by us. For example, users can use the Hulu Services on the Distribution Sites. Hulu is not responsible for the privacy practices of the Distribution Sites or other websites operated by third parties that are linked to any of the Sites. Once you have left the Hulu Site by clicking on a link, or if you are using the Hulu Services on another Site, you should check the privacy policy of the other website to determine how it handles any personally identifiable information they collect from you.</p>
<p>Hulu carries advertisements from other companies, often with the ability to click through to websites run by such other companies. Hulu is not responsible for the privacy practices of advertisers. Once you have left the Hulu Site by clicking on an advertisement, you should check the privacy policy of the advertiser to determine how it handles any personally identifiable information they collect from you. Please be aware that Hulu does not warn you when you have chosen to link through to another website from the Hulu Site.</p>
<p>Some of the advertisements that appear in connection with the Hulu Services may be delivered to you by internet advertising companies (also called "ad networks" or "network advertisers"). These companies may use cookies and other technologies to deliver advertisements to you, measure their effectiveness, and personalize advertising content. Hulu does not have access to or control over cookies or other technologies that they may use. The information practices of these advertising companies are governed by their own privacy policies and are not covered by this Privacy Policy.</p>

<div class="section-header"><a name="change" class="anchor-title">What happens when Hulu changes its Privacy Policy?</a></div>
<p>From time to time, Hulu may revise this Privacy Policy to reflect industry initiatives or changes in the law or to the scope of the Hulu Services, among other reasons. Any revisions will be effective upon posting the new Privacy Policy on the Hulu Site at <a href="http://www.hulu.com/privacy">http://www.hulu.com/privacy</a>. Therefore, it is important to check the effective date of the Privacy Policy posted at this location each time you visit the Hulu Site or use any of the Hulu Services to ensure you are familiar with the most updated policies and practices. If you do not agree with any changes to the Privacy Policy, you must leave the Hulu Site and discontinue any use of the Hulu Services. Any visit to the Hulu Site or use of the Hulu Services on any of the Sites by you after the new Privacy Policy is posted will indicate your agreement to the new Policy.</p>
