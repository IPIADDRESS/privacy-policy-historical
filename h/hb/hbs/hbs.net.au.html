For starters, we’re owned by customers, not shareholders, so our focus is always on putting ‘<em>People first</em>’ by providing customer benefits – in the form of better rates and better service - rather than maximising profits. In everything we do, we put ‘<em>People first’. </em></p><p></p><h2>Privacy background</h2><p>Heritage Bank Limited ABN 32 087 652 024, Australian Financial Services Licence and Australian Credit Licence 240984 (also referred to as “Heritage”, “we”, “our” or “us” in this Privacy Policy) considers the protection and maintenance of your personal information to be of the utmost importance. We take very seriously the ongoing trust that you place in us to protect your personal information.</p><p>When handling your personal information we are bound and committed to complying with the Australian Privacy Principles in the <em>Privacy Act 1988</em>. We are also bound by Division 3 of Part IIIA of the Privacy Act and the Credit Reporting Privacy Code (CR Code), which regulates the handling of credit information, credit eligibility information and related information by credit providers, like us and credit reporting bodies (CRBs) like Veda Advantage Limited, Dun &amp; Bradstreet (Australia) Pty Ltd and Experian Australia Pty Ltd.</p><p>This Privacy Policy outlines how we deal with your personal information (including credit-related information), as well as our legal obligations and rights as to that information. If we agree with you to use or disclose any of your personal information in ways which differ to those stated in this Privacy Policy, the provisions of that agreement will prevail to the extent of any inconsistency.</p><p></p><h2>What does "personal information" mean?</h2><p>Personal information is information that may identify you or by which your identity may be reasonably determined. The types of personal information that Heritage collects and holds includes the following information about customers, potential customers, and associated persons (such as guarantors) which is relevant to our relationship with that person. Such information may include an individual's name, address, other contact details, date of birth, financial details such as income, savings and lending history and expenses, credit reports from CRBs, employment details, tax file number and the reason a person might be applying for a financial product from us.</p><p></p><h2>What does "credit eligibility information" mean?</h2><p>"Credit eligibility information" means information that has been obtained from a CRB (e.g. a consumer credit report), or personal information that has been derived from that information, that is about an individual's consumer credit worthiness.</p><p>The kind of information we might derive from an individual's consumer credit report includes:</p><ul><li>a credit assessment relating to the individual;</li><li>an unsuitability assessment relating to the individual; and</li><li>any internal credit scores. </li></ul><h2>What does "credit information" mean?</h2><p>"Credit information" includes identification information, consumer credit liability information, repayment history information, credit enquiry, type of credit sought, default information, court proceedings and personal insolvency information, publicly available information that relates to the individual’s credit worthiness and information about a serious credit infringement.</p><p>We will hold all of this information about an applicant for credit, a guarantor, or related person (for example, a director of a company which has applied for credit).</p><h2>Why do we collect your personal information?</h2><p>We will only ask for personal information (including credit information and credit eligibility information) relevant to our business relationship with you.</p><p>We will tell you why we are asking for your personal information when we seek it from you.
