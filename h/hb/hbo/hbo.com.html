internal review in aggregate form. E-mail addresses and other personally 
identifying data about visitors to this site are known to HBO when voluntarily

we direct e-mail to visitors who provide us with their e-mail addresses for specific 
purposes such as responding to comments or being notified if they have won one of 
our contests. If you at any point no longer wish to receive communications from HBO, 
please forward such requests to us at <a href="mailto:webmaster@hbo.com">Webmaster@hbo.com.</a>

A SPECIAL NOTICE FOR PARENTS</center>

While HBO encourages children to consult with their parents before furnishing data, 
parents should supervise their children's online activities and consider using parental 
control tools available from online services and software manufactures that help provide 
a child-friendly online environment. These tools can also prevent children from disclosing 
online their name, address, and other personal information without parental permission.

 Assistance" page of direct Marketing Association home page (www.the-dma.org).</p></td>
