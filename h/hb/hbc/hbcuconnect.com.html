          safeguarding your privacy online. We only use your personal information 
          to help us to improve our services to you, to provide you with products

          We protect your account information by placing it on the secure portion 
          of our Web site. That's why you have to enter a unique Member Name (email 
          address) and Password each time you want to access your HBCUCONNECT.com 
          account. Your Password should never be shared with anyone. </font></p>

          in several ways from different parts of our Web site. Some personal

          Internet address and the site from which you visited. If you choose

          asks for your name, e-mail address, phone number, school name, claim 
          to fame, most memorable moment, current whereabouts. The more information 
          you volunteer (and the more accurate it is), the better we are able 
          to customize your experience. Once you register you are no longer anonymous 
          to HBCUCONNECT.com and are able to take full advantage of HBCUCONNECT.com's

          or services. If you contact HBCUCONNECT.com we may keep a record of 
          that correspondence. HBCUCONNECT.com also asks members to complete
