<h2 align="Center">HSH Associates' Privacy Policy</h2>

<div style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;">
<p><a href="http://www.hsh.com/abouthsh.html">HSH Associates, Financial Publishers</a> is committed to presenting current information about mortgages, consumer finance, and similar topics. <i>HSH is also committed to protecting your privacy.</i> This is a summary of the various ways we treat the information you provide us while visiting our Web site.</p>

<ul>
<li style="display: block; list-style-type: circle;"> HSH Associates does not collect personally identifying information, except with your specific knowledge and consent.</li>
<li style="display: block; list-style-type: circle;"> We <i>never</i> sell or offer contact information about our visitors to others. There's no need to send us an "opt out" message to prevent your name from appearing on a million mailing lists.</li>
<li style="display: block; list-style-type: circle;"> Our site doesn't use "cookies."</li>
</ul>

<p>Click here to read our <a href="http://www.hsh.com/privacy-ext.html">extended privacy Statement</a>.</p>

<p>In some cases, such as if you e-mail a question or some feedback to us, we may <i>request</i> your name, e-mail address or other information so that we can, for example, e-mail you with a personal reply. If you choose to supply this information, we will use it only for the specific purpose for which you supply it.
<!-- unless we tell you otherwise at the time of collection, in which case you'll have an option to forbid other uses by us. --></p>

<p>In other cases, we may <i>require</i> certain personal information -- such as when you use the "information request" coupons which lenders have on their home pages in the <a href="http://www.hsh.com/lshow.html"><i>Lender Showcase</i></a> and other Showcases.  In these cases, you must enter your name, address, and certain other information. <i>The information you provide goes only to the lender(s) you select. We don't sell this info to anyone.</i></p>

<p>When we ask for personal information via our <a href="https://www.hsh.com/secure_orderform.html">secure online order form</a> (or through any other means such as phone, fax or mail), we will keep your information private.  Obviously, we must collect this information so we can fulfill your order.  We maintain the information you provide (other than credit card information) to evidence that you have purchased a product.</p>

<div style="margin-left: 2em; margin-right: 2em;">
<p>We never share any of your personally identifying data with any other party without your explicit permission, nor use it for unapproved commercial purposes.</p>
</div>

<p>In addition, since HSH was founded in 1979, it has been our policy to never sell our customers' <i>postal</i> addresses, either.  So if you choose to order our <a href="http://www.hsh.com/catalog.html" title="Our consumer catalog">Homebuyer's Mortgage Kit</a> or other product and have it mailed to you, we keep your address confidential, too.</p>

<p>Some customers find it irritating that, when they re-order a <i>Kit</i> or other product from us, we don't have their information on file. They need to give us their name, address, and other information every time they re-order. That's because we delete all computer references to your order 30 days after the product is shipped to you.</p>

<p>We retain a <i>paper</i> record of your order for about six months, in case you need to call us. After that time, the paper record is destroyed as well.</p>

<!-- from elsewhere:
A few special cases are worth noting. From time to time we
may run competitions or request material we can publish; to
participate, you must usually supply us with your identity, which
you agree to have publicly associated with your submission. The
exact rules vary from case to case, and will be noted clearly on
the relevant pages. Your participation will always be voluntary and
knowing. -->

<p>We may <i>offer</i> to send you information or updates from HSH Associates via e-mail or otherwise. Obviously, signing up will put you on a specific mailing list. We will <i>not</i> put you on any other mailing lists, from us or anyone else, without your permission.</p>

<p>You may have read about "cookies". Sent to your computer by some Web sites, cookies contain information such as registration information, or similar data, which is stored on your hard drive and sent back to a site when you revisit it. <i>HSH Associates does not use cookies</i> -- it's that simple. (Most browsers have an option to warn you when a site wants to place a 'cookie' on your computer. Try it and see.)</p>

<!-- from elsewhere:
We use cookies only to control the display of ads -- to ensure that you don't see the same ad too many times in a single session, for example. Our cookies do not contain any personally identifying information.
If you don't like cookies, your Web browser likely includes an option that allows you not to accept them.  We don't recommend using this option, though: It makes browsing our site a less enjoyable experience. -->

<p>Finally, while your individual information is protected as outlined above, we do analyze our 'hit' logs to see how we're doing; but we only use aggregated, anonymous data about our users as a group. For instance, we like to know that a certain percentage of our users appear to be in the market for a certain loan type, based on the pages they view.</p>

<p>Our privacy policy may be modified from time to time; the last update was on April 19, 2000.</p>
