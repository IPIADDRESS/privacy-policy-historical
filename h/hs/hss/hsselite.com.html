<p>TrustHSS.com 
is committed to respecting your privacy. We do not sell, 
rent, or loan any identifiable information regarding our customers 
to any third party. Any information you give us is held with the 
utmost care and security – it will not be used in ways to which 
you have not consented.</p>

<p><b>DETAILED EXPLANATION OF PRIVACY POLICY</b></p>

<p>The following statement describes how we gather and use information 
from our visitors. This statement discloses the privacy practices for 
the TrustHSS.com web site – where you can expect to be notified of the 
following:</p>

<p></p><ul>
	<li>what personally identifiable information of yours or a third party is collected from you 
	</li><li>who is collecting that information 
	</li><li>how the information is used 
	</li><li>with whom the information may be shared 
	</li><li>site choices regarding collection, use and distribution of your information 
	</li><li>security procedures in place to protect the information from loss, misuse or alteration</li>             
</ul>
            <p></p>

<p><b>About Information We Collect</b></p>

<p>TrustHSS.com collects two types of information about our visitors:  
(1) aggregated (collective) data that tracks visitors as a group, and 
(2) individual user data that is volunteered.</p>
 
<p></p><ul>
	<li><b>Collective Data</b><br>
		TrustHSS.com gathers aggregated data to monitor visitor activity on the site as a 
		whole. This data does not identify you personally. Collective tracking allows us to 
		monitor traffic on the site to determine which areas of the TrustHSS.com web site are
		most attractive to visitors. This type of information helps us to make improvements 
		and to add new features and services based on visitor interests. We may disclose 
		this aggregated information to third parties such as our advertisers and partners. 
	</li><li><b>Individual User Data</b><br>
		We request individual user data 
              when you voluntarily sign up onsite for personalized services, or 
              when you register for contests, sweepstakes, or other promotional 
              programs. For example, to process your order, we require your 
              name, phone number, email address, and home address. 
              We use this information to process 
              your order, including contacting you to finalize your appointment. 
              Except as explained below, this information will not be disclosed 
              to parties other than TrustHSS.com without prior 
              notification. Financial information is used solely to bill for 
              services rendered, and is not shared.</li>
		     
		          
		         
		          
		         
		          
		         
		          
		       
		         
		     
</ul>
            <p></p>

<p><b>How We Collect Information</b></p>

<p>Like most other web sites, our servers automatically track certain information about your activity 
on the TrustHSS.com web site. This information includes the following:<br>
</p><ul>
	<li>your browser 
	</li><li>your IP address 
	</li><li>referring URL and the TrustHSS.com URLs 
              you visit</li>             
</ul>
            <p></p>

<p><b>Cookies</b></p>

<p>We use cookies on certain pages of our site to help us establish traffic patterns on the TrustHSS.com web site. 
One way that cookies are used is to allow you to store your user name and password 
without having to frequently reenter it during a session. Cookies also help us 
tailor content, special features, and marketing messages that match your interests. 
Cookies are stored on your hard drive, not on the TrustHSS.com web site. You are 
always free to set your browser to decline our cookies and you can delete cookies 
on your computer. However if you do so,  you may find that some areas of our site 
may not work properly and you will be required to reenter your password more 
frequently during a session.</p>

<p>We place advertising on our site that originates from the outside advertiser or 
their agency. At times, the advertiser may assign a cookie if you click on their 
banner or ad. TrustHSS.com does not control these cookies. Again, cookies are 
stored on your hard drive, not on TrustHSS.com's servers. You are always free 
to set your browser to decline cookies on from the TrustHSS.com web site.</p> 

<p><b>How We Use Information We Collect</b></p>

<p>Except as described below, we do not provide your personally identifiable 
information to anyone outside of TrustHSS.com. However, on certain pages, 
such as contests, we may collect your volunteered personally identifiable data 
and we will explicitly tell you that the data you give us will be shared with 
third parties, such as an advertiser. Such disclosures will override anything 
to the contrary stated in this policy.</p>

<p><b>TrustHSS.com Content Providers, Advertisers, and Partners</b></p>

<p>We do not give your personal information to anyone outside of TrustHSS.com 
except in limited circumstances mentioned above, such as contests, and then only 
with your consent.  However, the TrustHSS.com web site contains links to other 
sites and those sites may not follow the same privacy policies as the TrustHSS.com 
web site. For example, when you click on an ad on the TrustHSS.com web site, 
this can take you away from our site to the advertiser's site. These links include 
advertisers, content providers, retailers and business partners who may use the 
TrustHSS.com logo and/or style as part of a co-branding agreement. These sites may 
send their own cookies to you, and as a result, may collect data and ask for 
personal information.</p>

<p>If you have provided personal information to a company or advertiser that is 
linked to the TrustHSS.com web site and have not been informed by the TrustHSS.com 
web site as to how such information will be used, or if want to understand the 
privacy practices of such company or advertiser, you should contact that company 
or advertiser directly. You can do this by going to their web site's home page and 
looking for a company profile or contact information area on the site.</p> 

<p><b>Contests and Other Promotions</b></p>

<p>To participate in contests and other promotions offered on the TrustHSS.com web 
site, you are asked to provide certain personal information on a voluntary basis. 
The contest rules are prominently posted during the duration of the event, including 
how data gathered from entrants will be used. All contests are conducted in full 
accordance with U.S. federal and state laws. </p>
									
<p><b>Data Security</b></p>

<p>TrustHSS.com has security measures in place to protect against the loss, misuse 
and alteration of the information under our control.  We operate a secure network 
protected by industry standard firewall and password protection systems.  Only 
authorized individuals have access to the network.</p>

<p>We utilize SSL encryption when accepting and transmitting credit card information 
across the Internet.  SSL technology has effectively protected millions of customers 
who make purchases over the Internet.  Access to information provided by customers 
is limited to authorized individuals only.</p>

<a name="optout">
<p><b>Correct/Update/Opt-Out Policy</b></p>
									
<p>Changes and corrections to customer information or opting out of receiving communications 
from us are available through your account profile.  You can update your account 
profile at any time, which includes an option to receive/not receive information from 
us.

</p>
									
<p><b>Contacting the TrustHSS.com web site</b></p>

or your dealings with this Web site, you can contact our customer service 
representatives at </a><a href="mailto:HSSCustomerService@TrustHSS.com">HSSCustomerService@TrustHSS.com</a>
