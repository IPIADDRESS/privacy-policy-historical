<div class="single c">
    <p>Welcome, and thank you for your interest in AnchorFree, Inc. ("AnchorFree") and its Hotspot Shield software ("Hotspot Shield"). This Privacy
        Notice describes what information is collected by us from any user of the subscription-based Hotspot Shield Elite Version (collectively or
        individually "User(s)"), as well as our use and disclosure of that information.</p>
    <p>Your use of Hotspot Shield is subject to the terms of this Privacy Notice. By using Hotspot Shield, you consent to the collection and use of
        information in accordance with this notice.</p>
    <p>Please note that the AnchorFree website located at www.anchorfree.com has a different Privacy Policy that governs the use of personal
        information collected on that site. Additionally, please note that the Hotspot Shield Free Version has a different Privacy Notice that governs
        the use of information collected through that version of Hotspot Shield.</p>
    <p>NOTE TO KIDS: HOTSPOT SHIELD IS NOT AVAILABLE TO PERSONS UNDER THE AGE OF 13. <u>If you are under 13 years of age, please
        do not use Hotspot Shield.</u></p>

<p><span class="h4">Our Commitment to User Privacy:</span><br>
    AnchorFree does not collect any personally identifiable information on Hotspot Shield. Hotspot Shield automatically collects certain
    non-personally identifiable information from Users that is used in the aggregate only.</p>
<p>AnchorFree does not collect, store, or share any permanent identifiers of Users, including IP addresses.</p>
<p>Please note that Hotspot Shield only enables privacy and encrypts user Internet sessions when it is turned ON. Having Hotspot Shield on the
    desktop, without turning it ON does not do anything. Unless Users turn Hotspot Shield ON and opt into the service, Hotspot Shield will be
    completely idle.</p>
<p><span class="h4">Our Commitment to Web Security:</span><br>
    Hotspot Shield encrypts every page visited by our Users, thus protecting the communications between each User and the Internet.</p>
<p>AnchorFree Hotspot Shield employs certain physical, managerial, and technical safeguards to preserve the integrity and security of any
    information collected. We cannot, however, ensure or warrant that the safeguards will be uninterrupted or effective, or that any information
    you transmit to AnchorFree Hotspot Shield will remain secure, and you do so at your own risk. Once we receive your transmission of information,
    AnchorFree employs certain techniques and technologies to ensure the security of our systems. However, please note that this is not a guarantee
    that such information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards.</p>
<p>If AnchorFree learns of a security systems breach, we may post a notice on the AnchorFree website to notify Users.</p>
<p>Please note that Hotspot Shield helps secure your Internet session, not your computer. Hotspot Shield does not protect your computer from
    viruses or malware. We recommend getting anti-virus/anti-malware solutions from one of our reputable partners in order to also help secure
    your computer.</p>
<p><span class="h4">The Information Hotspot Shield Collects:</span><br>
    "Cookies" Information.  When you use Hotspot Shield, we may send one or more cookies - a small text file containing a string of alphanumeric
    characters - to your computer. Hotspot Shield uses both session cookies and persistent cookies. A persistent cookie remains after you close your
    browser and may be used by your browser on subsequent use of Hotspot Shield. These persistent types of cookies can be removed, but each
    web browser is a little different, so please look through your browser "Help" file to learn the correct way to modify your cookies set-up. Cookies
    are not used for ad tracking in the Hotspot Shield Elite Version.</p>
<p>"Automatically Collected" Information.  When you use Hotspot Shield, we automatically record certain information from your web browser by
    using different types of proprietary technology, including cookies. The automatically collected information does not identify a User personally,
    and AnchorFree only uses the automatically collected information in the aggregate.</p>
<p><span class="h4">The Way AnchorFree Uses Information Collected from Hotspot Shield:</span><br>
    AnchorFree may use automatically-collected information in the aggregate for purposes of research and analysis.</p>
<p>Please note that by having Hotspot Shield on your computer, but not turned on, no information is collected by AnchorFree. Anonymous web
    information may only be collected when you turn Hotspot Shield ON.</p>
<p><span class="h4">Payment and Third-Party Providers</span><br>
    Your payment obligations will be handled by a third-party payment vendor, and will be subject to that third-party payment vendor's terms,
    conditions, and policies. Third-party payment vendors may collect personal information from you and notify us that you have paid. Please note
    that this Privacy Notice will not apply to your activities or any information you disclose while using any third-party products or services or
    otherwise interacting with third parties. How third parties handle and use your personal information related to their sites and services is governed
    by their security, privacy and other policies, if any, and not this Privacy Notice. AnchorFree has no responsibility for any third party's policies, or
    any third party's compliance with them.</p>
<p>Any information collected from Users in connection with the use of a prepaid credit card to pay the subscription fees will be governed by the
    Privacy Policy available on the AnchorFree website.</p>
<p><span class="h4">Changes and Updates to this Hotspot Shield Privacy Notice:</span><br>
    This Hotspot Shield Privacy Notice may be revised periodically and this will be reflected by the "last modified" notice above. Please revisit this
    page to stay aware of any changes. Your continued use of the Hotspot Shield constitutes your agreement to this Hotspot Shield Privacy Notice
    and any future revisions.</p>
<p><span class="h4">AnchorFree Contact Information:</span><br>
    Please contact AnchorFree with any questions or comments about this Hotspot Shield Privacy Notice at <a href="#">info@anchorfree.com</a>. Please note that
    if you contact AnchorFree, you will be disclosing your personal information, and the use of such personal information will be governed by the
    AnchorFree Privacy Policy.</p>
