				<li>We only collect personal information that we believe to be relevant and required to understand your financial needs and to conduct our business.</li>
				<li>We use your personal information to provide you with better customer services and products.</li>
				<li>We may pass your personal information to other HSBC Group companies or agents, as permitted by law.</li>
				<li>We will not disclose your personal information to any external organisation unless we have your consent or are required by law or have previously informed you.</li>
				<li>We may be required from time to time to disclose your personal information to Governmental or judicial bodies or agencies or our regulators, but we will only do so under proper authority.</li>
				<li>We aim to keep your personal information on our records accurate and up-to-date.</li>
				<li>We maintain strict security systems designed to prevent unauthorised access to your personal information by anyone, including our staff.</li>
				<li>All HSBC Group companies, all our staff and all third parties with permitted access to your information are specifically required to observe our confidentiality obligations.</li>
 	  </ol>
			<font class="hsbcSizeText02">By maintaining our commitment to these principles, we at HSBC will ensure that we respect the inherent trust that you place in us.</font>
		<hr><p></p>
		<p class="hsbcSizeText02"><b>Your Privacy Matters to Us</b></p>
		<p class="hsbcSizeText02">This section provides specific details of how we treat any personal information you might wish to provide us when you visit this site.</p>
		<p class="hsbcSizeText02"><b>Data Security</b></p>
		<p class="hsbcSizeText02">
	  </p><ul>
				<li>Security is our top priority. The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited ('the Bank') will strive at all times to ensure that your personal data will be protected against unauthorised or accidental access, processing or erasure. We maintain this commitment to data security by implementing appropriate physical, electronic and managerial measures to safeguard and secure your personal data.</li>
				<li>The secure area of our website supports the use of 128-bit Secure Socket Layer (SSL) encryption technology - an industry standard for encryption over the Internet to protect data. When you provide sensitive information such as credit card details, it will be automatically converted into codes before being securely dispatched over the Internet.</li>
				<li>Our web servers are protected behind "firewalls" and our systems are monitored to prevent any unauthorised access. We will not send personal information to you by ordinary email. As the security of ordinary email cannot be guaranteed, you should only send email to us using the secure email facility on our website.<br><br>
				All practical steps will be taken to ensure that personal data will not be kept longer than necessary and that the Bank will comply with all statutory and regulatory requirements in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region concerning the retention of personally identifiable information.</li>
	  </ul><p></p>
		<p class="hsbcSizeText02"><b>Security Assurance</b></p>
		<p class="hsbcSizeText02">
	  </p><ul>
				<li>Both you and HSBC play an important role in protecting against online fraud. You should be careful that your bank account details including your User ID and/or Password are not compromised by ensuring that you do not knowingly or accidentally share, provide or facilitate unauthorised use of it. Do not share your User ID and/or password or allow access or use of it by others. We endeavor to put in place high standards of security to protect your interests. If, in the unlikely event, unauthorised transactions have been conducted through your account through no fraud, fault or negligence on your part, we will see that you are covered for your direct loss up to the full amount of the unauthorised transaction.</li>
				<li>You should safeguard your unique User ID and Password by keeping it secret and confidential. Never write them down or share these details with anyone. HSBC will never ask you for your Internet Banking Password, in order to ensure that you are the only person who knows this information. When choosing your unique User ID and Password for the first time, do not create it using easily identifiable information such as your birthday, telephone number or a recognisable part of your name. If you think your User ID and/or password has been disclosed to a third party, is lost or stolen and unauthorised transactions may have been conducted, you are responsible to inform us immediately.</li>
