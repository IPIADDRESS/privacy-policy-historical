We may also provide information to Affiliates that perform operational services related to your account(s). These Affiliates all provide financial services, such as banking, consumer finance, insurance, mortgage, and brokerage services. Some examples include companies doing business under the names HSBC, HFC®, Household, or Beneficial®. We may also share certain information with non-financial service providers that become affiliated with us in the future (such as travel, auto, or shopping clubs), except as prohibited by applicable law.
The information we share might come from your application, for instance your name, address, telephone number, social security number, and e-mail address. Also, the information we share could include your transactions with us or our Affiliates (such as your account balance, payment history, and parties to the transaction), your internet usage, or your credit card usage. Except for Vermont residents, the information we share could also include your assets, income, or credit report information. For Vermont residents, applicable law requires us to obtain your permission in order to share information about you with our Affiliates. Please note that we have chosen not to share your information in this way while you are a resident of Vermont.</p>

These companies may be financial services providers (such as mortgage bankers, insurance agents or a re-insurer) or they may be non-financial companies (such as retailers or marketing companies). These offers are typically for products and services
that you might not otherwise hear about. The information that we may provide Non-Affiliates comes from the sources described above and might include your name, address, phone number, and information about your account with us. For California and Vermont residents, applicable law requires us to obtain your permission in order to share information about you with Non-Affiliates, and so we have chosen not to share your information in this way while you are a resident
of California or Vermont.</p>
<br>
<p>We may also provide information to Non-Affiliates that perform operational services for your account such as, collection, fraud control and marketing. The sharing of information with these types of Non-Affiliates is permitted by law. This might include a financial company (such as an insurance service provider) or a non-financial company (such as a data processor or Internet service provider) with whom we have a service agreement. The information we may share
also comes from the sources described above and might include your name, address, phone number, and account experience with us.</p>
<br>
<p>Finally, we provide information about you to Non-Affiliates as permitted by law. These may include credit reporting agencies and companies which provide services related to your account.</p>

<h1><a name="error_res">Notice of Error Resolution Procedures</a></h1>


The following annual notice is being provided to you, because you are enrolled in HSBC Card Services’ Online Bill Payment Service for your general purpose credit card.  This notice provides important information regarding the procedures for notification on any errors or questions about your online bill payments.  <br>
<p><strong>This is not a notification of an error on your account.</strong></p> 
<p>Please read the notice below and retain it for your records.</p> 
====================================================== 
<br><br> 
<strong>Notice of Error Resolution Procedures</strong>
<br><br> 
In Cases of Errors or Questions About Your Electronic Transfers
 <ul>
		<li>Telephone us at the number on the back of your credit card, or</li>
		<li>Write us at HSBC Bank Nevada, N.A. / HSBC Bank USA, N.A., 1441 Schilling Place, Salinas, CA 93912</li>
	</ul>
 
as soon as you can, if you think your statement or receipt is wrong or if you need more information about a transfer listed on the statement or receipt. We must hear from you no later than 60 days after we sent the FIRST statement on which the problem or error appeared.
<ol>
	<li>Tell us your name and account number (if any).</li>
	<li>Describe the error or the transfer you are unsure about, and explain as clearly as you can why you believe it is an error or why you need more information.</li>
	<li>Tell us the dollar amount of the suspected error.</li>
</ol>
 
If you tell us orally, we may require that you send us your complaint or question in writing within 10 business days.
<br><br> 
We will determine whether an error occurred within 10 business days after we hear from you and will correct any error promptly. If we need more time, however, we may take up to 45 days to investigate your complaint or question. If we decide to do this, we will credit your account within 10 business days for the amount you think is in error, so that you will have the use of the money during the time it takes us to complete our investigation. If we ask you to put your complaint or question in writing and we do not receive it within 10 business days, we may not credit your account.
<br><br>
