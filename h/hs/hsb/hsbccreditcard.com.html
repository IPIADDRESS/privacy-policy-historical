We greatly appreciate the trust that you and millions of other customers have placed in us, and we protect that trust by respecting your privacy, even if our relationship with you ends.</p>
<br>
<p>This Privacy Statement illustrates our commitment to your privacy and explains our privacy practices so you can make an informed decision about whom you allow us to share your information with in order to offer you additional products and services. Although most customers enjoy receiving offers and information about additional products and services, if you prefer that we do not share your information for marketing purposes, we will respect your choice. If you have selected a credit insurance product, the privacy statement applicable to that credit insurance product is set forth at the end of this Privacy Statement.</p><p></p>

This information comes either directly from you, for instance, from your application and transactions on your Account; or, it may come from an outside source such as your credit bureau report. In addition, if you visit our Internet website, we may collect certain information about your Internet usage. Gathering this information helps us to identify our customers and manage our customer relationships. It also assists us in the development of products and services to meet the continuing needs of our customers.</p><p></p>

Because HSBC Bank respects your privacy and values your trust, the only employees or companies who can access your nonpublic personal information are those who use it to service your Account or provide services to you or to us.

These companies all provide financial services such as banking, consumer finance, insurance, mortgage, and brokerage services. Some examples include companies doing business under the names Household, Beneficial, or HSBC. We may also share certain information with non-financial service providers that become our Affiliates (such as travel, auto and shopping clubs). The information we share might come from your application, such as your name, address, telephone number, Social Security number, and e-mail address. Also, the information we share could include your transactions with us or our Affiliates (such as your Account balance, payment history, and parties to the transaction), your Internet usage, or credit card usage.  Except for Vermont residents, the information we share with our Affiliates may also include your assets, income, or credit reports, which we collect from the sources described above. With this information, our Affiliates can determine if the products they specialize in, such as mortgages, automobile loans and insurance, may be of benefit to you.</p><p></p>

<p class="bodybold"><a name="privacy_statement5">How We Share Information Outside the HSBC Bank Family</a></p><p class="bodytext"></p><p>Except for California and Vermont residents, we also may share information with companies outside our corporate family (non-Affiliates) that are able to extend special offers we feel might be of value to you. These companies may be financial service providers (such as mortgage bankers or insurance product providers) or they may be non-financial companies (such as retailers or marketing companies). These offers are typically for products and services that you might not otherwise hear about. The information we may provide them comes from the sources described above and might include your name, address, and phone number. For California and Vermont residents, state law restricts how we share information about you, and we have chosen not to share your information in this way.</p>

<p>If you have selected insurance or another product offered by HIG, the Privacy Statement is set forth herein and is applicable to information used by HIG in connection with the insurance or other product you purchased.  HIG does not disclose information about you to HIG's affiliates or to third parties, except as permitted by law.</p>
<br>

<p>We reserve the right to change our privacy practices at any time in accordance with applicable law. Notice of such changes will be provided if required by applicable law.</p>
