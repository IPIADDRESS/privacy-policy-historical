Your privacy is valued and respected by us. As such, this Privacy Policy describes our online information practices, including the types of information that we may collect from you when you visit the Sites and how we use, share and protect this information.</p>

<p>This Privacy Policy is part of, and incorporated into, the <a href="/terms-of-use">Terms of Use</a> for the Sites (“Terms of Use”), which govern your use of the Sites. Please review the <a href="/terms-of-use">Terms of Use</a> prior to using the Sites.</p>

	<li>as a result of a reorganization process;</li>
