		<h2>Privacy Statement</h2>
<h3> 1.	Scope </h3>
<p class="bodytext"><br> Protecting your personal data and therefore your privacy is a top priority for our enterprise. With this privacy statement, we would like to inform you which data HHL Leipzig Graduate School of Management (HHL gemeinnützige GmbH) collects and processes when you visit and use its website. We observe legal requirements; specifically those arising from the German Data Protection Act (BDSG) and the German Broadcast Media Act (TMG).</p>
<h3><br> 2.	What is personal data?</h3>
<p class="bodytext"><br> Personal data means any information concerning the personal or material circumstances of an identified or identifiable individual (section 3, paragraph 1 of BDSG). This includes, among other things, the address, name, e-mail address and telephone number. Details such as your marital status, insurance number or which websites you visited are considered personal data. We only collect, use and forward personal data if doing so is permitted by the German Data Protection Act or required by other law or you agreed to the collection of your data.<br><br></p>
<h3> 3.	What data is collected and processed?</h3>
<h4><br> Access data/server log files</h4>
<p class="bodytext"> Any time you visit our website or use our services, data is automatically collected and stored in so-called server log files. <br> These access data include but are not limited to:</p><ul><li>name of the visited website</li><li>date and time of visit</li><li>data volume transmitted</li><li>notification of successful data retrieval</li><li>browser type, including version</li><li>user's operating system&nbsp;</li><li>websites you previously visited</li><li>IP address</li><li>requesting provider</li></ul><p class="bodytext"><br> This log data is used for statistical evaluation, maintenance, safety and optimization of the services. If there is specific evidence of an illegal use, the provider reserves the right to review the data retroactively.</p>
<h4> Contact</h4>
<p class="bodytext"> If you contact us via the contact form or e-mail, your data will be stored in order to process the inquiry and any subsequent questions. Please note that this information is transmitted unencrypted.</p>
<h4> Salesforce</h4>
<p class="bodytext"> We use cloud-based services to process personal data during the admission and study process. Agreements in accordance with section 11 of BDSG have been concluded with the providers of these services (Salesforce) regulating the processing of the contract data and also allowing for processing outside the scope of the EU Data Protection Directive. Due to state authorities outside the EU being able to access to your data, we recommend that you do not upload particularly sensitive data (in accordance with section 3, paragraph 9 of BDSG) to the system but instead send them to your contact person via e-mail.<br> By confirming you have read and accepted our Terms and Conditions and the Privacy Statement, your consent to the processing of personal data as described above will be logged. The consent may only be revoked with effect for the future. At this stage, we can only assure logical deletion of the data stored so far. Revoking your consent will be accompanied by further limitations during the application and study process about which we will gladly inform you on a case-by-case basis. Salesforce participates in the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework. For more details visit <a href="https://www.privacyshield.gov/participant?id=a2zt0000000KzLyAAK" title="Opens external link in new window" target="_blank" class="external-link-new-window">https://www.privacyshield.gov/participant?id=a2zt0000000KzLyAAK</a>.</p>
<h4> Blog comments and contributions</h4>
<p class="bodytext"> Any details such as your name, e-mail address, homepage and content submitted as part of a blog comment or contribution will solely be used for the purposes of blog commenting. If you compose blog comments or other contributions, we will store your IP address for our own security. This step is based on the fact that we can be held liable for illegal comments and contributions (e.g., insults, forbidden political propaganda). </p>
<h4>Integration of third-party services and content</h4>
<p class="bodytext"> At times, we also integrate third-party content into our online offer. This includes, among other things, graphics from other websites or Google Maps. These third-party providers will be notified of your IP address; otherwise the content could not be displayed. We do not have any influence on whether the third-party providers store your e-mail address (e.g., for statistical purposes) but we seek to only use images where no such data is stored. As soon as we learn about IP addresses being stored, we will inform the user of this circumstance.</p>
<h4> Registration feature</h4>
<p class="bodytext"> If you wish to use our offer, we will need the data which you submitted during the registration process. The data entered into the input during registration is collected.</p>
<h4> Cookies </h4>
<p class="bodytext"> To be able to offer you certain features on our website, we use cookies. These are small text files which allow for specific device-related information to be stored on your access device (PC, smartphone, etc.). Cookies serve the purpose of increasing the user-friendliness of our website (e.g., saving login data) as well as collecting statistical data about the website use to improve our offer following an analysis of the data. You can limit or prevent cookies from being stored to your computer by changing your browser settings. Please note, however, that you might no longer be able to use all the features on our website to their full extent when doing so.</p>
<h4> Newsletter/MailChimp</h4>
<p class="bodytext"> You can subscribe to our newsletter informing you about HHL Leipzig and its latest offers.<br> To send you the newsletter, we require a valid e-mail address from you. If you sign up for our newsletter, we will store your IP address and the date as proof in the event that a third person has misused the authorized recipient's e-mail address and signed up for the newsletter without the recipient's knowledge.<br> We use MailChimp as a list provider to send out our newsletter. MailChimp is a service provided by The Rocket Science Group, LLC, 512 Means Street, Suite 404, Atlanta, GA 30318. Arrangements with the agent on data processing in accordance with section 11 of BDSG are in place.

You may revoke your consent to receiving this information at any time.</p>
<h4> Google AdWords</h4>
<p class="bodytext"> This website uses Google AdWords and, in doing so, its conversion tracking feature as well. If you come to our website by clicking on a Google ad, Google AdWords will add cookies to your computer. These cookies become invalid after 30 days and do not serve as a means of personal identification. If you visit specific pages of the AdWords customer's website and the cookie has not yet expired, both Google and we, the customer, can see that the user clicked on the advertisement and was redirected to the current page. Every AdWords customer receives a different cookie. Cookies can therefore not be tracked over AdWords customer websites. The information collected with the help of the conversion cookies are used in the creation of conversion statistics for AdWords customers who have opted for conversion tracking. AdWords customers receive information about the total number of users which have clicked on their advertisement(s) and also how many of these customers were redirected to a website with a conversion tracking tag. However, these AdWords customers do not receive any information which would personally identify the users. If you do not wish to participate in the tracking process, you can block the Google AdWords conversion tracking cookie by changing your browser settings (block cookies from the www.googleadservices.com domain). Google's privacy statement on conversion tracking is available at <a href="http://www.google.com/intl/de/policies/privacy" title="Opens external link in new window" target="_blank" class="external-link-new-window">www.google.com/intl/de/policies/privacy</a>.</p>
<h4> WordPress.com</h4>
<p class="bodytext"> HHL's blog is based on the WordPress.com service. For the purposes of the statistical evaluation of user access, the website uses a tool by Automattic Inc., 60 29th Street, 343, San Francisco, CA 94110-4929, USA, which includes the use of tracking technology by Quantcast Inc., 201 3rd St, Floor 2, San Francisco, CA 94103-3153, USA and com Score Inc., 11950 Democracy Drive, Suite 600 Reston, VA 20190, USA. WordPress.com also uses cookies, which are text files placed on your computer, to enable an analysis of the use of the website. This includes information on your pattern of use and is stored on servers based in the United States. Your IP address will be anonymized before it is saved.
