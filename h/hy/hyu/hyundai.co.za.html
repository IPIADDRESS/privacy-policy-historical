In respect of marketing services or products, consent to collect or use information can be expressed (for example signing an agreement) or implied (for example if the user is given an opportunity to opt out of a specific form of information sharing, but choose not to do so, it implies that the user chooses to share this information.<br>
<br>
ii.	we provide such information to our subsidiaries, affiliated companies or other trusted business or persons for the purpose of processing user information on our behalf.

The user will have the option to indicate that he/she does not want to receive such specific product communications in future, at time of receipt of the communication.  The user will, however, continue to receive other product information until the option to not receive future communications has again been selected for such specific product.<br>

<br>
v.	of protecting the rights or property of Hyundai or the users of the website; and<br>

vi.	of developing new services.<br>
<br>
<strong>5.	INFORMATION SECURITY</strong><br>
<br>
a.	Hyundai takes appropriate security measures to protect against unauthorized access to or unauthorized alteration, disclosure or destruction of data.  These include internal reviews of our data collection, storage and processing practices and security measures, as well as physical security measures to guard against unauthorized access to systems where we store personal data.<br>
<br>
b.	Hyundai restricts access to personal information to Hyundai employees, contractors and agents who need to know that information in order to operate, develop or improve our services.  These individuals are bound by confidentiality obligations.<br>
<br>
<strong>6.	DATA INTEGRITY</strong><br>
<br>
Hyundai processes user information only for the purposes for which it was collected and in accordance with this Privacy Policy or any applicable service-specific privacy notice.  We review our data collection, storage and processing practices to ensure that we only collect, store and process the personal information needed to provide or improve our services or as otherwise permitted under this Policy.  We take reasonable steps to ensure that the personal information we process is accurate, complete, and current, but depend on the users to update or correct their user information whenever necessary.<br>
<br>
<strong>7.	ACCESSING AND UPDATING PERSONAL INFORMATION</strong><br>
<br>
When using Hyundai services, we make reasonable efforts to provide you with access to your personal information and either to correct this data if it is inaccurate or to delete such data at your request if it is not otherwise required to be retained by law or for legitimate business purposes.  We request individual users to identify themselves and the information requested to be accessed, corrected or removed before processing such request, and we may decline to process requests that are unreasonably repetitive or systematic, require disproportionate technical effort, jeopardize the privacy of others, or would be extremely impractical (for instance, requests concerning information residing on backup tapes), or for which access is not otherwise required.  In any case where we provide information access and correction, we perform this service free of charge, except if doing so would require a disproportionate effort.  Some of our services have different procedures to access, correct or delete user information.<br>
<br>
<strong>8.	CHANGES TO PRIVACY POLICY</strong><br>
<br>
Please note that this Privacy Policy may change from time to time.  We will not reduce your rights under this Privacy Policy without your consent, and we expect most such changes to be minor.  Regardless, we will post any Privacy Policy changes on this page, and if the changes are significant, we will provide a more prominent notice (including, for certain services, email notification of Privacy Policy changes).  Each version of this Privacy Policy will be identified at the top of the page by its effective date, and we also keep prior versions of this Privacy Policy, if any, in an archive for your review.
