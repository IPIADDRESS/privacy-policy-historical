				<h1 style="font-size: 20px;">Privacy is important to us.</h1>
				<p>We'll only use your info to serve the purpose for which you submitted it. And we definitely won't trade or sell it to anyone else.</p>
				<p>That's the gist of our Privacy Policy in plain English. But if you can read legalese and you're so inclined, our full Privacy Policy is detailed below.</p>

				
				
				<div class="content-block privacy">
					<div class="subhead" style="font-size: 150%;">Hydra Network Privacy Statement</div><br>
					The policy was adopted, effective <strong>May 1, 2005</strong>
				</div>
				
				<div class="content-block privacy">
					<div class="subhead">Information Collection and Use</div>

					<p><strong>Information Collection</strong><br>
					  Hydra Network is the sole owner of the information collected on Hydra Network.
					    Hydra Network collects information from our users at several different
					points on our Web site.</p>
					<p><strong>Order</strong><br>
					  We request information from the user on our order form. A user must provide
					    contact information (such as name, email, and shipping address) and financial
					    information (such as credit card number, expiration date). This information
					    is used for billing purposes and to fill customer’s orders. If we have
					trouble processing an order, the information is used to contact the user.</p>

					<div class="content-block privacy">
						<div class="subhead">Information Use</div>
					</div>

					<p><strong>Profile</strong><br>
					  We store information that we collect through cookies, log files, clear gifs,
					    and/or third parties to create a profile of our users. A profile is stored
					    information that we keep on individual users that details their viewing preferences.
					We do not sell any personally identifiable information to third parties. </p>

					<p><strong>Cookies</strong><br>
					  A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user’s computer tied to information
					  about the user. We use session ID cookies to keep track of a user’s order
					  when they move through our site. For the session ID cookie, once users close
					  the browser, the cookie simply terminates. Cookies are required for ordering
					from Hydra Network. See <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_cookie" target="_blank">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_cookie</a> for more information.</p>
					<p><strong>Log Files</strong><br>
					  Like most standard Web site servers we use log files. This includes internet
					    protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit
					    pages, platform type, date/time stamp, and number of clicks to analyze trends,
					    administer the site, track user’s movement in the aggregate, and gather
					    broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses, etc. are not
					linked to personally identifiable information.</p>
					<p><strong>Clear Gifs (Web Beacons/Web Bugs)</strong><br>

					  We employ a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs),
					    that help us better manage content on our site by informing us what content
					    is effective. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar
					    in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web
					    users. The main difference between the two is that clear gifs are invisible
					    on the page and are much smaller, about the size of the period at the end
					    of this sentence. Clear gifs are tied to users’ personally identifiable
					    information to allow us to keep track of the orders of users that have entered
					our site via third-party advertising.</p>
					<p>In addition, we use clear gifs in our HTML-based emails to let us know which
					  emails have been opened by the recipients. This allows us to gauge the effectiveness
					  of certain communications and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns.
					  If users would like to opt-out of these emails, please see the Opt-out section. </p>

					<div class="content-block privacy">
						<div class="subhead">Communications from the Site</div>
					</div>

					<p><strong>Special Offers and Updates</strong><br>
					We send all new customers a welcoming email to verify their password and username.
					  Established members will occasionally receive information on products, services,
					  and special deals. Out of respect for the privacy of our users we present the
					  option to not receive these types of communications. Please see the Choice
					  and Opt-out sections.</p>
					<p><strong>Customer Service</strong><br>
					  We communicate with users on a regular basis to provide requested services
					    and in regards to issues relating to their account we reply via email or
					phone, in accordance with the users’ wishes.</p>

					<p><strong>Sharing</strong><br>
					  Legal Disclaimer<br>
					  Though we make every effort to preserve user privacy, we may need to disclose
					  personal information when required by law wherein we have a good-faith belief
					  that such action is necessary to comply with a current judicial proceeding,
					  a court order or legal process served on our Web site. We do not sell any personally
					  identifiable information to third parties.</p>
					<p><strong>Aggregate Information (non-personally identifiable)</strong><br>
					  We do not share aggregated demographic information with our partners and advertisers.
					    However, we do store aggregate data so that we provide outside sources with
					    general traffic statistics from our website (for example, we may use aggregate
					    information in a press release that states “traffic at Hydra Network
					increased 40% this week.”)</p>
					<p><strong>Choice/Opt-out</strong><br>

					  Our users are given the opportunity to ‘opt-out’ of having their
					  information used for purposes not directly related to our site by changing
					  their profile preferences. Every user will receive an email confirmation of
					  their username and password as well as instructions for how to login to their
					account. </p>
					<p>Users who no longer wish to receive our promotional communications may opt-out
					  of receiving these communications by emailing us at <a href="mailto:unsubscribe@hydranetwork.com">unsubscribe@hydranetwork.com</a>.
					  We also offer an opt-out mechanism on the user profile page or the user may
					  contact us at 8581 Santa Monica Blvd #707, Los Angeles, CA 90069 to opt-out.</p>
					<p>Users of our site are always notified when their information is being collected
					  by any outside parties. We do this so our users can make an informed choice
					  as to whether or not they should proceed with services that require an outside
					  party.</p>
					<p><strong>Links</strong><br>
					  This Web site contains links to other sites. Please be aware that we,
					    Hydra Network, are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other
					    sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to
					    read the privacy statements of each and every Web site that collects personally
					    identifiable information. This privacy statement applies solely to information
					collected by this Web site. </p>

					<p><strong>Security</strong><br>
					  This Web site takes every precaution to protect our users’ information.
					  When users submit sensitive information via the Web site, their information
					is protected both online and off-line.</p>
					<p>When our registration/order form asks users to enter sensitive information
					  (such as credit card number and/or social security number), that information
					  is encrypted and is protected with the best encryption software in the industry
					  - SSL. While on a secure page, such as our order form, the lock icon on the
					  bottom of Web browsers such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer
					  becomes locked, as opposed to un-locked, or open, when users are just ‘surfing’.
					  To learn more about SSL, follow this link <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Sockets_Layer" target="_blank">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Sockets_Layer</a>. </p>
					<p>While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also
					  do everything in our power to protect user-information off-line. All of our
					  users’ information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above,
					  is restricted in our offices. Only employees who need the information to perform
					  a specific job (for example, our billing clerk or a customer service representative)
					  are granted access to personally identifiable information. Furthermore, all
					  employees are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy practices. Every
					  time new policies are added, our employees are notified and/or reminded about
					  the importance we place on privacy, and what they can do to ensure our users’ information
					  is protected. Finally, the servers that store personally identifiable information
					  are in a secure Class-A environment, behind a locked cage in a locked facility
					  that employs biometric security measures to restrict access physical access. </p>

					<p>If users have any questions about the security at our Web site, users can
					  send an email to <a href="mailto:support@hydranetwork.com">support@hydranetwork.com</a>.</p>
					<p><strong>Correcting/Updating/Deleting/Deactivating Personal Information</strong><br>
					  If a user’s personally identifiable information changes (such as zip
					  code, phone, email or postal address), or if a user no longer desires our service,
					  we provide a way to correct, update or delete/deactivate users’ personally
					  identifiable information. This can usually be done by emailing our Customer
					Support at <a href="mailto:support@hydranetwork.com">support@hydranetwork.com</a>.</p>
					<p><strong>Notification of Changes</strong><br>
					  If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes to this
					    privacy statement, the homepage, and other places we deem appropriate so
					    our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it,
					    and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. We will use information
					in accordance with the privacy policy under which the information was collected. </p>

					<p>If, however, we are going to use users’ personally identifiable information
					  in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection we will notify
					  users via email. Users will have a choice as to whether or not we use their
					  information in this different manner. However, if users have opted out of all
					  communication with the site, or deleted/deactivated their account, then they
					  will not be contacted, nor will their personal information be used in this
					  new manner.<br>
					    <br>
