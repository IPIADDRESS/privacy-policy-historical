                        <br>
                  The information collection, use, and dissemination practices 
                  of HydraMediaGroup.com (the "Company") are discussed in this 
                  policy. <br>
                  1. Collection of Information. <br>
                  1.1 Survey Information. The Company collects information from 
                  individuals when an individual voluntarily completes a Company 
                  survey or order form or a registration page either online or 
                  offline, or by means of online or offline surveys or order forms 
                  or registration pages operated by third parties (collectively, 
                  a "Survey"). (As used herein, "online" means 
                  using the Internet and related technologies, and "offline" 
                  means by methods other than online, including in person, in 
                  the mail, using telephone and cell phones, and other methods 
                  of communication including future technologies.) In the Surveys, 
                  the Company or the third party (the "Third Party") 
                  may ask an individual to provide various information to the 
                  Company, which may include his or her name, email address, street 
                  address, zip code, telephone numbers (including cell phone numbers 
                  and carriers), birth date, gender, salary range, education and 
                  marital status, occupation, employment information, personal 
                  and online interests, and such other information as may requested 
                  from time to time (together, "Survey Information"). 
                  Completing the Surveys is completely voluntary, and individuals 
                  are under no obligation to provide Survey Information to the 
                  Company or Third Party, but an individual may receive incentives 
                  from the Company or a Third Party in exchange for providing 
                  Survey Information to the Company. <br>
                  1.2 Third Party List Information. The Company collects information 
                  from individuals when an individual provides information to 
                  a third party, and the Company subsequently purchases or otherwise 
                  acquires the information from the third party (the "Seller"). 
                  Such purchased information may include an individual’s 
                  name, email address, street address, zip code, telephone numbers 
                  (including cell phone numbers and carriers), birth date, gender, 
                  salary range, education and marital status, occupation, industry 
                  of employment, personal and online interests, and such other 
                  information as the individual may have provided to the Seller 
                  (together, "Third Party List Information"). When acquiring 
                  Third Party List Information, the Company seeks assurances from 
                  the Seller that the Seller has a right to transfer the Third 
                  Party List Information to the Company and that the Seller has 
                  a right to provide promotional offers to the individuals whose 
                  personal information is included on the list. <br>
                  1.3 Other Information. Other occasions when the Company requests 
                  personal information include (1) when an individual is making 
                  a claim for a prize or seeking to redeem an incentive offered 
                  by the Company or by a third party, (2) when an individual requests 
                  assistance through Company’s customer service department, 
                  and (3) when an individual voluntarily subscribes to a Company 
                  service or newsletter (together, "Other Information"). 
                  <br>
                  1.4 Cookie and Webbug Information. The Company uses cookie and 
                  webbug technology to associate certain Internet-related information 
                  about an individual with information about the individual in 
                  our database ("Cookie and Webbug Information"). A 
                  cookie is a small amount of data stored on the hard drive of 
                  the individual’s computer which allows Company to identify 
                  the individual with his or her corresponding data that resides 
                  in Company’s database. You may wish to read more about 
                  cookies at www.cookiecentral.com. Individuals who use certain 
                  of Company’s web sites need to accept cookies in order 
                  to use of all of the features and functionality of the web sites. 
                  A "webbug" is an &lt;img src="x"&gt; link 
                  (for more information on webbugs and how webbugs are created, 
                  please see www.www.org or http://www.privacyfoundation.org/resources/webbug.asp#1)on 
                  an Internet page or in an email message that can be used to 
                  monitor who is reading the web page or email message. The following 
                  information can be sent to Company’s computer when a webbug 
                  is viewed: the Internet protocol (or IP) address of an individual’s 
                  computer, the URL of the page where the webbug is located, the 
                  time at which the webbug was viewed, the type of browser that 
                  received the webbug, and a previously set cookie. If information 
                  about the individual who receives the webbug is in Company’s 
                  records, Company may associate the information received from 
                  the webbug with other information about the individual by using 
                  the cookie. <br>
                  1.5 Outside Information. The Company may receive information 
                  about individuals from third parties ("Outside Information"). 
                  <br>
                  1.6 No Information Collected from Children. The Company does 
                  not intentionally collect personal information from children 
                  who are younger than age 13. Because it does not collect such 
                  information, the Company has no such information to use nor 
                  to disclose to third parties. <br>
                  1.7 Individual Information. As used herein, Individual Information 
                  means Survey Information, Third Party List Information, Other 
                  Information, Cookie and Webbug Information, and Outside Information, 
                  and any other information the Company gathers or receives about 
                  individuals. <br>
                  2. Use of Individual Information. <br>
                  2.1 Discretion to Use Information. The Company may use the Individual 
                  Information for any legally permissible purpose in Company’s 
                  sole discretion. The following paragraphs in Section 2 describe 
                  how the Company currently uses the Individual Information, but 
                  the Company may change or broaden its use at any time. As noted 
                  below, the Company may update this policy from time to time. 
                  The Company may use Individual Information to provide promotional 
                  offers to individuals by means of email advertising, telephone 
                  marketing, direct mail marketing, online banner advertising, 
                  and package stuffers, among other possible uses. <br>
                  2.2 Targeted Advertising. Based on the Individual Information, 
                  the Company attempts to customize and target advertising to 
                  an individual. When an individual is using Company web pages, 
                  the Company uses cookies and webbugs (see Section 2.5 below) 
                  to associate a person with the person’s Individual Information, 
                  and the Company attempts to show advertising for products and 
                  services in which the person has expressed an interest in the 
                  Surveys and otherwise. The Company may, at its discretion, target 
                  advertising by using email, direct mail, telephones, cell phones, 
                  and other means of communication to provide promotional offers. 
                  <br>
                  2.3 Email. The Company uses Individual Information to provide 
                  promotional offers by email to individuals. The Company may 
                  maintain separate email lists for different purposes. If email 
                  recipients wish to end their email subscription from a particular 
                  list, they need to follow the instructions at the end of each 
                  email message to unsubscribe from the particular list. To unsubscribe 
                  from all Company email lists, a person must visit and follow 
                  the instructions provided at www.HydraMediaGroup.com. <br>
                  2.4 Direct Mail and Telemarketing. The Company uses Individual 
                  Information to advertise, directly or indirectly to individuals 
                  using direct mail marketing, on telemarketing using telephones 
                  and cell phones. <br>
                  2.5 Use of Cookies and Webbugs. The Company uses the Cookie 
                  and Webbug Information (1) to match a person’s Cookie 
                  and Webbug Information to other categories of Individual Information 
                  to make and improve a profile of a person, (2) to track a person’s 
                  web browsing habits on Company web sites and on the sites of 
                  its marketing partners, (3) to determine which areas of Company’s 
                  web sites are most frequently visited. This information helps 
                  the Company to better understand the online habits of individuals 
                  so that the Company can attempt to customize and target advertising 
                  and promotions to them. <br>
                  2.6 Profiles of Individuals. The Company uses Individual Information 
                  to make a profile of a person. A profile is created by associating 
                  the various sources of Individual Information. <br>
                  2.7 Storage of Individual Information. The Company stores the 
                  Individual Information in a database on Company computers. Our 
                  computers have security measures (such as a firewall) in place 
                  to protect against the loss, misuse and alteration of the information 
                  under Company’s control. Notwithstanding such measures, 
                  the Company cannot guarantee that its security measures will 
                  prevent the Company computers from being illegally accessed, 
                  and the Individual Information on them stolen or altered, and 
                  the Company assumes no responsibility for such actions. <br>
                  3. Dissemination of Individual Information. <br>
                  3.1 Sale or Transfer to Third Parties. The Company may sell 
                  or transfer Individual Information to third parties for any 
                  purpose in Company’s discretion. <br>
                  3.2 Order Fulfillment. The Company will transfer Individual 
                  Information to third parties when necessary to provide a product 
                  or service that a person orders from such third party while 
                  using Company web sites or when responding to offers provided 
                  by Company. <br>
                  3.3 Legal Process. The Company may disclose Individual Information 
                  to respond to subpoenas, court orders, and other legal process. 
                  <br>
                  3.4 Summary Data. The Company may sell or transfer non-individualized 
                  information, such as summary or aggregated anonymous information 
                  about all persons or sub-groups of persons. <br>
                  4. Privacy Practices of Third Parties. <br>
                  4.1 Advertiser cookies and webbugs. Advertising agencies, advertising 
                  networks, and other companies (together, "Advertisers") 
                  who place advertisements on Company web sites may use their 
                  own cookies and webbugs on your computer and collect information 
                  from such cookies and webbugs. The Company does not control 
                  the Advertisers’ use of their own cookies and webbugs 
                  and the Company has no responsibility for such cookies and webbugs 
                  and the use of information gathered from them. <br>
                  4.2 Links. The Company’s web sites and email messages 
                  sometimes contain hypertext links to the web sites of third 
                  parties. The Company is not responsible for the privacy practices 
                  or the content of such other web sites. <br>
                  4.3 Disclosure of Information in Chat Rooms. Individuals should 
                  be aware that if they disclose personally identifiable information 
                  (for example, their name, address, telephone number, or email 
                  address) in chat rooms on Company sites, that information can 
                  be collected and used by third parties and may result in unsolicited 
                  messages from third parties, among other things. Such activities 
                  are beyond the control of the Company, and Company recommends 
                  that individuals use caution when disclosing personal information. 
                  <br>
                  4.4 Affiliated Companies. The Company may disclose, transfer 
                  and sell Individual Information to entities affiliated with 
                  Company in Company’s discretion. <br>
                  5. Deleting Individual Information. Individuals have the ability 
                  to request deletion of their Individual Information by sending
