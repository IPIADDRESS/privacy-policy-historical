You can choose not to receive any more e-mails at any time (in accordance with <a href="#9">Subsection 9. (Choice/Opt-Out)</a> below). However, such choice will not affect the sending of emails that are strictly required to perform the business relationship between you and SAP.</p> <p>Depending on how your e-mail application is set up, information about you may be transmitted automatically when you send e-mail to SAP.</p> <p>If you choose to register for third-party services, we may need to send some information from your registration with SAP to the service provider, possibly including your e-mail address.</p> <p style="font-size:16px; line-height:25px;"><a href="#top"><font style="color:#000000;"><b><u>»&nbsp;Back to Top</u></b></font></a></p></div></div> <div id="3" class="spof"><hr> <div class="spof-text-big">3.

These forms may in addition to the information described above collect your financial information, such as your banking details or credit card numbers.

IP Addresses</div> <div class="spof-text"><p>We use IP addresses to help diagnose problems, to establish the country from where a user is using our websites and services in order to provide appropriate legal statements, to administer our website, and to gather demographic information as further stated in the below <a href="#5">Subsection 5 (Automated Tools)</a>.</p> <p>We may also use IP addresses or other information, as further explained in <a href="#5">Subsection 5 (Automated Tools)</a> below you have shared on this website or at any earlier occasion or a campaign code, to determine which pages on our sites are being visited and topics that may be of interest so we can provide you with information about relevant products and services.</p> <p>SAP may also collect IP addresses (and other technical information such as browser type) during a Click-to-Chat or Click-to-Call session that you initiate. This information is collected when you connect to SAP so that we may identify your session, deliver content based on the technical capabilities of your browser, and for quality control purposes. Your IP address will not be used to identify you unless you provide your prior consent.</p> <p>SAP will only gather information related to your visit to the SAP site. We do not track or collect Personal Data from your visits to companies or entities outside the SAP Group of companies beyond the information stated above in the <a href="#III">Subsection III. (Collection and Processing of Your Personal Data)</a>.</p> <p style="font-size:16px; line-height:25px;"><a href="#top"><font style="color:#000000;"><b><u>»&nbsp;Back to Top</u></b></font></a></p></div></div> <div id="5" class="spof"><hr> <div class="spof-text-big">5. Automated Tools</div> <div class="spof-text"><p>In addition to the information you provide, SAP may also collect information during your visit to a SAP website through Automated Tools, which include Web beacons, cookies, embedded Web links, and other commonly used information-gathering tools. These tools collect certain standard information that your browser sends to our website such as your browser type and language, access times, and the address of the website from which you arrived at an SAP website. Using these tools, SAP is also able to confirm receipt of e-mails that the recipient consented to receive, and can track other information such as pages visited on the relevant SAP site and whether or not the recipient registers for an event offered by SAP and certain other aggregate data that is not related to a particular individual.</p> <p>Unless another mean to make your choice is listed below, you may refuse the use of Automated Tools like cookies (i) if the relevant website supports TRUSTe Consent Manager by clicking on the respective link in the footer of the website or, (ii) if TRUSTe Consent Manager is not available, by selecting the appropriate settings in your browser. Kindly note that in the latter case the settings in your browser regarding cookies are limited to the particular browser installed on a particular device and that, as a consequence, if you visit SAP’s websites with different browsers or different devices, you have to disable the tracking cookies in the browsers of all relevant devices. However kindly further note that if you do this you may not be able to use the full functionality of the relevant site.</p> <p>SAP is in particular currently using the following Automated Tools for the purposes set out below.</p> <p>&nbsp;<br><b>a. Adobe Analytics</b></p> <p>Some websites which refer to this Privacy Statement use Adobe Analytics. Adobe Analytics is using IP addresses to establish the approximate region where a user is coming from. Therefore, Adobe Analytics is collecting the full IP address of users in a first step and then anonymizes it in a second step. Only the anonymized IP address is used to determine the approximate location from where a user is accessing a certain website.</p> <p>Furthermore, if you are a registered user and logged on, SAP uses Adobe Analytics to track your user ID together with how you use the relevant website.</p> <p>In addition to an opt-out by way of the TRUSTe Consent Manager (where available) you can opt-out of the use of Adobe Analytics by using this link: <a target="_blank" href="http://sap.d1.sc.omtrdc.net/optout.html?optout=1&amp;confirm_change=1">http://sap.d1.sc.omtrdc.net/optout.html?optout=1&amp;confirm_change=1</a></p> <p>&nbsp;<br><b>b. Adobe Target</b></p> <p>Some websites which refer to this Privacy Statement use Adobe Target. Adobe Target assigns a user ID to each user who does not opt-out of the tracking as described below and then creates a user profile based on this user ID by adding information about the user’s (i) browser and other device specific information, (ii) information about usage behavior and (iii) location data. Location data is collected by way of analyzing the user’s anonymized IP address: Adobe Target is collecting the full IP address of users in a first step and then anonymizes it in a second step. Only the anonymized IP address is used to determine the approximate location from where a user is accessing a certain website.</p> <p>This information is used to display targeted content on the SAP group websites using Adobe Target.</p> <p>In addition to an opt-out by way of the TRUSTe Consent Manager (where available) you can opt-out of the use of Adobe Analytics by using this link: <a target="_blank" href="http://sap.d1.sc.omtrdc.net/optout.html?optout=1&amp;confirm_change=1">http://sap.d1.sc.omtrdc.net/optout.html?optout=1&amp;confirm_change=1</a></p> <p>&nbsp;<br><b>c. Google Analytics</b></p> <p>Some websites which refer to this Privacy Statement use Google Analytics. Google Analytics uses cookies, which are text files placed on your computer to help the website analyze how users use the site. The information generated by the cookie about your use of the website (including your IP address) will be transmitted to and stored by Google on servers in the United States. Google will use this information for the purpose of evaluating your use of the website, compiling reports on site activity for site operators and providing other services relating to site activity and internet usage.</p> <p>Google may also transfer this information to third parties where required to do so by law, or where such third parties process the information on Google's behalf. Google will not associate your IP address with any other data held by Google.</p> <p>In addition to an opt-out by way of TRUSTe Consent Manager (where available), Google has developed the Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on. It provides website visitors more choice on how their data is collected by Google Analytics. The add-on communicates with the Google Analytics JavaScript (ga.js) to indicate that information about the website visit should not be sent to Google Analytics. It can be downloaded here: <a target="_blank" href="http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en">http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en</a></p> <p>&nbsp;<br><b>d. SAP Web Analytics</b></p> <p>Some websites which refer to this Privacy Statement use SAP Web Analytics (<b>“SWA”</b>). SWA helps to analyze how users use the relevant site. The information generated (including a part of your IP address and a browser-ID) will be transmitted to and stored by SAP. SAP will use this information only for the purpose of evaluating your use of the website and compiling reports on website activity for website operators – and finally, to improve SAP’s websites.</p> <p>Each website which uses SWA contains a separate statement regarding such use and provides for an option of the user to opt-out of the tracking by SWA either directly in the relevant statement or by way of the TRUSTe Consent Manager which can be reached over a link on the relevant page (where available).</p> <p>&nbsp;<br><b>e. Usage tracking for marketing purposes</b></p> <p>Certain SAP websites may collect the way you are accessing and using such websites by other means in order to prepare pseudonymous usage profiles that are used to determine which content is the most appropriate to be displayed while you visit a certain website.</p> <p>In this case, SAP is capturing your usage behavior together with a unique identifier (that allows SAP to establish that there is a certain person active on its websites) but no information like your name that can be used to directly identify you. SAP will use the collected information only in order to display appropriate and relevant content on its websites. Each SAP website making use of such tracking mechanism will contain further information about the collected information as well as an opt-out choice.</p> <p>&nbsp;<br><b>f. Embedded Web Links</b></p> <p>Emails from SAP often use links designed to lead you to a relevant area on the Web, after redirection through SAP's servers. The redirection system allows SAP to change the destination URL of these links, if necessary, and to determine the effectiveness of our marketing initiatives.</p> <p>In emails, such links may also allow SAP to determine if you have clicked on a link in the email, and the information about this interaction may be connected to your personal identity. If you do not want SAP to collect information about the links you clicked, you can simply choose not to click on the links in an e-mail that SAP sends you.</p> <p>&nbsp;<br><b>g. Cookies</b></p> <p>Cookies are identifiers that can be sent from a site via your browser to be placed on your computer's hard drive. SAP uses cookies to deliver personalized content, to save you having to re-enter your password or complete registration forms repeatedly, to keep track of your shopping cart, and to tailor our information offerings to how you and others use the site.</p> <p>We offer to you the following two ways to make your choice regarding SAP’s use of cookies:</p> <p>aa. Some websites of SAP use the TRUSTe Consent Manager to enable users to make their choices regarding SAP’s use of cookies. Wherever the TRUSTe Consent Manager is used, you will find in a footer a link to it. Please click on that link to access the TRUSTe Consent Manager and to make your choice regarding SAP’s use of cookies.</p> <p>bb. In case a SAP website does not use the TRUSTe Consent Manager, you may refuse the use of cookies by selecting the appropriate settings in your browser. Kindly note that the settings in your browser regarding cookies is limited to the particular browser installed on a particular device and that, as a consequence, if you visit SAP’s websites with different browsers or different devices, you have to disable the cookies in the browsers of all relevant devices. Furthermore, please note that if you disable cookies you may not be able to use the full functionality of a website.</p> <p style="font-size:16px; line-height:25px;"><a href="#top"><font style="color:#000000;"><b><u>»&nbsp;Back to Top</u></b></font></a></p></div></div> <div id="6" class="spof"><hr> <div class="spof-text-big">6. Sharing Your Personal Data</div> <div class="spof-text"><p>As a member of a global group of companies, SAP operates a number of websites around the world. Any data and information that you volunteer or that is otherwise collected on one of our sites in any one country may be sent electronically to a server for one of these sites in another country. Such servers or other types of data processing facilities may be located within or outside the European Economic Area or third countries that are regarded by the EU Commission as featuring an adequate level of data protection. However, we safeguard your privacy interests around the world by ensuring that this SAP website adheres to our data protection principles described in this statement. All companies of the SAP group (including, for the avoidance of doubt, all SAP companies as well as all Ariba, SuccessFactors, Hybris, Sybase, Business Objects, Fieldglass, Concur, Multiposting and SeeWhy companies) may use the information internationally in connection with processing your inquiries and orders, in order to provide services to you, to help improve our products and services to keep you up to date about the latest IT product announcements, software updates, software upgrades, security patches, system enhancements, special offers, for processing and storage and for all other purposes set out in the section “Use and Purpose of Collected Personal Data” above. This includes that all companies of the SAP group may provide you with marketing materials if (depending on the country in which the relevant SAP group company operates) you have granted your prior consent and/or unless you have opted out of receiving marketing materials.</p> <p>We may also share such information with business partners, service vendors, authorized third-party agents or contractors (such as Google, Inc. or Adobe Systems Inc.) in order to provide a requested service or transaction, including processing orders, processing credit card transactions, hosting websites, hosting event and seminar registration and providing customer support, providing you with information on products and services that may be of interest to you or in order to analyze the user behavior on our webpages (e.g. in case of Adobe Analytics or Google Analytics).</p> <p>We only provide these third parties with the minimum amount of Personal Data necessary to provide the services on our behalf, and the third parties are (where legally required) bound by appropriate order data processing agreements and/or comprehensive confidentiality undertakings and therefore not permitted to use your Personal Data except for the limited purpose of completing the requested service or transaction.</p> <p>We do not sell or rent your Personal Data to third parties for marketing purposes unless you have granted us permission to do so.</p> <p>We may respond to subpoenas, court orders, or legal process by disclosing your Personal Data and other related information, if necessary. We also may choose to establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims.</p> <p>Circumstances may arise where, whether for strategic or other business reasons, SAP decides to sell, buy, merge or otherwise reorganize businesses in some countries. Such a transaction may involve, in accordance with applicable law, the disclosure of Personal Data to prospective or actual purchasers, or the receipt of it from sellers. It is SAP's practice to seek appropriate protection for information in these types of transactions.</p> <p>We may collect and share Personal Data and any other additional information available to us in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of SAP's terms of use, or as otherwise required by law.</p> <p>While visiting SAP's website you may be directed to content or functionality that is hosted by a third-party supplier. Most often, this is done to host special events, such as contests or seminars. When information is collected on behalf of SAP exclusively, the appropriate SAP entity's privacy statement will be referenced on the website and will govern how information is used. For other, non-SAP sites, the site's owner's privacy policy will be referenced. It is SAP's practice to require such suppliers and business partners to handle information in a manner consistent with SAP's privacy statement.</p> <p style="font-size:16px; line-height:25px;"><a href="#top"><font style="color:#000000;"><b><u>»&nbsp;Back to Top</u></b></font></a></p></div></div> <div id="7" class="spof"><hr> <div class="spof-text-big">7.
