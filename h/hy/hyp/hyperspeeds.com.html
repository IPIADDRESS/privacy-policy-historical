<h3>Website Visitors</h3>
<p>Like most website operators, hyperspeeds.com collects   non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and   servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language   preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor   request. hyperspeeds.com purpose in collecting non-personally   identifying information is to better understand how hyperspeeds's   visitors use its website. From time to time, hyperspeeds.com may release   non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by   publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.</p>
<p>hyperspeeds.com also collects potentially personally-identifying   information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. hyperspeeds.com does   not use such information to identify its visitors, however, and does not   disclose such information, other than under the same circumstances that   it uses and discloses personally-identifying information, as described   below.</p>
<h3>Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</h3>
<p>Certain visitors to hyperspeeds.com websites choose to interact   with hyperspeeds.com in ways that require hyperspeeds.com to gather   personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information   that hyperspeeds.com gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For   example, we ask visitors who use our forums to provide a username and   email address. In each case, hyperspeeds.com collects such information   only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of   the visitor’s interaction with hyperspeeds.com. hyperspeeds.com does not   disclose personally-identifying information other than as described   below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying   information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in   certain website-related activities.</p>
<h3>Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information</h3>
<p>hyperspeeds.com discloses potentially personally-identifying and   personally-identifying information only to those of its employees,   contractors, and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that   information in order to process it on hyperspeeds.com behalf or to   provide services available at hyperspeeds's websites, and (ii) that   have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees,   contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your   home country; by using hyperspeeds's websites, you consent to the   transfer of such information to them. hyperspeeds.com will not rent or   sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying   information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors, and   affiliated organizations, as described above, hyperspeeds.com discloses   potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying   information only when required to do so by law, or when hyperspeeds.com   believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to   protect the property or rights of hyperspeeds.com, third parties, or the   public at large. If you are a registered user of a hyperspeeds. website   and have supplied your email address, hyperspeeds.com may occasionally   send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback,   or just keep you up to date with what’s going on with hyperspeeds.com and   our products. We primarily use our blog to communicate this type of   information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If   you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our   feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to   help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other   users. hyperspeeds.com takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect   against the unauthorized access, use, alteration, or destruction of   potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying   information.</p>
