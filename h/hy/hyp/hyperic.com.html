      <p><br>
        By accessing or using this Web site operated by Hyperic LLC ("Hyperic"), you agree to the terms of the Hyperic Online Privacy Policy, as outlined below. If you do not agree to these terms, please do not access or use this site. <br>

        <br>
        When you engage in certain activities on this site, such as ordering products, downloading software, or entering contests, Hyperic may ask you to provide certain information about yourself by filling out and submitting an online form. It is completely optional for you to engage in these activities. If you elect to engage in these activities, however, Hyperic may require that you provide us personal information, such as your name, mailing address, e-mail address, and other personal identifying information.

        <br>
        Hyperic collects this information in order to record and support your participation in the activities you select. If you order a product, for example, the information is used to register your license and rights, if any, to technical support, upgrade discounts, or other benefits that may be made available to registered users. If you enter a contest, information is collected to qualify the entry and contact you regarding the contest or prize awards. Hyperic also uses information that you provide as part of our effort to keep you informed about product upgrades, special offers, and other Hyperic products and services. <br>
        <br>
        Hyperic recognizes and appreciates the importance of responsible use of this information. If you do not want the information you provide to Hyperic to be used to inform you of other products and special offers from Hyperic, and you indicate this preference when you provide the information to Hyperic, Hyperic will honor your preference. In addition, Hyperic may selectively provide certain information to other companies or organizations that have products or services we think may interest you. If you do not want the information you provide to Hyperic to be shared with other companies, and you indicate this preference when you provide the information to Hyperic, Hyperic will honor your preference. When you submit personal information to Hyperic with respect to a particular activity, such as ordering a product, you understand and agree that in order to complete the activity and update related files, Hyperic and its subsidiaries, affiliates and trusted vendors may need to transfer, store, and process your information in any of the countries in which such entities maintain offices, including without limitation, the United States. Your personal information will not be transferred outside of the European Union for any other purpose unless you give your consent. <br>
