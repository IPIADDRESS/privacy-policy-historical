<h2>Your privacy is protected:</h2>
<p>In the course of your dealings with hyperWALLET, you will share some of your important personal information with us. Your privacy is important to us and we understand the sensitive nature of this information. hyperWALLET is vigilant in its efforts to ensure that information about its users is protected.</p>
<p>Our Privacy Policy provides you with all of the safeguards set forth in the Canadian Federal Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA) and in other applicable personal information protection legislation ("Privacy Laws"). Nothing in this Privacy Policy will limit our rights and obligations pursuant to such Privacy Laws.</p>
<h2>CONSENT</h2>
<p>BY SUBMITTING PERSONAL INFORMATION TO HYPERWALLET OR ITS SERVICE PROVIDERS AND AGENTS, YOU AGREE THAT HYPERWALLET AND ITS SERVICE PROVIDERS AND AGENTS MAY COLLECT, USE AND DISCLOSE SUCH PERSONAL INFORMATION IN ACCORDANCE WITH THIS PRIVACY POLICY AND AS PERMITTED OR REQUIRED BY PRIVACY LAWS. Subject to legal and contractual requirements, you may refuse or withdraw your consent to certain of the identified purposes at any time by contacting the hyperWALLET Privacy Officer. If you refuse or withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide you or continue to provide you with certain services or information which may be of value to you. If you provide hyperWALLET or its service providers and agents with personal information of another individual, you represent that you have all necessary authority and/or have obtained all necessary consents from such person to enable us to collect, use and disclose such personal information for the purposes set forth in this Privacy Policy.</p>
<h3>WHAT PERSONAL INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT?</h3>
<p>Personal information means any information about you except your business contact information.</p>
<p>The types of personal information that hyperWALLET may collect from you include: your name, home address, telephone number, personal e-mail address, your forwarding address (e.g. during a vacation), previous address(es), billing and account information (such as credit card, or bank account number), your mailing preferences, delivery instructions, and customer service preferences. In addition, from time to time, we may ask you to provide us with more detailed information regarding your interests, occupation and background. For example, we sometimes ask our customers to complete surveys in order to get a better sense of who they are and what issues, products or services may be of interest to our clients.</p>
<h2>hyperWALLET's PRIVACY PRINCIPLES</h2>
<p>hyperWALLET collects, uses and discloses your personal information by employing "fair information practices" as described in the following privacy principles and embodied in Privacy Laws:</p>
<h2>1.&nbsp;ACCOUNTABILITY:</h2>
<h3>Accountability for hyperWALLET's compliance with this Privacy Policy rests with hyperWALLET's Privacy Officer. The Privacy Officer may delegate other individuals to act in his or her behalf. hyperWALLET is responsible for all personal information under its control.</h3>
<p>hyperWALLET is committed to ensuring that appropriate security measures are employed in the storage or transfer of sensitive information. However, in relation to e-mail or wireless communication, complete confidentiality and security cannot be assured. Remember that e-mail sent over the Internet is generally unencrypted. We recommend that you use caution when contacting us via e-mail and that you do not include confidential information (such as financial institution account numbers) in those messages, as they are not encrypted. hyperWALLET is not accountable for any damages suffered when a user transmits personal information through e-mail or wireless communication to hyperWALLET or when hyperWALLET transmits personal information via e-mail or wireless communication to a client on request.</p>
<h2>2.&nbsp;IDENTIFYING PURPOSES:</h2>
<h3>The purposes for which personal information is collected shall be identified by hyperWALLET before or at the time the information is collected.</h3>
<p>There are certain specific reasons why hyperWALLET needs to collect your personal information:</p>
<ul><li>to establish your identity and obtain contact information for you;</li>
<li>to process transactions;</li>
<li>to protect you and us from error and fraud;</li>
<li>to develop and manage our business and operations;</li>
<li>to distribute our news letters and other material to individuals on our mail and e-mail lists, including via third party mailing houses and e-mail service providers;</li>
<li>to understand and respond to your needs and preferences, including to contact and communicate with you and to conduct surveys, research and evaluations;</li>
<li>to prevent potentially prohibited or illegal activity, and to enforce our User Agreement;</li>
<li>to develop, enhance, market, sell or otherwise provide our products and services;</li>
<li>as permitted by, and to comply with, any legal or regulatory requirements or provisions; and</li>
<li>for any purpose to which you consent.</li>
<li>To ensure the accuracy of your instructions and to monitor the quality of service, hyperWALLET may record its telephone calls. If you have concerns about the recording of your telephone conversations, you should contact us by e-mail or by regular mail. hyperWALLET collects, uses, and discloses personal information only for purposes that are directly related to the processing of transactions, and that a reasonable person would consider appropriate under those circumstances.</li>
</ul><h2>3.&nbsp;CONSENT:</h2>
<h3>The knowledge and consent of the individual are required for the collection, use or disclosure of personal information, except as provided by law.</h3>
<p>Your knowledge and consent are required before we may collect, use or release your personal information to anyone outside of hyperWALLET, except in special circumstances. These special circumstances include times when your consent is deemed given by law or not required by law. These circumstances may include, but are not limited to, a fraud investigation, an investigation by police, or where the financial institution from which you transferred funds to hyperWALLET is unable to contact you. hyperWALLET may be compelled to release your information by a court of law, or by another legal authority, regulatory authority (including self regulatory authority), or governmental body. In all cases, our policy is to release information only to the extent that we are required to do so.</p>
<p>By entering your personal information on hyperWALLET's website, you are consenting to the collection of that information. hyperWALLET will seek your express consent before disclosing your information for purposes other than those specified in this Policy or that a reasonable person would expect, unless such a request would compromise an investigation.</p>
<h3>You can withdraw your consent after you have given it:</h3>
<p>An individual may withdraw consent at any time, subject to legal or contractual restrictions and reasonable notice. To withdraw your consent you must contact our Privacy Officer, in writing, using the contact information listed in this Policy. If you do not consent to certain uses of information, or if you withdraw your consent, hyperWALLET may not be able to provide you with a particular product or service or we may not be able to provide service to you at all.</p>
<h2>4.&nbsp;LIMITING COLLECTION:</h2>
<h3>The collection of personal information shall be limited to that which is necessary for the purposes identified by hyperWALLET.</h3>
<p>The information shall be collected by fair and lawful means. Personal information shall not be collected indiscriminately. Both the amount and the type of information collected shall be limited to that which is necessary to fulfill the purposes identified.</p>
<h2>5.&nbsp;LIMITING USE, DISCLOSURE, AND RETENTION:</h2>
<h3>Personal information shall not be used or disclosed for purposes other than those for which the information was collected, except with the consent of the individual or as required by law.</h3>
<h3>The information is only used for specific purposes:</h3>
<p>Personal information will only be used or disclosed for the purpose(s) for which it is collected. hyperWALLET will not use personal information for any additional purpose unless we obtain your consent to do so. hyperWALLET will not sell personal information to any third party. If we deem it necessary to disclose your information to a party other than your financial institution, we will obtain your consent prior to the disclosure.</p>
<p>We may also share your personal information with:</p>
<ul><li>hyperWALLET's wholly-owned subsidiaries to provide joint content, products and services, to help detect and prevent potentially illegal acts and violations of our policies, and to guide decisions about their products, services and communications;</li>
<li>third-party service providers under contract who help with parts of our business operations, such as legal compliance, fraud prevention, marketing and technology services;</li>
<li>third parties in the event of the sale, acquisition, merger or amalgamation of some or all of our assets.&nbsp;If your personal information could be used contrary to this Privacy Policy, you will receive prior notice;</li>
<li>other hyperWALLET users to the extent needed to complete transactions with such users; and</li>
<li>law enforcement, government officials or other third parties if we are obligated to do so by a court order, subpoena or similar legal procedure; we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to report suspected illegal activity, to comply with the law, to prevent physical harm of financial loss, or to investigate violations of our User Agreement.</li>
</ul><h3>Your information is destroyed when it is no longer needed:</h3>
<p>hyperWALLET keeps your information only for as long as we need it. Please note that hyperWALLET retains your information for a period of five (5) years after the completion of our services to you in order to assist you in reviewing your historical account information when necessary and to enable us to provide more comprehensive security.</p>
<h2>6.&nbsp;ACCURACY:</h2>
<h3>Personal information shall be as accurate, complete and up-to-date as is necessary for the purposes for which it is used.</h3>
<p>hyperWALLET will make reasonable efforts to ensure that personal information is as accurate, complete and current as required for the purposes for which it was collected. In many cases, hyperWALLET relies on its users to ensure that certain information, such as their address or telephone number, is current, complete and accurate.</p>
<p>You can check your information to verify, update and correct it, and to have any obsolete information removed. You may make your request in writing to our Privacy Officer as set out in this Policy. hyperWALLET will charge a reasonable fee for accessing your information through our Privacy Officer.&nbsp;You may also review and edit your personal information at any time by logging in to your account and clicking "Profile", then "Update" for the information which needs updating.</p>
<h2>7.&nbsp;SAFEGUARDS:</h2>
<h3>Security safeguards appropriate to the sensitivity of the information shall protect personal information.</h3>
<p>Security safeguards shall protect personal information against loss or theft, as well as unauthorized access, disclosure, copying, use or modification. We maintain policies and procedures designed to restrict third party access to your personal information in several ways.&nbsp;These include programs and specifications for physical access controls to our offices and files; we authorize access to personal information only for those employees who require it to fulfill their job responsibilities, and we use&nbsp;electronic security measures such as passwords, encryption, firewalls, and secure connections.</p>
<p>hyperWALLET is not accountable for any damages suffered when a customer transmits personal information through e-mail to hyperWALLET or when hyperWALLET transmits personal information via e-mail in response to a request from the user.</p>
<p>Care shall be used in the disposal or destruction of personal information to prevent unauthorized parties from gaining access to the information.</p>
<h2>8.&nbsp;OPENNESS:</h2>
<h3>Policies and procedures will be made available either electronically or in written format in plain language.</h3>
<p>hyperWALLET is open about the policies and procedures it uses to protect personal information However, to ensure the integrity of our security procedures and business methods, hyperWALLET may refuse to publicly disclose certain information.</p>

<ul><li>The title, e-mail address, and mailing address of the Privacy Officer, and how an individual may contact the Privacy Officer with respect to complaints or inquiries;</li>
<li>A description of the type of personal information held by hyperWALLET including a general explanation of its use;</li>
<li>Information on how an individual can gain access to the personal information held by hyperWALLET by contacting the Privacy Officer, confirming their identity, and requesting specified information; and</li>
<li>An explanation of what personal information is made available to related organizations</li>
</ul><h2>9. INDIVIDUAL ACCESS:</h2>
<h3>You have the right to access your personal information held by hyperWALLET.</h3>
<p>Please make any requests for access in writing to the Privacy Officer, stating as specifically as possible the personal information you are requesting. Upon request, hyperWALLET will, within a reasonable time period or as otherwise required by law, tell you what personal information it has, what it is being used for, and to whom it has been disclosed, if applicable. Before providing any information to the requestor, hyperWALLET must verify the individual's identity.</p>
<p>hyperWALLET may also refuse to provide access where it would reveal personal information about, or the identity of, a third party that cannot be severed from the information about the individual making the request, and in certain other circumstances there needs to be notification of governmental institutions before release. Access may also be refused where the information is protected by solicitor-client privilege; where revealing the information would also reveal commercial information confidential to hyperWALLET; where revealing the information could reasonably be expected to threaten the life, health or security of an individual; if the information was collected during an investigation of a breach of an agreement or a contravention of the laws of Canada or a province on the expectation that the knowledge or consent of the individual would compromise the availability or accuracy of the information; where the information was generated in the course of a formal dispute resolution process; or where access may otherwise be prohibited or limited at law. In such cases, hyperWALLET will explain the reasons it will not provide the requested information.</p>
<h3>We will respond to your request promptly:</h3>
<p>hyperWALLET will deal quickly with your request for access, usually responding to your request within 30 days. If we need to extend the time, or we must refuse your request, we will tell you why, subject to any legal restrictions and we will notify you in writing of the new deadline, the reasons for the extension, and of your right to make a complaint to the relevant privacy commissioner regarding the extension. When an individual successfully demonstrates the inaccuracy or incompleteness of personal information, hyperWALLET must amend the information as required. Depending upon the nature of the information challenged, amendment could involve the correction, deletion or addition of information. Where appropriate, the amended information shall be transmitted to third parties having access to the information in question.</p>
<p>When a challenge is not resolved to the satisfaction of the customer, the substance of the unresolved challenge shall be recorded by hyperWALLET. When appropriate, the existence of the unresolved challenge shall be transmitted to third parties having access to the information in question.</p>
<p>hyperWALLET may charge you a minimal fee for providing access to your personal information provided that we notify you of this cost prior to charging you for such access.</p>
