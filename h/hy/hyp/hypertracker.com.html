<div style="text-align: center; font-size: 12px; font-weight:bold; margin-top: 25px; margin-bottom: 8px">

content, explain the utility of our website and services we provide, and to 
extend their functionality.
<br><br> 
Similar to other commercial websites, the technology called "cookies" may be used to provide you with tailored information. A cookie is a small piece of data that a website can send to your browser, which may then be stored on your hard drive, so we can recognize you when you return. You may be able to set your browser to notify you when you receive a cookie. Our cookies collect general information that enhances our ability to serve you and measure the utility of our website. 
<br><br>
Information we collect may be used to enhance your use of our website, and to provide you with a service that you ordered, arrange the website in the most customer friendly way, communicate special offers and featured items, and/or respond to your questions and suggestions. 
<br><br>
In the case of an agreement, personal information includes data that identifies you as the specific individual, i.e. your name, email address, phone number, geographical address, and/or company name and company address. This information is used to complete the account application process, Customer's information request, and/or to verify the validity of the request, and to process payment. 
<br><br>
We will use this information solely for performing Services and processing payments for those Services that you ordered. 
<br><br>
<strong>Implix collects only personal information that you choose to provide voluntarily registering
to our HyperTracker Service. Implix shall advise you which information is mandatory to provide and what you do not have to enclose.</strong>

	Mailing Policy
</div>

When you send us an email, we use your email address to thank you for your 
comment and/or reply to your question, and we will store your communication and 
our reply for any future correspondence. Beyond our initial reply, we will 
never use your email address to send you any unsolicited message or 
information, nor will we share it with or sell it to anyone else for such use.
<br><br>
When you accept to receive information about our Services, promotions and/or new offers, we use your email address and any other information you give us to provide you with the requested information and/or Services, until you ask us to stop (using the 'unsubscribe' instructions provided with each email, and/or on the site where you signed up, and/or as we otherwise provide). 
<br><br>
When you request information or other Services from us, we use your email address and any other information you give us to provide you with the information and/or other Services that you requested, until you ask us to stop (using the 'unsubscribe' instructions provided with each email, and/or on the site where you signed up, and/or as we otherwise provide), or until the information or Service is no longer available. 
<br><br>
We will never use your email address or other information to provide you with any unsolicited messages or information (unless that is part of the Service you request), nor will we share it with or sell, rent or lease it to any third party for such use.

</div>

Implix recognizes the importance of respecting the privacy of those who decided 
to entrust their sensitive information with you. We assure to make every effort 
to safeguard their security. Implix will never use the information about the 
customers you collect within our services to send any unsolicited messages or 
information, nor will we share it with or sell it to anyone else for such use.

<div style="text-align: center; font-size: 12px; font-weight:bold; margin-top: 25px; margin-bottom: 8px">
	Information Security
</div>

We believe that keeping personal information secure is one of our most significant responsibilities.
<br><br>
We restrict access to personal information about you to those employees and others who need to know that information to assist us in our business, or to provide products or Services to you.
We safeguard personal information, according to the established security standards and procedures, by maintaining physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to the personal data information. 
<br><br>
When we request our Customers to enter sensitive information, such as their name, geographical address, email address, and a credit card number, it is encrypted and protected with the best encryption software in the industry, SSL, and processed through a reputable payment processor <a href="http://www.paylane.com">PayLane</a>. While on the secure page, such as our order form, the lock icon at the bottom of web browsers, e.g. Mozilla Firefox or Microsoft Internet Explorer, becomes locked, as opposed to unlocked or open, when you are just 'surfing'. 
<br><br>
All of our Customers' information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted in our offices. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (e.g. our billing clerk or a Customer Service Representative) are personally granted access to.
<br><br>

<div style="text-align: center; font-size: 12px; font-weight:bold; margin-top: 25px; margin-bottom: 8px">
	Security
</div>

Implix stores its servers in a highly secure server environment, with surveillance and support to prevent unauthorized access and data security. 
<br><br>
We cannot guarantee the security of your data while it is being transmitted over the Internet and through servers that are out of our control. We strive to protect your personal information but Implix cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to our website or Services. Any data transmissions you make over the Internet are done so at your own risk. Once we receive the data transmission, we make our best efforts to ensure its security and privacy on our systems.
