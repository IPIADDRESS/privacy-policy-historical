Welcome to Habitica, the land of productivity, healthy living, and the occasional rampaging gryphon. We have a cheerful community full of helpful people supporting each other on their way to self-improvement.","commGuidePara002":"To help keep everyone safe, happy, and productive in the community, we have some guidelines. We have carefully crafted them to make them as friendly and easy-to-read as possible. Please take the time to read them.","commGuidePara003":"These rules apply to all of the social spaces we use, including (but not necessarily limited to) Trello, GitHub, Transifex, and the Wikia (aka wiki). Sometimes, unforeseen situations will arise, like a new source of conflict or a vicious necromancer. When this happens, the mods may respond by editing these guidelines to keep the community safe from new threats. Fear not: you will be notified by an announcement from Bailey if the guidelines change.","commGuidePara004":"Now ready your quills and scrolls for note-taking, and let's get started!","commGuideHeadingBeing":"Being a Habitican","commGuidePara005":"Habitica is first and foremost a website devoted to improvement. As a result, we've been lucky to attract one of the warmest, kindest, most courteous and supportive communities on the internet. There are many traits that make up Habiticans. Some of the most common and most notable are:","commGuideList01A":"<strong>A Helpful Spirit.</strong> Many people devote time and energy helping out new members of the community and guiding them. The Newbies Guild, for example, is a guild devoted just to answering people's questions. If you think you can help, don't be shy!","commGuideList01B":"<strong>A Diligent Attitude.</strong> Habiticans work hard to improve their lives, but also help build the site and improve it constantly. We're an open-source project, so we are all constantly working to make the site the best place it can be.","commGuideList01C":"<strong>A Supportive Demeanor.</strong> Habiticans cheer for each other's victories, and comfort each other during hard times. We lend strength to each other and lean on each other and learn from each other. In parties, we do this with our spells; in chat rooms, we do this with kind and supportive words.","commGuideList01D":"<strong>A Respectful Manner.</strong> We all have different backgrounds, different skill sets, and different opinions. That's part of what makes our community so wonderful! Habiticans respect these differences and celebrate them. Stick around, and soon you will have friends from all walks of life.","commGuideHeadingMeet":"Meet the Mods!","commGuidePara006":"Habitica has some tireless knight-errants who join forces with the staff members to keep the community calm, contented, and free of trolls. Each has a specific domain, but will sometimes be called to serve in other social spheres. Staff and Mods will often precede official statements with the words \"Mod Talk\" or \"Mod Hat On\".","commGuidePara007":"Staff have purple tags marked with crowns. Their title is \"Heroic\".","commGuidePara008":"Mods have dark blue tags marked with stars. Their title is \"Guardian\". The only exception is Bailey, who, as an NPC, has a black and green tag marked with a star.","commGuidePara009":"The current Staff Members are (from left to right):","commGuidePara009a":"on Trello","commGuidePara009b":"on GitHub","commGuidePara010":"There are also several Moderators who assist the staff members. They were selected carefully, so please give them your respect and listen to their suggestions.","commGuidePara011":"The current Moderators are (from left to right):","commGuidePara011a":"in Tavern chat","commGuidePara011b":"on GitHub/Wikia","commGuidePara011c":"on Wikia","commGuidePara011d":"on GitHub","commGuidePara012":"If you have an issue or concern about a particular Mod, please send an email to Lemoness (<a href=\"mailto:leslie@habitica.com\">leslie@habitica.com</a>).","commGuidePara013":"In a community as big as Habitica, users come and go, and sometimes a moderator needs to lay down their noble mantle and relax. The following are Moderators Emeritus. They no longer act with the power of a Moderator, but we would still like to honor their work!","commGuidePara014":"Moderators Emeritus:","commGuideHeadingPublicSpaces":"Public Spaces In Habitica","commGuidePara015":"Habitica has two kinds of social spaces: public, and private. Public spaces include the Tavern, Public Guilds, GitHub, Trello, and the Wiki. Private spaces are Private Guilds, party chat, and Private Messages.","commGuidePara016":"When navigating the public spaces in Habitica, there are some general rules to keep everyone safe and happy. These should be easy for adventurers like you!","commGuidePara017":"<strong>Respect each other.</strong> Be courteous, kind, friendly, and helpful. Remember: Habiticans come from all backgrounds and have had wildly divergent experiences. This is part of what makes Habitica so cool! Building a community means respecting and celebrating our differences as well as our similarities. Here are some easy ways to respect each other:","commGuideList02A":"<strong>Obey all of the Terms and Conditions.</strong>","commGuideList02B":"<strong>Do not post images or text that are violent, threatening, or sexually explicit/suggestive, or that promote discrimination, bigotry, racism, sexism, hatred, harassment or harm against any individual or group.</strong> Not even as a joke. This includes slurs as well as statements. Not everyone has the same sense of humor, and so something that you consider a joke may be hurtful to another. Attack your Dailies, not each other.","commGuideList02C":"<strong>Keep discussions appropriate for all ages.</strong> We have many young Habiticans who use the site! Let's not tarnish any innocents or hinder any Habiticans in their goals.","commGuideList02D":"<strong>Avoid profanity.</strong> This includes milder, religious-based oaths that may be acceptable elsewhere-we have people from all religious and cultural backgrounds, and we want to make sure that all of them feel comfortable in public spaces. Additionally, slurs will be dealt with very severely, as they are also a violation of the Terms of Service.","commGuideList02E":"<strong>Avoid extended discussions of divisive topics outside of the Back Corner.</strong> If you feel that someone has said something rude or hurtful, do not engage them. A single, polite comment, such as \"That joke makes me feel uncomfortable,\" is fine, but being harsh or unkind in response to harsh or unkind comments heightens tensions and makes Habitica a more negative space. Kindness and politeness helps others understand where you are coming from.","commGuideList02F":"<strong>Comply immediately with any Mod request</strong> to cease a discussion or move it to the Back Corner. Last words, parting shots and conclusive zingers should all be delivered (courteously) at your \"table\" in the Back Corner, if allowed.","commGuideList02G":"<strong>Take time to reflect instead of responding in anger</strong> if someone tells you that something you said or did made them uncomfortable. There is great strength in being able to sincerely apologize to someone. If you feel that the way they responded to you was inappropriate, contact a mod rather than calling them out on it publicly.","commGuideList02H":"<strong>Divisive/contentious conversations should be reported to mods.</strong> If you feel that a conversation is getting heated, overly emotional, or hurtful, cease to engage. Instead, email <a href=\"mailto:leslie@habitica.com\">leslie@habitica.com</a> to let us know about it. It's our job to keep you safe.","commGuideList02I":"<strong>Do not spam.</strong> Spamming may include, but is not limited to: posting the same comment or query in multiple places, posting links without explanation or context, posting nonsensical messages, or posting many messages in a row. Repeatedly begging for gems or a subscription may also be considered spamming.","commGuidePara019":"<strong>In private spaces,</strong> users have more freedom to discuss whatever topics they would like, but they still may not violate the Terms and Conditions, including posting any discriminatory, violent, or threatening content.","commGuidePara020":"Private Messages (PMs) have some additional guidelines. If someone has blocked you, do not contact them elsewhere to ask them to unblock you. Additionally, you should not send PMs to someone asking for support (since public answers to support questions are helpful to the community). Finally, do not send anyone PMs begging for a gift of gems or a subscription, as this can be considered spamming.","commGuidePara021":"Furthermore, some public spaces in Habitica have additional guidelines.","commGuideHeadingTavern":"The Tavern","commGuidePara022":"The Tavern is the main spot for Habiticans to mingle. Daniel the Barkeep keeps the place spic-and-span, and Lemoness will happily conjure up some lemonade while you sit and chat. Just keep in mind...","commGuidePara023":"Conversation tends to revolve around casual chatting and productivity or life improvement tips.","commGuidePara024":"Because the Tavern chat can only hold 200 messages, <strong>it isn't a good place for prolonged conversations on topics, especially sensitive ones</strong> (ex. politics, religion, depression, whether or not goblin-hunting should be banned, etc.). These conversations should be taken to an applicable guild or the Back Corner (more information below).","commGuidePara027":"<strong>Don't discuss anything addictive in the Tavern.</strong> Many people use Habitica to try to quit their bad Habits. Hearing people talk about addictive/illegal substances may make this much harder for them! Respect your fellow Tavern-goers and take this into consideration. This includes, but is not exclusive to: smoking, alcohol, pornography, gambling, and drug use/abuse.","commGuideHeadingPublicGuilds":"Public Guilds","commGuidePara029":"<strong>Public guilds are much like the Tavern, except that instead of being centered around general conversation, they have a focused theme.</strong> Public guild chat should focus on this theme. For example, members of the Wordsmiths guild might be cross if they found the conversation suddenly focusing on gardening instead of writing, and a Dragon-Fanciers guild might not have any interest in deciphering ancient runes. Some guilds are more lax about this than others, but in general, <strong>try to stay on topic!</strong>","commGuidePara031":"<strong>Some public guilds will contain sensitive topics such as depression, religion, politics, etc.</strong> This is fine as long as the conversations therein do not violate any of the Terms and Conditions or Public Space Rules, and as long as they stay on topic.","commGuidePara033":"<strong>Public Guilds may NOT contain 18+ content. If they plan to regularly discuss sensitive content, they should say so in the Guild title.</strong> This is to keep Habitica safe and comfortable for everyone. If the guild in question has different kinds of sensitive issues, it is respectful to your fellow Habiticans to place your comment behind a warning (ex. \"Warning: references self-harm\"). Additionally, the sensitive material should be topical -- bringing up self-harm in a guild focused on fighting depression may make sense, but may be less appropriate in a music guild. If you see someone who is repeatedly violating this guideline, even after several requests, please email <a href=\"mailto:leslie@habitica.com\">leslie@habitica.com</a> with screenshots.","commGuidePara035":"<strong>No Guilds, Public or Private, should be created for the purpose of attacking any group or individual. Creating such a Guild is grounds for an instant ban.</strong> Fight bad habits, not your fellow adventurers!","commGuidePara037":"All Tavern Challenges and Public Guild Challenges must comply with these rules as well.","commGuideHeadingBackCorner":"The Back Corner","commGuidePara038":"<strong>Sometimes a conversation will get too long, off-topic, or sensitive to be continued in a Public Space without making users uncomfortable. In that case, the conversation will be directed to the Back Corner Guild. Note that being directed to the Back Corner is not at all a punishment!</strong> In fact, many Habiticans like to hang out there and discuss things at length.","commGuidePara039":"The Back Corner Guild is a free public space to discuss sensitive material or a single conversation for a long time, and it is carefully moderated. <strong>The Public Space Guidelines still apply, as do all of the Terms and Conditions.</strong> Just because we are wearing long cloaks and clustering in a corner doesn't mean that anything goes! Now pass me that smoldering candle, will you?","commGuideHeadingTrello":"Trello Boards","commGuidePara040":"<strong>Trello serves as an open forum for suggestions and discussion of site features.</strong> Habitica is ruled by the people in the form of valiant contributors -- we all build the site together. Trello is the system that lends method to our madness. Out of consideration for this, <strong>try your best to contain all your thoughts into one comment, instead of commenting many times in a row on the same card. If you think of something new, feel free to edit your original comments.</strong> Please, take pity on those of us who receive a notification for every new comment. Our inboxes can only withstand so much.","commGuidePara041":"Habitica uses five different Trello boards:","commGuideList03A":"The <strong>Main Board</strong> is a place to request and vote on site features.","commGuideList03B":"The <strong>Mobile Board</strong> is a place to request and vote on mobile app features.","commGuideList03C":"The <strong>Pixel Art Board</strong> is a place to discuss and submit pixel art.","commGuideList03D":"The <strong>Quest Board</strong> is a place to discuss and submit quests.","commGuideList03E":"The <strong>Wiki Board</strong> is a place to improve, discuss and request new wiki content.","commGuidePara042":"<strong>All have their own guidelines outlined, and the Public Spaces rules apply.</strong> Users should avoid going off-topic in any of the boards or cards. Trust us, the boards get crowded enough as it is! Prolonged conversations should be moved to the Back Corner Guild.","commGuideHeadingGitHub":"GitHub","commGuidePara043":"<strong>Habitica uses GitHub to track bugs and contribute code.</strong> It's the smithy where the tireless Blacksmiths forge the features! <strong>All the Public Spaces rules apply.</strong> Be sure to be polite to the Blacksmiths -- they have a lot of work to do, keeping the site running! Hooray, Blacksmiths!","commGuidePara044":"The following users are members of the Habitica repo:","commGuideHeadingWiki":"Wiki","commGuidePara045":"<strong>The Habitica wiki collects information about the site.</strong> It also hosts a few forums similar to the guilds on Habitica. Hence, all the Public Space rules apply.","commGuidePara046":"The Habitica wiki can be considered to be a database of all things Habitica. It provides information about site features, guides to play the game, tips on how you can contribute to Habitica and also provides a place for you to advertise your guild or party and vote on topics.","commGuidePara047":"Since the wiki is hosted by Wikia, the terms and conditions of Wikia also apply in addition to the rules set by Habitica and the Habitica wiki site.","commGuidePara048":"The wiki is solely a collaboration between all of its editors so some additional guidelines include:","commGuideList04A":"Requesting new pages or major changes on the Wiki Trello board","commGuideList04B":"Being open to other peoples' suggestion about your edit","commGuideList04C":"Discussing any conflict of edits within the page's talk page","commGuideList04D":"Bringing any unresolved conflict to the attention of wiki admins","commGuideList04E":"Not spamming or sabotaging pages for personal gain","commGuideList04F":"Read the wiki contribution page before making major changes","commGuideList04G":"Impartial tone within wiki pages","commGuideList04H":"Ensuring that wiki content is relevant to the whole site of Habitica and not pertaining to a particular guild or party (such information can be moved to the forums)","commGuidePara049":"The following people are the current wiki administrators:","commGuidePara018":"Wiki Administrators Emeritus are","commGuideHeadingInfractionsEtc":"Infractions, Consequences, and Restoration","commGuideHeadingInfractions":"Infractions","commGuidePara050":"Overwhelmingly, Habiticans assist each other, are respectful, and work to make the whole community fun and friendly. However, once in a blue moon, something that a Habitican does may violate one of the above guidelines. When this happens, the Mods will take whatever actions they deem necessary to keep Habitica safe and comfortable for everyone.","commGuidePara051":"<strong>There are a variety of infractions, and they are dealt with depending on their severity.</strong> These are not conclusive lists, and Mods have a certain amount of discretion. The Mods will take context into account when evaluating infractions.","commGuideHeadingSevereInfractions":"Severe Infractions","commGuidePara052":"Severe infractions greatly harm the safety of Habitica's community and users, and therefore have severe consequences as a result.","commGuidePara053":"The following are examples of some severe infractions. This is not a comprehensive list.","commGuideList05A":"Violation of Terms and Conditions","commGuideList05B":"Hate Speech/Images, Harassment/Stalking, Cyber-Bullying, Flaming, and Trolling","commGuideList05C":"Violation of Probation","commGuideList05D":"Impersonating Staff or Moderators","commGuideList05E":"Repeated Moderate Infractions","commGuideList05F":"Creating a duplicate account to avoid consequences (for example, making a new account to chat after having chat privileges revoked)","commGuideHeadingModerateInfractions":"Moderate Infractions","commGuidePara054":"Moderate infractions do not make our community unsafe, but they do make it unpleasant. These infractions will have moderate consequences. When in conjunction with multiple infractions, the consequences may grow more severe.","commGuidePara055":"The following are some examples of Moderate Infractions. This is not a comprehensive list.","commGuideList06A":"Ignoring or Disrespecting a Mod. This includes publicly complaining about moderators or other users/publicly glorifying or defending banned users. If you are concerned about one of the rules or Mods, please contact Lemoness via email (<a href=\"mailto:leslie@habitica.com\">leslie@habitica.com</a>).","commGuideList06B":"Backseat Modding. To quickly clarify a relevant point: A friendly mention of the rules is fine. Backseat modding consists of telling, demanding, and/or strongly implying that someone must take an action that you describe to correct a mistake. You can alert someone to the fact that they have committed a transgression, but please do not demand an action-for example, saying, \"Just so you know, profanity is discouraged in the Tavern, so you may want to delete that,\" would be better than saying, \"I'm going to have to ask you to delete that post.\"","commGuideList06C":"Repeated Violation of Public Space Guidelines","commGuideList06D":"Repeated Minor Infractions","commGuideHeadingMinorInfractions":"Minor Infractions","commGuidePara056":"Minor Infractions, while discouraged, still have minor consequences. If they continue to occur, they can lead to more severe consequences over time.","commGuidePara057":"The following are some examples of Minor Infractions. This is not a comprehensive list.","commGuideList07A":"First-time violation of Public Space Guidelines","commGuideList07B":"Any statements or actions that trigger a \"Please Don't\". When a Mod has to say \"Please Don't do this\" to a user, it can count as a very minor infraction for that user. An example might be \"Mod Talk: Please Don't keep arguing in favor of this feature idea after we've told you several times that it isn't feasible.\" In many cases, the Please Don't will be the minor consequence as well, but if Mods have to say \"Please Don't\" to the same user enough times, the triggering Minor Infractions will start to count as Moderate Infractions.","commGuideHeadingConsequences":"Consequences","commGuidePara058":"In Habitica -- as in real life -- every action has a consequence, whether it is getting fit because you've been running, getting cavities because you've been eating too much sugar, or passing a class because you've been studying.","commGuidePara059":"<strong>Similarly, all infractions have direct consequences.</strong> Some sample consequences are outlined below.","commGuidePara060":"If your infraction has a moderate or severe consequence, you will receive an email explaining:","commGuideList08A":"what your infraction was","commGuideList08B":"what the consequence is","commGuideList08C":"what to do to correct the situation and restore your status, if possible.","commGuideHeadingSevereConsequences":"Examples of Severe Consequences","commGuideList09A":"Account bans","commGuideList09B":"Account deletions","commGuideList09C":"Permanently disabling (\"freezing\") progression through Contributor Tiers","commGuideHeadingModerateConsequences":"Examples of Moderate Consequences","commGuideList10A":"Restricted public chat privileges","commGuideList10B":"Restricted private chat privileges","commGuideList10C":"Restricted guild/challenge creation privileges","commGuideList10D":"Temporarily disabling (\"freezing\") progression through Contributor Tiers","commGuideList10E":"Demotion of Contributor Tiers","commGuideList10F":"Putting users on \"Probation\"","commGuideHeadingMinorConsequences":"Examples of Minor Consequences","commGuideList11A":"Reminders of Public Space Guidelines","commGuideList11B":"Warnings","commGuideList11C":"Requests","commGuideList11D":"Deletions (Mods/Staff may delete problematic content)","commGuideList11E":"Edits (Mods/Staff may edit problematic content)","commGuideHeadingRestoration":"Restoration","commGuidePara061":"Habitica is a land devoted to self-improvement, and we believe in second chances. <strong>If you commit an infraction and receive a consequence, view it as a chance to evaluate your actions and strive to be a better member of the community.</strong>","commGuidePara062":"The email that you receive explaining the consequences of your actions (or, in the case of minor consequences, the Mod/Staff announcement) is a good source of information. <strong>Cooperate with any restrictions which have been imposed, and endeavor to meet the requirements to have any penalties lifted.</strong>","commGuidePara063":"<strong>If you do not understand your consequences, or the nature of your infraction, ask the Staff/Moderators</strong> for help so you can avoid committing infractions in the future.","commGuideHeadingContributing":"Contributing to Habitica","commGuidePara064":"Habitica is an open-source project, which means that any Habiticans are welcome to pitch in!

We reserve the right to change the specific levels, titles and rewards at our discretion.","commGuideList13B":"<strong>Tiers get harder as you progress.</strong> If you made one monster, or fixed a small bug, that may be enough to give you your first contributor level, but not enough to get you the next. Like in any good RPG, with increased level comes increased challenge!","commGuideList13C":"<strong>Tiers don't \"start over\" in each field.</strong> When scaling the difficulty, we look at all your contributions, so that people who do a little bit of art, then fix a small bug, then dabble a bit in the wiki, do not proceed faster than people who are working hard at a single task. This helps keep things fair!","commGuideList13D":"<strong>Users on probation cannot be promoted to the next tier.</strong> Mods have the right to freeze user advancement due to infractions. If this happens, the user will always be informed of the decision, and how to correct it.

or using a habitrpg.com or HabitRPG application on a mobile device ("the Applications"),
you agree to be bound contractually by this Privacy Policy. Individually
or collectively, the Applications and the Sites may be referred to as
the "Services."</p><p>To review material modifications and their effective dates scroll
to the bottom of the page.</p><p><strong>1. Privacy Statement; Collection of Personal
Information.</strong><br>1.1 HabitRPG, Inc. owns and operates this business. All
references to "we", "us", shall be construed to mean HabitRPG, Inc..</p><p>1.2 We understand that visitors to this website are concerned
about the privacy of information. The following describes our privacy
policy regarding information, including personal information, that we
collect through this website.</p><p><strong>2. Modification of Privacy Policy.</strong><br>We reserve the right to modify this Privacy Policy at any time,
and without prior notice, by posting an amended Privacy Policy that is
always accessible by clicking on the "Privacy Policy" link on this
site's home page. Your continued use of this site indicates your
acceptance of the amended Privacy Policy. You should check the Privacy
Policy through this link periodically for modifications by clicking on
the link provided near the top of the Privacy Policy for a listing of
material modifications and their effective dates. Regarding personal
information, if any modifications are materially less restrictive on our
use or disclosure of the personal information previously disclosed by
you, we will obtain your consent before implementing such revisions with
respect to such information.</p><p><strong>3. Collection of Anonymous, Passive Information.</strong><br>We reserve the right to monitor your use of the services. As you
navigate through the services, certain anonymous information may be
passively collected (that is, gathered without your actively providing
the information) using various technologies, such as cookies, Internet
tags or web beacons, and navigational data collection (log files, server
logs, clickstream). The following is a listing and a brief explanation
of passive information collection methodologies which we may use from
time to time to better understand how the Services are being used.</p><p>3.1 A "cookie" is a text file that this site sends to your
browser in the form of a text file The information generated by the
cookie about your use of this site (including your IP address) will be
transmitted to and stored. Most browsers automatically accept cookies,
but they usually can be modified to decline cookies if you prefer;
however, certain features of this site might not work without cookies.</p><p>3.2 "Session" cookies are temporary bits of information that are
used to improve navigation, block visitors from providing information
where inappropriate (the Services "remembers" previous entries of age or
country of origin that were outside the specified parameters and blocks
subsequent changes), and collect aggregate statistical information on
the Services. They are erased once you exit your Web browser or
otherwise turn off your computer.</p><p>3.3 "Persistent" cookies are more permanent bits of information
that are placed on the hard drive of your computer and stay there unless
you delete the cookie. Persistent cookies store information on your
computer for a number of purposes, such as retrieving certain
information you have previously provided, helping to determine what
areas of the Services you may find most valuable, and customizing the
Services based on your preferences on an ongoing basis. Persistent
cookies placed by this site in your computer do not hold personal
information.</p><p>3.4 You can set your browser to accept all cookies, to reject all
cookies, or to notify you whenever a cookie is offered so that you can
decide each time whether to accept it. To learn more about cookies and
how to specify your preferences, please search for "cookie" in the
"Help" portion of your browser.</p><p>3.5 An Internet Protocol (IP) address is a number assigned to
your computer by your Internet service provider so you can access the
Internet and is generally considered to be non-personally identifiable
information, because in most cases an IP address is dynamic (changing
each time you connect to the Internet), rather than static (unique to a
particular user's computer). The IP address can be used to diagnose
problems with a server, report aggregate information, determine the
fastest route for your computer to use in connecting to a site, and
administer and improve the Services.</p><p>3.6 "Internet tags" (also known as Web Beacons, single-pixel
GIFs, clear GIFs, invisible GIFs, and 1-by-1 GIFs) are smaller than
cookies and tell the Web site server information such as the IP address
and browser type related to the visitor's computer. Tags may be placed
both on online advertisements that bring people to the Services and on
different pages of the Services. Such tags indicate how many times a
page is opened and which information is consulted.</p><p>3.7 "Navigational data" (log files, server logs, and clickstream
data) are used for system management, to improve the content of the
Services, market research purposes, and to communicate information to
visitors.</p><p><strong>4. Use and Sharing of Anonymous, Passive Information.</strong><br>The Services may make full use of passively collected anonymous
information, including without limitation the right to use such
information to provide better service to Service users, customize the
Services based on your preferences, compile and analyze statistics and
trends, and otherwise administer and improve the Services for your use. We
reserve the right to share this anonymous, passive information in
aggregated form.</p><p><strong>5. 3rd Party Behavioral Ads; Google's AdSense Network.</strong><br>5.1 We reserve the right to use anonymous, passive information
about your visits to this and other websites (not including your name,
address, email address or telephone number) for purposes of serving our
ads and third party ads that are targeted to your interests ("3rd Party
Behavioral Ads"). We reserve the right to share anonymous, passive
information collected on the services with third parties for purposes of
serving 3rd Party Behavioral Ads. These 3rd Party Behavioral Ads do not
identify you personally. Instead, they associate your behavioral data on
visited sites with your browser, so that the ads your computer sees on
this site are more likely to be relevant to your interests. 3rd Party
Behavioral Ads require that that you be served with a cookie containing
a tracking code. You may refuse the use of cookies by selecting the
appropriate settings on your browser; however, please note that if you
do this you may not be able to use the full functionality of this site.</p><p>5.2 We reserve the right to participate in Google's AdSense
network for purposes of serving 3rd Party Behavioral Ads. Google uses
DoubleClick's DART cookie for serving 3rd Party Behavioral Ads over the
AdSense network. You may opt out of the use of the DART cookie. For
information regarding how to opt out, go to
http://www.google.com/privacy_ads.html.</p><p><strong>6. Use of 3rd Party Analytics.</strong><br>We reserve the right to use analytics services provided by
third parties. These services use 3rd party cookies to collect
anonymous, passive information about your use of this site (see
explanation of cookies in Collection of Anonymous, Passive Information
above). We use this information for the purpose of evaluating your use
of the Services, compiling reports on activity, and providing other
services. These web analytics services may also transfer this
information to third parties where required to do so by law, or where
such third parties process the information on the service's behalf.</p><p><strong>7. Collection of Personal Information; Categories.</strong><br>We will ask you for personal information when you sign up for any
specific benefit or purpose that requires registration. Personal
information that we collect may vary with each registration, and it may
include one or more of the following categories: name, physical
address, an email address, phone number, and credit card information
including credit card number, expiration date, and billing address,
emergency contact information, current medications, allergies, medical
insurance information.</p><p><strong>8. Use And Sharing of Personal Information: General
Policy And Exceptions.</strong><br>Our general policy is that we will use your personal information,
including combining your personal information with passive information
collected from this site, only for: the performance of the services or
transaction for which it was given, our private, internal reporting for
this site, and security assessments for this site, and we will not
share, sell, or rent your personal information to others. The only
exceptions to this general policy: (i) are described in the subsections
below, and (ii) if you explicitly approve through our site.</p><p>8.1 Affiliates And Service Providers. We reserve the right to
provide such information to our affiliates or subsidiaries, or trusted
service providers for the purpose of hosting our servers or processing
or archiving personal information for us. We require that these parties
agree to privacy and security safeguards for this information that are
consistent with this Privacy Policy.</p><p>8.2 Acquisition; Bankruptcy. In the event that we are acquired by
or merged with a third party entity, we reserve the right to transfer
such information as part of such merger, acquisition, sale, or other
change of control. In the unlikely event of our bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, receivership, or assignment for the benefit of
creditors, or the application of laws or equitable principles affecting
creditors' rights generally, we reserve the right to transfer such
information to protect our rights or as required by law.</p><p>8.3 Enforcement; Legal Process. We reserve the right to transfer
such information if we have a good faith belief that access, use,
preservation or disclosure of such information is reasonably necessary
(i) to satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process or
enforceable governmental request, or (ii) to investigate or enforce
violations of our rights or the security of this site.</p><p>8.4 Miscellaneous. We reserve the right to share personal
information with the following additional parties: online organizers
using our tools and resellers of our products and services from whose
site the sale originated (even though the sale originates at site of the
reseller, registration and collection of personal information occurs at
this site).</p><p><strong>9. Onward Transfer of Personal Information Outside Your
Country of Residence.</strong><br>Any personal information which we may collect on this site will
be stored and processed in our servers located only in the United
States. By using this site, if you reside outside the United States, you
consent to the transfer of personal information outside your country of
residence to the United States.</p><p><strong>10. Security of Personal Information.</strong><br>We follow reasonable and appropriate industry standards to
protect your personal information and data. Unfortunately, no data
transmission over the Internet or method of data storage can be
guaranteed 100% secure. Therefore, while we strive to protect your
personal information by following generally accepted industry standards,
we cannot ensure or warrant the absolute security of any information you
transmit to us or archive at this site.</p><p><strong>11. Changing And Updating Personal Information.</strong><br>Upon request, we will permit you to request or make changes or
updates to your personal information for legitimate purposes. We request
identification prior to approving such requests. We reserve the right to
decline any requests that are unreasonably repetitive or systematic,
require unreasonable time or effort of our technical or administrative
personnel, or undermine the privacy rights of others. We reserve the
right to permit you to access your personal information in any account
you establish with this site for purposes of making your own changes or
updates, and in such case, instructions for making such changes or
updates will be provided where necessary.</p><p><strong>12. Email From This Site; Opt-Out Rights.</strong><br>If you supply us with your e-mail address you may receive
periodic messages from us with information specific to the Services and
required for the normal functioning of the Services as well as for new
products or services or upcoming events. If you prefer not to receive
periodic email messages, you may opt-out by following the instructions
on the email.</p><p><strong>13. Children's Online Policy.</strong><br>We are committed to preserving online privacy for all of our
website visitors, including children. This site is a general audience
site. Consistent with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act
(COPPA), we will not knowingly collect any information from, or sell to,
children under the age of 13. If you are a parent or guardian who has
discovered that your child under the age of 13 has submitted his or her
personally identifiable information without your permission or consent,
we will remove the information from our active list, at your request. To
request the removal of your child's information, please email us at
<a href="mailto:admin@habitrpg.com" target="_blank">admin@habitrpg.com</a> and be sure to include in
your message the same login information that your child submitted.</p><p><strong>14. Email And Other Messages Through This Site; ECPA
Notice.</strong><br>This site treats email messages and other electronic messages
that are sent through this site and not viewable by others as
confidential and private, except as required by law, including without
limitation, the Electronic Communications Privacy Act of 1986, 18 U.S.C.
Sections 2701-2711 (the "ECPA"). The ECPA permits this site's limited
ability to intercept and/or disclose electronic messages, for example
(i) as necessary to operate our system or to protect our rights or
property, (ii) upon legal demand (court orders, warrants, subpoenas), or
(iii) where we receive information inadvertently which appears to
