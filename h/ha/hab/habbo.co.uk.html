We also collect  information automatically about your visit to our Websites using “cookies”. A cookie is a small piece of information sent by web server to a web browser, which enables the server to collect information from the browser about your computer, but not about you.

Our use of cookies also allows you to be presented with a personalised version of the Websites and promotional information, and to enable you to access your account.<br><br>Most Internet browsers are initially set up to accept cookies. If you would prefer to, you can disable this feature by removing or blocking these cookies in your browser settings through the “Tools” option on your top menu bar and adapting your “Privacy” settings within the “Internet Options” dialogue box.<br><br><b>PURPOSES OF COLLECTION</b><br><br>We may collect, use, transfer and disclose your personal information for the purposes of:<br>1.	* Understanding your needs and improving our offering of information, products and services to you, such as special discounts and deals.<br>2.	* Enabling you to send other end users emails [and SMS].<br>3.	* Administering your account with us, such as collecting payments and monitoring your credit status, and managing invoicing, accounting and information security services related to our relationship with you.<br>4.	* Managing the provision of goods, services and privileges to you.<br>5.	* Where you have agreed, to send you newsletters and other information (including marketing information) about the Websites, us and Sulake UK Affiliates, in any format or media, including via selected third parties.<br>6.	* Informing you about changes or new information that might affect you or your account (e.g. changes to our procedures, changes to the Terms and Conditions, etc.).<br>7.	* Maintaining information as a reference tool or general resource to help us to understand trends and visitor needs.<br>8.	* Where you have agreed, providing you with personalised information about products and services of ours, Sulake UK Affiliates, and third parties with whom we do business.<br>9.	* Detecting and protecting us and Sulake UK Affiliates and other third parties against error, negligence, breach of contract, theft, fraud and other illegal activity, to comply with our audit requirements, and to audit compliance with our corporate policies, the relevant Terms and Conditions, this Privacy Policy, laws and contractual obligations.<br>10.	* As permitted by, and to comply with, applicable laws and regulations.<br>11.	* Any other purposes to which you consent.<br>We may also aggregate information about you and your use of our Websites with information about other subscribers to our services in order to identify trends in our business ("Aggregated Data").

All personal information you provide us with on the Websites, and all personal information contained in your account (including any credit card details that you may provide), is encrypted. This encoding lets your browser automatically encrypt or scramble data before you send it to us. Transactions will not be permitted if your browser does not accept the encryption. Only our authorised personnel of ours and Sulake UK Affiliates or their partners can decode this information and such personnel will only do so in accordance with our, or their, privacy policy.<br>That said, it is impossible for us to guarantee that no-one can circumvent the security measures that are in place. For example, we cannot control any illegal and/or unforeseen activity of other users that may allow them to get around the privacy or security settings on our Websites. You acknowledge, therefore, that there may be circumstances in which your personal information may be accessed by unauthorised persons and used for unauthorised purposes. <br>Please note that unlike your communications with the Websites, we have no control over the privacy of your e-mail messages with us. We recommend that you do not include personal information in e-mails, including your account password. We are not responsible for any loss or damage if you send us personal information by e-mail.<br><br><b>CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY</b><br><br>We reserve the right, at any time, and from time to time, to modify this Privacy Policy, and you agree to be bound by such modifications. Changes to this Privacy Policy shall be effective immediately upon providing you with notice, which notice may be given by any means, including without limitation, by posting the change on the Websites or by electronic or conventional mail. You agree to regularly review the Privacy Policy. Your use of the Websites following the posting of any change (other than changes to the purposes for which we collect, use or disclose your personal information) shall constitute your agreement to the modified Privacy Policy. If at any time the modified Privacy Policy is no longer acceptable to you, you should not use the Websites.<br><br><b>LINKS TO THIRD PARTY WEBSITES</b><br><br>Please be aware our Websites may have advertisements and links to third party websites and services that may collect personal information about you. This Privacy Policy only applies to personally identifiable information that is collected by us and does not cover the practices and policies of these other third parties, and we cannot control the practices of these third parties. We encourage you to read the privacy policies of all websites you use, as their policies and practices may be very different from ours.<br><br><b>APPLICATION OF THIS PRIVACY POLICY</b><br><br>This Privacy Policy applies to us. Nothing in this Privacy Policy will create or add to any right or claim (whether legal, equitable or otherwise) that any individual or person may have at law or otherwise against us or a Sulake UK Affiliate; nor will the existence of this Privacy Policy or its application impose any obligations or liability upon us or a Sulake UK Affiliate, or add to any obligation or liability, that we or a Sulake UK Affiliate does not already otherwise have to any individual or person at law, or in equity, or otherwise.</div>
