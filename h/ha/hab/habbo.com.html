<div class="tos-item">Privacy Policy<br><br>Habbo Hotel<br>Habbo Hotel is a place where people can create their own Habbos, have fun, hang out, play games, and make friends. Because of its interactive content, Habbo Hotel is for users who are 13 years of age or older. We urge everyone, especially teens and their parents to use and enjoy our web site responsibly. At Sulake, Inc. ("Sulake"), we respect your privacy concerns and we understand that visitors to the Hotel need to understand the uses of their personal information. The privacy policy below details the measures taken by Sulake to protect your privacy in connection with your use of www.habbo.com and other sites owned and operated by Sulake ("Sulake Sites").

By personal information we mean individually identifiable information about an individual collected online, including, but not limited to, first and last name, physical or email address, telephone number, instant messenger screen names etc., that is associated with individually identifiable information (Personal Information).

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Privacy Policy or elsewhere, we reserve the right at all times to disclose any information as necessary to satisfy any applicable law (including, without limitation, the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act), regulation, legal process, law enforcement requests, demands by parties claiming your infringement of their rights or governmental request, to edit, refuse to post or remove any information or materials, in whole or in part, in our sole discretion; or to act in an emergency to protect someone?s safety or legal rights.<br><br>We encourage you to use caution and common sense in giving out Personal Information when using Community Services or otherwise. We have no control over third parties to whom you may give Personal Information through the use of our Services.<br><br>A Special Note about Children, Childrens Privacy and Our Compliance with the Childrens Online Privacy Protection Act:<br>In compliance with the Childrens Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), we do not intend to collect any Personal Information from children under 13 years of age unless we believe such collection to be permitted by law.

Upon request, the parent or guardian of a child under 13 may review and request the deletion of such child?s Personal Information, as well as refuse to permit the further collection or use of such Personal Information.<br><br>Opt-Out and Termination:<br>We believe that our ability to share your Personal Information with our affiliates, vendors and certain third parties improves our ability to provide services to you. However, if you object to our sharing of your personal information and would like to exercise your rights under the Financial Services Modernization Act and the Fair Reporting Act to limit our use of certain information governed by the mandatory opt-out provisions of those acts (should we ever collect such information and even though we are not governed by those acts), or if you would like to exercise your right under the CAN SPAM Act to not receive future e-mail correspondence from us, except with respect to your prior financial transaction or communications, or as otherwise required by law, please print, complete, sign and return the opt-out letter available at <a href="http://images.habbohotel.com/c_images/album43/Opt_Out_Notice.pdf">Opt-Out Notice<br></a>.

Your user information helps us tailor the content, services, goods and advertising to your current and future needs. For this reason, if you are 13 or older we will ask you to provide personal information when you first sign-up and create your Habbo, visit certain areas of Habbo Hotel?, or engage in activities (e.g. download software, enter a contest, order products, or subscribe to a newsletter). If you choose not to register, you may not have access to areas that require personal identification.<br><br>E-mail:<br>If you register with our site or purchase products from us, from time to time, we may e-mail you with informative messages about our services or third party products and services we believe may be of interest to you, such as new features and services, special offers and updated information. The newsletters may contain code that enables our database to track your usage of the newsletters, including whether the email was opened and/or what links (if any) were clicked. We will combine that information to other information we have about you and may use that information to improve your site experience and/or provide customized e-mail communications to you.<br><br>Registration:<br>When you register, Sulake asks for your e-mail address, a user-selected user name, and other information. Once you are a registered user you can update your profile and may be able to provide additional preferential information. Sulake may also ask for other optional information.<br><br>Order Forms and Products Store:<br>Sulake also uses forms for users to request information, products and services. For such forms, we collect a user's contact information (e.g., e-mail address and in the case of delivery of tangible products, delivery address and phone number) and necessary information to process the order (e.g., credit card number and billing address). Contact information from the order is used to send orders to our registered users and to get in touch with the user when deemed necessary. Sulake may use third parties to accept and process orders for merchandise and products, including software, and to operate the Sulake Sites and such third parties may have access to your Personal Information.<br><br>Contests, Sweepstakes and Promotions:<br>Sulake may occasionally present a special contest, sweepstakes or promotion that is sponsored by Sulake or another company. To qualify for entry in that contest or promotion, we may ask you to provide personal information.

Web servers automatically identify your computer by its IP address. We will use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server and to administer our site and to track and contact you. Your IP address also may be used to gather broad demographic information.<br><br>Cookies:<br>A "cookie" is a small line of text that is stored with your Web browser for record-keeping purposes and to help us provide better service to you. Your browser has options to accept, reject, or provide you with notice when a cookie is sent.

As stated, Sulake may use third parties to accept and process orders for merchandise and products, including Habbo Coins, and to help us operate our services. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, Sulake may disclose any information you provide if required to do so by law or pursuant to a request by a law enforcement official or if we have a good faith belief that disclosure is necessary to (1) comply with the law or with legal process; (2) protect and defend the rights or property of Sulake or third parties; or (3) act in an emergency to protect someone's safety or legal rights (?Mandatory Disclosures?).<br><br>As we develop our business, we may buy or sell assets, and, depending upon the transaction, your personal information may be one of the transferred assets. In the event that Sulake is acquired by another company, your personal information may be part of the assets transferred to the acquiring party (?Change of Control?).<br><br>What are my options to control the use of my personally identifiable information?<br>Unless you opt-out we and our affiliates may e-mail you with information from Sulake, including information about selected third parties. If you have opted in to our sharing of your Personal Information with third parties, you may receive e-mails directly from third parties. If you do not want to receive information from Sulake or third parties that we have selected, you may <a href="http://images.habbohotel.com/c_images/album43/Opt_Out_Notice.pdf">Opt-Out Notice<br></a>. You may also contact Sulake by postal mail at the address below.<br><br>What else should I know about my privacy?<br><br>Security:<br>Sulake has security measures in place to attempt to protect against the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control.
