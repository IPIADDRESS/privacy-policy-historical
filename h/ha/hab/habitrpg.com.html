Its ears, once filled with feathers and half-remembered tasks, are now clear as day. It crows at you quietly, snuggling its beak into your shoulder. The next day you’re set to take your leave, but @EmeraldOx runs up to you with a covered basket. “Wait!

or using a habitrpg.com or HabitRPG application on a mobile device ("the Applications"),
you agree to be bound contractually by this Privacy Policy. Individually
or collectively, the Applications and the Sites may be referred to as
the "Services."</p><p>To review material modifications and their effective dates scroll
to the bottom of the page.</p><p><strong>1. Privacy Statement; Collection of Personal
Information.</strong><br>1.1 OCDevel owns and operates this business. All
references to "we", "us", shall be construed to mean OCDevel.</p><p>1.2 We understand that visitors to this website are concerned
about the privacy of information. The following describes our privacy
policy regarding information, including personal information, that we
collect through this website.</p><p><strong>2. Modification of Privacy Policy.</strong><br>We reserve the right to modify this Privacy Policy at any time,
and without prior notice, by posting an amended Privacy Policy that is
always accessible by clicking on the "Privacy Policy" link on this
site's home page. Your continued use of this site indicates your
acceptance of the amended Privacy Policy. You should check the Privacy
Policy through this link periodically for modifications by clicking on
the link provided near the top of the Privacy Policy for a listing of
material modifications and their effective dates. Regarding personal
information, if any modifications are materially less restrictive on our
use or disclosure of the personal information previously disclosed by
you, we will obtain your consent before implementing such revisions with
respect to such information.</p><p><strong>3. Collection of Anonymous, Passive Information.</strong><br>We reserve the right to monitor your use of the services. As you
navigate through the services, certain anonymous information may be
passively collected (that is, gathered without your actively providing
the information) using various technologies, such as cookies, Internet
tags or web beacons, and navigational data collection (log files, server
logs, clickstream). The following is a listing and a brief explanation
of passive information collection methodologies which we may use from
time to time to better understand how the Services are being used.</p><p>3.1 A "cookie" is a text file that this site sends to your
browser in the form of a text file The information generated by the
cookie about your use of this site (including your IP address) will be
transmitted to and stored. Most browsers automatically accept cookies,
but they usually can be modified to decline cookies if you prefer;
however, certain features of this site might not work without cookies.</p><p>3.2 "Session" cookies are temporary bits of information that are
used to improve navigation, block visitors from providing information
where inappropriate (the Services "remembers" previous entries of age or
country of origin that were outside the specified parameters and blocks
subsequent changes), and collect aggregate statistical information on
the Services. They are erased once you exit your Web browser or
otherwise turn off your computer.</p><p>3.3 "Persistent" cookies are more permanent bits of information
that are placed on the hard drive of your computer and stay there unless
you delete the cookie. Persistent cookies store information on your
computer for a number of purposes, such as retrieving certain
information you have previously provided, helping to determine what
areas of the Services you may find most valuable, and customizing the
Services based on your preferences on an ongoing basis. Persistent
cookies placed by this site in your computer do not hold personal
information.</p><p>3.4 You can set your browser to accept all cookies, to reject all
cookies, or to notify you whenever a cookie is offered so that you can
decide each time whether to accept it. To learn more about cookies and
how to specify your preferences, please search for "cookie" in the
"Help" portion of your browser.</p><p>3.5 An Internet Protocol (IP) address is a number assigned to
your computer by your Internet service provider so you can access the
Internet and is generally considered to be non-personally identifiable
information, because in most cases an IP address is dynamic (changing
each time you connect to the Internet), rather than static (unique to a
particular user's computer). The IP address can be used to diagnose
problems with a server, report aggregate information, determine the
fastest route for your computer to use in connecting to a site, and
administer and improve the Services.</p><p>3.6 "Internet tags" (also known as Web Beacons, single-pixel
GIFs, clear GIFs, invisible GIFs, and 1-by-1 GIFs) are smaller than
cookies and tell the Web site server information such as the IP address
and browser type related to the visitor's computer. Tags may be placed
both on online advertisements that bring people to the Services and on
different pages of the Services. Such tags indicate how many times a
page is opened and which information is consulted.</p><p>3.7 "Navigational data" (log files, server logs, and clickstream
data) are used for system management, to improve the content of the
Services, market research purposes, and to communicate information to
visitors.</p><p><strong>4. Use and Sharing of Anonymous, Passive Information.</strong><br>The Services may make full use of passively collected anonymous
information, including without limitation the right to use such
information to provide better service to Service users, customize the
Services based on your preferences, compile and analyze statistics and
trends, and otherwise administer and improve the Services for your use. We
reserve the right to share this anonymous, passive information in
aggregated form.</p><p><strong>5. 3rd Party Behavioral Ads; Google's AdSense Network.</strong><br>5.1 We reserve the right to use anonymous, passive information
about your visits to this and other websites (not including your name,
address, email address or telephone number) for purposes of serving our
ads and third party ads that are targeted to your interests ("3rd Party
Behavioral Ads"). We reserve the right to share anonymous, passive
information collected on the services with third parties for purposes of
serving 3rd Party Behavioral Ads. These 3rd Party Behavioral Ads do not
identify you personally. Instead, they associate your behavioral data on
visited sites with your browser, so that the ads your computer sees on
this site are more likely to be relevant to your interests. 3rd Party
Behavioral Ads require that that you be served with a cookie containing
a tracking code. You may refuse the use of cookies by selecting the
appropriate settings on your browser; however, please note that if you
do this you may not be able to use the full functionality of this site.</p><p>5.2 We reserve the right to participate in Google's AdSense
network for purposes of serving 3rd Party Behavioral Ads. Google uses
DoubleClick's DART cookie for serving 3rd Party Behavioral Ads over the
AdSense network. You may opt out of the use of the DART cookie. For
information regarding how to opt out, go to
http://www.google.com/privacy_ads.html.</p><p><strong>6. Use of 3rd Party Analytics.</strong><br>We reserve the right to use analytics services provided by
third parties. These services use 3rd party cookies to collect
anonymous, passive information about your use of this site (see
explanation of cookies in Collection of Anonymous, Passive Information
above). We use this information for the purpose of evaluating your use
of the Services, compiling reports on activity, and providing other
services. These web analytics services may also transfer this
information to third parties where required to do so by law, or where
such third parties process the information on the service's behalf.</p><p><strong>7. Collection of Personal Information; Categories.</strong><br>We will ask you for personal information when you sign up for any
specific benefit or purpose that requires registration. Personal
information that we collect may vary with the each registration, and it
may include one or more of the following categories: name, physical
address, an email address, phone number, and credit card information
including credit card number, expiration date, and billing address,
emergency contact information, current medications, allergies, medical
insurance information.</p><p><strong>8. Use And Sharing of Personal Information: General
Policy And Exceptions.</strong><br>Our general policy is that we will use your personal information,
including combining your personal information with passive information
collected from this site, only for: the performance of the services or
transaction for which it was given, our private, internal reporting for

consistent with this Privacy Policy.</p><p>8.2 Acquisition; Bankruptcy. In the event that we are acquired by
or merged with a third party entity, we reserve the right to transfer
such information as part of such merger, acquisition, sale, or other
change of control. In the unlikely event of our bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, receivership, or assignment for the benefit of
creditors, or the application of laws or equitable principles affecting
creditors' rights generally, we reserve the right to transfer such
information to protect our rights or as required by law.</p><p>8.3 Enforcement; Legal Process. We reserve the right to transfer
such information if we have a good faith belief that access, use,
preservation or disclosure of such information is reasonably necessary
(i) to satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process or
enforceable governmental request, or (ii) to investigate or enforce
violations of our rights or the security of this site.</p><p>8.4 Miscellaneous. We reserve the right to share personal
information with the following additional parties: online organizers
using our tools and resellers of our products and services from whose
site the sale originated (even though the sale originates at site of the
reseller, registration and collection of personal information occurs at
this site).</p><p><strong>9. Onward Transfer of Personal Information Outside Your
Country of Residence.</strong><br>Any personal information which we may collect on this site will
be stored and processed in our servers located only in the United
States. By using this site, if you reside outside the United States, you
consent to the transfer of personal information outside your country of
residence to the United States.</p><p><strong>10. Security of Personal Information.</strong><br>We follow reasonable and appropriate industry standards to
protect your personal information and data. Unfortunately, no data
transmission over the Internet or method of data storage can be
guaranteed 100% secure. Therefore, while we strive to protect your
personal information by following generally accepted industry standards,
we cannot ensure or warrant the absolute security of any information you
transmit to us or archive at this site.</p><p><strong>11. Changing And Updating Personal Information.</strong><br>Upon request, we will permit you to request or make changes or
updates to your personal information for legitimate purposes. We request
identification prior to approving such requests. We reserve the right to
decline any requests that are unreasonably repetitive or systematic,
require unreasonable time or effort of our technical or administrative
personnel, or undermine the privacy rights of others. We reserve the
right to permit you to access your personal information in any account
you establish with this site for purposes of making your own changes or
updates, and in such case, instructions for making such changes or
updates will be provided where necessary.</p><p><strong>12. Email From This Site; Opt-Out Rights.</strong><br>If you supply us with your e-mail address you may receive
periodic messages from us with information specific to the Services and

products or services or upcoming events. If you prefer not to receive
periodic email messages, you may opt-out by following the instructions
on the email.</p><p><strong>13. Children's Online Policy.</strong><br>We are committed to preserving online privacy for all of its
website visitors, including children. This site is a general audience
site. Consistent with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act
(COPPA), we will not knowingly collect any information from, or sell to,

we will remove the information from our active list, at your request. To
request the removal of your child's information, please send contact our
site as provided below under “Contact Us”, and be sure to include in

Notice.</strong><br>This site treats email messages and other electronic messages
that are sent through this site and not viewable by others as
confidential and private, except as required by law, including without
limitation, the Electronic Communications Privacy Act of 1986, 18 U.S.C.
Sections 2701-2711 (the "ECPA"). The ECPA permits this site's limited

property, (ii) upon legal demand (court orders, warrants, subpoenas), or
(iii) where we receive information inadvertently which appears to
pertain to the commission of a crime. This site is not considered a
"secure communications medium" under the ECPA.</p><p><strong>15. Contact Us.</strong><br>If you have any questions regarding this Privacy Policy, please
