Where we maintain an online store, we use a variety of technical, administrative and physical safeguards so that you can enjoy your shopping experience without having to worry about the loss of, misuse of, or unauthorized access to your information.</p><p><strong>Secure Shopping.</strong> Where our Site permits you to enter credit card or other billing information, we use industry-standard encryption technologies to encrypt that information while it is being transmitted to our Site. In addition, we make commercially acceptable efforts to stay up to date with best practices regarding the protection of information in connection with transactions occurring over the internet. We also use GeoTrust, Inc. as our SSL provider as an added measure for your protection. You may want to check your internet settings to make sure your browser is in compliance with industry-standard encryption technology.</p><p><strong>Firewalls.</strong> We protect all personal information stored in our computer systems, including information about your orders, behind a network security system called a "firewall." We only permit our authorized staff and authorized third party service providers to access our computer systems, and then only for the purposes described in this privacy policy.</p><p><strong>Phone Orders.</strong> Some versions of popular web browsers and some firewalls do not permit communication through secure servers like the ones we use to process orders. If your web browser cannot support this level of security, you will not be able to order products through our Site or those of our affiliated companies. If so, you may place orders by calling us toll-free at 800-742-2263.</p><p>We follow industry practices to protect your personal information from unauthorized access, but no data transmission over Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. We cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us over the Internet.

We have created this easy-to-read privacy policy with that goal in mind. Some browsers utilize privacy enhancing technology to translate our privacy policy into a computer readable format. The technology then requires that the computer format be translated back into human readable format for you to read. This translation back into human readable format is often referred to as a "Policy Summary"; it is possible that through these translations, the Policy Summary may unintentionally end up being inconsistent with the privacy policy upon which it is based. It might fail to address an issue or it might address an issue not raised in our privacy policy. For this reason, you should rely on our privacy policy as the most accurate and definitive description of our practices.</p><p><a href="#top">[back to top]</a></p><p><a id="sec12"></a><strong>Patent Disclosure</strong></p><p>One or more patents may apply to this Site or those of our affiliated brands, including without limitation, U.S. Patent #5,528,490; #5,761,649; and #6,029,142.</p><p><a href="#top">[back to top]</a></p><!--
