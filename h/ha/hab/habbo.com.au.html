For example, if you do not wish to receive the Website newsletters or information about products and services supplied by us or Sulake Australia Affiliates or third parties, do not tick the boxes at the bottom of the registration form. You may change these options anytime by selecting the ?Account Settings? link (for Habbo) or the ?Own Info? link (for Luupi) on our home page.

Accordingly, it is up to you to ensure they abide by the relevant Terms and Conditions, caution them not to share personal information, and to monitor their use of the Websites.

We encourage you to read the policies of all websites you use, as their policies and practices may be very different from ours.<br><br><b>APPLICATION OF THIS PRIVACY POLICY</b><br>This Privacy Policy applies to us. Nothing in this Privacy Policy will create or add to any right or claim (whether legal, equitable or otherwise) that any individual or person may have at law or otherwise against us or a Sulake Australia Affiliate; nor will the existence of this Privacy Policy or its application impose any obligations or liability upon us or a Sulake Australia Affiliate, or add to any obligation or liability, that we or a Sulake Australia Affiliate does not already otherwise have to any individual or person at law or in equity or otherwise.</div>
