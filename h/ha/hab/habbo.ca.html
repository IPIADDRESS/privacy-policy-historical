For example, you may chose not to receive the Website newsletters or information about products and services supplied by us or Sulake Canada Affiliates or third parties by ticking the boxes at the bottom of the registration form. You may also change these options anytime by selecting the ‘Account Settings’ link (for Habbo) or the ‘Own Info’ link (for Luupi) on our Websites’ home page. Alternatively, you may opt-out by <a href="http://www.habbo.ca/iot/go?lang=en_CA&amp;country=ca">emailing us</a>.<br><br><b>DELETING YOUR ACCOUNT</b><br>You may delete your account with us by informing our customer support and asking them to delete your account. If you request to have your account deleted, you will not be able to reactivate your account or retrieve any of the content or information you have added. Personal information that was collected by us related to your account may be retained by us for a reasonable period of time but will not be generally available to other users of the Websites.<br><br><b>ACCESS, UPDATE OR CORRECT YOUR INFORMATION</b><br>Following registration you may be able to review and change some of the information that you provided to us by emailing us. To ensure that the personal information that you provided to us is accurate, complete and up to date as is necessary for the purposes for which it is to be used, we rely on you to provide us with updates and to inform us of any errors by <a href="http://www.habbo.ca/iot/go?lang=en_CA&amp;country=ca">emailing us</a>.<br><br><b>SECURITY</b><br>We protect your personal information with appropriate security safeguards, including physical, administrative and technical measures designed to protect against loss, theft and unauthorized access, disclosure, copying, use or modification. All personal information you provide us with on the Websites, and all personal information contained in your account, is encrypted. This coding lets your browser automatically encrypt or scramble data before you send it to us. Transactions will not be permitted if your browser does not accept the encryption. Only authorised personnel of ours and Sulake Canada Affiliates or their partners can decode this information and such personnel will only do so when necessary and in accordance with our, or their, privacy policy. In certain cases, personal information may be transferred outside of Canada in order to continue to provide our products and services to you. In those cases, the information will be subject to the laws and regulations of the jurisdiction where the information is transferred.<br><br>Please note that unlike your communications with the Websites, we have no control over the privacy of your e-mail messages with us. We recommend that you do not include personal information in e-mails, including your account password. We are not responsible for any loss or damage if you send us personal information by e-mail.<br><br><b>CHILDREN</b><br>If any of your children under 18 years of age disclose information about themselves using our Websites or in our public discussion areas, they may get unsolicited messages from other parties. Accordingly, it is up to you to ensure they abide by the relevant <a href="http://www.habbo.ca/papers/termsAndConditions">Terms and Conditions</a>., caution them not to share personal information, and to monitor their use of the Websites. If you're worried about your children's activities or their privacy on our Websites, we encourage you to <a href="http://www.habbo.ca/iot/go?lang=en_CA&amp;country=ca">email us</a>.<br><br><b>CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY</b><br>We reserve the right, at any time, and from time to time, to modify this Privacy Policy and to reflect those changes in our information practices, and you agree to be bound by such modifications. However, any changes or additions to the purposes for which we collect, use or disclose your personal information will not apply to you unless you consent to them or unless otherwise permitted by law. Changes to this Privacy Policy shall be effective immediately upon providing you with notice, which notice may be given by any means, including without limitation, by posting the change on the Websites or by electronic or conventional mail. You agree to regularly review the Privacy Policy. Your use of the Websites following any change (other than changes to the purposes for which we collect, use or disclose your personal information) shall constitute your agreement to the modified Privacy Policy. If at any time the Privacy Policy is no longer acceptable to you, you should not use the Websites.<br><br><b>LINKS TO THIRD PARTY WEBSITES</b><br>Please be aware our Websites may have advertisements and links to third party websites and services that may collect personal information about you. These third party websites operate independently of us and are not under our authority or control. This Privacy Policy does not cover the practices and policies of these other third parties, and we cannot control the information practices of these third parties. We encourage you to read the policies of all websites you use, as their policies and practices may be very different from ours. Sulake Canada and Sulake Canada Affiliates are not responsible for any information that is provided by, or collected through, those websites or for any other use of those websites.<br><br><b>APPLICATION OF THIS PRIVACY POLICY</b><br>Nothing in this Privacy Policy will create or add to any right or claim (whether legal, equitable or otherwise) that any individual or person may have at law or otherwise against us or a Sulake Canada Affiliate; nor will the existence of this Privacy Policy or its application impose any obligations or liability upon us or a Sulake Canada Affiliate, or add to any obligation or liability, that we or a Sulake Canada Affiliate does not already otherwise have to any individual or person at law or in equity or otherwise.</div>
