        <p class="leading_top">This statement explains the online data collection and use practices of Hannaford.com; the statement and its description of our online data practices does not apply to other online sites or to other services provided by Hannaford Bros. Co.("Hannaford"), Delhaize America, Inc. or the Delhaize Group.

        <p>Since Internet technologies continue to evolve and Internet business models are not fully established, this statement is subject to change.
