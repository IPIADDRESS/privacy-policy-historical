                              <br>
                              Second, to provide additional value to our customers, we may allow our suppliers to provide offers to a select group of customers that may be interested in their items. To ensure your personal data is protected, we will obtain the materials from the supplier and communicate offers directly to our customers. <br>
                              <br>
                              In all instances, the information will only be used to provide information and offers regarding products and service available at Hannaford. <br>
