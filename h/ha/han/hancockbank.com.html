If we combine Anonymous Information with Personally Identifiable Information (such as combining your name with your geographical location), we will treat that Anonymous Information as Personally Identifiable Information as long as it is combined with Personally Identifiable Information.</p>

    <h3>Cookies</h3>
    <p>We use "cookies" to provide you with a better online experience. A cookie is a small text file that can be placed on your system when you visit a website. Cookies allow us to collect both Personally Identifiable Information and Anonymous Information, such as browser type, time spent on a website, pages visited, language preferences, and information about your relationships with us. Cookies allow us to facilitate image changes, collect anonymous aggregate website traffic, provide certain discount, promotional and reward programs to you, and personalize our services to your needs. Our Site does not require users to accept cookies, and you can set your browser to notify you when you receive a cookie, giving you the opportunity to decide whether or not to accept it. If you choose not to accept cookies, you may experience some reduction in graphics and other personalized services. You also may need to accept cookies in order to maintain certain online advertising opt-out elections (see "How We Use Your Information for Advertising" and "Opting Out of Behavioral Advertising" sections below).</p>

    <h3>How We Use Your Information for Advertising</h3>
    <p>We may use Personally Identifiable Information or Anonymous Information in connection with our online advertising activity. Online advertisements may be in the form of banner ads, splash ads, or other formats. These advertisements may appear at our Site, and we may contract with third party advertising companies to promote our products and services and serve related advertisements on websites and mobile applications that are owned or operated by parties not affiliated with us.</p>
    <p>In order to better understand which of our products and services may be of interest to you and to tell you about those products and services, we may from time to time collect information about your online activities over time and across third party websites and online services. We also may engage third party service providers to collect information about your online activities over time and across third party websites and online services when you use our Site. Serving advertisements based on a person’s online activities over time and across third party websites and online services is generally known as "online behavioral advertising," (hereinafter "OBA").  Here are some tips and other important information regarding online behavioral advertising:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>If you are given an opportunity to opt out from OBA and you make an opt-out election, then in order to maintain the opt-out election at our Site and at other websites that might serve behavioral advertisements on our behalf, your browser must be enabled accept cookies. If you delete cookies, buy a new device, access our Site or other websites from a different device, login under a different screen name, or change web browsers, you will need to opt out again.</li>
        <li>You also may be able to avoid OBA by disabling scripting in your browser. Please check the security settings in your browser to determine the status of scripting settings.</li>
        <li>Some browsers may provide a "do not track" or similar setting.  Our Site does not respond to such settings.  If you enable such a setting, it will not prevent the collection of information about your online activities over time and across third party websites when you visit our Site.</li>
        <li>You should be aware that even if you exercise a choice not to receive targeted advertisements in connection with OBA, your election does not necessarily stop the collection of information about your online activities over time and across third party websites and online services for purposes other than OBA.</li>
        <li>You may still receive generic advertising (i.e., advertising that is not based on your online activities over time and across third party websites and online services) even if you opt out of OBA, and opting out of OBA may not result in the termination of advertising and promotions provided in connection with rewards programs we may offer.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>We may share Anonymous Information with third party advertising companies with which we have contracted in order to support other targeted advertising, promotional programs that we offer.</p>

    <h3>Opting Out of Online Behavioral Advertising ("OBA")</h3>
    <p>Certain Hancock Bank ads on third-party websites feature an Advertising Options Icon, that when clicked, (i) describes the collection and uses of data gathered at the relevant third-party website and (ii) provides a way for you to opt out of data collection and use by the third parties listed for the purposes of OBA.  If you choose to opt out, you may opt out by visiting <a href="bump-page-about-ads.asp" class="cboxelement">www.aboutads.info/choices</a> or by clicking on the AdChoices icon in an advertisement and following the instructions.  You may also opt out of receiving behavioral ads from many sites through the Network Advertising Initiative's (NAI) <a href="bump-page-nai.asp" class="cboxelement">Opt-Out Tool</a> or other tools provided by the publishing platform.  Bear in mind that because cookies are stored by your browser, if you use different browsers on your computer, or multiple computers and devices that have browsers and you do not wish to have cookies collect information for OBA purposes, you will need to opt out of OBA from each browser on each of the computers and devices that you use.  Please note that even if you opt out of OBA, you may still receive advertisements from us; they just won’t be customized based on your web-browsing activities on third-party websites.</p>

Information is retained on our system or the system of the appropriate third-party service provider, depending upon what is required to serve your needs.  We will protect your information by using those security standards which, at a minimum, meet those required of us by applicable federal and state law. We also require an I.D. and password to access your accounts.  If you do not provide this information, we cannot establish an Online Banking service for you.  You can also help maintain the security of your banking information by not sharing your I.D. or password with anyone, by changing your password regularly, and by remembering to sign off.</p>

    <h3>Security</h3>
    <p>To protect Personally Identifiable Information, we apply administrative, technical, and physical security measures. These measures include computer safeguards and secured files and buildings. In the event we share information with third party service providers or joint marketers, we restrict the ability of such parties to use or disclose the information we furnish. We also require such parties to apply appropriate security measures to protect information. Unfortunately, no data transmission or storage system can be guaranteed to be absolutely secure, and we disclaim any representation or warranty that our information security systems or those of our service providers and joint marketers are absolutely invulnerable to breach or compromise.</p>

    <h3>Links to Other Websites</h3>
    <p>The information and disclosures contained in this Notice apply only to our Sites. If you link to a third party website from our Site, the third party website will not be governed by this Notice. We recommend that you review the internet or online privacy notice for any third party website you visit, including any social media website or application.</p>

    <h3>Keeping Information Accurate</h3>
    <p>Keeping your account information accurate and up-to-date is very important. If you ever find that our records are incomplete, inaccurate or not current, please call the telephone number on your account statement or email <a href="home-contact.asp">customer service</a>. We will correct the information as quickly as possible.</p>

    <p>Hancock Bank does not collect information on our web sites from persons we actually know are under 13 years old, and no part of our web site is targeted toward any person under 13 years old. Parents can limit web site access by their children by installing programs that enable parental control of Internet access.</p>
