                visitors on its Web sites to send e-mail messages to Hancock Bank 
                so that Hancock Bank may respond to inquiries regarding Hancock 
                Bank or its products or services. Hancock Bank retains copies

                will only be used to respond to the visitor's inquiry and to provide 
                better customer service. If Hancock Bank thinks that a particular

                needs, then Hancock Bank may occasionally contact you at your

                Through its Web site, Hancock Bank offers opportunities to apply 
                for various products and services online, such as PC banking and 
                brokerage services. Visitors who choose to apply for such products 
                and services provide personal information Hancock Bank needs to 
                process the application. To protect the confidentiality of the 
                information submitted, Hancock Bank uses secure socket layer (SSL) 
                technology. SSL technology establishes a "secure" Internet session 
                and encodes the data submitted to the Hancock Bank Web site, ensuring 
                that the information is accessible only to an authorized Hancock 
                Bank representative and the customer. To support SSL, customers 
                must have an Internet browser that supports state-of-the-art 128-bit 
                "strong" encryption, such as Netscape 2.0 and higher, Microsoft's 
                Internet Explorer 2.0 and higher, and AOL 3.0 (Windows). A customer 
                can tell whether a document comes from a secure server by looking 
                at the location (URL) field. If the URL begins with https:// (instead 
                of http://), the document comes from a secure server. After you 
                have submitted an application online, Hancock Bank recommends 
                that you end your browser session before leaving your computer.
