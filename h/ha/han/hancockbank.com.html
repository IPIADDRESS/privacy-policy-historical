              submitted, Hancock Bank uses secure socket layer (SSL) technology. 
              SSL technology establishes a "secure" Internet session and encodes 
              the data submitted to the Hancock Bank Web site, ensuring that the 
              information is accessible only to an authorized Hancock Bank representative

              browser that supports state-of-the-art 128-bit "strong" encryption, 
              such as Netscape 6.1 and higher, Microsoft's Internet Explorer 6.0 
              and higher, and AOL 3.0 (Windows). A customer can tell whether a 
              document comes from a secure server by looking at the location (URL) 
              field. If the URL begins with https:// (instead of http://), the 
              document comes from a secure server. After you have submitted an 
              application online, Hancock Bank recommends that you end your browser
