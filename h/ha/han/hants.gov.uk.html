</p><h1>Privacy Statement</h1>
<h3>What it covers</h3>
<p>This policy covers the treatment of personally identifiable information that
Hampshire County Council collects when you are in the <a href="http://www.hants.gov.uk">hants.gov.uk</a>
domain. Links within this domain to other web sites are not covered by this
policy.</p>
<h3>Information collection</h3>
<p>You can visit our site and use many of the services without telling us who
you are or giving us any personally identifiable information.</p>
<p>The Council does not use <a href="#cookies">cookies</a> for the general running of
the site. Cookies may be used on some 'interactive' pages to provide additional
functionality or when it is totally necessary to maintain a unique 'id.' on your
browser whilst you use those pages. Where cookies are used their purpose will be
made clear.</p>
<p>It is only when you complete a form that requests personal information or
email Hampshire County Council that you can be identified. When completing forms
you may be asked for a variety of personal information such as name, address,
post code etc.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
Hampshire County Council automatically receives and records information on
server logs from your <a href="#browser">browser</a>. The Council only monitors the <a href="#ip"> IP</a> addresses of visitors to assess
which pages are the most popular. These IP addresses are not linked to any
personal data so all visitors to our site remain anonymous.</p>
<h3>Information use</h3>
<p>Where you
voluntarily choose to give us your personal details the personal data you give Hampshire County Council will be used exclusively for
providing you with the information or service you have requested.</p>
<h3>Information Sharing and Disclosure</h3>
<p>Hampshire County Council will not sell or rent your personally identifiable
information to anyone.</p>
<p>Hampshire County Council will only send personally identifiable information
about you to other organisations when we have your consent. This is only necessary
when we need to share your information in order to provide the information or
service requested. We also use the information in response to subpoenas, court
orders or other legal process.</p>
<h3><b>Security:</b></h3>
<p>While we strive to keep the information that you supply secure, please be
aware that the Internet is not a fully secure medium. We use <a href="#secure"> secure servers</a> for
collecting sensitive information.</p>
<h3><b>Policy changes:</b></h3>
<p>By using our site you agree to accept this privacy policy and are aware that
our policy may change with time. Any changes to this policy will appear on this
web page.</p>

request forms and contacting the Data Protection Officer, please see the <a href="/dataprotection/">Hampshire
County Council Data Protection pages</a>.</p>
<h3>Summary of terms</h3>

<a name="browser"></a><p><a name="browser"><b>Browser</b></a><b><br>
</b>Used to locate and display Web pages via a software application. The most
popular ones are Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer.</p>


<a name="cookies"></a><p><a name="cookies"><b>Cookie</b></a><br>
Message given to a web<b> </b>browser by a web
server. The message is then stored by the browser
in a text file called <i>cookie.txt.</i> Each time the browser requests a page
from the server, this message is sent back. A cookie's main objective is to
identify users and personalise their visit by customising web pages for them for
example by welcoming them by name next time they visit the same site. A site
using cookies will usually invite you to provide personal information such as
your name, e-mail address and interests.</p>
 
<a name="ip"></a><p><a name="ip"><b>IP (Internet Protocol)</b></a><br>
All networks connected to the internet speak IP, the technical standard which
allows data to be transmitted between two devices. <b>TCP/IP </b>(Transmission
Control Protocol/Internet Protocol) is responsible for making sure messages get
from one host to another and that the messages are understood.</p>
<a name="ip-address"></a><p><a name="ip-address"><b>IP address</b></a><br>
If you are connected to the Internet you have one, for example it may look
something like this 198.184.98.9</p>
<a name="secure"></a><p><a name="secure"><b>Secure Server</b></a><br>
This allows information to be sent 'securely' by encrypting the information you
send. HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol over Secure Socket Layer, or HTTP over SSL)
is a facility built into a browser that encrypts and decrypts user page requests
as well as the pages that are returned by the Web server.</p>
<p><a name="web-server"><b>Web Server</b></a><br>
Delivers (serves up) web pages to your computer.</p>
