          <h4> Privacy Policy<br>
            Please read this carefully<br>
          </h4>
          <p>Updated  May 25th 2007<br>
            Published: May 25th 2007</p>
          <p>Before using the Website , it is your responsibility to read the Privacy Policy. You can notify us in the manner set out below if you do not want us to share information about you with third parties.</p>
          <h4>The basic principles</h4>
          <p>By accessing and using the Website you are agreeing to be legally bound by  this Privacy Policy. <br>
          </p>
          <p>Hanky Panky Ltd. is determined to protect your privacy.<br>
            It is very important to us that you should be able to use and enjoy the Website without having to compromise your privacy unacceptably.</p>
          <p>Knowing something about our users is, however, necessary to ensure that our service is continually improved.<br>
            We need to build an accurate picture of the needs and wishes of our users, and to be able to communicate with you.<br>
            That enables us to offer a service that is relevant and truly interactive, which is what our users expect.<br>
          </p>
          <h4>We answer your important questions</h4>
          <h4>"What information do you collect about me?"</h4>
          <p>We automatically collect some data about our users' browsing actions and patterns. This is aggregate data and does not identify any individual.</p>
          <p>We may also ask you to provide personal information on a<strong> <u>voluntary basis</u></strong> in order to get a clearer picture of our users. <br>
            It is then entirely up to you whether you are happy to give us this information.</p>
          <p>In the course of entering competitions, promotions and other offers you will be asked to give some details about yourself.<br>
            You may also choose to e-mail us or make contact with us in other ways. Such contact gives us information about you.</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <h4>"For what purposes do you collect and use this information?"</h4>
          <p>We use aggregate audience details (where no individual is identifiable) to help us improve our understanding of our users and their preferences. <br>
            We use it to assist us in arranging relevant advertising, commercial opportunities and competitions, as well as ensuring the best editorial coverage. It also helps us develop the Website and audit its use.</p>
          <p>* The information about you as an identifiable individual, including contact details, may be used in the following ways:</p>
          <p>* to conduct market research and other surveys.</p>
          <p>* to create and draw to your attention editorial material and commercial opportunities that may be of interest to you.</p>
          <p>* to be shared with advertisers, trading partners and other commercial entities with whom we have or might have an association. We may also be able to share the information that they obtain about their users, which may include you.</p>

However we cannot be held responsible for the actions of any third party who receives or obtains access to the information, or for any breach of security.</p>
          <p>If you tell us that you do not want us to use your details, then data about your use of the Website would then only form part of aggregated statistics and would not be related to you as an individual.</p>
          <p>You can ask to see the information we have about you by e-mailing a request to customerservice@hankypanky.com</p>
          <h4>"What do I do if I am not happy for you to share information about me with others?"</h4>

You can e-mail customerservices@hankypanky.com at any time to let us know of any objections you may have to how we use or disclose your data in the ways set out in this Privacy Policy. Your personal details may in any event be shared with third party organisations we have contracted to provide services to us, on an agency basis, which include processing data. We may also have to release information (which could include the contents of e-mail communications between any persons) because of a legal requirement on us or pursuant to a court order.</p>
