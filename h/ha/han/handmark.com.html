 	<h1>Handmark Privacy Policy</h1>
<p>Handmark respects your privacy rights and recognizes the importance of protecting any information collected about you. This Privacy Policy defines how Handmark collects and uses personal and non-personal information.</p>
<p>BY INSTALLING HANDMARK APPLICATIONS, USING OR OTHERWISE ACCESSING HANDMARK PRODUCTS &amp; SERVICES, YOU AGREE TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY, PLEASE DO NOT INSTALL, USE OR OTHERWISE ACCESS HANDMARK PRODUCTS &amp; SERVICES. Handmark reserves the right to modify this Privacy Policy at reasonable times, so please review it frequently. We may e-mail periodic reminders of our notices and conditions. Unless stated otherwise, our current Privacy Notice applies to all information that we have about you and your account. We stand behind the promises we make and will never materially change our policies and practices to make them less protective of customer information collected in the past without the consent of affected customers.</p>

<h3>Personal Data</h3>
<p>Handmark does not collect or use any personal data that may be used to identify, track, or contact you, unless you have intentionally provided it. You can choose not to provide certain information, but please realize you might not be able to take advantage of many of our features. </p>
<p>We do receive and store certain types of automatic information whenever you interact with us. As with many Web sites, we use "cookies," and we obtain certain types of information when your Web browser accesses Handmark.com. A number of companies offer utilities designed to help you visit Web sites anonymously. Although we will not be able to provide you with a personalized experience at Handmark.com if we cannot recognize you, we want you to be aware that these tools exist. </p>
<p>(Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer's hard drive through your Web browser to enable our systems to recognize your browser and to provide features such as personalized product spotlights and storage of items in your Shopping Cart between visits.)</p>


<h3>Non-personal data</h3>
<p>Handmark may use tools or third party analytical software to collect and use certain non-personal data that does not enable Handmark to identify you. The types of non-personal data Handmark may collect and use include, but are not limited to: (i) mobile device type and device properties; (ii) mobile device software platform and firmware; (iii) mobile phone carrier; (iv) geographical data no more accurate that metropolitan areas; (v) gamescore and achievements; (vi) other non-personal data as reasonably required by Handmark to enhance its services.</p>
<p>Handmark may use the collected data for purposes of analyzing usage and to further develop its products and services. Handmark reserves the right to use and disclose the collected non-personal data for purposes of advertisement by Handmark or Handmark partners.</p>

<h3>Third Party Terms and Conditions</h3>
<p>Please note that your access to Handmark products and services may be subject to certain third party terms and conditions and privacy policies, including but not limited to application stores, mobile software platforms, on-line gaming platforms and payment providers.

<h3>Links to Third Party Sites</h3>
<p>Handmark may at its discretion make available links through advertisements or otherwise enabling you to access third party sites or applications. Please note that, while using such sites, you are using properties administered by people or companies not affiliated with or controlled by Handmark. Handmark is not responsible for the actions of those people or companies, the content of their sites or games, the use of information you provide to them, or any products or services they may offer. Our link to those sites does not constitute our sponsorship of, or affiliation with, those people or companies.</p>


<h3>Security</h3>
<p>We work to protect the security of your information during transmission by using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software, which encrypts information you input. We reveal only the last five digits of your credit card numbers when confirming an order. Of course, we transmit the entire credit card number to the appropriate credit card company during order processing. It is important for you to protect against unauthorized access to your password and to your computer. Be sure to sign off when finished using a shared computer.</p>

<h3>Settings Options</h3>
<p>If you do not want to receive e-mail or other mail from us, please adjust your Newsletter Preferences. (If you do not want to receive "Conditions of Use" and other legal notices from us, such as this Privacy Notice, those notices will still govern your use of Handmark.com, and it is your responsibility to review them for changes.) </p>
<p>The Help portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. However, you will not be able to use such important features as personalized settings and saving your shopping cart for later use. </p>
