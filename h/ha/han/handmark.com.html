<p>Handmark knows that you care how information about you is used and shared, 
  and we appreciate your trust that we will do so carefully and sensibly. This 
  notice describes our privacy policy. By visiting Handmark.com, you are accepting 
  the practices described in this Privacy Notice. </p>
<p><b>What Personal Information Does Handmark.com Gather?</b></p>
<p>The information we learn from customers helps us personalize and continually 
  improve your shopping experience at Handmark.com. Here are the types of information 
  we gather. 
</p><ul class="bullet">
  <li><b>Information You Give Us:</b> We receive and store any information you 
    enter on our Web site or give us in any other way. You can choose not to provide 
    certain information, but then you might not be able to take advantage of many 
    of our features. We use the information that you provide for such purposes 
    as responding to your requests, customizing future shopping for you, improving 
    our stores, and communicating with you. 
  </li><li><b>Automatic Information:</b> We receive and store certain types of information 
    whenever you interact with us. For example, like many Web sites, we use "cookies," 
    and we obtain certain types of information when your Web browser accesses 
    Handmark.com. A number of companies offer utilities designed to help you visit 
    Web sites anonymously. Although we will not be able to provide you with a 
    personalized experience at Handmark.com if we cannot recognize you, we want 
    you to be aware that these tools exist. 
</li></ul>
<p></p>
<p><b>What About Cookies?</b> 
</p><ul class="bullet">
  <li>Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer's 
    hard drive through your Web browser to enable our systems to recognize your 
    browser and to provide features such as personalized product spotlights and 
    storage of items in your Shopping Cart between visits. 
  </li><li>The Help portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent 
    your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you 
    when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. However, 
    cookies allow you to take full advantage of some of Handmark.com's coolest 
    features, and we recommend that you leave them turned on. </li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p><b>Does Handmark.com Share the Information It Receives?</b></p>
<p>Information about our customers is an important part of our business, and we 
  are not in the business of selling it to others. We share customer information 
  only as described below and with subsidiaries Handmark.com, Inc. controls that 
  either are subject to this Privacy Notice or follow practices at least as protective 
  as those described in this Privacy Notice. 
</p><ul class="bullet">
  <li><b>Developer-Partners:</b> We sell offerings from other developers at Handmark.com. 
    In some cases, we provide information to these developers so they can fulfill 
    and provide support for their products. 
  </li><li><b>Agents:</b> We employ other companies and individuals to perform functions 
    on our behalf. Examples include fulfilling orders, delivering packages, sending 
    postal mail and e-mail, removing repetitive information from customer lists, 
    analyzing data, providing marketing assistance, providing search results and 
    links (including paid listings and links), processing credit card payments, 
    and providing customer service. They have access to personal information needed 
    to perform their functions, but may not use it for other purposes. 
  </li><li><b>Business Transfers:</b> As we continue to develop our business, we might 
    sell or buy subsidiaries or business units. In such transactions, customer 
    information generally is one of the transferred business assets but remains 
    subject to the promises made in any pre-existing Privacy Notice (unless, of 
    course, the customer consents otherwise). Also, in the unlikely event that 
    Handmark, Inc., or substantially all of its assets are acquired, customer 
    information will of course be one of the transferred assets. 
  </li><li><b>Protection of Handmark and Others:</b> We release account and other personal 
    information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with the law; 
    enforce or apply our Conditions of Use and other agreements; or protect the 
    rights, property, or safety of Handmark, our users, or others. This includes 
    exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection 
    and credit risk reduction. Obviously, however, this does not include selling, 
    renting, sharing, or otherwise disclosing personally identifiable information 
    from customers for commercial purposes in violation of the commitments set 
    forth in this Privacy Notice. 
</li></ul>
<p></p>
<p><b>How Secure Is Information About Me?</b> 
</p><ul class="bullet">
  <li>We work to protect the security of your information during transmission 
    by using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software, which encrypts information you 
    input. 
  </li><li>We reveal only the last five digits of your credit card numbers when confirming 
    an order. Of course, we transmit the entire credit card number to the appropriate 
    credit card company during order processing. 
  </li><li>It is important for you to protect against unauthorized access to your password 
    and to your computer. Be sure to sign off when finished using a shared computer.</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p><b>Which Information Can I Access?</b></p>
<p>Handmark.com gives you access to a broad range of information about your account 
  and your interactions with Handmark.com for the limited purpose of viewing and, 
  in certain cases, updating that information. </p>
<p><b>What Choices Do I Have?</b> 
</p><ul class="bullet">
  <li>As discussed above, you can always choose not to provide information, even 
    though it might be needed to make a purchase or to take advantage of such 
    Handmark.com features. 
  </li><li>You can add or update certain information on pages such as those listed 
    in the "Which Information Can I Access?" section above. When you update information, 
    we usually keep a copy of the prior version for our records. 
  </li><li>If you do not want to receive e-mail or other mail from us, please adjust 
    your Newsletter Preferences. (If you do not want to receive "Conditions of 
    Use" and other legal notices from us, such as this Privacy Notice, those notices 
    will still govern your use of Handmark.com, and it is your responsibility 
    to review them for changes.) 
  </li><li>The Help portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent 
    your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you 
    when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. However, 
    you will not be able to use such important features as personalized settings 
    and saving your shopping cart for later use. 
</li></ul>
<p></p>
<p><b>Children</b></p>
<p>Handmark.com does not sell products for purchase by children. We sell children's 
  products for purchase by adults. If you are under 18, you may use Handmark.com 
  only with the involvement of a parent or guardian. </p>
<p><b>Conditions of Use, Notices, and Revisions</b> </p>
<p>If you choose to visit Handmark.com, your visit and any dispute over privacy 
  is subject to this Notice and our Conditions of Use, including limitations on 
  damages, arbitration of disputes, and application of the law of the state of 
  New Hampshire. If you have any concern about privacy at Handmark.com, please 
  send us a thorough description to support@Handmark.com, and we will try to resolve 
  it. </p>
<p>Our business changes constantly, and our Privacy Notice and the Conditions 
  of Use will change also. We may e-mail periodic reminders of our notices and 
  conditions, unless you have instructed us not to, but you should check our Web 
  site frequently to see recent changes. Unless stated otherwise, our current 
  Privacy Notice applies to all information that we have about you and your account. 
  We stand behind the promises we make, however, and will never materially change 
  our policies and practices to make them less protective of customer information 
  collected in the past without the consent of affected customers. </p>
