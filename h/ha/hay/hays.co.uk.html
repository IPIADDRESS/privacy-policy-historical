<p>***</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong><a name="ClientColl"></a>CLIENT DATA:</strong> The data we collect about <a href="#Clients">Clients</a> is actually very limited. We generally only need to have your contact details or the details of individual contacts at your organisation (such as their names, telephone numbers and email addresses) to enable us to ensure that our relationship runs smoothly. We also hold information relating to your online engagement with <a href="#Candidates">Candidate</a> profiles and other material published by Hays, which we use to ensure that our marketing communications to you are relevant and timely. We may also hold extra information that someone in your organisation has chosen to tell us. In certain circumstances, such as when you engage with our Finance and Debt Recovery teams, our calls with you may be recorded, depending on the applicable local laws and requirements. If we need any additional personal data for any reason, we will let you know.  <br>

<p><strong><a name="KinColl"></a>PEOPLE WHOSE DATA WE RECEIVE FROM CANDIDATES AND STAFF, SUCH AS REFEREES AND EMERGENCY CONTACTS AND DEPENDANTS:</strong> All we need from referees is confirmation of what you already know about our <a href="#Candidates">Candidate</a> or prospective member of <a href="#Staff">Staff</a>, so that they can secure that job they really want. Emergency contact details give us somebody to call on in an emergency. To ask for a reference, we'll obviously need the referee's contact details (such as name, email address and telephone number). We'll also need these details if our <a href="#Candidates">Candidate</a> or a member of our <a href="#Staff">Staff</a> has put you down as their emergency contact so that we can contact you in the event of an accident or an emergency.</p>
<p>We will collect your date of birth, contact details and potentially some health information if a member of our <a href="#Staff">Staff</a> has put you down as a dependant or any other kind of beneficiary for a benefit connected with their employment or if a member of our <a href="#Staff">Staff</a> exercises certain employment rights.

Please note that in certain of the jurisdictions in which we operate, we comply with additional local law requirements. For more information in relation to your jurisdiction, please click <a href="#Annex-3">here</a>.<br>         &nbsp;</li>         <li>Soft opt-in consent is a specific type of consent which applies where you have previously engaged with us (for example by submitting a job application or CV, or registering a vacancy to be filled), and we are marketing other recruitment-related services. Under ‘soft opt-in’ consent, we will take your consent as given unless or until you opt out. For most people, this is beneficial as it allows us to provide you with information that we think will be of interest to you and suggest other jobs to you alongside the specific one you applied for, significantly increasing the likelihood of us finding you a new position.

Nobody's perfect, even though we try to be. We want to let you know that even if you have opted out from our marketing communications through our preference centre, it is possible that your details may be recaptured through public sources in an unconnected marketing campaign. We will try to make sure this doesn't happen, but if it does, we're sorry. We'd just ask that in those circumstances you opt out again. <br>         &nbsp;</li>         <li>All our marketing is based on what we think will serve our <a href="#Clients">Clients</a> and <a href="#Candidates">Candidates </a>best, but we know we won’t always get it right for everyone. We may use your data to show you Hays adverts and other content on other websites, for example Facebook. If you do not want us to use your data in this way, please turn off the “Advertising Cookies” option (please refer to our <a href="#cookieslong">Cookies Policy</a>). Even where you have turned off advertising cookies, it is still possible that you may see a Hays advert, but in this case it won’t have been targeted at you personally, but rather at an anonymous audience. <br>         &nbsp;</li>     </ul>     <p><strong><a name="SPD"></a>Equal opportunities monitoring and other sensitive personal data</strong></p>     <li>We are committed to ensuring that our recruitment processes are aligned with our approach to equal opportunities. Some of the data we may (in appropriate circumstances and in accordance with local law and requirements) collect about you comes under the umbrella of "diversity information". This could be information about your ethnic background, gender, disability, age, sexual orientation, religion or other similar beliefs, and/or social-economic background. Where appropriate and in accordance with local laws and requirements, we'll use this information on an anonymised basis to monitor our compliance with our equal opportunities policy. We may also disclose this (suitably anonymised where relevant) data to <a href="#Clients">Clients</a> where this is contractually required or the <a href="#Clients">Client</a> specifically requests such information to enable them to comply with their own employment processes. <br>     &nbsp;</li>     <li>This diversity information is what is called ‘sensitive’ or 'special category' personal information and slightly stricter data protection rules apply to it. We therefore need to obtain your explicit consent before we can use it. We'll ask for your consent by offering you an opt-in. This means that you have to explicitly and clearly tell us that you agree to us collecting and using this information.<br>     &nbsp;</li>     <li>We may collect other sensitive/special category personal data about you, such as health-related information, religious affiliation, or details of any criminal convictions if this is appropriate in accordance with local laws and is required for a role that you are interested in applying for. We will never do this without your explicit consent unless we have another valid legal basis to do so. <br>     &nbsp;</li>     <li>If you would like to find out more about consent, please click <a href="#Consent">here</a>.

If you do not provide consent to profiling, your application will continue to be reviewed manually for opportunities you apply for, but your profile will not be automatically considered for alternative roles. This is likely to decrease the likelihood of us successfully finding you a new job.<br>     &nbsp;</li>     <li>You have the right to withdraw that consent at any time and can find out more about how to do so <a href="#Consentwithdraw">here</a>. <br>     &nbsp;</li> </ul> <p>***</p> <ul>     <li><strong><a name="USE-client"></a>CLIENT DATA: </strong> We use <a href="#Clients">Client</a> information for:     <p>- <a href="#Clientrec">Recruitment Activities</a>;</p>     <p>- <a href="#ClientMark">Marketing Activities; </a>and</p>     <p>- <a href="#Clilegal">To help us to establish, exercise or defend legal claims.</a></p></li>     <p>Here are some more details about each:&nbsp;</p>     <p><strong><a name="Clientrec"></a>Recruitment Activities </strong></p>     <ul>         <li>Obviously, our main area of work is recruitment, through: (i) providing you with <a href="#Candidates">Candidates</a>; (ii) <a href="#RPO">RPO services</a> ; and (iii) <a href="#MSP">MSP programmes</a>.

<h3>WHO DO WE SHARE YOUR PERSONAL DATA WITH?</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Where appropriate and in accordance with local laws and requirements, we may share your personal data, in various ways and for various reasons, with the following categories of people:
    <p>- Any of our group companies;</p>
    <p>- Individuals and organisations who hold information related to your reference or application to work with us, such as current, past or prospective employers, educators and examining bodies and employment and recruitment agencies;</p>
    <p>- Tax, audit, or other authorities, when we believe in good faith that the law or other regulation requires us to share this data (for example, because of a request by a tax authority or in connection with any anticipated litigation);</p>
    <p>- Third party service providers who perform functions on our behalf (including external consultants, business associates and professional advisers such as lawyers, auditors and accountants, technical support functions and IT consultants carrying out testing and development work on our business technology systems);</p>
    <p>- Third party outsourced IT and document storage providers where we have an appropriate processing agreement (or similar protections) in place;</p>
    <p>- Marketing technology platforms and suppliers;</p>
    <p>- In the case of <a href="#Candidates">Candidates</a>: potential employers and other recruitment agencies/organisations to increase your chances of finding employment;</p>
    <p>- In the case of <a href="#Candidates">Candidates</a>: third party partners, job boards and job aggregators where we consider this will improve the chances of finding you the right job;</p>
    <p>- In the case of <a href="#Candidates">Candidates</a>: <a href="#MSP">MSP suppliers</a> as part of our clients' <a href="#MSP">MSP programmes</a>;</p>

    <p>- If Hays merges with or is acquired by another business or company in the future, (or is in meaningful discussions about such a possibility) we may share your personal data with the (prospective) new owners of the business or company.</p>
    <br>
    &nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>*******************************</p>
<p><a name="safeguard"></a></p>
<h3>HOW DO WE SAFEGUARD YOUR PERSONAL DATA?</h3>
<ul>
    <li>We are committed to taking all reasonable and appropriate steps to protect the personal information that we hold from misuse, loss, or unauthorised access. We do this by having in place a range of appropriate technical and organisational measures. These include measures to deal with any suspected data breach.<br>
    &nbsp;</li>
    <li>If you suspect any misuse or loss of or unauthorised access to your personal information please let us know immediately. Details of how to contact us can be found <a href="#Annex-1">here</a>. <br>
    &nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>********************************</p>
<p><a name="retention"></a></p>
<h3>HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR PERSONAL DATA FOR?</h3>
<ul>
    <li>We will <a href="#Delete">Delete</a> your personal data from our systems if we have not had any meaningful contact with you (or, where appropriate, the company you are working for or with) for two years (or for such longer period as we believe in good faith that the law or relevant regulators require us to preserve your data). After this period, it is likely your data will no longer be relevant for the purposes for which it was collected. <br>
    &nbsp;</li>
    <li>For those <a href="#Candidates">Candidates</a> whose services are provided via a third party company or other entity, "meaningful contact" with you means meaningful contact with the company or entity which supplies your services. Where we are notified by such company or entity that it no longer has that relationship with you, we will retain your data for no longer than two years from that point or, if later, for the period of two years from the point we subsequently have meaningful contact directly with you.<br>
    &nbsp;</li>
    <li>When we refer to "meaningful contact", we mean, for example, communication between us (either verbal or written), or where you are actively engaging with our online services. If you are a <a href="#Candidates">Candidate</a> we will consider there to be meaningful contact with you if you submit your updated CV onto our website or take part in any of our online training. We will also consider it meaningful contact if you communicate with us about potential roles, either by verbal or written communication or click through from any of our marketing communications. Your receipt, opening or reading of an email or other digital message from us will not count as meaningful contact – this will only occur in cases where you click-through or reply directly. <br>

<h3>HOW CAN YOU ACCESS, AMEND OR TAKE BACK THE PERSONAL DATA THAT YOU HAVE GIVEN TO US?</h3>
<ul>
    <li>One of the GDPR's main objectives is to protect and clarify the rights of EU citizens and individuals in the EU with regards to data privacy. This means that you retain various rights in respect of your data, even once you have given it to us. These are described in more detail below.<br>
    &nbsp;</li>
    <li>To get in touch about these rights, please <a href="#Annex-1">contact us</a>. We will seek to deal with your request without undue delay, and in any event within one month (subject to any extensions to which we are lawfully entitled). Please note that we may keep a record of your communications to help us resolve any issues which you raise.<br>
    &nbsp;</li>
    <li><strong><a name="Legitintobj"></a>Right to object:</strong> this right enables you to object to us processing your personal data where we do so for one of the following four reasons: (i) our <a href="#legitintv2">legitimate interests</a>; (ii) to enable us to perform a task in the public interest or exercise official authority; (iii) to send you direct marketing materials; and (iv) for scientific, historical, research, or statistical purposes.<br>
    &nbsp;</li>
    <li>The "legitimate interests" and "direct marketing" categories above are the ones most likely to apply to our <a href="#Website-Users">Website Users</a>, <a href="#Candidates">Candidates</a>, <a href="#Clients">Clients</a> and <a href="#Suppliers">Suppliers</a>. If your objection relates to us processing your personal data because we deem it necessary for your legitimate interests, we must act on your objection by ceasing the activity in question unless:
    <p>- we can show that we have compelling legitimate grounds for processing which overrides your interests; or</p>
    <p>- we are processing your data for the establishment, exercise or defence of a legal claim.</p>
    <br>
    &nbsp;</li>
    <li>If your objection relates to direct marketing, we must act on your objection by ceasing this activity. <br>
    &nbsp;</li>
    <li><strong><a name="consentwithdraw"></a>Right to withdraw consent:</strong> Where we have obtained your consent to process your personal data for certain activities (for example, for our marketing arrangements or automatic profiling), you may withdraw this consent at any time and we will cease to carry out the particular activity that you previously consented to unless we consider that there is an alternative reason to justify our continued processing of your data for this purpose in which case we will inform you of this condition.<br>
    &nbsp;</li>
    <li><strong>Data Subject Access Requests (DSAR):</strong> You may ask us to confirm what information we hold about you at any time, and request us to modify, update or <a href="#Delete">Delete</a> such information. We may ask you to verify your identity and for more information about your request. If we provide you with access to the information we hold about you, we will not charge you for this unless your request is "manifestly unfounded or excessive". If you request further copies of this information from us, we may charge you a reasonable administrative cost where legally permissible. Where we are legally permitted to do so, we may refuse your request. If we refuse your request we will always tell you the reasons for doing so. <br>
    &nbsp;
    <ul>
        <li>Please note that in certain of the jurisdictions in which we operate, we comply with additional local law requirements regarding data subject access requests and may refuse your request in accordance with such laws. For more information in relation to your jurisdiction, please click <a href="#Annex-3">here</a>.<br>
        &nbsp;</li>
        <li><strong>Right to erasure:</strong> You have the right to request that we erase your personal data in certain circumstances. Normally, the information must meet one of the following criteria:
        <p>- the data are no longer necessary for the purpose for which we originally collected and/or processed them;</p>
        <p>- where previously given, you have withdrawn your consent to us processing your data, and there is no other valid reason for us to continue processing;</p>
        <p>- the data has been processed unlawfully (i.e. in a manner which does not comply with the GDPR);</p>
        <p>- it is necessary for the data to be erased in order for us to comply with our legal obligations as a data controller; or</p>
        <p>- if we process the data because we believe it necessary to do so for our legitimate interests, you object to the processing and we are unable to demonstrate overriding legitimate grounds for our continued processing.</p>
        <br>
        &nbsp;</li>
        <li>Please note that in certain of the jurisdictions in which we operate, we comply with additional local law requirements regarding data subject right to erasure and may refuse your request in accordance with local laws. For more information in relation to your jurisdiction, please click <a href="#Annex-3">here</a>.<br>
        &nbsp;</li>
        <li>We would only be entitled to refuse to comply with your request for one of the following reasons: <br>
        &nbsp;</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <p>- to exercise the right of freedom of expression and information;</p>
    <p>- to comply with legal obligations or for the performance of a public interest task or exercise of official authority;</p>
    <p>- for public health reasons in the public interest;</p>
    <p>- for archival, research or statistical purposes; or</p>
    <p>- to exercise or defend a legal claim.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>When complying with a valid request for the erasure of data we will <a href="#Delete">Delete</a> the relevant data.<br>
        &nbsp;</li>
        <li><strong>Right to restrict processing:</strong> You have the right to request that we restrict our processing of your personal data in certain circumstances. This means that we can only continue to store your data and will not be able to carry out any further processing activities with it until either: (i) one of the circumstances listed below is resolved; (ii) you consent; or (iii) further processing is necessary for either the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims, the protection of the rights of another individual, or reasons of important EU or Member State public interest. <br>
        &nbsp;</li>
        <li>The circumstances in which you are entitled to request that we restrict the processing of your personal data are:
        <p>- where you dispute the accuracy of the personal data that we are processing about you. In this case, our processing of your personal data will be restricted for the period during which the accuracy of the data is verified;</p>
        <p>- where you object to our processing of your personal data for our legitimate interests. Here, you can request that the data be restricted while we verify our grounds for processing your personal data;</p>
        <p>- where our processing of your data is unlawful, but you would prefer us to restrict our processing of it rather than erasing it; and</p>
        <p>- where we have no further need to process your personal data but you require the data to establish, exercise, or defend legal claims.</p>
        <br>
        &nbsp;</li>
        <li>If we have shared your personal data with third parties, we will notify them about the restricted processing unless this is impossible or involves disproportionate effort. We will, of course, notify you before lifting any restriction on processing your personal data.<br>
        &nbsp;</li>
        <li><strong>Right to rectification:</strong> You also have the right to request that we rectify any inaccurate or incomplete personal data that we hold about you. If we have shared this personal data with third parties, we will notify them about the rectification unless this is impossible or involves disproportionate effort. Where appropriate, we will also tell you which third parties we have disclosed the inaccurate or incomplete personal data to. Where we think that it is reasonable for us not to comply with your request, we will explain our reasons for this decision.<br>
        &nbsp;</li>
        <li><strong>Right of data portability:</strong> If you wish, you have the right to transfer your personal data between data controllers. In effect, this means that you are able to transfer your Hays account details to another online platform. To allow you to do so, we will provide you with your data in a commonly used machine-readable format that is password-protected so that you can transfer the data to another online platform. Alternatively, we may directly transfer the data for you. This right of data portability applies to: (i) personal data that we process automatically (i.e. without any human intervention); (ii) personal data provided by you; and (iii) personal data that we process based on your consent or in order to fulfil a contract.</li>
        <li><strong>Right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority:</strong> You also have the right to lodge a complaint with your local supervisory authority. Details of how to contact them can be found <a href="#Annex-2">here</a>. <br>
        &nbsp;</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li>If you would like to exercise any of these rights, or withdraw your consent to the processing of your personal data (where consent is our legal basis for processing your personal data), details of how to contact us can be found <a href="#Annex-1">here</a>. Please note that we may keep a record of your communications to help us resolve any issues which you raise.<br>
        &nbsp;</li>
        <li>You may ask to unsubscribe from job alerts and any other marketing communications from us at any time. Details of how to do so can be found <a href="#unsubscribe ">here.</a><br>
        &nbsp;</li>
        <li>It is important that the personal information we hold about you is accurate and current. Please keep us informed if your personal information changes during the period for which we hold your data.<br>
        &nbsp;</li>

Cookies can also be used to analyse traffic and for advertising and marketing purposes. <br>     &nbsp;</li>     <li>Cookies are used by nearly all websites and do not harm your system. If you want to check or change what types of cookies you accept, this can usually be altered within your browser settings. We also provide information about this in our Marketing preferences page on the Hays website.<br>     &nbsp;</li>     <p><strong>How do we use cookies?</strong></p>     <li>We use cookies to do two things:     <p>- to track your use of our website. This enables us to understand how you use the site and track any patterns that emerge individually or from larger groups. This helps us to develop and improve our website and services in response to what our visitors want and need; and</p>     <p>- to help us advertise jobs to you that we think you'll be interested in. Hopefully this means less time for you trawling through endless pages and will get you into the employment you want more quickly.</p>     <br>     &nbsp;</li>     <li>Cookies are either:     <p>- Session cookies: these are only stored on your computer during your web session and are automatically deleted when you close your browser –  they usually store an anonymous session ID allowing you to browse a website without having to log in to each page but they do not collect any information from your computer; or</p>     <p>- Persistent cookies: a persistent cookie is stored as a file on your computer and it remains there when you close your web browser. The cookie can be read by the website that created it when you visit that website again. We use persistent cookies for Google Analytics and for personalisation (see below).</p>     <br>     &nbsp;</li>     <li>Cookies can also be categorised as follows:     <p>- Strictly necessary cookies: These cookies are essential to enable you to use the website effectively, such as when applying for a job, and therefore cannot be turned off.

These cookies do not gather information about you that could be used for marketing or remembering where you have been on the internet.</p>     <p>- Performance cookies: These cookies enable us to monitor and improve the performance of our website. For example, they allow us to count visits, identify traffic sources and see which parts of the site are most popular.</p>     <p>- Functionality cookies: These cookies allow our website to remember choices you make (such as your user name, language or the region you are in) and provide enhanced features. For instance, we may be able to provide you with news or updates relevant to the services you use. These cookies can also be used to remember changes you have made to text size, font and other parts of web pages that you can customise. They may also be used to provide services you have requested such as viewing a video or commenting on a blog. The information these cookies collect is usually anonymised.</p>     <p>- Personalisation cookies: These cookies help us to advertise details of potential job opportunities that we think may be of interest.

Once it's looking like you may get the job, your prospective employer may also want to double check any information you've given us (such as the results from psychometric evaluations or skills tests) or to confirm your references, qualifications and criminal record, to the extent that this is appropriate and in accordance with local laws.

We therefore think it's reasonable for us to process your data to make sure that we send you the most appropriate content. <br>     &nbsp;</li>     <li>We also think that it might help with your job search if you take part in our specialist online training or some of our more interactive services, if you have the time. These are part of our service offering as a business, and help differentiate us in a competitive marketplace, so it is in our legitimate interests to use your data for this reason. <br>     &nbsp;</li>     <li>We have to make sure our business runs smoothly, so that we can carry on providing services to <a href="#Candidates">Candidates</a> like you. We therefore also need to use your data for our internal administrative activities, like payroll and invoicing where relevant. <br>     &nbsp;</li>     <li>We have our own obligations under the law, which it is a legitimate interest of ours to insist on meeting! If we believe in good faith that it is necessary, we may therefore share your data in connection with crime detection, tax collection or actual or anticipated litigation. <br>     &nbsp;</li> </ul> <p>***</p> <ul>     <li><strong>CLIENT DATA:</strong><br>     &nbsp;</li>     <li>To ensure that we provide you with the best service possible, we store your personal data and/or the personal data of individual contacts at your organisation as well as keeping records of our conversations, meetings, registered jobs and placements. From time to time, we may also ask you to undertake a customer satisfaction survey. We think this is reasonable – we deem these uses of your data to be necessary for our legitimate interests as an organisation providing various recruitment services to you. <br>     &nbsp;</li> </ul> <p>***</p> <ul>     <li><strong>SUPPLIER DATA:</strong><br>     &nbsp;</li>     <li>We use and store the personal data of individuals within your organisation in order to facilitate the receipt of services from you as one of our <a href="#Suppliers">Suppliers</a>. We also hold your financial details, so that we can pay you for your services. We deem all such activities to be necessary within the range of our legitimate interests as a recipient of your services. <br>     &nbsp;</li> </ul> <p>***</p> <ul>     <li>PEOPLE WHOSE DATA WE RECEIVE FROM CANDIDATES AND STAFF, SUCH AS REFEREES AND EMERGENCY CONTACTS:<br>     &nbsp;</li>     <li>If you have been put down by a <a href="#Candidates">Candidate</a> or a prospective member of <a href="#Staff">Staff</a> as one of their referees, we use your personal data in order to contact you for a reference. This is a part of our quality assurance procedure and so we deem this to be necessary for our legitimate interests as an organisation offering recruitment services and employing people ourselves. <br>     &nbsp;</li>     <li>If a <a href="#Candidates">Candidate</a> or <a href="#Staff">Staff</a> member has given us your details as an emergency contact, we will use these details to contact you in the case of an accident or emergency. We are sure you will agree that this is a vital element of our people-orientated organisation, and so is necessary for our legitimate interests.  <br>     &nbsp;</li> </ul> <p>****************************************</p> <h3><a name="Consent"></a>CONSENT</h3> <ul>     <li>In certain circumstances, we are required to obtain your consent to the processing of your personal data in relation to certain activities. Depending on exactly what we are doing with your information, this consent will be opt-in consent or soft opt-in consent. <br>     &nbsp;</li>     <li>Article 4(11) of the <a href="#GDPR">GDPR</a> states that (opt-in) consent is "any freely given, specific, informed and unambiguous indication of the data subject's wishes by which he or she, by a statement or by a clear affirmative action, signifies agreement to the processing of personal data relating to him or her." In plain language, this means that:     <p>- you have to give us your consent freely, without us putting you under any type of pressure;</p>     <p>- you have to know what you are consenting to – so we'll make sure we give you enough information;</p>     <p>- you should have control over which processing activities you consent to and which you don’t. We provide these finer controls within our privacy preference centre; and</p>     <p>- you need to take positive and affirmative action in giving us your consent – we're likely to provide a tick box for you to check so that this requirement is met in a clear and unambiguous fashion.</p>     <p>We will keep records of the consents that you have given in this way.</p>     <br>     &nbsp;</li>     <li>We have already mentioned that, in some cases, we will be able to rely on soft opt-in consent. We are allowed to market products or services to you which are related to the recruitment services we provide to you as long as you do not actively opt-out from these communications.  <br>     &nbsp;</li>     <li>Please note that in certain of the jurisdictions in which we operate, we comply with additional local law requirements regarding consenting to receive marketing materials. For more information in relation to your jurisdiction, please click <a href="#Annex-3">here</a>.<br>     &nbsp;</li>     <li>As we have mentioned, you have the right to withdraw your consent to these activities. You can do so at any time, and details of how to do so can be found <a href="#consentwithdraw">here</a>. <br>     &nbsp;</li> </ul> <h3>ESTABLISHING, EXERCISING OR DEFENDING LEGAL CLAIMS</h3> <ul>     <li>Sometimes it may be necessary for us to process personal data and, where appropriate and in accordance with local laws and requirements, sensitive personal data in connection with exercising or defending legal claims. Article 9(2)(f) of the GDPR allows this where the processing "is necessary for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims or whenever courts are acting in their judicial capacity".<br>     &nbsp;</li>     <li>This may arise for example where we need to take legal advice in relation to legal proceedings or are required by law to preserve or disclose certain information as part of the legal process.<br>     &nbsp;</li> </ul> <h3>TO EXERCISE OUR RIGHTS OR CARRY OUT OUR EMPLOYMENT AND SOCIAL SECURITY LAW OBLIGATIONS</h3> <ul>     <li>For some <a href="#Candidates">Candidates</a>, and for individuals whose personal data is provided by <a href="#Candidates">Candidates</a> and <a href="#Staff">Staff</a> , it will sometimes be necessary for us to process your sensitive/special category personal data. Article 9(2)(b) of the GDPR allows us to do this where the processing is "necessary for the purposes of carrying out the obligations and exercising [our or your] specific rights… in the field of employment and social security and social protection law", as long as this is allowed by law.&nbsp;</li>      <li>We process <a href="#Candidates">Candidates</a> sensitive/special category personal data for the purpose of ensuring our compliance with our equal opportunities obligations where this is in accordance with local law, (for example, for some <a href="#Candidates">Candidates</a> during the course of the recruitment process). We may also process the sensitive/special category personal data of individuals connected with <a href="#Candidates">Candidates</a> or <a href="#Staff">Staff</a> for other reasons, for example to allow the relevant <a href="#Staff">Staff</a> member to access certain benefits or employment rights. You can find out how we process your sensitive/special category personal data under "What Kind of Personal Information Do We Collect?" above.</li> </ul>

            <h3>GLOSSARY</h3>
<ul>
    <li><em><strong><a name="Candidates"></a>Candidates </strong></em>– includes applicants for all roles advertised or promoted by Hays, including permanent, part-time and temporary positions and freelance roles with Hays' <a href="#Clients">Clients</a>; as well as people who have supplied a speculative CV to Hays not in relation to a specific job. Individual contractors, freelance workers and employees of suppliers or other third parties put forward for roles with Hays, <a href="#Clients">Clients</a> as part of an <a href="#MSP">MSP </a>offering or otherwise will be treated as candidates for the purposes of this Privacy Policy. <br>
    &nbsp;</li>
    <li><em><strong><a name="Clients"></a>Clients</strong></em> - while it speaks for itself, this category covers our customers, clients, and others to whom Hays provides services in the course of its business.<br>
    &nbsp;</li>
    <li><strong><em><a name="Delete"></a>Delete</em> </strong>–In this day and age it is virtually impossible to guarantee the permanent and irretrievable deletion of electronic data.  In addition, as we have explained to you in this Privacy Policy, sometimes we may be obliged by law or regulation, or need for risk-management reasons, to retain the ability to access certain elements of personal data.  However, our commitment to you is that once your personal data reaches the end of its nominal retention period, or where we receive a valid request from you to erase it, we will put in place specific operational and <a href="#Systems">Systems</a> measures to ensure that your data is "put beyond use".  By this we mean that while the data will still technically exist on an archive system, we will ensure that it cannot be accessed by any of our operational <a href="#Systems">Systems</a> , processes or <a href="#Staff">Staff</a>.  Only a very (and we mean exceptionally) small number of senior <a href="#Staff">Staff</a> , in very (and, again, we mean exceptionally) limited and carefully prescribed situations, will be able to restore your personal data so that it can be viewed for those legitimate purposes.  Once we are clear that all relevant legally mandated retention periods have expired (which, for present purposes, we expect to be the period of ten years), we will go the additional final step of undertaking a "hard delete", whereby not even that very limited number of senior <a href="#Staff">Staff</a> would be able to restore your personal data.<br>
    &nbsp;</li>
    <li><em><strong><a name="GDPR"></a>General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)</strong></em> – a European Union statutory instrument which aims to harmonise European data protection laws. It has an effective date of 25 May 2018, and any references to it should be construed accordingly to include any national legislation implementing it. <br>
    &nbsp;</li>
    <li><em><strong><a name="MSP"></a>Managed Service Provider (MSP) programmes</strong></em> – <a href="#Clients">Clients</a>' outsourcing of the management of external staff (including freelance workers, independent contractors and temporary employees) to an external recruitment provider.  <br>
    &nbsp;</li>
    <li><em><strong><a name="Other-people"></a>Other people whom Hays may contact </strong></em>– these may include <a href="#Candidates">Candidates</a>' and Hays' <a href="#Staff">Staff</a> emergency contacts and referees. We will only contact them in appropriate circumstances.<br>
    &nbsp;</li>
    <li><em><strong><a name="RPO"></a>Recruitment Process Outsourcing (RPO) services</strong></em> – full or partial outsourcing of the recruitment process for permanent employees to a recruitment provider. <br>
    &nbsp;</li>
    <li><em><strong><a name="Staff"></a>Staff </strong></em>– includes current and former employees and interns engaged directly in the business of Hays (or who have accepted an offer to be engaged) as well as certain other workers who are or were engaged in the business of providing services to Hays (even though they are not classed as employees). For these purposes we also include employees of Hays who are engaged to work on <a href="#Clients">Clients</a>' premises under the terms of <a href="#RPO"> RPO</a> or <a href="#MSP">MSP</a> agreements. To be clear, 'Staff' does not include individuals hired by Hays for the purpose of being placed with <a href="#Clients">Clients</a> outside of an RPO/MSP arrangement. These individuals are treated in the same way as Hays' <a href="#Candidates">Candidates</a> and are covered by this Privacy Policy. Likewise, independent contractors and consultants performing services for Hays fall within the definition of a 'Supplier' for the purposes of this Privacy Policy.<br>
    &nbsp;</li>
    <li><em><strong><a name="Suppliers"></a>Suppliers</strong></em> – refers to partnerships and companies (including sole traders), and atypical workers such as independent contractors and freelance workers, who provide services to Hays. In certain circumstances Hays will sub-contract the services it provides to <a href="#Clients">Clients</a> to third party suppliers who perform services on Hays' behalf. In this context, suppliers that are individual contractors, freelance workers, or employees of suppliers will be treated as <a href="#Candidates">Candidates</a> for data protection purposes. Please note that in this context, Hays requires Suppliers to communicate the relevant parts of this Privacy Policy (namely the sections directed at <a href="#Candidates">Candidates</a>) to their employees.<br>
    &nbsp;</li>
    <li><em><strong><a name="Systems"></a>Systems</strong></em> – include telephone, computer, internet and Wi-Fi systems, software and portals, accounts and/or networks belonging, controlled or used by Hays that are used to transmit, undertake and/or receive communications or are otherwise used in the course of Hays' business, including candidate portal software and CRM systems.<br>
    &nbsp;</li>
    <li><em><strong><a name="Website-users"></a>Website Users </strong></em>- any individual who accesses any of the Hays websites.<br>
    &nbsp;</li>
