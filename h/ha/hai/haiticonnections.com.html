Haiticonnections.com’s Privacy Policy<br>
THIS POLICY WAS LAST UPDATED ON January 23, 2013<br>
Haiticonnections.com Privacy Policy:<br><br>

Haiticonnections.com, owned and operated by F and D Connect DBA Haiticonnections.com ("we" or " 

Haiticonnections.com ") have adopted this privacy policy to protect your personal information and to 

let you know how we might use it. This privacy policy only applies to activities you perform on 

Haiticonnections.com website, transactions for purchasing Haiticonnections.com’ s subscription 

services, and activities or communications that occur while using its service (collectively known as 

the "Service") and does not apply to any other Website or offline point of contact between 

Haiticonnections.com, or any other company, and consumers. This policy was implemented on January 

16, 2013 and may change from time-to-time, please periodically review this page. Each time you use 

the Service or provide us with information, by doing so you are accepting the practices described in 

this privacy policy at that time.


<b>Your IP Address:</b><br><br>

Like most e-commerce Websites, each time you use the Service, we automatically collect your IP 

address and the web page from which you came. In order to administer and optimize the Service for 

you and to diagnose problems, we use your IP address to help identify you and to gather broad 

demographic information about you.




<b>Cookies:</b><br><br>

Like most Websites, the Service uses cookies to keep track of your purchases and other activity on 

the website to enhance your experience. We also use cookies to deliver content specific to your 

interests, to save your password, and if you choose, to save other personal and financial 

information so you do not have to reenter it each time you use the Service. Third party advertisers 

on the Site may also place or read cookies on your browser. If you wish to disable these cookies, 

the "help" portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how. However, if you set your 

browser to disable cookies, you may not be able to access certain aspects of the Service.





<b>Information We Collect From You:</b><br><br>

In order to operate the Service and to provide you with information about products or services that 

may be of interest to you, we may collect "personal information" (i.e. information that could be 

used to contact you directly without using the service" demographic information" (i.e. information 

that you submit, or that we collect, that is neither personal information nor financial information; 

this may include, but is not limited to, zip code, postal code, hometown, gender, username, 

age/birth date, purchase history information, browsing history information, searching history 

information, registration history information, and the content of communications between you and 

other members over the Service), subject to the rest of this paragraph. Demographic information is 

divided into two categories: 1) "non-public information", which consists of purchase history 

information and one-on-one communications between you and other users of the Service; and 2)
 "public information", which consists of all other demographic information. We ask that you do not 

enter personal information or financial information into your "Profile" (for example, don't use your 

address or pass-code as your username, or include your name or address in your written responses), 

because if you do then it may be posted publicly on the Service, and the information will then be 

treated as "demographic information" that is "public information." Please note that nowhere on the 

Service do we knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 18, as we 

require that all users represent to us that they are at least 18 years old.




<b>Information Other Websites Collect From You:</b><br><br>

We may place links to other Websites operated by other parties. Some of these other Websites contain 

our brand names and trademarks and other intellectual property that we own; others do not. When you 

click on these links and visit these other Websites, regardless of whether or not they contain our 

brand names, trademarks and other intellectual property. You need to be aware that we do not control 

these other Websites or these other Websites' business practices, and that this privacy policy does 

not apply to these other Websites. Consequently, the operators of these other Websites may collect 

different kinds of information about you, and may use and disclose that information in different 

ways than we would if it were collected on the Service. We encourage you to review their privacy 

policies and remind you that we will not be responsible for their actions.


<b>How We Use Personal Information:</b><br><br>

care. Your email address and personal information is not shared with any third parties and is solely 

used to send email communication from Haiticonnectionsl.com. Your personal information will not be

activities on the Service (including, but not limited to, confirmation emails or important news that 

could affect your relationship with Haiticonnections.com, and to forward messages to you from other 

Haiticonnections.com ‘s users. These types of communications are known as "Operational

such as banner ads and special offers.We also use personal information to send you newsletters, 

information, offers and other promotional materials for Haiticonnections.com or third parties' goods 

or services. We attempt to send you offers that are of value to you, such as discounts, exclusive 

offers or special event information. The Service provides you with options to decline to receive 

communications from Haiticonnections.com (other than those contained in Operational Communications). 

Some of these options may only be for a certain category of communications; others may be more 

general. By posting a profile on the Service, you are opting in to receive messages from other 

Haiticonnections.com’s members by email or text message. To stop receiving messages from other 

Haiticonnections.com‘s members, change your account settings on Haiticonnections.com.



<br><br>

To operate the Service, including processing your transactions and supporting your activities on the 

Service, we may share your personal information with our agents, representatives, contractors and 

service providers so they can provide us with support services such as authorization of credit card 

transactions, email origination, receipt or support services, customer relationship management 

services, order fulfillment and sweepstakes and promotional fulfillment. We require these entities 

not to use your information for any other purpose.
By purchasing, or registering or making reservations for, products or services offered or sponsored 

by third parties on the Service, or electing to receive communications (such as emails or magazine 

subscriptions) or electing to participate in contests, sweepstakes or other programs (such as 

discount or rewards programs), offered or sponsored by third parties on the Service, you consent to 

our providing your personal information to those third parties. Those third parties may use your 

personal information in accordance with their own privacy policies. You will need to contact those 

third parties to instruct them directly regarding your preferences for the use of your personal 

information by them. Additionally, you agree that we may use and disclose all such information so 

submitted to such third parties in the same manner in which we are entitled to use and disclose any 

other information you submit to us.


<br><br>

In some cases, we may enter into a promotional relationship with another company in which we 

prominently display their brand name or trademarks on pages of the Service. These pages are known as 

"Co-Branded Pages" and these companies are known as "Co-Branded Companies." If the page on which you 

submit information is a Co-Branded Page, or was accessed by clicking on a link on a Co-Branded Page, 

then we may share your personal information with the associated Co-Branded Company. Co-Branded 

Companies may use your personal information in accordance with their own privacy policies. You will 

need to contact Co-Branded Companies to instruct them directly regarding your preferences for the 

use of your personal information by them. Additionally, you agree that we may use and disclose all 

such information so submitted to such Co-Branded Companies in the same manner in which we are 

entitled to use and disclose any other information you submit to us. Some Co-Branded
 Pages may contain an action tag (also known as a Web Beacon or a 1 pixel .gif file) that a third 

party, may use to read cookies that it, or its clients Haiticonnections.com, may have placed on your 

browser at other (non- Haiticonnections.com) web sites before your visit to Haiticonnections.com. 

This technology is used to measure the effectiveness of advertisements on such other Websites that 

promote Co-Branded Pages. Further, such other third parties may use the information collected 

through this technology to learn more about your visits to this Service and other Websites in order 

to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you.


<br><br>

Any third party with whom we are allowed to share your personal information is authorized to use 

your personal information in accordance with our contractual arrangements with such third parties 

and in accordance with their own privacy policies, over which we have no control, and you agree that 

we are not responsible or liable for any of their actions or omissions. Those who contact you will 

need to be instructed directly by you regarding your preferences for the use of your personal 

information by them.
Please read the information below under the heading "Special Cases in which we Share Personal and 

Financial Information" to learn more ways in which we may share your personal information.




<br><br>

How We Use Public Information and Other Demographic Information:

We may review all demographic information. We may use public information to enable other users to 

find your profile, to determine whether they are a match for you and to communicate with you. We may 

use demographic information to tailor the Service and communications to your interests. We may also 

share demographic information with advertisers on an anonymous and aggregated basis (i.e., without 

telling the advertisers your identity). One of the reasons we may do this is to increase the 

likelihood that our advertisers' goods and services will appeal to Haiticonnections.com users, so 

that we may target specific ads at specific demographic groups. Our sharing of demographic 

information with advertisers is anonymous (i.e., we do not tell advertisers which particular 

Haiticonnections.com users are members of which demographic groups), subject to the rest of this 

privacy policy. When you respond to an advertisement, however, we ask you to remember that if that
 ad that is targeted to a demographic group and you decide to give the advertiser your personal 

information, then the advertiser may be able to identify you as being a member of that demographic 

group. Please also be aware that when we disclose your financial information or personal information 

to a Co-Branded Company, as described above, we may also disclose to that Co-Branded Company your 

demographic information, other than the content of one-on-one communications between you and other 

members. Please also be aware that we may disclose your demographic information on a non-anonymous 

basis as described above in the paragraph titled "Special Cases in which we Share Personal and 

Financial Information." Also, to read further details about how we may use your public information, 

see our Terms of Use.



<br><br>


Changing our Privacy Policy for Previously Gathered Information:

If at any point we decide to use particular personally identifiable information in a manner 

different from that stated at the time it was collected, we will notify users by way of an email or 

by providing 30 days notice on the Service. Please note that we will continue to have the right to 

change our privacy policy and practices, and how we use your personally identifiable information, 

without notice, as described in the first paragraph of this Privacy Policy, provided that such 

changes shall only apply to information gathered on or after the date of the change.




<br><br>

How You Can Access and Update Your Email Preferences, Personal Information and Public Information:

We give you the opportunity to opt-out of certain communications and modify personal information or 

demographic information you have provided to us, and to hide demographic information from, or make 

demographic information visible to, the public users of the Service, at anytime by going to the 

"Account Settings" in your Haiticonnections.com profile of the Service. Please be aware that it may 

take several hours for the changes you make to take effect on the public areas of the Service. We 

thank you for your patience. Please note that changing or deleting your information in the "Account 

Settings" section of the Service, or otherwise opting-out of receipt of email communications from 

Haiticonnections.com, will only change or delete the data in our database for purposes of future 

activities on the Service and for managing future communications from Haiticonnections.com. These 

changes and deletions will not change or delete emails or information that we may
 have already forwarded to other users or credit card companies or any other third parties, all as 

provided above in this privacy policy.

your dealings with the Service, you can contact us at solutions@haiticonnections.com.<br> You can
