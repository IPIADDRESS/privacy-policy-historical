</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Disclosure Of Your Information</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We will not disclose your personally identifiable information to third parties without your consent, except as set forth below or provided elsewhere in this Privacy Policy:</span></p>
<ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Security</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The security of your information is very important to us. We attempt to provide for the secure storage of your information by using commercially reasonable safeguards. Unfortunately, due to the inherent nature of the Internet and online communications, we cannot ensure the security of any information you transmit to us or guarantee that information on the Website or our servers will be free from unauthorized access by third parties such as hackers. Your use of the Website demonstrates your assumption of this risk.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">All of our employees, workers and data processors (i.e. those who process your personal data on our behalf), who have access to, and are associated with, the processing of personally identifiable information, are obliged to respect the confidentiality of the personally identifiable information of all visitors to the Website and all users of our products and services.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Other Services, Websites and Applications</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Website may integrate third-party services and content and may contain links to third-party websites and applications. Functionality on the Website may also permit interactions between the Website and a third-party website or feature.

We are not responsible for the privacy practices or content of these third-party services, websites and applications, and we do not endorse or promote such third-party websites, applications and services. This Privacy Policy and our Terms of Use do not apply to any third-party service, website or application. Your browsing and interaction on any third-party service, website or application or service, including those that are integrated in the Website or have a link on the Website, are subject to that third party’s own rules and policies.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Social Media</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Website may contain links to our presence on various social media platforms. As we do not operate or control such platforms, this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Use do not apply to your use of such platforms. In addition, you should be aware that personally identifiable information which you voluntarily include and transmit online in a publicly accessible blog, social network or other social media platform may be viewed and used by others.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Protection for Children</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We do not knowingly collect or solicit any information from anyone under the age of 13. The Website and its content are not directed at children under the age of 13.

<p><b>Additional Information and Rights Applicable to Individuals Located in the EEA</b></p>
<p><b>Legal basis for processing</b></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Where your information is completely anonymized, we do not require a legal basis to use it as the information will no longer constitute personally identifiable information that is regulated under data protection laws.

		<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>How we obtain your consent</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Where our use of your personally identifiable information requires your consent, you can provide such consent either at the time we collect your personally identifiable information following the instructions provided or by informing us using our details in the “Contact” section below.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Duration of processing</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Regarding personally identifiable information we have processed in connection with the supply of our products and services to any person or organization, we will retain personally identifiable information relevant to that supply of products or services for six years from the date of supply and in compliance with our obligations under the GDPR (or similar legislation around the world). We may then destroy such files without further notice or liability.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Regarding any other personally identifiable information we have processed, we will retain relevant personally identifiable information for three years from the date of our last interaction with the relevant person or organization and in compliance with our obligations under the GDPR (or similar legislation around the world). We may then destroy such files without further notice or liability.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">If any personally identifiable information is only useful for a short period (e.g. for a specific marketing campaign), we may delete it at the end of that period.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Sharing Personally Identifiable Information</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">We will only share personally identifiable information with others when we are legally permitted to do so. When we share personally identifiable information with others, we put contractual arrangements and security mechanisms in place to protect the personally identifiable information and to comply with our data protection, confidentiality and security standards. When processing your personal information we may need to share it with third parties as follows:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong><em>Other organizations within our group of companies:</em></strong> We may share your personally identifiable information with other organizations within our group of companies where necessary for administrative purposes or where those organizations assist us in the provision of our products and services.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong><em>Third-party organizations that provide applications/functionality, data processing or IT services:</em></strong> We use third parties to support us in providing our products and services and to help provide, run and manage our internal IT systems. Such third parties may include, for example, providers of information technology, cloud based software as a service providers, identity management, website hosting and management, data analysis, data back-up, security and storage services. The servers powering and facilitating that cloud infrastructure are located in secure data centres around the world, and personally identifiable information may be stored in any one of them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong><em>Third-party email marketing and CRM specialists:</em></strong> We share personally identifiable information with specialist suppliers who assist us in managing our marketing database and sending out our email marketing communications to our subscribers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong><em>Third-party organizations that assist us with the administration of our promotions:</em></strong> We share personally identifiable information with specialist suppliers who assist us in administering our competitions, prize draws and other promotions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><em><strong>Auditors, lawyers, accountants and other professional advisers:</strong></em> We share personally identifiable information with professional services firms who advise and assist us in relation to the lawful and effective management of our organization and in relation to any disputes we become involved in.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong><em>Law enforcement or other government and regulatory agencies:</em></strong> We may share personally identifiable information with law enforcement or other government and regulatory agencies or other third parties as required by, and in accordance with, applicable law or regulation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Transfers of your Personally Identifiable Information Outside the EEA</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">We are a U.S. organization and many of our suppliers are U.S. organizations. Therefore when you submit personally identifiable information through our Sites, your personally identifiable information will be transferred to the United States of America where it will be stored and processed by us and, where applicable, our suppliers and other third parties referred to in this Privacy Policy for the purposes specified in this Privacy Policy. The laws of the United States of America may not offer the same standard of legal protection for your personally identifiable information that you enjoy in your own country. However, we will comply with our legal and regulatory obligations in relation to your personally identifiable information including having a lawful basis for transferring your personally identifiable information and putting appropriate safeguards in place to ensure an adequate level of protection for your personally identifiable information where it is transferred outside the EEA. Where we are transferring, storing or processing your personally identifiable information outside the EEA not strictly for the purpose of providing our services (e.g. to send you marketing), we shall only do so with your consent.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Your Rights</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">You have the following rights in relation to the personally identifiable information we hold about you:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><em><strong>Your right of access:</strong></em> If you ask us, we will confirm whether we are processing your personally identifiable information and, if so, provide you with a copy of that personally identifiable information (along with certain other details). If you require additional copies, we may charge a reasonable fee for producing those additional copies. You can contact us for this purpose using our details in the “Contact” section below.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><em><strong>Your right to rectification:</strong></em> If the personally identifiable information we hold about you is inaccurate or incomplete, you are entitled to have it rectified. If we have shared your personally identifiable information with others, we’ll let them know about the rectification where possible. If you ask us, where possible and lawful to do so, we will also tell you who we’ve shared your personally identifiable information with so that you can contact them directly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><em><strong>Your right to erasure:</strong></em> You can ask us to delete or remove your personally identifiable information in some circumstances, such as where we no longer need it or where you withdraw your consent (where applicable). If we have shared your personally identifiable information with others, we will let them know about the erasure where possible. If you ask us, where it is possible and lawful for us to do so, we will also tell you who we have shared your personally identifiable information with so that you can contact them directly.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;"><em><strong>Your right to restrict processing:</strong></em> You can ask us to block or suppress the processing of your personally identifiable information in certain circumstances, such as where you contest the accuracy of that personally identifiable information or you object to us processing it. It won’t stop us from storing your personally identifiable information, though. We will tell you before we lift any restriction. If we have shared your personally identifiable information with others, we will let them know about the restriction where it is possible for us to do so.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><em><strong>Your right to object:</strong></em> You can ask us to stop processing your personally identifiable information, and we will do so, if we are: (i) relying on our own or someone else’s legitimate interest to process your personally identifiable information, except if we can demonstrate compelling legal grounds for the processing; or (ii) processing your personally identifiable information for the purposes of direct marketing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><em><strong>Your rights in relation to automated decision-making and profiling:</strong></em> You have the right not to be subject to a decision when it is based on automatic processing, including profiling, if it produces a legal effect or similarly significantly affects you, unless such profiling is necessary for the entering into, or the performance of, a contract between you and us.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><em><strong>Your right to withdraw consent:</strong></em> If we rely on your consent (or explicit consent) as our legal basis for processing your personally identifiable information, you have the right to withdraw that consent at any time. You can exercise your right of withdrawal by contacting us using our details in the “Contact” section below or by using any other opt-out mechanism we may provide, such as an unsubscribe link in an email.</p>
