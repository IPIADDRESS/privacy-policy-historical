<font size="4"><b>Privacy Policy</b></font><br>
The following statement has been developed to demonstrate our commitment to your privacy. 
<br><br>
<b>Summary</b><br>
Pilot Online collects personal information to determine which products, features and special offers will 
benefit our users.  Pilot Online will send emails (to those who have elected to receive them) informing 
registered users of the offers and features that are of interest to them.   We will not sell or give any 
personally identifiable information to our advertisers.
<br><br>
<b>Overview</b><br>
Pilot Online collects personally identifiable information (name, e-mail address, etc.) and/or
demographic data (zip code, gender, interests, etc.) that you submit when you:

<ol>
<li> register for our services
</li><li> complete a survey
</li><li> register for a promotion, contest, or sweepstakes
</li><li> make a purchase from our online store
</li><li> send us an email. 
</li></ol>

We and/or our 3rd party partners may use this information to process and maintain your account,
compile demographic statistics about our users, and display to you information and advertisements
that match your interests and profile. 
<br><br>
Credit card information will be provided to third parties only to provide products and services that you 
order. We may use the contact information you provide to contact you about your account and/or to send 
you necessary information directly related to the product(s) or service(s) for which you have registered. 
With your permission, we may use your contact information to inform you of new features and special 
offers from Pilot Online. We will not provide your contact information to unaffiliated third parties without 
your express permission. As part of the registration process, you have the option to inform us that you do 
not wish to receive information about other special offers and promotions. 
<br><br>
<b>IP Addresses and Cookies</b><br>
Pilot Online uses IP addresses (random numbers assigned to individual computers) to help
diagnose problems with our servers, administer our web site, and anonymously track content
preferences and traffic patterns. We also use cookies (small text files transferred from our Web site
to your hard drive) to recognize repeat users, track usage behavior, and facilitate your access to and
use of our site. Cookies do not damage files or allow anyone to access your personally identifiable
information – they simply allow us to tailor information and advertisements to make your visits more
enjoyable and meaningful (and enable us to provide you with personalized information, if you
choose). They also provide information to us about site usage to help us improve and update our site.
We may share aggregate (not individual) site usage statistics and demographic information with
advertisers and other third parties, but this information will not include any personally identifiable
information. 
<br><br>
<b>Security and Links</b><br>
The security of the information you provide to Pilot Online is important to us. We use
encryption software and other security measures to protect the loss, misuse, and alteration of
sensitive information under our control. However, Pilot Online’s site includes links to other
sites, and when you choose to visit those sites, we are not responsible for their privacy policies or
how they treat user information. In addition, we may permit third parties to offer registration-based
services through our site. We are not responsible for the actions and policies of these third parties,
and you should review the privacy policies of these parties when supplying personally identifiable
information to them. 
<br><br>
<b>Additional Information</b><br>
Pilot Online reserves the right to alter our Privacy Policy as business needs require. Any
changes will be posted to our web site in a timely manner. This statement and the policies outlined
here are not intended to and do not give you any contractual or other legal rights.
