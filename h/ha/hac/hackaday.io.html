<h1><b>Hackaday Privacy Policy</b></h1>

<h2><b>Version 1.0</b></h2>

<h2>Last revised on: October 24, 2013</h2>

<p>We take the privacy and protection of personal information very seriously.  This Privacy Policy describes our practices
regarding the Personal Data (as defined below) we collect from users of the
Hackaday website at <a href="http://hackaday.com/" target="_blank">hackaday.com</a> (the “<b>Site</b>”),
the Hackaday forums at <a href="http://forums.hackaday.com/" target="_blank">forums.hackaday.com</a> (the “<b>Forum</b>”) and the services made available through the Site and Forum
(together with the Site and the Forum, the “<b>Services</b>”) provided by Supply Frame, Inc. (“<b>Supply Frame</b>”, “<b>us</b>”, “<b>our</b>”, and “<b>we</b>”).</p>

<p></p><h3>1. User Consent.</h3> By submitting Personal Data
through our Services, you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy and you
expressly consent to the collection, use and disclosure of your Personal Data
in accordance with this Privacy Policy.<p></p>

<p></p><h3>2. A Note About Children.</h3> We do not
intentionally gather Personal Data from visitors who are under the age of 13.<p></p>

<p></p><h3>3. A Note to Users Outside of the United States.</h3>Your Personal Data may be processed in the country in which it was
collected and in other countries, including the United States, where laws
regarding processing of Personal Data may be less stringent than the laws in
your country.<p></p>

<p></p><h3>4. Types of Data We Collect.</h3> <b>“Personal Data”</b>
means data that allows someone to identify or contact you, including, for
example, your name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, as well as any
other non-public information about you that is associated with or linked to any
of the foregoing data.  <b>“Anonymous Data”</b> means data that is not
associated with or linked to your Personal Data; Anonymous Data does not, by
itself, permit the identification of individual persons.  We collect Personal Data and Anonymous Data,
as described below.<p></p>

<p></p><h4>(a) Information You Provide to Us.</h4><p></p>

<ul style="clear:both;margin-left:2em">
<li>When you create an account (“<b>Account</b>”) to register for the Forum, we
will collect your username, e-mail address and password.  We may also collect optional information that
you provide us to customize your Account, for example, your language
preference, location, time zone, birthdates, occupation, interests, instant
messenger ID and website.</li>

<li>When you post a comment on the Site, we will collect
your username and e-mail address and, if you provide it, your website.</li>

<li>When you post comments or messages to the Site
or Forum, the information contained in your posting will be stored on our
servers and other users will be able to see it.</li>

<li>We retain information on your behalf, such as your
postings to the Site or Forum and files and messages that you store using your
Account.</li>

<li>If you provide us feedback or contact us via
e-mail, we will collect your name and e-mail address, as well as any other
content included in the e-mail, in order to send you a reply.</li>

<li>When you participate in one of our surveys, we
may collect additional profile information.</li>

<li>We also collect other types of Personal Data
that you provide to us voluntarily, such as your operating system and version,
product registration number, and other requested information if you contact us
via e-mail regarding support for the Services.</li>

<li>We may also collect Personal Data, such as at
other points in our Services that state that Personal Data is being collected.</li>
</ul>

<p></p><h4>(b) Information Collected via Technology.</h4><p></p>
  <ul style="clear:both;margin-left:2em">
    <li><u>Information Collected by Our Servers</u>.  To make our Services more useful to you, our
    servers (which may be hosted by a third party service provider) collect
    information from you, including your browser
    type, operating system, Internet Protocol (IP) address (a number that is
    automatically assigned to your computer when you use the Internet, which may
    vary from session to session), domain name, referring/exit pages, clickstream
    data (including the ads you see and click on), and/or a date/time stamp for
    your visit. We use this information to analyze trends, administer the Services,
    track users’ movements around the Site and Forum, gather demographic
    information about our user base as a whole, and better tailor our Services to
    our users’ needs.  For example, some of
    the information may be collected so that when you visit the Site or Forum again,
    it will recognize you and the information could then be used
    by us to serve advertisements and other information appropriate to your
    interests.  Except as noted in
    this Privacy Policy, we do not link this automatically-collected data to Personal Data.</li>

    <li><u>Cookies.</u> We store small text files called “<b>Cookies</b>" on your computer to make your
    experience on our website better. We use both session Cookies (which expire
    once you close your web browser) and persistent Cookies (which stay on your
    computer until you delete them). In order to provide the Services, we use a
    variety of Cookies that perform different functions. While you will still be able to use
    the Supply Frame Offerings if you disable Cookies in your browser, certain
    parts of the Supply Frame Offerings may not function as effectively. You can
    find more information on Cookies and how they may affect you by visiting: <a href="http://www.youronlinechoices.com" target="_blank">www.youronlinechoices.com</a>. We
    use the following types of cookies:

      <ul>
        <li><i>Strictly Necessary Cookies</i>. Strictly necessary cookies are cookies which are essential to enable you
        to move around the website and use its features, such as accessing secure areas
        of the website. Without these cookies, services you have asked for cannot be
        provided.</li>

        <li><i>Performance Cookies</i>. Performance cookies
        collect anonymized information about how you use our website. For example,
        these cookies may tell us which pages you go to most
        often and if you receive error messages from our webpages. We use this
        information to improve how our sites work. By using our web site, you agree we
        can place these cookies on your device.</li>

        <li><i>Functionality Cookies</i>. Functionality Cookies
        allow our website to remember the choices you make, such as your login information
        (if any), preferred language or region you are in, and can provide enhanced,
        more personal features. These cookies can also be used to remember changes you
        made to text size, fonts and other parts of web pages you can customize. They
        may also be used to provide services you have asked for such as watching a
        video or commenting on a blog. The information these cookies collect may be
        anonymized and they cannot track your browsing activity on other websites. By
        using our web site, you agree we can place these cookies on your device.</li>

        <li><i>Advertising Cookies</i>.  These cookies collect information to deliver
        you more relevant advertising. They may be placed by us,
        by third parties acting on our behalf, or by advertising networks with our
        permission. They remember other websites you have visited, and advertising
        networks may share this information with others including advertisers. By using
        our web site, you agree we can place these cookies on your device.</li>
      </ul>

    </li><li><u>Tracking Pixels</u>.  In addition, we use “<b>Tracking Pixels</b>,” which are small transparent graphic image
    (usually only 1 pixel) that we place on our Site that is used to collect
    information about the pages you view and when you view them.</li>

    <li><u>Google Analytics</u>.  We
    use Google Analytics to help analyze how users use the Site.  Google Analytics uses Cookies to collect
    information such as how often users visit the Site, what pages they visit, and
    what other sites they used prior to coming to the Site. We use the information
    we get from Google Analytics only to improve our Site and Services.  Google Analytics collects only the IP address
    assigned to you on the date you visit the Site, rather than your name or other
    personally identifying information.  Google’s ability to use and share information collected by Google
    Analytics about your visits to the Site is restricted by the Google Analytics
    Terms of Use and the Google Privacy Policy.</li>
  </ul>
