  <meta property="og:description" content="This is the privacy policy of Hacking Chinese, operated and managed by Lingedu AB. In this document, &quot;we&quot;, &quot;our&quot;, or &quot;us&quot; refer to Lingedu AB.

We are company number 559158-1615 registered in Sweden.

Our registered office is at Sjöfartsgatan 11, 12062 Stockholm, Sweden.

Please also read our Terms and Conditions.
Introduction

 	This is a notice to inform you of our policy about all information that we record about you. It sets out the conditions under which we may process any information that we collect from you, or that you provide to us. It covers information that could identify you (“personal information”) and information that could not. In the context of the law and this policy, “process” means collect, store, transfer, use or otherwise act on information.
 	We regret that if there are one or more points below with which you are not happy, your only recourse is to leave our website immediately.
 	We take seriously the protection of your privacy and confidentiality. We understand that all visitors to our website are entitled to know that their personal data will not be used for any purpose unintended by them, and will not accidentally fall into the hands of a third party.
 	We undertake to preserve the confidentiality of all information you provide to us, and hope that you reciprocate.
 	Our policy complies with Swedish law accordingly implemented, including that required by the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).
 	The law requires us to tell you about your rights and our obligations to you in regards to the processing and control of your personal data. We do this now, by requesting that you read the information provided at www.knowyourprivacyrights.org.
 	Except as set out below, we do not share, or sell, or disclose to a third party, any information collected through our website.

The bases on which we process information about you
The law requires us to determine under which of six defined bases we process different categories of your personal information, and to notify you of the basis for each category.

If a basis on which we process your personal information is no longer relevant then we shall immediately stop processing your data.

If the basis changes then if required by law we shall notify you of the change and of any new basis under which we have determined that we can continue to process your information.
1. Information we process because we have a contractual obligation with you
When you buy a product or service from us, or otherwise agree to our terms and conditions, a contract is formed between you and us.&nbsp;In order to carry out our obligations under that contract we must process the information you give us. Some of this information may be personal information.

We may use it in order to:

 	

 	verify your identity for security purposes
 	sell products to you
 	provide you with our services
 	provide you with suggestions and advice on products, services and how to obtain the most from using our website



We process this information on the basis there is a contract between us, or that you have requested we use the information before we enter into a legal contract.

Additionally, we may aggregate this information in a general way and use it to provide class information, for example to monitor our performance with respect to a particular service we provide. If we use it for this purpose, you as an individual will not be personally identifiable.

We shall continue to process this information until the contract between us ends or is terminated by either party under the terms of the contract.
2. Information we process with your consent
Through certain actions when otherwise there is no contractual relationship between us, such as when you browse our website, sign up for our newsletter or ask us to provide you with more information about our business, you provide your consent to us to process information that may be personal information.

Wherever possible, we aim to obtain your explicit consent to process this information, for example, by asking you to agree to our use of cookies. When you visited our website the first time, you were prompted to agree to our use of cookies. These include:

Sometimes you might give your consent implicitly, such as when you send us a message by e-mail to which you would reasonably expect us to reply.

Except where you have consented to our use of your information for a specific purpose, we do not use your information in any way that would identify you personally. We may aggregate it in a general way and use it to provide class information, for example to monitor the performance of a particular page on our website.

We continue to process your information on this basis until you withdraw your consent or it can be reasonably assumed that your consent no longer exists.

You may withdraw your consent at any time by instructing us at editor@hackingchinese.com.
3. Information we process for the purposes of legitimate interests
We may process information on the basis there is a legitimate interest, either to you or to us, of doing so.

Where we process your information on this basis, we do after having given careful consideration to:

 	

 	whether the same objective could be achieved through other means
 	whether processing (or not processing) might cause you harm
 	whether you would expect us to process your data, and whether you would, in the round, consider it reasonable to do so



For example, we may process your data on this basis for the purposes of:

 	

 	record-keeping for the proper and necessary administration of our business
 	responding to unsolicited communication from you to which we believe you would expect a response
 	protecting and asserting the legal rights of any party
 	protecting your interests where we believe we have a duty to do so



4. Information we process because we have a legal obligation
We are subject to the law like everyone else. Sometimes, we must process your information in order to comply with a statutory obligation.

For example, we may be required to give information to legal authorities if they so request or if they have the proper authorisation such as a search warrant or court order.

This may include your personal information.
Specific uses of information you provide to us
5. Information provided on the understanding that it will be shared with a third party
Our website allows you to post information with a view to that information being read, copied, downloaded, or used by other people.

Examples include:

 	

 	posting a comment to an article, resource or challenge
 	submitting a learning resource or challenge update



In posting personal information, it is up to you to satisfy yourself about the privacy level of every person who might use it.

We do not specifically use this information except to allow it to be displayed or shared.

We do store it, and we reserve a right to use it in the future in any way we decide.

Once your information enters the public domain, we have no control over what any individual third party may do with it. We accept no responsibility for their actions at any time.

Provided your request is reasonable and there is no legal basis for us to retain it, then at our discretion we may agree to your request to delete personal information that you have posted. You can make a request by contacting us at editor@hackingchinese.com.
6. Complaints regarding content on our website
Our website is a publishing medium. Anyone may register or&nbsp; publish information about himself, herself or some other person.

We attempt to moderate user generated content, but we are not always able to do so as soon as that content is published.

If you complain about any of the content on our website, we shall investigate your complaint.

If we feel it is justified or if we believe the law requires us to do so, we shall remove the content while we investigate.

Free speech is a fundamental right, so we have to make a judgment as to whose right will be obstructed: yours, or that of the person who posted the content that offends you.

If we think your complaint is vexatious or without any basis, we shall not correspond with you about it.
7. Information relating to your method of payment
Payment information is never taken by us or transferred to us either through our website or otherwise. Our employees and contractors never have access to it.

We use external payment service providers, through whose platforms the users and we can make payment transactions. The e-commerce platform we use is E-junkie. You can find out more about their services in relation to data protection here and here. E-junkie does not process the transactions themselves. This is done through PayPal.

In order to fulfil contracts, as well as on the basis of legitimate interest,&nbsp;we use PayPal in order to offer our users effective and secure payment options. Amongst the data processed by the payment service providers are inventory data, e.g. the name and the address, bank data, such as account numbers or credit card numbers, passwords, TANs and check sums, as well as contract, summary and recipient-related information.&nbsp;This information is required to complete the transactions.

However, the data entered will only be processed and stored by the payment service providers; we do not receive any account or credit card information, but only information with confirmation or negative disclosure of the payment, along with basic information about customer country, which is required by law for the proper application of value added tax within the EU.

The data may be transmitted by the payment service providers to credit reporting agencies. This transmission aims at identity and credit checks. For this we refer to the terms and privacy policy of payment service providers. For the payment transactions, the terms and conditions and the privacy notices of the respective payment service providers, which are available within the respective websites, or transaction applications apply. We also refer to these for further information and assertion of rights of withdrawal, information and other data subjects.
8. Contacting us via the contact form or e-mail
When you contact us, whether through our website or by e-mail, we collect the data you have given to us in order to reply with the information you need.

We record your request and our reply in order to increase the efficiency of our business.

We keep personally identifiable information associated with your message, such as your name and email address so as to be able to track our communications with you to provide a high quality service.
9. Complaining
When we receive a complaint, we record all the information you have given to us.

We use that information to resolve your complaint.

If your complaint reasonably requires us to contact some other person, we may decide to give to that other person some of the information contained in your complaint. We do this as infrequently as possible, but it is a matter for our sole discretion as to whether we do give information, and if we do, what that information is.

We may also compile statistics showing information obtained from this source to assess the level of service we provide, but not in a way that could identify you or any other person.
10. Affiliate and business partner information
This is information given to us by you in your capacity as an affiliate of us or as a business partner.

It allows us to recognise visitors that you have referred to us, and to credit to you commission due for such referrals. It also includes information that allows us to transfer commission to you.

The information is not used for any other purpose.

We undertake to preserve the confidentiality of the information and of the terms of our relationship.

We expect any affiliate or partner to agree to reciprocate this policy.
Use of information we collect through automated systems when you visit our website

Only in exceptional cases will the full IP address be sent to a Google server in the US and shortened there. The IP address submitted by the user's browser will not be merged with other data provided by Google.

Introduction

 	This is a notice to inform you of our policy about all information that we record about you. It sets out the conditions under which we may process any information that we collect from you, or that you provide to us. It covers information that could identify you (“personal information”) and information that could not. In the context of the law and this policy, “process” means collect, store, transfer, use or otherwise act on information.
 	We regret that if there are one or more points below with which you are not happy, your only recourse is to leave our website immediately.
 	We take seriously the protection of your privacy and confidentiality. We understand that all visitors to our website are entitled to know that their personal data will not be used for any purpose unintended by them, and will not accidentally fall into the hands of a third party.
 	We undertake to preserve the confidentiality of all information you provide to us, and hope that you reciprocate.
 	Our policy complies with Swedish law accordingly implemented, including that required by the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).
 	The law requires us to tell you about your rights and our obligations to you in regards to the processing and control of your personal data. We do this now, by requesting that you read the information provided at www.knowyourprivacyrights.org.
 	Except as set out below, we do not share, or sell, or disclose to a third party, any information collected through our website.

The bases on which we process information about you
The law requires us to determine under which of six defined bases we process different categories of your personal information, and to notify you of the basis for each category.

If a basis on which we process your personal information is no longer relevant then we shall immediately stop processing your data.

If the basis changes then if required by law we shall notify you of the change and of any new basis under which we have determined that we can continue to process your information.
1. Information we process because we have a contractual obligation with you
When you buy a product or service from us, or otherwise agree to our terms and conditions, a contract is formed between you and us.&nbsp;In order to carry out our obligations under that contract we must process the information you give us. Some of this information may be personal information.

We may use it in order to:

 	

 	verify your identity for security purposes
 	sell products to you
 	provide you with our services
 	provide you with suggestions and advice on products, services and how to obtain the most from using our website



We process this information on the basis there is a contract between us, or that you have requested we use the information before we enter into a legal contract.

Additionally, we may aggregate this information in a general way and use it to provide class information, for example to monitor our performance with respect to a particular service we provide. If we use it for this purpose, you as an individual will not be personally identifiable.

We shall continue to process this information until the contract between us ends or is terminated by either party under the terms of the contract.
2. Information we process with your consent
Through certain actions when otherwise there is no contractual relationship between us, such as when you browse our website, sign up for our newsletter or ask us to provide you with more information about our business, you provide your consent to us to process information that may be personal information.

Wherever possible, we aim to obtain your explicit consent to process this information, for example, by asking you to agree to our use of cookies. When you visited our website the first time, you were prompted to agree to our use of cookies. These include:

Sometimes you might give your consent implicitly, such as when you send us a message by e-mail to which you would reasonably expect us to reply.

Except where you have consented to our use of your information for a specific purpose, we do not use your information in any way that would identify you personally. We may aggregate it in a general way and use it to provide class information, for example to monitor the performance of a particular page on our website.

We continue to process your information on this basis until you withdraw your consent or it can be reasonably assumed that your consent no longer exists.

You may withdraw your consent at any time by instructing us at editor@hackingchinese.com.
3. Information we process for the purposes of legitimate interests
We may process information on the basis there is a legitimate interest, either to you or to us, of doing so.

Where we process your information on this basis, we do after having given careful consideration to:

 	

 	whether the same objective could be achieved through other means
 	whether processing (or not processing) might cause you harm
 	whether you would expect us to process your data, and whether you would, in the round, consider it reasonable to do so



For example, we may process your data on this basis for the purposes of:

 	

 	record-keeping for the proper and necessary administration of our business
 	responding to unsolicited communication from you to which we believe you would expect a response
 	protecting and asserting the legal rights of any party
 	protecting your interests where we believe we have a duty to do so



4. Information we process because we have a legal obligation
We are subject to the law like everyone else. Sometimes, we must process your information in order to comply with a statutory obligation.

For example, we may be required to give information to legal authorities if they so request or if they have the proper authorisation such as a search warrant or court order.

This may include your personal information.
Specific uses of information you provide to us
5. Information provided on the understanding that it will be shared with a third party
Our website allows you to post information with a view to that information being read, copied, downloaded, or used by other people.

Examples include:

 	

 	posting a comment to an article, resource or challenge
 	submitting a learning resource or challenge update



In posting personal information, it is up to you to satisfy yourself about the privacy level of every person who might use it.

We do not specifically use this information except to allow it to be displayed or shared.

We do store it, and we reserve a right to use it in the future in any way we decide.

Once your information enters the public domain, we have no control over what any individual third party may do with it. We accept no responsibility for their actions at any time.

Provided your request is reasonable and there is no legal basis for us to retain it, then at our discretion we may agree to your request to delete personal information that you have posted. You can make a request by contacting us at editor@hackingchinese.com.
6. Complaints regarding content on our website
Our website is a publishing medium. Anyone may register or&nbsp; publish information about himself, herself or some other person.

We attempt to moderate user generated content, but we are not always able to do so as soon as that content is published.

If you complain about any of the content on our website, we shall investigate your complaint.

If we feel it is justified or if we believe the law requires us to do so, we shall remove the content while we investigate.

Free speech is a fundamental right, so we have to make a judgment as to whose right will be obstructed: yours, or that of the person who posted the content that offends you.

If we think your complaint is vexatious or without any basis, we shall not correspond with you about it.
7. Information relating to your method of payment
Payment information is never taken by us or transferred to us either through our website or otherwise. Our employees and contractors never have access to it.

We use external payment service providers, through whose platforms the users and we can make payment transactions. The e-commerce platform we use is E-junkie. You can find out more about their services in relation to data protection here and here. E-junkie does not process the transactions themselves. This is done through PayPal.

In order to fulfil contracts, as well as on the basis of legitimate interest,&nbsp;we use PayPal in order to offer our users effective and secure payment options. Amongst the data processed by the payment service providers are inventory data, e.g. the name and the address, bank data, such as account numbers or credit card numbers, passwords, TANs and check sums, as well as contract, summary and recipient-related information.&nbsp;This information is required to complete the transactions.

However, the data entered will only be processed and stored by the payment service providers; we do not receive any account or credit card information, but only information with confirmation or negative disclosure of the payment, along with basic information about customer country, which is required by law for the proper application of value added tax within the EU.

The data may be transmitted by the payment service providers to credit reporting agencies. This transmission aims at identity and credit checks. For this we refer to the terms and privacy policy of payment service providers. For the payment transactions, the terms and conditions and the privacy notices of the respective payment service providers, which are available within the respective websites, or transaction applications apply. We also refer to these for further information and assertion of rights of withdrawal, information and other data subjects.
8. Contacting us via the contact form or e-mail
When you contact us, whether through our website or by e-mail, we collect the data you have given to us in order to reply with the information you need.

We record your request and our reply in order to increase the efficiency of our business.

We keep personally identifiable information associated with your message, such as your name and email address so as to be able to track our communications with you to provide a high quality service.
9. Complaining
When we receive a complaint, we record all the information you have given to us.

We use that information to resolve your complaint.

If your complaint reasonably requires us to contact some other person, we may decide to give to that other person some of the information contained in your complaint. We do this as infrequently as possible, but it is a matter for our sole discretion as to whether we do give information, and if we do, what that information is.

We may also compile statistics showing information obtained from this source to assess the level of service we provide, but not in a way that could identify you or any other person.
10. Affiliate and business partner information
This is information given to us by you in your capacity as an affiliate of us or as a business partner.

It allows us to recognise visitors that you have referred to us, and to credit to you commission due for such referrals. It also includes information that allows us to transfer commission to you.

The information is not used for any other purpose.

We undertake to preserve the confidentiality of the information and of the terms of our relationship.

We expect any affiliate or partner to agree to reciprocate this policy.

<p>Once your information enters the public domain, we have no control over what any individual third party may do with it. We accept no responsibility for their actions at any time.</p>
<p>Provided your request is reasonable and there is no legal basis for us to retain it, then at our discretion we may agree to your request to delete personal information that you have posted. You can make a request by contacting us at editor@hackingchinese.com.</p>
<h3>6. Complaints regarding content on our website</h3>
<p>Our website is a publishing medium. Anyone may register or&nbsp; publish information about himself, herself or some other person.</p>
<p>We attempt to moderate user generated content, but we are not always able to do so as soon as that content is published.</p>
<p>If you complain about any of the content on our website, we shall investigate your complaint.</p>
<p>If we feel it is justified or if we believe the law requires us to do so, we shall remove the content while we investigate.</p>
<p>Free speech is a fundamental right, so we have to make a judgment as to whose right will be obstructed: yours, or that of the person who posted the content that offends you.</p>
<p>If we think your complaint is vexatious or without any basis, we shall not correspond with you about it.</p>
<h3>7. Information relating to your method of payment</h3>
<p>Payment information is never taken by us or transferred to us either through our website or otherwise. Our employees and contractors never have access to it.</p>
<p>We use external payment service providers, through whose platforms the users and we can make payment transactions. The e-commerce platform we use is <a href="https://www.e-junkie.com">E-junkie</a>. You can find out more about their services in relation to data protection <a href="https://www.e-junkie.com/wiki/legal1">here</a> and <a href="https://www.e-junkie.com/wiki/legal2">here</a>. E-junkie does not process the transactions themselves. This is done through PayPal.</p>
<p>In order to fulfil contracts, as well as on the basis of legitimate interest,&nbsp;we use PayPal in order to offer our users effective and secure payment options. Amongst the data processed by the payment service providers are inventory data, e.g. the name and the address, bank data, such as account numbers or credit card numbers, passwords, TANs and check sums, as well as contract, summary and recipient-related information.&nbsp;This information is required to complete the transactions.</p>
<p>However, the data entered will only be processed and stored by the payment service providers; we do not receive any account or credit card information, but only information with confirmation or negative disclosure of the payment, along with basic information about customer country, which is required by law for the proper application of value added tax within the EU.</p>
<p>The data may be transmitted by the payment service providers to credit reporting agencies. This transmission aims at identity and credit checks. For this we refer to <a href="https://www.paypal.com/webapps/mpp/ua/privacy-full">the terms and privacy policy of payment service providers</a>. For the payment transactions, the terms and conditions and the privacy notices of the respective payment service providers, which are available within the respective websites, or transaction applications apply. We also refer to these for further information and assertion of rights of withdrawal, information and other data subjects.</p>
<h3>8. Contacting us via the contact form or e-mail</h3>
<p>When you contact us, whether through our website or by e-mail, we collect the data you have given to us in order to reply with the information you need.</p>
<p>We record your request and our reply in order to increase the efficiency of our business.</p>
<p>We keep personally identifiable information associated with your message, such as your name and email address so as to be able to track our communications with you to provide a high quality service.</p>
<h3>9. Complaining</h3>
<p>When we receive a complaint, we record all the information you have given to us.</p>
<p>We use that information to resolve your complaint.</p>
<p>If your complaint reasonably requires us to contact some other person, we may decide to give to that other person some of the information contained in your complaint. We do this as infrequently as possible, but it is a matter for our sole discretion as to whether we do give information, and if we do, what that information is.</p>
<p>We may also compile statistics showing information obtained from this source to assess the level of service we provide, but not in a way that could identify you or any other person.</p>
<h3>10. Affiliate and business partner information</h3>
<p>This is information given to us by you in your capacity as an affiliate of us or as a business partner.</p>
<p>It allows us to recognise visitors that you have referred to us, and to credit to you commission due for such referrals. It also includes information that allows us to transfer commission to you.</p>
<p>The information is not used for any other purpose.</p>
<p>We undertake to preserve the confidentiality of the information and of the terms of our relationship.</p>
<p>We expect any affiliate or partner to agree to reciprocate this policy.</p>
