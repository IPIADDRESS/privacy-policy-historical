            Haggle Privacy Policy</h2>

            Effective March 23, 2010</p>
        <h3>
            What This Privacy Policy Covers</h3>
        <div class="aboutBlock">
            <ul>
                <li>This policy covers how Haggle LLC ("Haggle," "we" or "us") treats personal information
                    that Haggle collects and receives from you in connection with your use of its web
                    site at
                    <a href="/">www.haggle.com</a>
                    (the "Site"), your use or access of the Haggle auction service that may be accessed
                    through other Web sites (the "Auction"), and the download, installation, access
                    to and use of all or any part of the Haggle Toolbar software and any third party
                    software or any portion thereof provided in conjunction with the Haggle Toolbar
                    (collectively the "<span class="strong emphasis">Software</span>").</li>
                <li>As used in the policy, "personal information" means information that specifically
                    identifies an individual (such as a name, address, telephone number, e-mail address,
                    or other account number), and information about an individual or that individual's
                    location or activities, such as information about his or her use of the Site or
                    the Auction, when such information is directly linked to personally identifiable
                    information. Personal information does not include "aggregate" information, which
                    is data we collect about the use of the Site or the Auction or about a group or
                    category of products, services or users, from which individual identities or other
                    personal information has been removed. This policy in no way restricts or limits
                    our collection and use of aggregate information.</li>
                <li>This policy does not apply to the practices of companies that Haggle does not own
                    or control, or to people that Haggle does not employ or manage. Our Site may contain
                    links to other Web sites. Any personal information you provide on the linked pages
                    is provided directly to that third party and is subject to that third party's privacy
                    policy. We are not responsible for the content or privacy and security practices
                    and policies of web sites to which we link. We encourage you to learn about their
                    privacy and security practices and policies before providing them with any personal
                    information.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <h3>
            Information Collection</h3>
        <div class="aboutBlock">
            Personal information may be collected in a number of ways when you visit our Site
            or participate in the Auction. We may collect certain information that you voluntarily
            provide to us which may contain personal information. For example:
            <ul>
                <li>Haggle may collect personal information when you register with Haggle, when you
                    make a bid, or when you purchase bids or items. Haggle may combine information about
                    you that we have with information we obtain from business partners or other companies.</li>
                <li>When you register or make a purchase, we collect information such as your name and
                    email address, and you are not anonymous to us.</li>
                <li>Haggle’s third party payment processing provider collects credit card and other
                    personal information when you make purchases.</li>
                <li>Haggle may also collect demographic information and information about your transactions
                    with us and with some of our business partners.</li>
                <li>From time to time we may collect demographic, contact or other personal information
                    you provide in connection with your participation in surveys, sweepstakes, contests,
                    games, promotional offers, and other activities on the Site.</li>
                <li>If you participate Haggle-sponsored pages or events on third-party websites (such
                    as a social networking site), we may collect personal information you submit in
                    connection with such participation.</li>
            </ul>
            When you use the Site or participate in an Auction, some information is also automatically
            collected. For example:
            <ul>
                <li>Haggle may automatically receive and record information on our server logs from
                    your browser, including your IP address, your operating system, the browser type,
                    the address of a referring Web site, and your activity on the Site.</li>
                <li>We may automatically collect certain information through the use of "cookies" or
                    clear gifs. Cookies are small data files that are stored on a user's hard drive
                    at the request of a Web site to enable the Site to recognize users who have previously
                    visited them and retain certain information such as customer preferences and history.
                    Clear gifs (also known as web bugs or web beacons) are small, invisible graphic
                    images that may be used on the Site or in emails relating to the Site to collect
                    certain information and monitor user activity on the Site. If we combine cookies
                    with or link them to any of the personally identifying information, we would treat
                    this information as personal information.</li>
                <li>We may also use third parties to serve ads on the Site. These third parties may
                    place cookies, clear gifs or other devices on your computer to collect nonpersonal
                    information, and information provided by these devices may be used, among other
                    things, to deliver advertising targeted to your interests and to better understand
                    the usage and visitation of our Site and the other sites tracked by these third
                    parties. This policy does not apply to, and we are not responsible for, cookies
                    in third party ads. If you wish to block, erase, or be warned of cookies, please
                    refer to your browser instructions or help screen to learn about these functions.
                    However, if a browser is set not to accept cookies or if a user rejects a cookie,
                    some portions of the Site and services may not function properly. For example, you
                    may not be able to sign in and may not be able to access certain Site features or
                    services.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <h3>
            Use of Personal Information by Haggle</h3>
        <div class="aboutBlock">
            Haggle uses personal information it collects for the specific purpose for which
            the information was provided and for the following general purposes: 
            <ul>
                <li>to customize the content you see (which may include advertising), to process or
                    fulfill your requests for products and services or other transactions, to improve
                    our services, to administer of facilitate the operations of the Site or the Auction,

                <li>to respond to your emails, submissions, comments, requests or complaints and to
                    request feedback and enable us to develop, customize and improve the Site and the
                    Auctions;</li>
                <li>to provide you with information about our or a third party's events, offers, promotions,
                    products or services we think will be of interest to you and for other marketing,
                    informational, product development and promotional purposes;</li>
            </ul>
            Personal information provided online may be linked together or merged with other
            personal information so that we may better understand your needs and inform you
            about our products or services and those of our partners. In addition, if we receive
            information from third parties with whom we have business relationships, we may
            combine this information with the other personal information we maintain about you.
            In either case, this Policy governs this information.

            Information Sharing and Disclosure</h3>
        <div class="aboutBlock">
            <ul>
                <li>Haggle does not rent, sell, or share personal information about you we collect on
                    the Site, through the Software, or in connection with Auction with third parties
                    or non affiliated companies except to provide products or services you've requested,
                    when we have your permission to do so, or under the following circumstances:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>We may disclose personal information in the good faith belief that we are lawfully
                        authorized or required to do so, or that doing so is reasonably necessary or appropriate
                        to comply with the law or with legal process or authorities, or to exercise our
                        legal rights or respond to any claims.</li>
                    <li>We believe it is reasonably necessary or appropriate to share personal information
                        in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected
                        fraud, violations of Haggle's terms of use, or to otherwise protect the rights,
                        property or safety of Haggle, our users, our employees or the public, including
                        without limitation to protect Haggle or our users from fraudulent, abusive, inappropriate
                        or unlawful use of the Site or the Auctions.</li>
                    <li>We may disclose or transfer personal information about you during negotiations or
                        completion of any merger, sale of company assets, financing or acquisition or in
                        any other situation where personal information may be transferred as one of the
                        business assets of Haggle.</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Haggle may display targeted advertisements and targeted content or links, which
                    may be based on personal information. Advertisers (including ad serving companies)
                    and other third parties may assume that people who interact with, view, or click
                    on targeted ads, links or content meet the targeting criteria - for example, women
                    ages 18-24 from a particular geographic area. </li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Haggle does not provide any personal information to the advertiser or other third
                        party when you interact with or view a targeted ad. However, by interacting with
                        or viewing an ad, link or content, you are consenting to the possibility that the
                        advertiser will make the assumption that you meet the targeting criteria used to
                        display the ad.</li>
                    <li>Haggle advertisers include financial service providers (such as banks, insurance
                        agents, stock brokers and mortgage lenders) and non-financial companies (such as
                        stores, airlines, and software companies).</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Haggle works with vendors, partners, advertisers, and other service providers in
                    different industries and categories of business. In some cases, you may be linked
                    from the Site to certain third party Web sites in connection with performing certain
                    tasks or entering into certain transactions. Any information you provide while on

                <li>You understand that when you use the Site or the Auction, actions you take in connection
                    with the Auction or information you post in any interactive areas of the Site or
