                remain anonymous, but on some pages, you may need to provide Personal
                Information to register, order products or services, contact us
                with questions or feedback, enter sweepstakes or online contests,
                or conduct other online transactions. Examples of the type of
                Personal Information that you may be asked to provide on the Site
                include: name, company, occupation, account number, mailing address,
                email address, phone number, fax number, credit/debit card/procurement
                card information, username, and passwords. We may request additional
                information to respond to a specific request from you or to complete
                a transaction that you request. For example, if you elect to order
                service or set up an account online, you may be asked to provide
                additional information (such as your Social Security number (SSN)
                and date of birth) that will allow us to research your credit
                and establish your account. We also enable you to submit personally
                identifiable information about other people. For example, if you
                elect to purchase a family wireless plan, you may be asked to
                provide the names, addresses and other information for family
                members who will participate in the plan. </span></p>

                <span class="text9pt"><br>
                The Web site may “passively” collect certain kinds
                of information during your visit, including but not limited to:</span></p>
              <p><span class="text10ptBold">Cookies</span><br><span class="text9pt"> “Cookies” are small text files sent from a website
                to the hard drive of a user’s computer to store bits of
                information related to that user. Cookies can store a variety
                of information, including IP addresses, navigational data, server
                information, data transfer times, user preferences, and passwords
                needed to access the special areas on the Site. For example, we
                use cookies to identify who you are after you log in or register
                and to keep track of any purchases that you have made. We also
                use cookies to create a more personalized experience on the Site.
                For example, cookies can help us let you know what’s new
                on the Site since your last visit. You usually can configure your
                Internet browser to reject cookies. However, if you do so, you
                might not be able to access certain pages or use some functions

                Other Passive Web Site Tracking. The Site also uses Internet Protocol
                (IP) addresses and log files to identify server problems, to improve
                site content, and compile aggregated statistics about usage of
                the Site. We also use Web beacons to help personalize your experience,
                similar to how we use cookies. Companies that help us place
                advertisements on our site use Web beacons to serve cookies and
                advertisements. We also use Web beacons to gather general, non-personally
                identifiable statistics on the number of users who visit the Site
                and the areas that they visit. </span></p>

                reserve the right to introduce new passive tracking technologies
                and techniques related to the use of the Site. In general, we
                do not link your identity with information that we collect passively.
                However, in any situation where you log in with your username
                and password, any or all of the information that is passively
                collected about your activities on the Site may be linked with
                your identity, and therefore may become Personal Information about
                you.</p>

                for billing purposes, to answer your service questions, to provide

                or to create and inform you of products or services that you may
                find interesting. The following paragraphs provide some examples

                in the future, please contact us at 808-643-3456. </p></li>

                  and providing you with customer service. Although our contracts
                  with our Suppliers generally require them to keep your Personal
                  Information confidential and only use your Personal Information
                  to the extent necessary to perform their functions, we cannot
                  promise that they will comply with these commitments or be responsible

                  services that may be of interest to you. If you do not want us

                  the future, please contact us at 808-643-3456 and we will take
                  reasonable measures to avoid such sharing in the future. Please
                  note that these third parties are independent from Hawaiian Telcom;
                  therefore, you should contact them directly if you have any issues

                travels from your computer to ours. Your browser should indicate
                when it is on an SSL protected page, and you should check for
                this indication if you are relying on SSL security to protect
