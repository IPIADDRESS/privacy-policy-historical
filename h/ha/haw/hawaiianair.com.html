            <p><b>Your Hawaiian Airlines PIN (Personal Identification Number):</b> 
              <br>
              Your Hawaiian Airlines Membership number is unique to your account 
              and used to identify you and your transactions for record purposes. 
              In addition, you have a personal PIN number that serves as your 
              personal password to your account and is designed to protect your 
              account from unauthorized use. Hawaiian Airlines will not be responsible 
              for any lost, stolen, or otherwise disclosed PIN numbers. Additionally, 
              Hawaiian Airlines will not replace or reinstate any flight credits 
              or HawaiianMiles, partner miles, or program awards that are generated 
              or redeemed by unauthorized PIN use. Accordingly, your PIN number 
              should be guarded and not provided to anyone. </p>
            <p><b>Billing Information for Ticketless Travel (E-Tickets) Online:</b>

              number, and travel details of the reservation) will not be shared 
              with anyone outside of Hawaiian Airlines nor to any third party, 
              except as described below. Payment information (credit card numbers 
              and expiration dates) is also treated confidentially and will not 
              be shared with anyone outside of the financial institutions used 
              to process payments. </p>
            <p><b>Hawaiian Airlines and HawaiianMiles Special Offers:</b> <br>
              Hawaiian Airlines may use the name and address information or the 
              e-mail address you provide to send you special offers that we feel 
              may be interesting and useful for you. In some instances, we may 
              provide Customer lists to our Preferred Partners so you can receive 
              special offers or ways to earn HawaiianMiles awards more quickly. 
              Hawaiian Airlines requires our Preferred Partners to ensure safeguards 
              are always in place to protect the privacy of any information we 
              share. We try to be careful in our selection of these Partners to 
              ensure your privacy and the value of their offers. If you wish to 
              be excluded from any such special offers, or have your e-mail address 
              unsubscribed from any electronic offers please contact us toll-free 
              at 877-HA-MILES (426-4537). </p>
            <p>You should be aware that we require the same safeguards for the 
              information received over the Internet as we do for customer information 
              received by telephone and mail. Only Hawaiian Airlines or our approved 
              Preferred Partners will send you special offers. </p>
