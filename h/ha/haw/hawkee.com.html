					<h1>About Us</h1>
					Hawkee strives to facilitate technical collaboration on social software development. We
					focus on building a community around various application platforms, scripting languages
					and desktop systems.  Users can browse thousands of code snippets, comments, reviews
					and discussions to dig deep into a technical situation and come up with the best solution.

					<br><br>

					<h1>History of Hawkee</h1>
					Hawkee.com has been a scripting resource as far back as 1997.  At that time Hawkee.com began to
					review and host mIRC scripts.  We gained a reputation for our critical and thorough reviews and
					soon developed a scripting community.
					Hawkee focused entirely on mIRC scripts until 2004 when PHP snippets were introduced.  TCL and Ruby
					snippets were added in 2005 and various other development platforms have been added since.

					<br><br>

					Later in 2005 we introduced our price comparison engine which featured a variety of online
					computer and electronics merchants.  It included social features like product tagging, comments
					and product reviews.  Since the start of 2007 we started aggregating product
					reviews from around the internet and have amassed quite a collection.

					<br><br>

					In December of 2006 we launched our social network system where users could befriend one
					another, upload images and share comments with one another.  Our unique comment system allowed
					users to see site-wide updates on all categories of comments that we offered.

					<br><br>

					In May, 2008 we introduced a brand new design featuring an updated logo and layout. Newer
					features included Latest Topics on the Latest Comments page, code snippet thumbnails and
					a review search.
