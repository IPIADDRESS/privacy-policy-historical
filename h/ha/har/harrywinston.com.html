            <h3>Harry Winston Privacy Policy: Your Privacy Rights</h3>

            <p>
                Harry Winston knows that your privacy is important to you, and we want you to know that it is important to us too.  We created this Privacy Policy to explain the types of information we collect through our Web sites (on which it is linked to in the footer) and the various social networking platforms that we use (each, a “Site”), as well as in our retail salons.  This Privacy Policy describes how we will use, disclose and protect this information once it is collected, and how you can opt-out of some of our uses of your information.
            </p>

            <h3>Here are a few general principles to keep in mind as you read through this Policy:</h3>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    The Site and our retail salons are owned and operated by Harry Winston Diamond Corporation
                    and its corporate affiliates (referred to collectively in this policy as “we,” “us,” “our” and other
                    similar pronouns).
                </li>

                <li>
                       California’s Shine the Light" law, Civil Code section 1798.83, requires certain businesses to
                       respond to requests from California customers asking about the businesses' practices related to 
                       disclosing personal information to third parties for the third parties' direct marketing purposes. Alternatively, businesses may have in place a policy not to disclose personal information of customers to third parties for the third parties' direct marketing purposes unless the customer has opted-in to such information sharing.  Accordingly, we will not share your personal information with third parties other than our affiliates for the third party’s own marketing purposes unless you opt-in, for example by checking a consent check box when providing us with your information.  We will, however, share your personal information with our affiliates for marketing purposes.  To request a list of the affiliates with whom we have shared your personal information for marketing purposes in the last year, write to us at Harry Winston, 718 Fifth Avenue, New York, NY 10019 and include the words “California Shine The Light Request” in the “Regarding” line.
                </li>

                <li>
                    As our business evolves, this Policy may change, so check back to this page periodically to make
                    sure you understand how your personal information will be treated.
                </li>

                <li>
                    This Policy is incorporated into, and part of, our <a href="/terms" style="color:#000; text-decoration:underline;">Terms of Use</a>, which govern your use of our
                    Sites as a whole.
                </li>

                <li>
                    If you are located outside of the United States, you should know that the information you provide to us is being transmitted to us and processed in the United States and will be protected subject to this privacy policy and United States laws, which may not be as protective as the laws in your country.  Also, this Site places cookies and local shared objects on your computer or device which are further described below.
                </li>
            </ul>

                settings, the referring page that linked you to the Site, the pages, content or ads you see or click on
                during your visit and when and for how long you do so, items you download, the next Web site you visit
                when you leave the Site, and any search terms you have entered on the Site or a referral site.
            </p>

            <h3>Social Networking</h3>

            <p>
                We maintain presence on several social networking and blogging platforms, and we also incorporate
                some third party social networking features onto our Site. Through these platforms and features, we
                receive some Personal Information and some Site Usage Information about you, and this Privacy Policy
                applies to that information as well. In addition, third party social networking platforms and blogging
                platforms have their own privacy policies which explain how the third parties that provide them will use
                and protect your information. In accordance with those policies (and your privacy settings within your
                social networking accounts) information about your activities on our Site (such as “Mary Jane “likes” our
                Diamond Tassel necklace”) may be published to your social network.

            <h3>Do we share Personal Information and Site Usage Information with others?</h3>

            <p>
                Yes. We may share the information we collect on the Site and in our salons with others for a variety of
                reasons. In addition to the kinds of information sharing you might expect, such as sharing with third
                parties who need your information in order to provide services to us (or on our behalf and subject to
                confidentiality commitments) and sharing what you voluntarily post to public areas on the Site with
                other Site users, we may share your information:
            </p>

                    making purchases, investigate or prevent fraud or illegal activity, respond to a government, law
                    enforcement, judicial or other legal request, or to comply with the law.

                    business

            </ul>

            <p>
                In addition, we may share non-personally identifiable Site Usage Information (including aggregate data)
                with others, for their own use, in a form that does not include your name or contact information.
            </p>

            <h3>Text Message Service</h3>

            <p>
                We may seek to send messages to you on your wireless device via short message service (“Text
                Messaging”). If you sign up for Text Messaging, you agree to receive text messages from Harry Winston
                at the address you provide for such purposes unless and until you elect not to receive such messages
                by texting STOP to the applicable short code. You may opt out of Text Messaging at any time by texting
                STOP to the applicable short code, but your wireless carrier’s standard rates will apply to any messages
                you receive. Your opt-out will be effective once we send you a text confirmation of your opt-out.
                You represent that you are the owner or authorized user of the device you use to sign up for Text
                Messaging, and that you are authorized to approve the applicable charges. You must be 18 years of age
                or older and reside in the United States to use our Text Messaging. You must first register and provide
                all required Personal Information, which may include, for example, your name, text address, wireless
                carrier, and billing information (if fees are applicable to the Text Messaging), which may be either your
                credit card information or mobile service carrier information. We may also obtain the date, time and
                content of your messages in the course of your use of Text Messaging. We will use the information we
                obtain in connection with our Text Messaging in accordance with this Privacy Policy. If fees are charged
                to your wireless account invoice, we may provide information to your carrier about them. Your wireless
                carrier and other service providers may also collect data about your wireless device usage, and their
                practices are governed by their own policies. We may also access the content of your account and/or
                wireless account with your carrier for the purpose of identifying and resolving technical problems and/
                or service-related complaints.

            <h3>Your Access Rights</h3>

            <p>
                You may review, update or modify certain of the Personal Information that is stored in your user
                account on the Site (if you have one) by logging in to the “My Account” or similar area of the Site or by
                contacting us using the “Contact US” information below. We may ask you to verify your identity and to
                provide other details before we are able to provide you with any information, correct any inaccuracies,
                or delete any information. Your right to delete your information is subject to our records retention
                policies.
            </p>

            <h3>Security</h3>

            <p>
                While we endeavor to protect the security and integrity of sensitive Personal Information collected
                via this Site, due to the inherent nature of the Internet as an open global communications vehicle, we
                cannot guarantee that any information, during transmission through the Internet or while stored on our
                system or otherwise in our care, will be absolutely safe from intrusion by others, such as hackers.

                If you correspond with us by e-mail, text message, or using Web forms like a “contact us” feature on
                our Site, you should be aware that your transmission might not be secure. A third party could view
                the information you send in transit by such means. We will have no liability for disclosure of your
                information due to errors or unauthorized acts of third parties during or after transmission.

                If you create an account on our Site, you are responsible for maintaining the strict confidentiality of
                your account password, and you shall be responsible for any activity that occurs using your account
                credentials, whether or not you authorized such activity. Please notify us of any unauthorized use of
                your password or account or any other breach of security.

                If we believe that the security of your Personal Information in our care may have been compromised,
                we may seek to notify you of that development. If a notification is appropriate, we will endeavor
                to notify you as promptly as possible under the circumstances. If we have your e-mail address, we
                may notify you by e-mail. You consent to our use of e-mail as a means of such notification. If
                you prefer for us to use the U.S. Postal Service to notify you in this situation, please e-mail us at <a href="mailto:clientservices@harrywinston.com" style="color:#000; text-decoration:underline;">clientservices@harrywinston.com.</a>

            <h3>“Linked-To” Web Sites</h3>

            <p>
                The Site may contain links, banners, widgets or advertisements that lead to other Web sites. We are
                not responsible for these other sites, and so their posted privacy policies (not this Policy) will govern the
                collection and use of your information on them. We encourage you to read the privacy statements of
                each Web site visited after leaving the Site to learn about how your information is treated by others.
            </p>

            <h3>Changes to this Privacy Policy</h3>

            <p>
               We may change this Policy from time to time. When we do, we will let you know by posting the
                changed Policy on this page with a new “Last Updated” date. In some cases (for example, if we
                significantly expand our use or sharing of your Personal Information), we may also tell you about
                changes by additional means, such as by sending an e-mail to the e-mail address we have on file for you.
                In some cases, we may request your consent to the changes.
