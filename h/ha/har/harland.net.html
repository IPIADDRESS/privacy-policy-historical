    <td><p><strong>About this Privacy Notice</strong></p>
      <p>This Privacy Notice explains how we collect, use and protect information
        about you, our valued customer.&nbsp; </p>
      <p>“We” or “us” means the companies and businesses
        that belong to the John H. Harland Company corporate family and includes,
        for example, John H. Harland Company; The Check Store, Inc.;<strong> </strong>Scantron

      <p>We may change this Privacy Notice at any time so that it accurately
        states how we collect, use and protect information about you.&nbsp; </p>
      <p><strong>Information we collect about you </strong></p>
      <p>In order to better serve your needs and provide you with better customer
        service, we collect nonpublic personal information about you in many
        different ways.&nbsp; For example, we collect:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Information you give to us when you contact us or communicate with
          us in any way.&nbsp; For example, when you order or reorder products
          or services from us, when you fill out our forms or applications, or
          when you otherwise contact us to order or to learn more about our products
          and services.&nbsp; Such information may include, for example, your
          name, address, telephone number and e-mail address. </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>Information that we obtain from your transactions and dealings with
          us.&nbsp; For example, your account, order and payment history.</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>Information that we obtain from third parties about your transactions
          and dealings with these third parties.&nbsp; For example, your account,
          order and payment history with these third parties.</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>Also, we may collect Information about you that we obtain from consumer
          reporting agencies, such as your credit worthiness and credit history.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Information we disclose about you</strong></p>
      <p>We consolidate and share all of the information we collect, as described
        above, including information about former customers, with the companies
        and businesses that belong to the John H. Harland Company corporate family.</p>
      <p>We may disclose all of the information we collect, as described above,
        to </p>
      <ul>
        <li>persons or companies that perform business services and operations
          for us (such as check printing) or function on our behalf, or </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>persons or companies that perform marketing services on our behalf
          or to other financial institutions with whom we have joint marketing
          arrangements.&nbsp; </li>

        information we collect about you, whether you are our current or former
        customer, to anyone, except as permitted or required by law (such as
        to protect against fraud or in response to a subpoena).&nbsp; <strong></strong></p>
      <p><strong>How we protect information about you</strong></p>
      <p>We restrict access to nonpublic personal information about you to those
        employees who we believe need to know that information to provide products
        or services to you.&nbsp; </p>
      <p>Whenever we hire persons or companies outside of our corporate family
        to provide business or marketing support services to us, we will only
        provide them with such nonpublic personal information about you that
        we believe is necessary to fulfill their responsibilities or to provide
        a service to you.</p>
      <p>We maintain&nbsp; physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards that
        comply with federal regulations to guard you nonpublic personal information.</p>
