		<h3 id="info-we-collect">INFORMATION WE COLLECT</h3>
		<p>
			We collect information about you in a few different ways, including when you provide it to us directly through the Services and from your interaction with our Services.  Certain third parties may also collect information about you, either directly or from your interaction with our Services.
		</p>
		<p class="bold">Information You Provide to Us. </p>
		<p>
			We collect information that you voluntary give to us.  When you create an account to browse and purchase products in the shop, you provide us information like your name, address, email address, telephone number, credit card and billing information.  We may also collect content you choose to post to our Services, like comments, product reviews and ratings, and videos and photos.  For example, you may upload a photo to the shop in order to customize merchandize you would like to purchase.  We also collect information that you voluntarily give to us about other people.  For example, you might submit a person's name and email address to share content or product recommendations through our “tell-a-friend” feature, or if you order a gift and want it sent directly to the recipient, you might submit the recipient's name, address, and telephone number.  By submitting information to us about other people, you confirm that you have obtained permission from each of those people to share their information.
		</p>
		<p class="bold">Information We Collect from Your Interaction with the Service.</p>
		<p>
			We also collect certain information when you use our Services such as the type of browser you are using (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Internet Explorer, Safari) and the version of your browser, the type of operating system you are using (e.g., Windows, Mac OS, iOS, Android), the domain name of your Internet service provider or mobile carrier, IP address, mobile device IP address (e.g., MAC address), unique device identifier, your precise location information, and certain usage information.
		</p>
		<p class="bold">Information Provided or Collected Through Social Media.</p>
		<p>
			You can also engage with our Services through third party social media plug-ins and applications, such as those offered by Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest and others.  You may also choose to link your account with us to third party social media sites, for example, through Facebook Connect.  When you link your account or engage with such plug-ins or applications, you may allow us to have ongoing access to certain information from your social media account (e.g., name, e-mail address, profile photo, gender, birthday, location, your list of friends and their contact information, people you follow and/or who follow you, the posts or the 'likes' you make).
		</p>
		<p>
			When you provide information to us from your social media account, it can help enable us to do things like personalize your online experience with us, and enable us to contact you through the social media sites or directly with the latest news, special offerings, and rewards. By providing such information, you consent to the use of the information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
		</p>
		<p>
			If you post information or content, such as by posting photos, commenting or reviewing products, or when you interact with our Services through social media plug-ins or other applications, depending on your privacy settings, this information may become public on the Internet. Therefore, we cannot prevent further use of this information. You can control what data you share through privacy settings available on some social media sites. For more information about how you can customize your privacy settings and how third party social media sites handle your personal information, please refer to their privacy help guides, privacy policies and terms of use.
		</p>
		<p class="bold">Information From Other Sources.</p>
		<p>
			We may, on occasion, combine information we receive online with outside records and use such information in accordance with this Privacy Policy, such as to enhance our ability to market to you products or services that may be of interest to you and to personalize your experience.
		</p>
		<p class="bold" id="cookies_and_other">Cookies and Other Technical Information.</p>
		<p>
			Our Services use “cookies” and other similar technology such as “Web beacons.” Cookies are text files containing small amounts of information which are downloaded to your device when you visit a site. Cookies are then sent back to the originating site on each subsequent visit, or to another site that recognizes that cookie.   Cookies do a lot of different jobs, like remembering your preferences, and generally improve the user experience.  You can find more information about cookies at <a href="http://www.allaboutcookies.org/" target="_blank">All About Cookies</a>.  Web beacons are electronic images that often work in conjunction with cookies.
		</p>
		<p>
			Our Services use cookies for the following purposes:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>To identify you when you return to one of our shops or sign-in to your account. This allows us to provide you with product recommendations and display personalized content.  For example, if we notice that you are a fan of action and adventure movies, you will be less likely to see products related to comedies on future visits. And if you purchase a phone case from us or browse pages of phone cases in one of our shops, you will be more likely to see phone cases in the emails you receive from us and on our web sites when you return.</li>
			<li>To keep track of items stored in your shopping cart.</li>
			<li>To keep track of your specified preferences.</li>
			<li>To track your orders and process your transactions.</li>
			<li>To deliver content, including advertisements, relevant to your interests. Our interest-based ads are subject to your preferences as further described <a href="#" target="_blank">here</a>.</li>
			<li>To conduct research and diagnostics to improve our content, products and Services.  Google Analytics is one provider we use for site analytics.  You can find out more about Google Analytics cookies <a href="#" target="_blank">here</a>.</li>
			<li>To share information you choose on social media platforms by using social media sharing buttons or “like” buttons, or linking your social media account.</li>
			<li>To prevent fraudulent activity.</li>
			<li>To improve security.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			Cookies allow you to take advantage of some of our shop’s essential features. For instance, if you block or otherwise reject some of our cookies, you will not be able to add items to your shopping cart.  For information on how to opt-out of certain cookies, please review the section below entitled <a href="#cookies">Your Choices:  Cookies.</a>
		</p>
		<p>
			<span>By accepting this Privacy Policy, you specifically agree to our use of cookies and Web beacons as described herein.</span>
		</p>
		<p>
			We do not currently alter our practices when we receive Do Not Track signals because there is no consensus among industry participants as to what "Do Not Track" means in this context. To find out more about "Do Not Track," you may wish to visit <a href="http://allaboutdnt.com/" target="_blank">All About Do Not Track</a>.

			Many web browsers are set to accept cookies by default. If you prefer, you can usually choose to set your browser to remove cookies and to reject cookies from our servers.
