          <p class="textoprincipal"><strong>Harren Media Respects Your Privacy<br>
          </strong><br>
            Harren  Media, subsidiary  company of Freemount LTD holding, its affiliates  and subsidiaries (collectively referred  to as: "Harren Media", “we”, “our” or “us”) respect and value your  privacy. As such, this Privacy Policy details Harren Media’s treatment of  personally identifiable information (“PII”) that it collects when you provide  PII directly to Harren Media through this website, e-mail or other electronic  communication. This Privacy Policy also applies to consumers that have agreed  to receive e-mail marketing material from Harren Media’s partner websites,  third party partner websites, or otherwise (known as "List Management Arrangements").<br>
  <br>
            Harren Media reserves the right to modify this Privacy Policy from time to  time. Changes to our Privacy Policy will be posted on this website and the  effective date of the policy will be modified to reflect the effective date of  the most recent version. If a material change to our PII information practices  occurs in the future, we will only use PII collected from the time of the  policy change forward for these new purposes unless we have your consent.<br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <strong>Types of Information We Collect or Maintain  About Consumers</strong> <br>
  <strong>Personally Identifiable Information</strong><br>
            PII is information that allows Harren Media  to identify and communicate with an individual consumer. Through the use of  this website and through the election to receive e-mail on third-party sites in  List Management Arrangements with Harren Media, Harren Media may collect or  maintain the following PII about consumers:&nbsp;<br>
  <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•First and Last Name<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•Physical Address<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•Email Address<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•Phone Number<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•Fax Number<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•Any other PII the user  submits during the course of normal correspondence with Harren Media,&nbsp; or its third-party companies<br>
  <br>
  <strong>Non-Personally Identifiable Information</strong><br>
            Non-personally identifiable information is  information collected by Harren Media in the normal course of operating its  business that does not reveal the specific identity of the consumer. This data  records an individual’s activity either on the Harren Media website or within a  Harren Media -initiated e-mail. Types of non-personally identifiable  information collected include:&nbsp;<br>
  <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•IP Address<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•Consumer click-stream  data<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•Consumer data<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•Aggregate click-stream  data provided to Harren Media by third-party companies<br>
  <br>
  <strong>Children's Privacy</strong> <br>
            Harren Media places the highest value on the privacy of  children. Harren Media does not knowingly accept PII from children under the  age of 13.&nbsp; If you are under the age of  18, you may not use this website or receive e-mail marketing materials without  the involvement of a parent or guardian.&nbsp; <br>
  <br>
  <strong>How We Use Consumer PII</strong> <br>
  <strong>Consumer PII collected on this site.</strong><br>
            Harren Media will use consumer PII  collected on this site to contact the consumer in response to  consumer-initiated inquiries, to provide services requested by the consumer, to  alert consumers to changes in services or features, and to provide consumers  with requested information regarding Harren Media or our services. Harren Media  may share this PII with service providers who assist us with our marketing  efforts, but those service providers will not use this PII for their own  marketing purposes and are prohibited by contract from sharing this PII with  any party other than Harren Media. These businesses may include, but are not  limited to: providers of direct marketing services and applications, including  lookup and reference, data enhancement, suppression and validation services.<br>
  <br>
            Harren Media may use data-enhancement  providers to augment data provided to us by consumers on this site.  Data-enhancement providers will not use the data for any purpose other than to  provide the enhancement information to Harren Media, and are prohibited by  contract from sharing that PII with any party other than Harren Media. Harren  Media may, in order to provide the highest level of service, use data collected  through another Harren Media property to enhance the data we collect on this  site.<br>
  <br>
            Harren Media may also share PII in the  following limited circumstances: (1) upon receipt of a properly authorized and  authenticated governmental request for information; (2) in response to a  subpoena or a court order, (3) to comply with relevant laws; (4) in response to  an investigation of fraud regarding a specific consumer, or (5) in an effort to  safeguard the person or property of a Harren Media employee or a third party.<br>
  <br>
            Finally, Harren Media may, in the future, decide to sell, merge or otherwise  reorganize its business. Harren Media reserves the right to transfer and  disclose PII in this circumstance, but data collected by Harren Media will be  governed by the same privacy policy that existed prior to any change in  business conditions unless you consent to the new privacy policy.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>Consumer information managed by Harren  Media pursuant to a List Management Arrangement.</strong> <br>
            Harren Media is in the business of managing email-recipient  lists for clients. As such, Harren Media receives PII from marketing partners  and uses that PII to send relevant marketing content to those recipients. Harren  Media’s use of PII collected by third-party marketing partners is limited to  the uses allowed under the third-party's privacy policy previously agreed to by  the consumer. Harren Media will utilize service providers who assist us with  our marketing efforts, but those service providers will not use any PII  collected by third-party marketing partners and managed by Harren Media for  their own marketing purposes and are prohibited by contract from sharing that  PII with any party other than Harren Media. These businesses may include, but  are not limited to: providers of direct marketing services and applications,  including lookup and reference, data enhancement, suppression and validation  services.<br>
  <br>
            Harren Media may, in order to provide the  highest level of service, use data collected through another Harren Media  property to enhance the data we manage for third parties.<br>
            Harren Media will share PII collected by third-party  marketing partners and managed by Harren Media in the following limited  circumstances: (1) upon receipt of a properly authorized and authenticated  governmental request for information; (2) in response to a subpoena or a court  order, (3) to comply with relevant laws; (4) in response to an investigation of  fraud regarding a specific consumer, (4) if Harren Media is sold or acquired,  or (5) in an effort to safeguard the person or property of a Harren Media  employee or a third party.<br>
  <br>
            Harren Media may, in the future, decide to  sell, merge or otherwise reorganize its business. Harren Media reserves the  right to transfer and disclose PII in this circumstance, but data collected by Harren  Media will be governed by the same privacy policy that existed prior to any  change in business conditions unless you consent to the new privacy policy.<br>

            For PII collected from consumers inside the European Union, Harren Media will  not manage that consumer data unless that consumer first requested, pursuant to  clear and conspicuous notice, to receive such types of marketing  communications. Moreover, the EU recipient must be given clear and conspicuous  notice that the data is going to be shared with third parties for marketing  purposes, and that notice must be given prior to receipt of the recipient's  permission.<br>
            <strong> </strong><br>
            <strong>Choice</strong> <br>
            Harren Media manages e-mail lists through its List Management Arrangements.  Consumers may wish to remove themselves from specific Harren Media marketing  lists. As such, users may remove themselves from a specific mailing list by  utilizing the list-unsubscribe option that is present and available at the end  of each e-mail that Harren Media sends.<br>
  <br>
            Moreover, consumers may elect not to receive advertisements from a specific  advertiser at any time. In every e-mail communication we send, there is also an  unsubscribe hyperlink that allows the recipient to unsubscribe from receiving  commercial emails from that specific advertiser by clicking the hyperlink  provided and following the instructions provided. We process all unsubscribe  requests in a prompt fashion.<br>
  <br>
            Unsubscribe requests are either processed on an advertiser-specific basis or on  a list-specific basis, depending on the selection the consumer makes.  Unsubscribing from one list managed by Harren Media will not remove the  consumer from all Harren Media marketing lists. Similarly, unsubscribing from  one advertiser will not prevent the consumer from receiving all advertisers'  emails.<br>

            Additionally, every email we send as a result of a list management relationship  contains a bit of code known as a “web beacon.” This code allows us to  understand the time and date of when a user has opened an email and when he/she  has utilized a link within the email to visit a Web site. Our web beacons do  not collect PII. Users wishing to disable our web beacons should do so by  turning images “off” in their email client (e.g., Outlook, Outlook Express).
