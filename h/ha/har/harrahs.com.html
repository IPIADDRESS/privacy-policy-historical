Personal information is information about an identifiable individual, as more particularly described under applicable privacy legislation. This statement applies to our collection, use and disclosure of personal information. This Privacy Policy does not apply to information about employees of Caesars Windsor.

Any successor or replacement loyalty program adopted by Caesars Windsor (which is also referred to as a "Loyalty Program" in this Privacy Policy) may either be owned and operated by Caesars Windsor or Caesars Windsor may elect to join or participate in a loyalty program owned and operated by an affiliate of WCL or any of its shareholders (including any loyalty program operated by Harrah's Entertainment or any of its affiliates (www.harrahs.com) such as Harrah's Total Rewards loyalty program) ("Affiliated Loyalty Programs"). Affiliated Loyalty Programs may be located outside of Canada. The use and disclosure of personal information by Affiliated Loyalty Programs located in other countries (including the United States) will be subject to the laws of that country, which may differ from the laws of Canada and may include, for example, 1 January 2007 lawful requirements to disclose personal information to government authorities in those countries. At some places in this Privacy Policy we may, for clarity, specifically refer to Affiliated Loyalty Programs even though they are included by definition in the meaning of Loyalty Programs.<br>

<b>A.  PERSONAL INFORMATION - WHAT IS COLLECTED &amp; HOW</b><br>
<ol>
<li>	Identification ("ID") Verification. Casinos are required to verify the photo ID at the Casino entrances of all individuals who appear to be under 30, to ensure that no one under the legal gambling age of 19 is permitted entry. No information is recorded when ID is verified at the doors.
Casinos are also required, under regulations to the Gaming Control Act and/or the Proceeds of Crime Act, to verify government-issued photo ID and to record certain information, including name, date of birth, address, type of ID, and ID reference number, before conducting certain types of transactions. These transactions include foreign exchange transactions of $3,000 or more, cash transactions of $10,000 or more (see Large Cash Transaction Records), credit extensions of any amount, and opening a front money account in any amount.<br>
<br>
Caesars Windsor also requires government-issued photo ID before issuing a loyalty card for its Loyalty Programs such as the Players Prestige Card to protect customers who may lose or misplace their cards.<br>
<br>
</li><li>	Identification Verifiers. Security Officers posted at the entrance of the casino use identification verifiers to scan any ID they believe may have been tampered with or altered. The identification verifiers display the date of birth and recognize ID which has been falsified. Caesars Windsor does not keep a permanent record of any information displayed, as a result of scanning information through an identification verifier.<br>
<br>
</li><li>	Photography. To protect your privacy, photography is prohibited on the gaming floor. The only exceptions to this prohibition are photographs of jackpot and tournament winners, who consent in writing to their picture being taken. Except for your spouse or significant other, no other customers will be included in the photographs. With the permission of the AGCO, Caesars Windsor may also take photographs inside the casino for publicity purposes and advertising campaigns. In these cases, only actors are used in the photographs, and signage is posted to advise customers of the photo shoot.<br>
<br>
</li><li>	Video Surveillance. In order to comply with the Gaming Control Act Regulations, Caesars Windsor is required to have surveillance systems to monitor all gaming and sensitive areas of the casino. Video surveillance cameras are used to protect Caesars Windsor, its customers and employees against potential violations of criminal and/or civil laws. Surveillance camera output is monitored by Caesars Windsor Surveillance personnel, authorized Caesars Windsor officers or directors, Ontario Provincial Police and regulatory authorities.<br>
<br>
</li><li>	Manual and Electronic Forms. During your visit to Caesars Windsor, you may be asked to provide information for various forms, releasing different types of Personal Information. The forms you may be asked to complete fall in the following categories:<br>
<br>
Customer Tracking and Reward Programs: From time to time Caesars Windsor has established and may in future establish various player tracking and reward programs. For example, you may choose to become a member of our Loyalty Program so that you can redeem your slot points for cash back, or qualify for complimentaries and many other promotional offers, and receive invitations to parties and events. If you choose to join the Loyalty Program and have your play rated, we may collect certain information about you including name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, interests, gaming history, number of visits to the casino, and level of play. Caesars Windsor uses this information to better understand the interests of its customers, to provide you with valuable marketing information, and to assess your eligibility for cash back, complimentaries, and other promotional offers, and to invite you to parties and events.<br>
<br>
Credit Applications: As a service to eligible customers, Caesars Windsor may extend you credit to facilitate gaming. To assess your eligibility for credit and determine a line of credit that corresponds with your financial means, we will first have to obtain information about you and verify your financial history. You will be required to provide us with your name, address, income, banking information and credit history. To determine your eligibility for credit, we may disclose your Personal Information to credit reporting agencies, financial institutions and other casinos. The information on our credit applications is required under the Gaming Control Act Regulations, and is similar to the type of information a bank would require before extending a consumer loan.<br>
<br>
Other Financial Services: As a service to customers, Caesars Windsor may open a front money account for you, advance you cash on your credit card, transfer your funds by wire to a financial institution, or permit you to use a Safety Deposit Box. Before we can facilitate these services, we will require certain Personal Information. Depending on the type of service you are interested in, the Personal Information may include your name, address, date of birth, signature, etc. Where these transactions (excluding use of Safety Deposit Box) amount to $10,000 or more in the gaming day, a Large Cash Transaction Record is required under law.<br>
<br>
Large Cash Transaction Records: Under regulations to the Gaming Control Act and Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering Act), casinos are required to complete a Large Cash Transaction or Disbursement Record before conducting any cash transactions of $10,000 or more (including multiple transactions, where cash is received from the same person, amounting to $10,000 or more during the gaming day). These records include Personal Information such as your name, address, business or principal occupation. Where we determine that the transaction is being completed on behalf of a third party, Personal Information on the third party is also required, including the third party's name, address, business or principal occupation. In addition, we are required to file with the federal agency, Financial Transactions Reports Analysis Centre of Canada, transactions where $10,000 or more in cash is received (including multiple cash transactions, by the same person, amounting to $10,000 or more during the gaming day). The recording and reporting requirements for large cash transactions apply not only to all casinos/slot facilities in the country, but also to all financial institutions, foreign exchange dealers, etc.
Self-Exclusion Forms: If you have difficulty in gaming responsibly, you may wish to complete a Self-Exclusion Form. The form requires that you disclose your name, address, date of birth, and a piece of ID, and that you allow us to take a photograph of you. This information is shared with all gaming premises in the province for purposes of the self-exclusion program.
Security Incidents: Details of security incidents, such as assaults, thefts, drunkenness or disorderly conduct, etc., are recorded. If you are involved in or witness a security incident, you may be asked to provide us with your name, address, and telephone number.<br>
<br>
Health and Safety: If you or a family member become ill or are involved in an accident while visiting Caesars Windsor, we may ask you to provide us with your contact information, health history, physician and next of kin.

<b>III. PERSONAL INFORMATION COLLECTED BY THE ALCOHOL AND GAMING COMMISSION (AGCO) OF ONTARIO AND THE ONTARIO PROVINCIAL POLICE (OPP)</b><br>
<br>
The AGCO is an agency of the Government of Ontario. The AGCO is responsible for ensuring that gaming in this province is conducted with honesty and integrity. This involves overseeing the operation of Ontario's gaming facilities. Officers of the OPP are seconded to the AGCO to carry out law enforcement activities within gaming facilities.<br>
<br>
Regulations made under the Gaming Control Act require that gaming facility operators install video surveillance in certain parts of the facilities. OPP officers monitor the video surveillance in order to identify any illegal activity. In cases where illegal activity is suspected, OPP officers carry out an investigation. Some investigations may involve use of face recognition information comparing a facial scan to a database of known or suspected criminals.<br>
<br>
Patrons of gaming facilities do not automatically have their face recognition information gathered by the OPP when they enter a gaming facility. Face recognition information is gathered and used strictly in the course of police investigations. Access to information gathered by OPP officers is restricted to the officers who are assigned to work in the gaming facility. All information gathered is protected by sophisticated systems. Once an investigation is completed, the relevant face recognition information is removed from the OPP database.<br>
<br>
The AGCO gathers personal information in accordance with the Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act for the purpose of law enforcement. Anyone seeking access to the information must meet the requirements set out in the Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act. If you have any questions or would like more information about the role of the AGCO or its use of face recognition, please contact:<br>
