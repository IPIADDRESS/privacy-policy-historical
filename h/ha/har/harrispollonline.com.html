<p>1) Company Background and Websites</p>
</b>
<p>Harris Interactive is a worldwide market research and consulting firm most
widely known for<i> The Harris Poll</i><sup>®</sup> and for its pioneering
leadership in the online market research industry. This privacy statement covers
the following of our sites: <a href="http://www.harrisinteractive.com/">www.HarrisInteractive.com</a>,
<a href="http://www.Novatris.com">www.Novatris.com</a>, <a href="http://www.HISBOnline.com">www.HISBOnline.com</a>,
and <a href="http://www.harrispollonline.com">www.HarrisPollOnline.com</a>.
Harris Interactive is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content
of other websites. We recommend that you carefully read the privacy policies of
each site you visit.</p>
<p>HarrisInteractive.com is Harris Interactive’s corporate website including
our European operations. Novatris.com focuses on research in France only.
HISBOnline.com is the website for HISB (Harris Interactive Service Bureau) a
division of Harris Interactive that provides research services to other market
research companies.</p>
<p>HarrisPollOnline.com is our panel members website which registers and
conducts surveys with individuals aged 13 and over. Children under age 13 are
only contacted to participate in surveys through their parents; they are not
offered the opportunity to register for our online panels directly. For research
with teenagers between the ages of 13 and 18 and children under 13, we are
careful to respect their privacy and parental concerns.</p>
<p>Our survey websites provide members with the opportunity to express opinions
and attitudes about the most current issues. We conduct research that involves
people from around the world, and provide the aggregated results of our research
(stripped of any personally identifiable information) to a wide variety of
clients, including important decision-makers in government, major corporations,
and news organizations. In addition, certain survey findings are published on
our websites so that you can be among the first to hear about the concerns and
interests of people around the world. Our survey research is what allows us to
offer the services and features on our sites free of charge.</p>
<b>
<p class="PageSubHead">2) Information Collected on Harris Interactive Websites</p>
<p>Information Collected During the Registration Process</p>
</b>
<p>Individuals can join our growing databases of survey respondents by
registering at our HarrisPollOnline.com website. When registering on the
websites of third parties with whom we have developed business relationships,
registration through these various means work as follows:</p>
<ul>
  <li>During the registration process on HarrisPollOnline.com (a site directed
    towards, intended for, and appealing to individuals age 13 and over) we
    require individuals to provide us with contact information (e.g., email
    address) and demographic information (e.g., gender, birth year, zip code,
    and country). To allow individuals to modify their submissions at a later
    point in time, we also ask registrants to establish a unique password.
    Individuals under the age of 13 are prevented from registering based upon
    their birth year entry on the registration form. Individuals who are age 13
    are required to enter their month and day of birth to verify they are at
    least 13 years of age.</li>
  <li>Harris Interactive, and its subsidiaries, may provide registration
    opportunities for our survey databases via surveys we conduct with
    individuals age 13 or over.</li>
  <li>Potential survey site members age 13 or over may also have been recruited
    on our behalf by third party websites, who forwarded to us your information,
    with your consent. Any additional information we collect from you, for
    example, to complete registration (if it was not already completed by the
    third party) or during a survey is subject to this privacy policy.</li>
  <li>Individuals have the opportunity, in certain cases, to register in their
    native language by selecting from a set of available languages on the main
    registration page.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once you become a panel member you agree to receive other Harris Poll Online
communications regarding&nbsp;survey invitations and reminders, sweepstakes
notification in the event you are a winner, updates to&nbsp;our privacy
policy,&nbsp;regional-specific communications in the event of a natural or other
disaster, responses to inquiries that you submit to our Survey&nbsp;help desk,
and&nbsp;inquiries should we receive&nbsp;communication from your ISP regarding
your status as an Harris Poll Online member.</p>
<b>
<p>Other Information Collected on Harris Interactive Websites</p>
</b>
<p>As part of the survey process, we often ask members other demographic
information (e.g., income level), and other information related to interests,
hobbies, and product/technology usage. We collect this information so that we
can send surveys to members that correspond with their interests, and aggregate
the responses received by various broad categories to report the aggregated
results to our clients. We also summarize information about the panel to develop
statistics ensuring that the panel is representative of the general population.
Finally, we use this information to pre-qualify panel members for future market
research reports that target certain demographics (male vs. female, age, etc.).</p>
<p>Harris Interactive offers an incentive program, HIpoints, where members of
certain survey sites can accumulate points towards award redemption based on the
number of eligible surveys in which they participate. This program is open only
to members in limited countries. To redeem HIpoints, members must provide full
name and shipping information so that we can deliver the selected items.</p>
<p>Visitors to certain areas of our websites are provided online forms to
contact us if they have questions, comments, are interested in job
opportunities, or require further information on our products or services.
Responses to such inquiries may be sent via email or regular mail within 30 days
upon receipt.</p>
<b>
<p>Children’s Privacy</p>
</b>
<p>Harris Interactive believes that it's especially important to protect
children's privacy online and encourages parents and guardians to spend time
online with their children to participate and monitor their Internet activity.</p>
<p>Harris Interactive complies with all applicable national and international
children's privacy regulations. We comply with the Children’s Online Privacy
Protection Act of 1998 ("COPPA"). We do not collect any personal
information from children under 13 years of age. As part of the validation
process for our clients, we may collect the names of individuals who
participated in a market research study, which may include the names of children
who are under 13 years of age if they so participated. From time to time, we may
also ask our adult panel members or respondents whether they have children under
13 residing with them who might want to participate in a survey. In such event,
we will never collect personally identifiable information from the child, nor
will we combine other information that we collect from the child with personally
identifiable information about the child or parent.</p>
<p>If you would like to contact us about your information, any information about
your child, or to find out how you can have your child's information removed
from our database, please see the "Accessing the Information Your
Provided" section of this policy.</p>
<b>
<p>Information Collected Passively on Harris Interactive Websites</p>
</b>
<p>Harris Interactive<b> </b>does not use cookies to obtain any personal
information about our users.</p>
<b>
<p class="PageSubHead">3) How Information Is Used</p>
<p>Surveys</p>
</b>
<p>We will use the information you provide us primarily to contact you about
surveys in which we would like you to participate, or to provide you with the
results of the surveys. We may also notify you about new features on our
websites, or other products or services related to the primary purpose of our
business in which we think you may be interested. From time to time we may also
invite our members to enter a sweepstakes or participate in other incentive
programs, most of which are related to the running of our surveys. Any
additional information you provide when participating in an online sweepstakes
or other online incentive program we host is subject to this privacy policy.
Harris Interactive does not send unsolicited commercial emails.</p>
<p>Although not covered by the Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited
Pornography and Marketing Act ("CAN-SPAM Act"), Harris Interactive
voluntarily complies with the key privacy and disclosure provisions of the
CAN-SPAM Act, including:</p>
<ul>
  <li>providing truthful sender information;</li>
  <li>including a physical address for Harris interactive or the Harris
    Interactive affiliate sending the email message; and,</li>
  <li>providing a clear and simple opt-out method which is always honored.</li>
</ul>
<p>All survey invitations sent via email are consistent with the CASRO Code of
Standards and Ethics for Survey Research.</p>
<p>As part of our survey research process, we gather, aggregate, and analyze
information from our panelists. We provide the results of our research (which
contain no personally identifiable information) to our clients, which include
governmental agencies, major corporations, and other organizations. Your survey
responses are valuable in guiding the development and designing of products and
services. Panel members’ survey responses are often used by our clients to
make decisions on key issues.</p>
<b>
<p>Sharing Information</p>
</b>
<p>Harris Interactive is not in the business of selling your personally
identifiable information. We use the information you provide to us for internal
purposes, and share it only for the limited purposes described here:</p>
<p>In order to provide you with the services on our sites, we may need to share
your information with third parties, our agents, who perform services on our
behalf, such as merchandise (HIpoints rewards) fulfillment, web hosting, and the
like. They may also collect information on our behalf. Any personal information
collected by a third party website is in accordance to this Privacy policy. For
example, the HIpoints program is managed by our agent, Incentive Logic. A
limited amount of your registration information is provided to Incentive Logic
for purposes of running the HIpoints program. This information is kept in
confidence and not used for any other purpose than to establish and track your
earned HIpoints. Incentive Logic operates the HIpoints program in accordance
with our privacy guidelines and does not share your personal information with
any third party without your permission.</p>
<p>As a company conducting market research, protecting survey participants’
privacy has been an important part of our business long before the advent of the
Internet. We know that you will not want to complete a survey if your personally
identifiable information is shared with third parties, which is why we
participated in industry-wide efforts to protect consumer information, even
before we began conducting surveys online. We only release summarized or
non-personally identifiable information to our clients and require your consent
prior to releasing any personally identifiable information that you provide
during the survey process. U.S. Clients that receive personally identifiable
information are required to sign and abide by CASRO’s "Standards
Regarding Disclosure of Respondent-Identifiable Data to Clients."</p>
<p>Harris Interactive is a thriving and expanding business, and like other
companies, we sometimes acquire or spin off new business units. As part of such
transfers, we convey the business assets of the particular business unit,
including survey participant data. If a change of ownership occurs, a notice
will be posted on www.HarrisInteractive.com or an email will be sent to you
directly.</p>
<p>Harris Interactive will periodically be engaged by our clients to build
Proprietary Panels (database of survey participants). With respect to
Proprietary Panels, data from the resulting database of respondents may also be
made available for use by the client who commissioned the research. Such
information will only be made available to the client pursuant to an agreement
with Harris Interactive that the information will be kept confidential and will
be used exclusively for research purposes. Harris Interactive’s use of
personal information you provide as part of such panels is subject to the same
provisions as indicated herein for Harris Poll Online registrants.</p>
<p>Harris Interactive websites may contain links to information on other
websites. We do not have any control over these other websites, and therefore we
cannot be responsible for the protection and privacy of any information that you
provide while visiting those sites. Those sites are not governed by this privacy
policy, and if you have questions about how a site uses your information,
consult that site's privacy statement.</p>
<b>
<p>Legal Disclaimer</p>
</b>
<p>Though we make every effort to preserve user privacy, we may need to disclose
personal information when required by law wherein we have a good-faith belief
that such action is necessary to comply with a current judicial proceeding, a
court order or legal process served on our website.</p>
<b>

</b>
<p>We passively collect information to make your browsing experience more
pleasant, and to understand what areas of our sites are more popular, what areas
may require improvement, and what technologies are being used by members of our
sites. This information helps us to update and improve our sites. We also use
this information for security purposes, to detect and to block security
breaches, and to provide you with a safe online environment.</p>

<b>
<p class="PageSubHead">4) Accessing the Information You Provided</p>
</b>
<p>For panel members, not only is it important for our members to be able to
correct their information, it is important to us. The results from our public
surveys (which report aggregate, non-identifiable information) often get
reported by the media. We encourage members to keep their account profiles
up-to-date, so that we continue to have accurate demographic information behind
our results.</p>

<p>Responses to such inquiries may be sent via email or regular mail within 30
days upon receipt. If the user does not receive acknowledgement of their
inquiry, or if their inquiry is not satisfactorily addressed, they should then
contact TRUSTe through the TRUSTe Watchdog Dispute Resolution Process (<a href="http://www.truste.org/consumers/watchdog_complaint.php" target="_blank">http://www.truste.org/consumers/watchdog_complaint.php</a>).
TRUSTe will serve as a liaison with the website to resolve users’ concerns.</p>
<b>
<p class="PageSubHead">5) Your Options on Harris Interactive Websites and Opt-out Policies</p>
</b>
<p>For panel members, we are committed to giving you the maximum amount of
flexibility in accessing your information, and in the level of participation you
have with our sites. In each email invitation sent to members of our respondent
database, we provide the opportunity to opt-out of receipt of further mailings.
This opt-out opportunity deactivates the member's account and terminates their
membership with Harris Interactive. Our survey invitations inform you about the
subject matter of the survey in which we would like your input, whether it is in
the category of public opinion, current trends and activities, or
products/services. Any personally identifiable information that you provide
during the survey process will be subject to your consent prior to release to
our client. Should you grant release of such information, and then change your
mind, all you need do is to send an email to <a href="mailto:surveyhelp@hpol.harrisinteractive.com">surveyhelp@hpol.harrisinteractive.com</a>.</p>
<p>If at any point you decide that you no longer wish to be a member of Harris
Interactive’s respondent databases, you may send an email request with the
word "unsubscribe" to <a href="mailto:surveyhelp@hpol.harrisinteractive.com">surveyhelp@hpol.harrisinteractive.com</a>.
Panel members can also opt out by filling out a request on the Member Services
section of the website. We will retain your information in our
"unsubscribe" database, to ensure that we do not contact you in the
future.</p>
<p>For panel member parents, if we invite your 13-to-17 year old children to
participate in surveys covering sensitive topics, we may notify you first,
depending on the nature of the survey involved. If notified, you will be asked
if you will allow your child to participate. In such cases, we will not notify
the child about the survey or ask him or her to participate without your
permission. For the most sensitive of subjects, we typically ask the adult
members of our HarrisPollOnline.com website if they have any children in the
appropriate age level that they would be willing to have participate in the
survey in question. Again, children under age 13 are only contacted to
participate in surveys through their parents.</p>
<p>For subscribers to any Harris Interactive newsletter, you may unsubscribe by
sending an email to <a href="mailto:newsletters@harrisinteractive.net">newsletters@harrisinteractive.net</a> or simply click on
the "One-Click Unsubscribe" in the footer of the email in which you
received with this newsletter.</p>
<p>For all other users of Harris Interactive sites that may have provided
personal information in regards to any of our products or services and wish to
be removed from our contact list send an email directly to <a href="mailto:info@harrisinteractive.com">info@harrisinteractive.com</a>.</p>
<b>
<p class="PageSubHead">6) Safety and Security</p>
</b>
<p>The Harris Interactive websites have security measures in place to prevent
the loss, misuse, and alteration of the information under our control. We will
not activate a potential registrant’s account without confirmation. Once the
registration process is completed, the individual is sent an email that requests
he or she confirm his or her registration. The account will not be activated
until confirmation is received. Additionally, all website members are required
to use their passwords and usernames (email addresses) when registering,
updating their contact information, or when accessing "members only"
sections of the websites. If a member cannot remember his or her password, he or
she can send a message to the website’s Help Desk to retrieve it. To protect
the security of our members’ contact information, requests to retrieve
passwords must include information to allow us to verify the member’s
identity.</p>
<p>We employ standard technology and internal processes to protect the
information our members release to us. Additionally, only select, authorized
employees have access to process the data collected and maintain the database
that stores member contact information. All questions are screened by Harris
Interactive staff prior to being deployed to ensure they are proper and
appropriate for their intended audiences.</p>
<p>While navigating Harris Interactive websites you may be directed to content
or functionality that is hosted by a third party supplier, not on a Harris
Interactive owned domain. For example, this is done on our Careers webpages.
When information is collected on behalf of Harris Interactive exclusively,
Harris Interactive privacy policy will be referenced on the site and will govern
how your information is used. For other, non-Harris Interactive sites, the site
owner's privacy policy will be referenced.</p>
<p>Harris Interactive also safeguards all information it collects through its
websites from unauthorized access. Only authorized Harris Interactive employees
or agents carrying out permitted business functions are allowed to access this
information. In addition, each employee of Harris Interactive is required to
sign a confidentiality agreement requiring him or her to keep confidential all
personal information of panel members. Employees who violate the confidentiality
agreement are subject to disciplinary actions, including termination when
appropriate.</p>
<p>In the unlikely event that Harris Interactive suffers a breach of its
security systems and an individual or entity gains unauthorized access to any
information stored on Harris Interactive servers, Harris Interactive will
immediately investigate such security breach, and will provide prompt notice to
any individual whose information was affected.</p>
<b>
<p class="PageSubHead">7) Notification of Changes</p>
</b>
<p>If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes to this
privacy statement and other places we deem appropriate so our users are always
aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what
circumstances, if any, we disclose it. We will use information in accordance
with the privacy policy under which the information was collected.</p>
<p>If, however, we are going to use users' personally identifiable information
in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection, we will notify
users via email. If users have opted out of all communication with the site, or
deleted/deactivated their account, then they will not be contacted, nor will
their personal information be used in this new manner. In addition, if we make
any material changes in our privacy practices that do not affect user
information already stored in our database, we will post a prominent notice on
our website notifying users of the change. In some cases where we post a notice
we will also email users who have opted to receive communications from us,
notifying them of the changes in our privacy practices.</p>
