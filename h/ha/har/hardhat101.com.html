<div class="main_content">
<p>Nubian101.com&nbsp; Network Inc. has created this privacy policy because we value our 
members and recognize their right to keep personal information private. This 
statement discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices for 
the World Wide Web site located at www.Nubian101.com (the "Nubian101 Site"). We 
believe very strongly that private information should remain private. We'd like 
to hear your feedback about this statement. If you have comments or questions, 
please
<a style="font-family: Verdana; color: #0000CC; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="mailto:nubian101@gmail.com?subject=Contact%20Us%20Nubian101.com">
Contact Us.</a> <br>
<br>
Except as otherwise expressly discussed in this Privacy Policy, this document 
only addresses the use and disclosure of information we collect from you. To the 
extent that you disclose your information to other parties, whether they are 
other members of the Site or other sites throughout the Internet, different 
rules may apply to their use or disclosure of the personal information you 
disclose to them. </p>
<p><b>NUBIAN101 GATHERS THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION: </b></p>
<p><b>Cookies </b><br>
Our Web site sets cookies to administer our site, to gather broad demographic 
information, to deliver content requested by you or specific to your interests, 
to customize our Web site for you, and to save your member name and city so that 
you don't have to enter it each time you visit. </p>
<p>A cookie is a small line of data that is stored on your hard drive. Some 
cookies are only stored for the duration of a single browser session; others 
persist across sessions. We only save your password and member name if you tell 
us to do so; your password is encrypted, stored on your computer and transferred 
over the Internet in an encrypted format. Keep in mind that anyone using your 
Web browser would be able to access the Nubian101 Site as you if you choose to 
store your member name and password. Nubian101's Web servers also set session ID 
cookies that are used to allow our servers to deliver information you request 
(e.g., search results). Members who do not want to receive cookies can instruct 
their Web browsers to refuse them; however, doing so may prevent certain parts 
of Nubian101's site from working (e.g., anything that requires login, including 
member chat, etc). While cookies set by Nubian101 may be used to collect 
personally identifiable information and can be traced to an individual user, 
this personally identifiable information is used only for internal purposes.,
</p>
<p><b>Registration Form </b><br>
Membership on the Nubian101 Site is completely optional. Nubian101's 
registration form requires users to give their email address. On our join form, 
required fields are marked. Nubian101 will never share e-mail addresses with 
third party organizations without your express permission. </p>
<p><b>Control of Your Password</b><br>
<b>Do not disclose</b> your password to any third parties nor share it with any 
third parties. If you lose control of your password, you may lose control over 
your personal information and may be subject to legally binding actions taken on 
your behalf. Therefore, if your password has been compromised for any reason, 
you should immediately change your password. To change your password you can do 
so at any time through the MY ACCOUNT page then click
<a style="font-family: Verdana; color: #0000CC; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="http://www.nubian101.com/edit_profile&amp;s=password">
Change Password</a>. </p>
<p><b>Order Forms </b><br>
When purchasing products or services on the Nubian101 site, you're asked for 
credit card, billing, and shipping information. This information is transmitted 
using a secure, encrypted form. You can see that the transaction is secure from 
the fact that the URL begins with the secure address https:// and we ensure 
encryption through the use of standard SSL encryption technologies. </p>
<p>This credit card information is gathered to bill customers for services 
purchased. Only billing vendors have access to financial information and only 
for the purpose of billing customers. At times Nubian101 may refer users to 
other Web sites to purchase products or services. User activity on those sites 
is covered by the privacy policies on those sites. <!-- <p><b>Online Surveys </b><br>
  At times Adam4Adam may run online surveys asking for specific contact or demographic information. These surveys are always optional. At times Adam4Adam may share both the results of, and individual entries in, surveys with the sponsors of the survey. Results of surveys may be shared with partners and advertisers on an aggregate basis.
<p><b>Contests </b><br>
  At times Adam4Adam may run contests on the Site where we ask for contact or demographic information. These contests are always optional. At times Adam4Adam may share both the results of, and individual entries in, contests with the sponsors of the contests. Results of contests may be shared with partners and advertisers on an aggregate basis. -->
</p>
<p><b>Community Tools </b><br>
Nubian101 provides many venues for member interaction and community. In some 
cases use of such tools (e.g., chat rooms) may reveal a user's member name or 
e-mail address and may permit users to publish certain personal information on 
the Nubian101 Site. In all cases, users affirmatively choose to expose or place 
this information in public areas (e.g. profile page) of the Nubian101 Site, and 
thereby agree that such information may be viewed by or forwarded to anyone. 
Users who do not want this information to be publicly available should not post 
in public areas of the Nubian101 Site. </p>
<p><b>Nubian101 Profiles and PRO ads</b><br>
Nubian101 permits users to submit adult-oriented personal information for use in 
the Nubian101 Profile and PRO ad services. This information is also stored for 
the purposes of member self-publishing and interaction and to customize the 
user's Nubian101 site experience. By registering for Nubian101 Profiles or PRO 
ad and submitting your user information, you understand that the information 
provided in the profile or PRO ad, including your photograph, may be forwarded 
by members to other members and to persons who are not members. Nubian101 will 
not knowingly collect Profile or PRO ad information from those under the age of 
18. </p>
<p><b>Member Feedback </b><br>
Nubian101 stores feedback members send to us. This feedback is used to 
administer and refine the Nubian101 Site and associated services and at times 
may be shared with Nubian101 partners either in aggregate form or individually 
with specific identifying characteristics about the Member (e.g., e-mail address 
or name) removed. </p>
<p><b>IP Addresses </b><br>
Nubian101 tracks individual IP addresses to help diagnose problems with our 
service, to administer our site and to gather broad demographic information. 
User IP address information is used only for our internal purposes. </p>
<p><b>ADDITIONAL DISCLOSURE SCENARIOS </b><br>
Notwithstanding anything else in this policy, Nubian101 may also disclose 
personal and aggregate information when required by a valid legal mechanism such 
as a search warrant, subpoena, or court order, or when we deem it necessary, in 
our sole discretion, to protect our rights and the safety of others, or our 
members, employees, or properties. </p>
<p>Nubian101 believes that members' private communications in chat rooms, 
e-mail, and instant message-like conversations should generally remain 
confidential. Nubian101 does not read or disclose private communications unless 
ordered to do so through a valid legal mechanism such as a search warrant, 
subpoena, or court order, to protect the company's rights and property, or 
during emergencies when we believe safety is at risk. Please remember that what 
you write or post in public areas such as chat rooms and message boards is 
available to all Nubian101 members, and in many cases other visitors to the 
Nubian101 site. Also keep in mind that Nubian101 is not responsible for what 
other users may do with private communications you've had with them. While chat 
and instant message-like conversations pass through Nubian101's servers, we do 
not store logs of these conversations. </p>
<p>Nubian101 reserves the right to share some or all of your personal 
information with its parent company, subsidiaries, joint ventures or other 
companies under common control with Nubian101, in which case Nubian101 will 
require such entities to honor this privacy policy. If Nubian101 is acquired by 
another company, that company will obtain the member information collected by 
Nubian101 and will assume the rights and obligations set forth in this privacy 
policy regarding that information. </p>
<p><b>OFF-SITE LINKS </b><br>
Nubian101 provides links to other sites. Nubian101 is not responsible for the 
privacy practices or contents of these other sites. </p>
<p><b>SYNDICATED NUBIAN101 CONTENT </b><br>
Nubian101 may syndicate its content to and distribute its content through other 
sites on the Internet. Although you may see the Nubian101 logo on such other 
sites, your activity on such other sites is governed by the privacy statement on 
the site you are visiting. </p>
<p><b>OPT-OUT </b><br>
Our site provides users the opportunity upon registration to opt out of 
receiving communications from us and from our partners, affiliates, and 
advertisers. These options are available during registration, and through the

providing information on forms such as the Premium Personals profile forms.
