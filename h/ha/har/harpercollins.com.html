															<p><font face="Arial"><u><b>NON-PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION</b></u></font><font face="Arial">&nbsp;</font></p>
															<p><font face="Arial">When visitors come to our Site, we collect and aggregate information indicating, among other things, which web pages were visited, the order in which they were visited, and which hyperlinks, if any, were "clicked" by the visitor. HarperCollins, like most major web sites, collects such information by placing small bits of information, known as "cookies", on the hard drive of your computer to log IP addresses, operating system (e.g., Windows or Macintosh), type of browser software (e.g., Netscape Navigator or Internet Explorer), and Internet service providers (e.g., AOL or NET.COM) used by each visitor to the Site.</font></p>
															<p><font face="Arial">Cookies enable us to do a number of things to make your visit and future visits to the site more enjoyable. For example, cookies allow a visitor to quickly log on to a site he/she has used before by storing a password. By tracking how many people visit our Site and where they go, we are able to determine which part of the Site users like the best, which part needs some improvement and what changes should be made. By obtaining this information, we are able to continually improve our Site and bring you the best online experience possible.</font></p>
															<p><font face="Arial">Although the cookie itself does not collect any personally identifiable information about a visitor, and HarperCollins does not use cookies in order to obtain such information, the cookie can be used to determine the IP address of the visitor's Internet Service Provider and the geographic location of his or her point of connectivity to the Internet. HarperCollins may also disclose some of the non-personally identifiable information we obtain to advertisers to inform them how many people have seen or linked to their advertisements on our Site. However, we do not disclose personally identifiable information to these advertisers.

If you would like to to know whether we have collected personal information about you, please provide us with the activities that you participated in on the Site which requested personal information. After we have reviewed the relevant databases, we will confirm whether we have collected such information about you. Prior to changing or deleting such infromation, we require that you provide us with proof of your name and address, such as a valid driver's license. Once we have received such proof and determined that it is satisfactory, we will immediately delete or modify your information in our database and refrain from collecting any other personally identifiable information from you, if you so request.

															<p><font face="Arial">We at HarperCollins understand that the Internet presents an opportunity for us to reach the public in new and exciting ways with information about our programming, fun games, exciting sweepstakes and contests, email, chat rooms, bulletin boards, and other forms of interactivity. HarperCollins also recognizes the privacy concerns of parents, and the importance of protecting the privacy of the information this Site collects from children. Parents of children who visit this Site can be confident that any personal information that may be provided to this Site will be collected and maintained in accordance with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act ("COPPA"). HarperCollins encourages parents to supervise their children's activities online and to participate with their children's online activities whenever possible. However, we understand that parents may not always be able to supervise their children's activities on the Internet. That's why HarperCollins has developed a Site that parents can feel is safe for their children and kids will find cool, informative, educational, and fun! Because there's always room for improvement, HarperCollins welcomes any suggestions on how to make the Site a better, <i>safer</i> place to hang out.</font></p>
															<p><font face="Arial"><u><b>COLLECTION AND USE OF PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION FROM CHILDREN UNDER 13</b></u>&nbsp;</font></p>
															<p><font face="Arial">When a visitor to our Site is under the age of 13, HarperCollins does not require the disclosure of more personally identifiable information than is reasonably necessary for him or her to participate in an activity as a condition of such participation.</font></p>
															<p><font face="Arial">HarperCollins may use different types of personally identifiable information submitted to this Site by children under 13 in a variety of ways, which are described below. In each instance, we comply with the parental consent requirements of COPPA.</font></p>

															</li></ol>
															<ul>
																<ul>
																	<li><font face="Arial">We may collect a child's email address in connection with a contest, sweepstakes or game for the sole purpose of communicating with the child on a one-time-only basis (i.e., to contact a contest winner). This information will not be used to re-contact the child, and will be deleted from our records when the contest or game is over. Parental consent will be obtained before we send the winner a prize.</font>

															</ul>
															<ul>
																<ul>
																	<ul>
																		<ul>
																			<li><font face="Arial">We may collect a child's email address in order to respond more than once to a child's specific request. For example, the child may want to subscribe to an online newsletter or receive other online communications from HarperCollins. In these instances HarperCollins will also obtain a parent's email address along with the child's. Before any further contact with the child, HarperCollins will send an email to the parent (a) notifying him or her we have collected the child's email address in order to respond more than once to the child's request for a subscription, information, etc; (b) informing the parent that he or she can refuse us permission to contact the child, and how to do so; and (c) informing the parent that if he or she does not respond to the email within 72 hours, HarperCollins may use the child's information for the purpose for which it was submitted.</font>

In these instances we will initially collect only the child's name and online contact information and the email address of the child's parent. Before using this information for any purpose, we will send the parent an email that (a) informs the parent that we wish to collect and use the child's personal information and need the parent's consent to do so, and (b) provides the parent with a link to access to this Privacy Policy, which describes our information collection and use policies as required by COPPA. If the proposed use of the child's personal information does not involve disclosure to a third party, then HarperCollins will ask the parent to provide consent by return email. Upon receipt of the email consent, we will send the parent a confirming email. If the proposed use of the child's personal information involves disclosure to third parties, the email we send to the parent will ask the parent either to (i) return by postal mail or fax a consent form that will be attached to the email, or (ii) call a toll free number where consent can be given over the phone. If parental consent is not obtained by one of these methods within <b>one week</b> HarperCollins will delete all of the child's and parent's personally identifiable information from its records. In addition, parents can revoke a prior consent at any time.</font>
