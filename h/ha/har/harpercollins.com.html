<center><b>Welcome to HarperCollins! </b></center><br>HarperCollins Publishers Inc. ("HarperCollins") is part of the News America Group, which has adopted a set of <a href="http://www.newscorp.com/privacy.html">Privacy Principles</a>  applicable to all its U.S.-based companies.  HarperCollins has implemented those Principles in this Privacy Policy, which describes how we collect, use and share personally identifiable information ("PII") we obtain from and about individuals located in the U.S. both online and off-line.
<img src="/images/universal/000066.gif" width="730" height="1" border="0" alt="" vspace="4"><br>
<img src="/images/universal/clear.gif" width="0" height="20" border="0" alt=""><br>




<b>Children's Privacy Policy</b><br>
Some of our online activities are directed to children under 13. When those activities involve the collection of PII, we provide additional privacy protections.  To read about our protections that relate to the online collection of PII from children under 13 <a href="?page=coppa">click here</a>.<br><br>

From time to time HarperCollins may revise this Privacy Policy to reflect industry initiatives or changes in the law, our PII collection and use practices, the features of our web sites, or technology.  Therefore, you should review it periodically so that you are up to date on our most current policies and practices.<br><br>

<b>COLLECTION:  COLLECTION OF PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION ("PII") BY HARPERCOLLINS</b><br>

	General.  HarperCollins collects personally identifiable information ("PII" -- that is, information such as your full name, e-mail address, mailing address or telephone number) only in order to create or enhance our relationship with you.  When we collect PII from you it is because you are voluntarily submitting the information to us in order to participate in activities like sweepstakes, contests, games, surveys, forums, subscription registrations, in connection with content or suggestions you submit to us, chats or bulletin boards, or because you want us to furnish you with products, services or information.  On those occasions when we obtain PII from a third party, we use only reputable sources of such information.<br><br>

Cookies. Cookies are small bits of information that the operators of Internet sites place on the hard drive of your computer. Cookies remember information about your activities on the site and enable the operator of the site to make your visits to our Web sites more enjoyable.<br><br>At this time, HarperCollins only employs cookies to identify each user as a unique visitor, so that we can determine if you are a new or returning user. These cookies are not associated
with any PII. In the future, we may use cookies in a variety of ways, including storing your password for easy logon and
relating your use of our site to your PII, so that, if you ask us to send you
information about our upcoming products or promotions, cookie and/or other information about your online activities may allow us to limit the material we send you to the types of items you had viewed on our site in the past. However, if we wish to coordinate your personal and web site activity information in this manner, we will obtain your express prior consent (i.e., "opt in"). Also, our cookies will not contain PII. <br>
<br>
You can always program your computer to warn you each time a cookie is being sent or to refuse cookies completely.<br><br>

<b>NOTICE:  HARPERCOLLINS WILL PROVIDE YOU WITH NOTICE ABOUT ITS PII COLLECTION PRACTICES</b><br><br>

When HarperCollins collects PII from you, we will make sure you are informed about who is collecting the information, how and why the information is being collected and the types of uses we will make of the information. <br><br>

This Policy describes the types of other companies that may want to send you information about their products and services and therefore may want to share your personal information (See "Use" below). However, we will notify you of your options regarding our use of your PII, including whether we can share it with outside companies, before we use it for a purpose other than the one for which it was originally collected or disclose it to third parties, typically at the time of collection (See "Choice" below).  <br><br>

Sometimes we collect personally identifiable information from consumers in manual format, such as a post card or subscription form.  Providing detailed notice in those situations often proves impractical, so consumers will instead be provided with a short notice that describes how to obtain the full text of this Policy and other relevant information from us.<br><br>

HarperCollins's Web sites may be linked to Internet sites operated by other companies.  Some of these third party sites may be co-branded with a HarperCollins logo, even though they are not operated or maintained by HarperCollins, such as Web sites owned and operated by our authors.  HarperCollins's Web sites may also carry advertisements from other companies.  Although we choose our business partners and advertisers carefully, HarperCollins is not responsible for the privacy practices of Web sites operated by third parties that are linked to our sites or for the privacy practices of third parties that advertise on our Web sites.  Once you've left a HarperCollins Web site via such a link or by clicking on an advertisement, you should check the applicable privacy policy of the third party to determine how they will handle any PII they collect from you.<br><br>

HarperCollins's Web sites may also be linked to sites operated by companies affiliated with HarperCollins.  Visitors to those affiliated sites should still refer to their separate privacy policies and practices, which may differ in some respects from this Policy.<br><br>

<b>CHOICE:   HARPERCOLLINS WILL PROVIDE YOU WITH CHOICES ABOUT THE USE OF YOUR PII</b><br><br>

HarperCollins will provide you with the opportunity to choose whether your PII may be used for purposes different from the purpose for which it was submitted.  You will also be able to choose whether your information is shared with companies that are not affiliated with HarperCollins (i.e., not part of the News America Group).
<br><br>

<b>USE:  HARPERCOLLINS'S USE OF PII</b>
<br><br>
HarperCollins will use your PII in a manner that is consistent with this Policy and only for the purpose for which it is submitted, unless other uses are disclosed and you allow us to use your information in these other ways.
<br><br>
HarperCollins may share your PII with companies that are affiliated with us, that is are part of the News America Group of companies.  We may also share your PII with companies that are not affiliated with HarperCollins but would like to send you information about their products and services.  For example, HarperCollins may offer a sweepstakes or contest in conjunction with a co-sponsor, and the co-sponsor may send you information concerning its products or services.  However, you will always have the opportunity to instruct us not to share your information with third parties.
<br><br>
HarperCollins's employees, agents and contractors must have a legitimate business reason to obtain access to your PII.  Outside contractors or agents who help us manage our information activities (i.e., sweepstakes administration, order fulfillment, statistical analyses) may only use PII to provide HarperCollins with a specific service and not for any other purpose.
<br><br>
If HarperCollins obtains PII from a third party, such as a business partner, our use of this information is governed by this Policy.
<br><br>
There may be instances when HarperCollins may disclose PII without providing you with a choice in order to protect the legal rights of HarperCollins, other companies within the News America Group or their employees, agents and contractors; to protect the safety and security of visitors to our web sites; to protect against fraud or for risk management purposes; or to comply with the law or legal process.  In addition, if HarperCollins sells all or part of its business or makes a sale or transfer of assets or is otherwise involved in a merger or business transfer, HarperCollins may transfer your PII to a third party as part of that transaction.
<br><br>
<b>SECURITY: HARPERCOLLINS PROTECTS THE SECURITY OF PII</b>
<br><br>
HarperCollins uses reasonable administrative, technical, personnel and physical measures to safeguard PII in its possession against loss, theft and unauthorized use, disclosure or modification.  In addition, we use reasonable methods to make sure that PII is accurate, up-to-date and appropriately complete.
<br><br>
<b>ACCESS: HOW TO ACCESS, OR CORRECT YOUR PII OR STOP ALL FUTURE COMMUNICATIONS FROM HARPERCOLLINS</b>
<br><br>
You may review PII about you from our records at anytime. If you would like to know the types of information that HarperCollins collects from visitors to its Web sites, please send your request to feedback@harpercollins.com or write to HarperCollins Publishers Inc., Attn:  Veronica "Ronnie" Gambon, 10 East 53rd Street, New York, NY  10022.  If you would like to know whether HarperCollins has collected PII about you, please send us the activities that you participated in on our Web sites which requested PII.  After reviewing the relevant databases, we will confirm whether we have collected such information about you.
<br><br>
Prior to changing any information about you or stopping to communicate with you, HarperCollins requires that you provide proof of your name and address, such as a valid driver's license. Once we determine that the information provided is satisfactory, we will immediately modify the information about you and/or and refrain from collecting PII about you and/or communicating with you in the future, if you so request. However, there may be residual information that will remain within our databases that may or may not contain PII. This residual information will not be given to any third party or used for any commercial purpose.
<br><br><b>
REMEDIES AND COMPLIANCE:  HOW TO CONTACT HARPERCOLLINS ABOUT PRIVACY CONCERNS</b>
<br><br>
If you have any complaints about HarperCollins's compliance with this Policy, have been unable to obtain or modify your PII, or to prevent HarperCollins from collecting your PII, or to stop HarperCollins from communicating with you, please contact Kyran Cassidy, Esq., Assistant General Counsel at: HarperCollins Publishers Inc., 10 East 53rd Street, New York, NY 10022; kyran.cassidy@harpercollins.com; or tel. no.: (212) 207-7969.
