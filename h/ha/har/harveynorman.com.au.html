We will take all necessary measures to fulfil this commitment, including to:</p>
<p>• comply with the Australian Privacy Principles ("APPs");</p>
<p>• ensure that we manage your personal information openly and transparently;</p>
<p>• only collect personal information from you that we need in order to offer you the best possible service and customer experience;</p>
<p>• tell you how we might use your personal information;</p>
<p>• let you know if we need to disclose your personal information to anyone else (including anyone overseas) and if so, in what circumstances this might occur;</p>

<p>• promptly respond to any request by you not to receive direct marketing material from us;</p>
<p>• make sure your personal information is kept accurate and up to date and to properly dispose of any personal information which is no longer required by us; and</p>
<p>• ensure that, where appropriate, you can access and correct your personal information.</p>
<h3>About this Policy</h3>
<p>This policy is intended to explain clearly and in plain language some of the key processes and procedures that we have implemented to manage your personal information, to protect your privacy and to comply with the Privacy Act 1988, the Privacy Amendment (Enhancing Privacy Protection) Act 2012 ("Act") and the Australian Privacy Principles.</p>
<p>References to "our", "us" and "we" in this policy are references to The eCommerce Agency Pty Limited A.C.N. 145 985 815 acting in its capacity as trustee of the eCommerce Agency No 2 Trust and trading as "Harvey Norman Online" and its related entities.</p>
<p><a title="Harvey Norman Website" href="http://www.harveynorman.com.au/">www.harveynorman.com.au</a> ("Website") is owned and administered by The eCommerce Agency Pty Limited.</p>
<h3>What sorts of personal information do we collect?</h3>
<p>We will only collect from you information that is necessary and relevant to our relationship with you, including to enable us to provide to you the best possible service and customer experience.</p>
<p>Depending on the exact nature of our relationship with you, we may request that you provide some or all of the following information:</p>
<p>• information that we may require to initially identify you, including your name, home address and your date of birth;</p>
<p>• information that we can use to contact you, including your telephone number, mobile number, email address, work address, mailing address;</p>
<p>• information we may require to confirm your identity, including your driver's licence number, passport details, business name, Medicare card;</p>
<p>• information that may assist us to confirm your financial position or credit history when you are considering a finance or credit arrangement, including your credit card details, bank details, purchase history or transaction details and loan and credit information where finance arrangements apply.</p>
<p>It would be very unusual for us to need to collect all or even most of the above information from you however the information we will require will depend on the specific service or services that we are providing to you. We will only collect personal information from you that we reasonably require in order to satisfactorily perform the services that you require from us.</p>
<p>The Act places restrictions on us collecting sensitive information about you (which includes information about your religion, political views, ethnicity, criminal records and sexual preferences). Generally we will not collect this type of information , however we may need to collect some sensitive information if you are applying for a job with us, and you have provided us with your consent to do so.</p>
<h3>Why do we require your personal information?</h3>
<p>There are various reasons why we might need to collect, hold, use or disclose your personal information and this will depend upon the specific services that we are providing to you but we will tell you the main reason for asking for your personal information at the time when we ask you to provide it.</p>
<p>Usually, the main reason that we will need to collect your personal information will be relating to a service that we are providing to you or are about to provide to you and for contacting you in relation to those services. Our main services include the sale, rental and delivery of goods; issuing gift cards; providing credit; repair; processing of warranties and coordinating the installation of goods.</p>
<p>We may also use your personal information for other reasons, including:</p>
<p>• to contact you in relation to an event, special offer or product that you might be interested in;</p>
<p>• preventing fraud and other criminal activities;</p>
<p>• to assist us to run our business and to improve our services and performance, including staff training, accounting, risk management, record keeping, archiving, systems development, developing new products and services and undertaking planning, research and statistical analysis; and</p>
<p>• to comply with our legal obligations.</p>
<p>There is no obligation for you to provide us with any of your personal information but if you choose not to provide us with your personal information, we may not be able to provide the information, goods or services that you require.</p>
<h3>How do we collect your personal information?</h3>

<p>We may also provide your personal information to third parties as outlined in this privacy policy.</p>
<p>Other than as outlined in this privacy policy or in any notice provided to you at the time of collecting your personal information, we will not disclose your personal information without your consent unless disclosure is either necessary to prevent a threat to life or health, authorised or required by law, reasonably necessary to enforce the law or necessary to investigate a suspected unlawful activity.</p>

Where we engage third party service providers to perform services for us, those third parties may be required to handle or deal with your personal information.

<p>Wherever possible, we will limit the information provided to independent third parties to that information required for those third parties to properly perform their functions. Further, our contracts with these third parties will always require the third parties to comply with the APPs (or equivalent standards).</p>
<h3>Do we use your personal information for marketing purposes?</h3>
<p>As part of the services that we provide to you, we may:</p>
<p>(a) use personal information that we have collected about you to identify a product or service that may benefit you;</p>
<p>(b) contact you from time to time to let you know about a product or service that we believe you might be interested in; and</p>
<p>(c) disclose your personal information to our related entities, any one or more of the Recipient Parties or to our business partners to enable them to tell you about a product or service that you might be interested in.</p>
<p>By providing your personal information to us or by agreeing to accept the terms of this privacy policy, or both, you consent to your personal information being included in our database to be used for direct marketing purposes, including those described above, however, you can opt-out, unsubscribe or make a request not receive direct marketing communications from us, by calling 02 9763-6891 or by writing to us at A1 Richmond Road Homebush West NSW 2140 or by logging such a request through the Website at any time. Additionally, each direct marketing communication, including all emails and SMS, will include an opt-out or "unsubscribe" option which will immediately indicate to us that you no longer wish to receive materials of this kind. If you make a request not to receive direct marketing communications from us, we will stop sending you these materials.</p>
<p>You may make a request that we do not disclose your personal information to facilitate direct marketing by another organisation and you may request that we provide you with the source of any personal information we use for direct marketing purposes. Any such requests will be actioned within a reasonable period and there will be no charges to you for making, or to you from us actioning, such requests.</p>
<h3>How do we store your personal information?</h3>
<p>We have implemented appropriate processes and techniques (including physical security such as locks and security systems and computer and network security, including firewalls and passwords) to protect personal information from loss, misuse and interference and from unauthorised access, modification or disclosure. In addition, access to your personal information is limited to those who specifically need it to conduct their responsibilities.</p>
<p>We and our third party service providers take all necessary steps to destroy or permanently de-identify your personal information where it is no longer required and to protect your personal information from loss, misuse and interference and from unauthorised access, modification or disclosure.</p>
<p>While care is taken to protect your personal information on the Website, unfortunately no data transmission over the Internet is guaranteed as 100% secure. Accordingly, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you send to us or receive from us online. This is particularly true for information you send to us via email as we have no way of protecting that information until it reaches us. Once we receive your personal information, we are required to protect it in accordance with the Act.</p>
<p>Maintaining your personal information</p>
<p>We take reasonable steps to ensure that:</p>
<p>(a) the information that we collect about you is accurate, complete and up-to-date at the time of collection;</p>
<p>(b) when we use your personal information, it is accurate, up-to-date, complete and accurate at the time of use; and</p>
<p>(c) if we disclose your personal information, it is accurate, up-to-date, complete and accurate at the time of disclosure.</p>
<h3>Will we disclose your personal information to anyone overseas?</h3>
<p>There may be circumstances where we need to disclose your personal information to a third party overseas. This may occur, for example, where we have a database or server hosted outside Australia.</p>
<p>APP 8.1 requires that we will take all reasonable steps to ensure that the third party recipient of your information complies with the APPs (other than APP 1) in relation to your information, or that the third party recipient is bound by laws that offer you at least as much protection as the APPs and that you are able to enforce your rights under those international laws in the event of any breach. Now that you are aware of our obligations and your rights under APP 8.1, please confirm your consent to us disclosing your personal information to overseas third parties by reading the following paragraph and ticking the box below.</p>
<p>I am aware of the obligations of Harvey Norman Online and the protections for me contained in APP 8.1 and as summarised above and I consent to Harvey Norman Online disclosing my personal information to overseas third parties on the understanding that in so consenting, Harvey Norman Online will not be subject to the obligations otherwise imposed on Harvey Norman Online by APP 8.1 and I will not be afforded the protections otherwise provided to me by APP 8.1.</p>
<p>The countries to which we are most likely to send your personal information include New Zealand, United States, United Kingdom and Singapore.</p>
<h3>How can you access your personal information?</h3>
<p>Usually we will be able to provide you with access to your personal information upon receipt of your written request by post sent to A1 Richmond Road Homebush West NSW 2140, and confirmation of your identity. There are some limited circumstances in which we may not be able to provide you with access to your personal information when requested. Such circumstances might include where access would pose a serious threat to the life, health or safety of another person or where such access would unreasonably impact on the privacy of others.</p>
<p>Where you request access to your personal information, we will respond to any such request within a reasonable period after the request is made and if possible, we will provide you with access to your information in the manner requested by you, if specified. In any event, we will take all reasonable steps to give you access to your information in a way that meets your needs.</p>
<p>If we deny you access to your personal information for any reason, or if we are unable to provide you with access to your information in the manner requested by you, then we will provide you with a written notice confirming:</p>
<p>(a) the reason for such refusal; and</p>
<p>(b) the procedure to complain about the refusal.</p>
<p>We may recover from you our reasonable costs of supplying you with access to your personal information but we will not charge you for any request you might make to access your information.</p>
<h3>How can you seek to correct your personal information?</h3>
<p>We do what we can to ensure that the information we hold about you is accurate, complete, up-to-date, relevant and not misleading. To assist us to do this, please ensure that you provide us with correct information at the time you provide it to us and immediately inform us if your details change at any time. If we are concerned that any of your information is inaccurate, incomplete, out-of-date, irrelevant or misleading, or if you request that we correct any of your information, then we will take all reasonable steps to correct the information to ensure that it is accurate, complete, up-to-date, relevant and not misleading in the context of the purpose for which it is held.</p>
<p>If we correct any of your personal information and that information has previously been disclosed to another entity that is required to comply with the APPs, then, upon your request to do so, we will take reasonable steps to notify that other entity of the correction unless such notification is impracticable or unlawful.</p>
<p>If we refuse to correct your personal information following a request by you to do so, then we will provide you with a written notice confirming:</p>
<p>(a) the reason for such refusal; and</p>
<p>(b) the procedure to complain about the refusal.</p>
<p>If we refuse to correct your personal information following a request by you to do so and you request that we associate with the information a statement that the information is inaccurate, out-of-date, incomplete, irrelevant or misleading then we will take reasonable steps to associate the statement with the information so that the statement is apparent to users of the information.</p>
<p>We will respond to any requests regarding the correction of your personal information within a reasonable period after the request is made.</p>
<p>We will not charge you for any request to correct your personal information, nor will we pass on to you any costs incurred by us in correcting your personal information or for associating a statement with your personal information.</p>
<h3>What if you want to make a complaint about some aspect of our privacy procedures?</h3>
<p>We are committed to maintaining and protecting your privacy but it is possible that in limited circumstances, mistakes might be made. If you are concerned with the way your personal information has been handled then you are entitled to make a complaint.
