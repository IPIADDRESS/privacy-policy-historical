<h1>ENSEMBLE STUDIOSâ€™ HALO WARS PRIVACY STATEMENT</h1>
<p>
  (Last updated: 09/27/2006)<br>
  Microsoft is committed to protecting your privacy. This  privacy statement explains data collection and use practices of the Ensemble  Studios' Halo Wars site (the "Site"); it does not apply to other  online or offline Microsoft sites, products or services. By accessing the Site,  you are consenting to the information collection and use practices described in  this privacy statement. <br>
  <strong>Collecting Your Personal Information</strong><br>
  The use of the Site does not require you to disclose any personal information.  However, the site offers you the opportunity to register for an account, which  permits you to use Forums. Should you choose to register for an account you  will be asked for personal information such as your name and e-mail address.  You may also be asked for additional personal information should you choose to  subscribe to the upcoming newsletters or enter any sweepstakes.<br>
  The Site may collect certain information about your  visit, such as the name of the Internet service provider and the Internet  Protocol (IP) address through which you access the Internet; the date and time  you access the Site; the pages that you access while at the Site and the  Internet address of the Web site from which you linked directly to our site.  This information is used for the operation and improvement of the Site. <br>
  <strong>Use of Your Personal Information</strong><br>
  The personal information collected on this Site will be used to operate the  Site and to provide the service(s) or carry out the transaction(s) you have  requested or authorized. <br>
  In support of these uses, Microsoft may use personal  information to provide you with more effective customer service, to improve the  Site and any related Microsoft products or services, and to make the Site  easier to use by eliminating the need for you to repeatedly enter the same  information or by customizing the Site to your particular preference or  interests. <br>
  We may use your personal information to provide you with  important information about the product or service that you are using,  including critical updates and notifications. Additionally, with your  permission, we may send you information about other Microsoft products and  services, and/or share information with Microsoft partners so they may send you  information about their products and services. <br>
  Microsoft occasionally hires other companies to provide  limited services on our behalf, such as Web site hosting, packaging, mailing  and delivering prizes, answering customer questions about products and services,  and sending information about our products, special offers, and other new  services. We will only provide those companies the personal information they  need to deliver the service. They are required to maintain the confidentiality  of the information and are prohibited from using that information for any other  purpose. <br>
  Microsoft may disclose personal information if required  to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to  (a) conform to the edicts of the law or comply with legal process served on  Microsoft or the Site; (b) protect and defend the rights or property of  Microsoft and our family of Web sites; or (c) act in urgent circumstances to  protect the personal safety of Microsoft employees or agents, users of  Microsoft products or services, or members of the public. <br>
  Personal information collected on the Site may be stored  and processed in the United    States or any other country in which  Microsoft or its affiliates, subsidiaries or agents maintain facilities, and by  using the Site, you consent to any such transfer of information outside of your  country. Microsoft abides by the safe harbor framework as set forth by the U.S.  Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of data  from the European Union. <br>
  <strong>Control of Your Personal Information</strong><br>
  Except as otherwise described in this statement, personal information you  provide on the Site will not be shared outside of Microsoft and its controlled  subsidiaries and affiliates without your permission <br>
  You may unsubscribe from the site's upcoming newsletter  at any time by following the instructions in the newsletter you receive.<br>
  Please be aware that this privacy statement and any  choices you make on the Site will not necessarily apply to personal information  you may have provided to Microsoft in the context of other, separately  operated, Microsoft products or services. <br>
  <strong>Security of Your Personal Information </strong><br>
  Microsoft is committed to protecting the security of your personal information.  We use a variety of security technologies and procedures to help protect your  personal information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. For example,  we store the personal information you provide on computer servers with limited  access that are located in controlled facilities. Additionally, when we  transmit sensitive personal information (such as a credit card number) over the  Internet, we protect it through the use of encryption, such as the Secure  Socket Layer (SSL) protocol. <br>
  We use cookies on this Site to ensure the integrity of  the registration process and to personalize the Site. A cookie is a small text  file that is placed on your hard disk by a Web page server. Cookies cannot be  used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely  assigned to you, and can only be read by a Web server in the domain that issued  the cookie to you. <br>
  One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a  convenience feature to save you time. For example, if you personalize a web  page, or navigate within a site, a cookie helps the site to recall your  specific information on subsequent visits. This simplifies the process of  delivering relevant content, eases site navigation, and so on. When you return  to the web site, the information you previously provided can be retrieved, so  you can easily use the site's features that you customized. <br>
  You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most  web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your  browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. If you choose to decline  cookies, you may not be able to fully experience the interactive features of  this or other web sites you visit. <br>
  <strong>Changes to This Privacy Statement </strong><br>
  We may occasionally update this privacy statement. When we do, we will also  revise the "last updated" date at the top of the privacy statement.  For material changes to this privacy statement, we will notify you either by  placing a prominent notice on the home page of our web site or by directly  sending you a notification. We encourage you to periodically review this  privacy statement to stay informed about how we are helping to protect the  personal information we collect. Your continued use of the service constitutes  your agreement to this privacy statement and any updates. <br>
