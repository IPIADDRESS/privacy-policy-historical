		<h2>Privacy Policy</h2>

<p>CompanyLine Corporation provides this Privacy Policy to inform you of our policies and procedures regarding
the collection, use, and disclosure of the information that we collect and receive from users of our Services at
www.hall.com (the “Site”). Unless otherwise defined in this Privacy Policy, terms used in this Privacy Policy have
the same meanings as in our <a href="/terms">Terms of Service</a> (the “Terms”). This Privacy Policy applies to information that you
provide to us through the Site.</p>

<p>As used in this policy, the terms “using” and “processing” information include using cookies on a computer,
subjecting the information to statistical or other analysis and using or handling information in any way, including,
but not limited to collecting, storing, evaluating, modifying, deleting, using, combining, disclosing and transferring
information within our organization or among our affiliates within the United States or internationally.</p>

<h3>Information Collection and Use</h3>
<p><i>Personal Information</i>. When using our Services, we will ask you for certain personally identifiable information.
This refers to information about you that can be used to contact or identify you, and information on your use or
potential use of the Services and related services. Personal information that we might collect would include things
like, your name, email address, home addresses, credit card or other billing information, and website URLs, and
any other information or data that you provide through the Services, such as any of your social networking site
accounts that you link to your Account. You are under no obligation to provide us with these credentials, and
can de-link your accounts at any time. You may change or delete any information that you provide; please use
caution when linking or posting any personal information, as such information may be viewed by other users of the
Services.</p>

<p>We use personal information for the following purposes: (i) to administer the Site and the Services, (ii) to enable
users to easily use and navigate the Site and the Services, (iii) to provide, improve and optimize the Services, (iv) to
better understand users needs and interests, (iv) to personalize your experience, (v) to provide you with software
updates and/or product announcements, and (vi) to provide you with further information and offers from us that
we believe you may find useful or interesting. If you decide at any time that you no longer wish to receive such
communications from us, please follow the unsubscribe instructions provided in any of the communications or
select the appropriate option via your Account.</p>

<p><i>Facebook ID</i>. By linking your Account with your Facebook ID, you are authorizing us to collect, store, and use the
information that you agreed that Facebook could provide to us through Facebook's Platform Policies. When you
use the Services with your Facebook ID, you allow us to access and use certain information from your Facebook
profile to establish your professional profile and network. The information you allow us to access is affected by
the privacy settings you establish at Facebook, however, we will not access or use any non- professional Facebook
information, such as your photos (other than your profile photo), videos, wall posts, status updates, location
check-ins, personal interests or your use of Facebook apps and services.</p>

<p>We will access, store and use some or all of the following information from your current Facebook profile (if you
make it available): your first and last name, your work history and education, your profile picture, your 
Facebook user ID number, the login e-mail you provided to Facebook when you registered, your friends' and their 
friends' names and applicable user ID number, profile photos, work history and education. </p>

<p>In order to help you continually build your professional network, when you add to your network of friends on
Facebook, we will also update your network of friends and their friends on our Services, but the rest of your profile
will not change if you change your Facebook profile.</p>

<p><i>Log Data</i>. When you use the Services, our servers automatically record information that your browser sends
whenever you visit the Site (“Log Data”). This Log Data may include information such as your computer’s Internet
Protocol (“IP”) address, browser type or the webpage you were visiting before you came to our Site, pages of our
Site and Services that you use, the time spent on those pages, information you search for on our Services, access
times and dates, and other statistics. We use this information to monitor and analyze use of the Services and for
the Services’ technical administration, to increase our Services’ functionality and user-friendliness, and to better
tailor it to our visitors’ needs. For example, some of this information is collected so that when you visit the Services
again, it will recognize you and serve information appropriate to your interests. We also use this information to
verify that visitors to the Services meet the criteria required to process their requests.</p>

<p>We use “cookies” to collect some of this information. A cookie is a small data file that we transfer to your
computer’s hard disk for record-keeping purposes. We use cookies for two purposes. First, we utilize persistent
cookies to save your registration ID and login password for future logins to the Services. Second, we utilize session
ID cookies to enable certain features of the Services, to better understand how you interact with the Services
and to monitor aggregate usage by users of the Services and web traffic routing on the Services. Unlike persistent
cookies, session cookies are deleted from your computer when you log off from the Services and then close your
browser. Third party advertisers on the Services may also place or read cookies on your browser. You can instruct
your browser, by changing its options, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie
from the websites you visit. If you do not accept cookies, however, you may not be able to use all portions or all
functionality of the Services.</p>


<h3>Information Sharing and Disclosure</h3>
<p>We will not share personal information about you with other people or nonaffiliated companies, unless we have
your permission, or under the following circumstances:</p>

<p><i>Public Profile and Company Association</i>. When you create an Account, certain of your information will be viewable
to everyone publicly (your "Public Profile."). By default, your Public Profile displays your name, photo and work
history. Your Public Profile is your virtual business card consisting of a URL that you can share or display as you
choose (e.g., on your email signature or blog). You can control how much of this information is available in public
search results and publicly on the Internet. Based on your Public Profile we will automatically associate you with
an organization or company with whom we believe you are affiliated or employed. You can change your company
association through your Account.</p>

<p><i>Aggregate Information and Non-Identifying Information.</i> We may share aggregated information that does not
include personal information and we may otherwise disclose non-identifying Information and Log Data with third
parties for industry analysis, demographic and analytical profiling and other purposes. Any aggregated information
shared in these contexts will not contain your personal information.</p>

<p><i>Service Providers.</i> We may employ third party companies and individuals to facilitate our Services, to provide
the Services on our behalf, to perform related services (e.g., without limitation, maintenance services, database
management, web analytics and improvement of the Services’ features) or to assist us in analyzing how our
Services are used. These third parties have access to your personally identifiable information only to perform
these tasks on our behalf and are obligated not to disclose or use it for any other purpose.</p>

<p><i>Compliance with Laws and Law Enforcement.</i> We will cooperate with government and law enforcement officials
and private parties to enforce and comply with the law and will disclose any information about you to government
or law enforcement officials or private parties as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate to
respond to claims and legal process (including but not limited to subpoenas), to protect our property and rights
or those of a third party, to protect the safety of the public or any person, or to prevent or stop activity we may
consider to be, or to pose a risk of being, any illegal, unethical or legally actionable activity.</p>

<p><i>Business Transfers.</i> We may sell, transfer or otherwise share some or all of our assets, which could include your
personal information, in connection with a merger, acquisition, reorganization or sale of assets or in the event of
bankruptcy.</p>

<h3>Changing or Deleting Your Information</h3>
<p>You may review, update, correct or delete your personal information through your Account or by <a href="/contact">contacting us</a>.
If you would like us to remove your personal information from our system, we will do so, but reserve the right to
retain a record for archive purposes. If you completely delete all such information, then your Account will become
deactivated.</p>

<h3>Security</h3>
<p>We employ administrative, physical and electronic measures designed to safeguard and protect your information
from unauthorized access and disclosure including encrypting your communication by utilizing Secure Sockets
Layer (SSL) software. We will make any legally required disclosures of any breach of the security, confidentiality,
or integrity of your unencrypted electronically stored “personal data” (as defined in applicable state statutes on
security breach notification) to you via email or conspicuous posting on this Services in the most expedient time
possible and without unreasonable delay, insofar as consistent with (i) the legitimate needs of law enforcement or
(ii) any measures necessary to determine the scope of the breach and restore the reasonable integrity of the data
system.</p>

<h3>International Transfer</h3>
<p>Your information may be transferred to — and maintained on — computers located outside of your state,
province, country or other governmental jurisdiction where the privacy laws may not be as protective as those
in your jurisdiction. If you are located outside the United States and choose to provide information to us, we
may transfer your personal information to the United States and processes it there. Your submission of such
information represents your agreement to that transfer.</p>

<h3>Links to Other Sites</h3>
<p>Our Services may contain links to other websites for news and other information. If you choose to visit an
advertiser by “clicking on” a banner ad or other type of advertisement, or click on another third party link, you
will be directed to that third party’s websites. The fact that we may link to a website or present a banner ad or
other type of advertisement is not an endorsement, authorization or representation of our affiliation with that
third party, nor is it an endorsement of their privacy or information security policies or practices. We do not
exercise control over third party websites. These other websites may place their own cookies or other files on your
computer, collect data or solicit personal information from you. Other services follow different rules regarding the
use or disclosure of the personal information you submit to them. Our Privacy Policy only applies to the Site and
we are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of other websites. You should check the privacy
policies of those sites before providing your personal information to them.</p>

<h3>Children’s Information</h3>
<p>The Site and Services are not directed to children. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information
from children. If a parent or guardian becomes aware that his or her child has provided us with personal
information without their consent, please <a href="/contact">contacting us</a>. If we become aware that a member is under the age of 13
and has provided us with personal information without verifiable parental consent, we will delete such information
from our files.</p>

<h3>Changes</h3>
<p>We reserve the right, in its sole discretion, to modify, discontinue, or terminate the Services or to modify this
Privacy Policy at any time. If we modify this Privacy Policy, we will notify you of such changes by posting them on
the Services or providing you with notice of the modification. We will also indicate when such terms are effective
below. By continuing to access or use the Services after we have posted a modification or have provided you
with notice of a modification, you are indicating that you agree to be bound by the modified Privacy Policy. If the
modified Privacy Policy is not acceptable to you, your only recourse is to cease using the Services.</p>
