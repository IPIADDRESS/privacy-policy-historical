				</ol>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>We will disclose your personal data to third parties:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>if Hal Leonard LLC or all or substantially all its assets or the relevant part of its assets 
					
					
					
					are acquired by a third party, in which case personal data held by it about its customers (or the relevant customers) will be one of the transferred assets; or</li>
					<li>if we are under a duty to disclose or share your personal data in order to: comply with any legal obligation; or to enforce or apply our standard terms and conditions of business and other agreements; or to protect the rights, property, or safety of Hal Leonard LLC, our clients, or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for the purposes of fraud protection and credit risk reduction.</li>

				</ol>
			</li>
		</ol>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p><strong>Where we store your personal data</strong></p>
		<ol>
			<li>All information you provide to us is stored on secure servers. These may be located anywhere in the world, including the USA. See below concerning international transfers of personal data.</li>
			<li>Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we will do our best to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee the security of your data transmitted to our site; any transmission is at your own risk. Once we have received your information, we will use strict procedures and security features to try to prevent unauthorized access. This includes encryption of some information.</li>
			<li>We will also require third parties to whom we disclose your personal data to take appropriate measures to ensure the security of your personal data and not to use it except for the purposes for which we disclose it to them.</li>
		</ol>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p><strong>International transfers of personal data</strong></p>
		<ol>
			<li>Many of our external third parties to whom we transfer your personal data as described above are based outside the European Economic Area (<strong>EEA</strong>) so their processing of your personal data will involve a transfer of data outside the EEA.</li>
			<li>
				<p>Whenever we transfer your personal data out of the EEA, we ensure a similar degree of protection is afforded to it by ensuring at least one of the following safeguards is implemented:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>Where we use certain service providers, we may use specific contracts approved by the European Commission which give personal data the same protection it has in Europe. For further details, see <em>European Commission: Model contracts for the transfer of personal data to third countries.</em></li>
					<li>Where we use providers based in the United States of America, we may transfer data to them if they are part of the Privacy Shield which requires them to provide similar protection to personal data shared between Europe and the US. For further details, see <em>European Commission: EU-US Privacy Shield.</em></li>
				</ol>
				<p>Please contact us if you want further information on the specific mechanism used by us when transferring your personal data out of the EEA.</p>
			</li>
		</ol>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p><strong>Retention of personal data</strong></p>
		<ol>
			<li>We will only retain your personal data for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes for which we collected your personal data.</li>
			<li>To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of that personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements. If by law we are required to retain any information about our customers or their interactions with us, we will retain your personal data insofar as required to comply with such law.</li>
			<li>We may anonymise your personal data (so that it can no longer be associated with you) for research or statistical purposes, in which case we may use this information indefinitely without further notice to you.</li>
		</ol>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p><strong>Your legal rights</strong></p>
		<ol>
			<li>
				<p>Under certain circumstances, you have the right to:</p>
				<ol>
					<li><strong>Request access</strong> to your personal data (commonly known as a "subject access request"). This enables you to receive a copy of the personal data we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it.</li>
					<li><strong>Request correction</strong> of the personal data that we hold about you. This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate information we hold about you corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide to us.</li>
					<li><strong>Request erasure</strong> of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal data where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal data in certain other circumstances, namely where you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below), where we may have processed your information unlawfully or where we are required to erase your personal data to comply with local law. Note, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request.</li>
					<li><strong>Object to processing</strong> of your personal data where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms. You also have the right to object where we are processing your personal data for direct marketing purposes. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which override your rights and freedoms.</li>
					<li><strong>Request the restriction of processing</strong> of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of personal data about you, for example if you want us to establish its accuracy or the reason for processing it.</li>
					<li><strong>Request the transfer</strong> of your personal data to you or to another person or entity. In that case we will provide to you, or to the person or entity to whom you wish us to transfer your personal data, your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format.</li>
					<li><strong>Withdraw consent at any time</strong> where we are relying on consent to process your personal data. However this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent. If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain products or services to you. We will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent.</li>
					<li><strong>Lodge a complaint</strong> with the UK Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) or another applicable regulator. If you have any complaints about the way in which we process your personal data please do contact us, as set out below, as we would appreciate the opportunity to resolve your complaint.</li>
				</ol>
			</li>
			<li>If you want to review, verify, correct or request erasure of your personal data, object to the processing of your personal data, or request that we transfer a copy of your personal data to another party, please contact us using the contact details provided below.</li>
