<p><span class="generalText"><strong>CHILDREN AND PRIVACY</strong><br>
  Hallmark Channel encourages parents and guardians to spend time
                with their children online, and to be familiar with the sites
          their children
                visit.
                When subscribing
                to our Hallmark Channel E-mail Newsletter or when entering information
                in connection with an online sweepstakes, contest, survey, registration,
                product
                or service,
                we ask for users to state their age/birth date. Hallmark Channel
                relies on our users to be truthful in responding to these questions.
                We do
                not knowingly
                collect
                personally identifiable information from children under the age
                of 13.<br>
  We encourage users under the age of 18 not to submit personal
                information to us. The age of eligibility may be greater than
                18 years of age
                when entering an online contest or sweepstakes (always read the
                rules for
details). </span></p>
<p><span class="generalText"><strong>COMMUNITY AND PUBLIC AREAS</strong><br>
  Information posted to message boards and chat areas is available
                  to the general public. Please use caution when posting any
          such information. Users under
                  the age of 18 should be particularly careful not to provide
          any personally identifying
                  information while using chat rooms or message boards. Users
          of chat areas
                  and message boards must follow acceptable standards of behavior
                  when posting messages
                  online. Hallmark Channel reserves the right to, but is not
          obligated to, refuse or delete any content that in our sole discretion
is considered inappropriate. </span></p>
<p><span class="generalText"><strong>LINKS TO OTHER SITES</strong><br>
  Our sites contain links to third party sites other than our
                    own. Those sites may not follow the same privacy policies
          as Hallmark
                    Channel.
                    Such links
                    may be to advertisers, content providers or partners who
          may use our logo and/or
                    style as a result of a co-branding agreement. These sites
          may send their own cookies to you, and may collect information
                    and use it
                    in a way inconsistent
                    with Hallmark Channel's privacy policy. Hallmark Channel
          does not control the
                    content that appears on these third party sites. Such sites
                    may contain information that content providers independent
                    of Hallmark
                    Channel
                    have created, maintained,
                    published, posted or otherwise made available. The use of
          any information or materials that you may access at these third
                    party sites is
                    purely voluntary. You should not rely on their contents without
                    independent
                    and thorough
                    review of the accuracy, completeness, effectiveness, timeliness
                    and correct sequencing.
                    When you click via a link to such third party sites you should
                    read the applicable privacy policy to determine how they
          will use any
                    information they collect
                    from
                    you. These third party sites may also refer to specific commercial
                    products,
                    processes, or services by trade name, trademark, service
          mark, manufacturer or otherwise. Unless Hallmark Channel has provided
                    explicit authority,
                    such references
in no way indicate our endorsement, recommendation or preference. </span></p>
