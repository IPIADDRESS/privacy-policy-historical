      <ol class="legal-list">
        <li>
          Security is a high priority. We take appropriate precautions to protect personal data from loss, misuse, unauthorised access or disclosure, alteration or destruction using the same safeguards as we use for our own proprietary information. All information you provide to us is stored on our secure servers and any payment transactions will be encrypted using SSL technology. Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password which enables you to access certain parts of the site, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to share a password with anyone.
        </li>
        <li>
          Unfortunately, email and other electronic communications are not secure if they have not been encrypted and your communications may pass through servers in a number of different countries before they reach us. Although we will do our best to protect your personal data (and will use strict procedures and security features to try to prevent unauthorised access once we have received it), we cannot guarantee the security of your data transmitted to the site and any transmission is at your own risk.  We also cannot accept responsibility for any unauthorised access to, or loss of, personal data that results from a cause beyond our control, nor can we be held responsible for the actions or omissions of other users or third parties who may misuse your personal data which they collect from the site.
