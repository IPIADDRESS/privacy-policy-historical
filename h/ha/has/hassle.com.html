<p>a. Facebook (visitor action pixels)</p>
<p>Our website uses “visitor action pixels” from Facebook Ireland Ltd., 4 Grand Canal Square, Grand Canal Harbour, Dublin 2, Ireland, hereinafter referred to as “Facebook”.</p>
<p>The visitor action pixel allows user behavior to be tracked after they have been redirected to the provider’s website by clicking on a Facebook ad. This enables us to measure the effectiveness of Facebook ads for statistical and market research purposes. The data collected in this way is anonymous to us, i.e. we do not see the personal data of individual users. However, this data is stored and processed by Facebook, which is why we are informing you, based on our knowledge of the situation. Facebook may link this information to your Facebook account and also use it for its own promotional purposes, in accordance with Facebook’s Data Usage Policy. See more <a href="https://www.facebook.com/about/privacy/">here.</a></p>
<p>The visitor action pixel is triggered by Facebook when visiting our website and may store a cookie on your device. If you log into Facebook after this or visit our website when logged into Facebook, the visit to our website will be linked to your account. The personal data collected still remains anonymous to us and does not allow us to make any assumptions about the identity of users. This data is nevertheless stored and processed by Facebook, so that it might be possible to link this to respective user accounts and can be used for market research or other promotional purposes by Facebook.</p>
<p>The legal basis for the use of this service is Article 6 (1) (f) GDPR and serves our legitimate commercial interests.</p>
<p>You can object to the collection of your data by Facebook pixel, or to the use of your data for the purpose of displaying Facebook ads <a href="https://www.facebook.com/settings?tab=ads">here</a></p>

<p>c. Google Marketing Services</p>
<p>Our website uses marketing and remarketing services of Google LLC, 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA, hereinafter referred to as “Google”. These services allow us to display advertisements in a more targeted manner in order to present advertisements of interest to users. Through remarketing, ads and products are displayed to users relating to an interest established by activity on other websites within the Google network. For these purposes, a code is used by Google when our website is accessed and what are referred to as (re)marketing tags are incorporated into the website. With their help, an individual cookie, i.e. a small file, is stored on the user’s device (comparable technologies may also be used instead of cookies). Cookies can be set by various domains, including google.com, doubleclick.net, invitemedia.com, admeld.com, googlesyndication.com or googleadservices.com. This file records which apps users have visited, which content they are interested in and which offers have been used. In addition, technical information about the browser and operating system, referring websites, the length of the visit as well as any additional data about the use of the online products and services are stored. The IP address of users is also recorded, although we would like inform you that within the framework of Google Analytics, IP addresses within member states of the European Union or in other contracting states to the Agreement on the European Economic Area are truncated.</p>
<p>All user data will only be processed as pseudonymous data. Google does not store any names or email addresses. All displayed ads are therefore not displayed specifically for a person, but for the owner of the cookie. This information is collected by Google and transmitted to and stored by servers in the USA.</p>
<p>One of the Google marketing services we use is the online advertising program Google AdWords. In the case of Google AdWords, each AdWords customer receives a different conversion cookie. Cookies can therefore not be tracked through the websites of AdWords customers. The information collected by the cookie is used to generate conversion statistics for AdWords customers who have opted for conversion tracking. AdWords customers see the total number of users who clicked on their ad and were redirected to a page with a conversion tracking tag. However, they will not receive any information that personally identifies users.</p>
<p>We may include third-party advertisements based on the Google Marketing Service called DoubleClick. DoubleClick uses cookies to enable Google and its partner websites to place ads based on users’ visits to this website or other websites on the Internet.</p>

The prerequisite for this is that the user has accessed our website through an ad from Microsoft Bing Ads. This enables Microsoft and us to know that someone has clicked on an ad, has been redirected to our online services and has reached a predetermined target page. We only see the total number of users who clicked on a Bing ad and were then forwarded to the target page (conversions). No IP addresses are stored. No other personal information about the identity of the user will be disclosed.</p>
<p>The legal basis for the use of this service is Article 6 (1) (f) GDPR and serves our legitimate commercial interests.</p>
