		<p>
		We are pleased that you have decided to visit the Hasbro Web site.
		If you are a parent or guardian and are interested in knowing what
		Hasbro's policy is regarding the on-line collection of information
		from children, click on <a href="#parents">Note to Parents</a>.
		The purpose of this site is to provide you with important information
		about our products
		and allow you to experience some of our toys and games.  Each page
		of the site is intended to be used for educational and entertainment
		purposes only. Remember, though, every time one of our games or toys
		is mentioned or featured, it is considered an advertisement for that product.
		</p><p>
		Hasbro continually strives to provide its visitors with the most exciting
		Internet experience possible.  To help us learn what you like and don't
		like about our sites, we may from time to time ask you for your opinion
		about the sites and how we can make them better.  The information you
		provide will only be used by us and will never be given to anyone else.
		If you don't want to receive new product information from us, just tell
		us.  But remember, kids -- before answering any question or offering any
		information, adopt and use a "screen name" and check with your parents or
		guardian to make sure it's okay.  
        </p><p>
		Finally, you should also know that we sometimes collect information exclusively
		for our internal purposes about how people came to the Hasbro site and how long
		they stay.  This information, however, does not include any personal information
		about you, only how you came to the Hasbro site, which pages you visited, and how
		long you stayed.  We do not know who you are unless you tell us, and we do not use
		this information beyond improving our own sites. 
		</p><p>
		Kids, if you are ever unsure about anything you are seeing on this site, check with
		your parents or guardian.
		</p><p>
		We reserve the right to change this statement at any time.  For additional information
		about our Web site, please see our <a href="terms.html">Terms and Conditions</a>. Thanks.
		Have fun.
