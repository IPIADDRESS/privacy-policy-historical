	</p><p><strong>WELCOME!</strong></p>
	<p>This Hasbro Web site brings you the coolest  information about the world of Hasbro and provides a first hand look at some of  our games and toys. If you are a parent or guardian and are interested in  knowing more about Hasbro's policy regarding the online collection of  information from children, we recommend reviewing the <a href="/home/privacy.html#parents">Note To Parents</a> below.    
	</p><p>	  Hasbro respects the privacy rights of its  online visitors and is committed to providing you with a secure online  environment. We have adopted an Online Privacy Policy ("Privacy  Policy") that guides how we collect, store and use the information you  provide us online.    
	</p><p>	  Hasbro, Inc. is a licensee of the  TRUSTe Web and Children’s Online Privacy Seal Program. TRUSTe is an  independent, non-profit organization whose mission is to build user’s trust and  confidence in the Internet by promoting the use of fair information practices. This  privacy statement covers the Web sites <a href="/" target="_blank">www.hasbro.com</a> and <a href="http://www.hasbrotoyshop.com/" target="_blank">www.hasbrotoyshop.com</a>. Because this Web site wants to demonstrate  its commitment to your privacy, it has agreed to disclose its information  practices and have its privacy practices reviewed for compliance by TRUSTe.    
	</p><p>	  If you have questions or concerns  regarding this statement, you should first contact the Website Administrator at <a href="mailto:hasbroregistration@hasbro.com">hasbroregistration@hasbro.com</a>. If you do not receive acknowledgement of  your inquiry or your inquiry has not been satisfactorily addressed, you should contact  TRUSTe at <a href="http://www.truste.org/consumers/watchdog_complaint.php" target="_blank">http://www.truste.org/consumers/watchdog_complaint.php</a>.  TRUSTe will then serve as a  liaison with us to resolve your concerns.    
	</p><p>	  The TRUSTe Web and Children’s  Online Privacy programs only covers information that is collected through this  Web site, and <strong>does not </strong>cover  information that may be collected through any software downloaded from this Web  site. In addition, this Privacy Policy applies only to the information that  Hasbro collects online, not offline.<strong></strong>    
	</p><p>	  Please note, also, that this  Privacy Policy applies only to sites operated by Hasbro from its offices within  the State of Rhode Island, United States of America ("US"), and not  to Web sites operated by our  international affiliates (e.g., Hasbro UK) or other companies or organizations  to which we link. When you link to any other sites from Hasbro's US Web site,  this policy no longer applies and Hasbro does not control the activities of  those sites.    
	</p><p><strong><u>What information does Hasbro collect?</u></strong>     
	</p><p>	  In order to give you the most exciting  Internet experience possible, Hasbro may request and/or collect information  from you on a voluntary basis when you: (1) register with us; (2) shop at any  of our online stores (when available); (3) participate in contests, events or  promotions; (4) send questions or comments via e-mail to Hasbro customer  support; (5) submit your resume to us online; and/or, (6) fill out online  surveys. The requested information may include personal information such as  your name, e-mail address, telephone number, and home address. For some  activities, we may also ask you to create a password and to provide demographic  information such as your age, the gender and birthdates of children in your  household, and toy and game ownership and preferences. If demographic  information is collected for an activity that also requires personal  information, we may combine the demographic information with your personal  information. This allows us to tailor the notices we send you and the content  we provide you according to your preferences and interests.<br>
	  If you are under the age of 13, only your parent or guardian can provide any personal  information to us for purposes of registration and other online activities.  Kids, if you are ever unsure about anything you are seeing on this site, ask  your parent or guardian for help. See <a href="/home/privacy.html#parents">Note To Parents</a> below for more information. 
	  </p><ul type="disc">
      <li><strong><u>Registration </u></strong></li>
	  </ul>
	<p>If you wish to register with one of our sites  or register a Hasbro product, you may be asked to supply personal information such  as your full name, e-mail address, and (in the case of product registration)  mailing address. We may also ask you to provide demographic information such as  your birthdate, gender, the birthdates and genders of children in your  household, the postal code and country in which you live, and information on  products you own or of interest to you. Hasbro uses such information to  periodically contact you with product information news, special offers and  relevant announcements (including service announcements) and to provide other  exclusive benefits to those who register their products on our sites.</p>
	<ul type="disc">
      <li><strong><u>Online Store </u></strong></li>
	  </ul>
	<p>In the event we provide an online store,  visitors purchasing goods and services through such store will need to provide  a valid credit card number and expiration date, in addition to name, mailing  address, phone number and e-mail address.</p>
	<ul type="disc">
      <li><strong><u>Promotions/Contests </u></strong></li>
	  </ul>
	<p>To participate in some of our  promotions, you may be asked to provide an e-mail address or screen name, so  that we can let you know if you won a prize. Please do not use your real name  for these promotions. For other Hasbro promotions, we may request your name and  home address in order to send you products or information by regular mail. All  promotions on the Hasbro Web sites are administered by Hasbro. Your personal  information is not shared with any third parties, except with entities who use  it solely to provide support for the operations of the Hasbro  promotion/contest.</p>
	<ul type="disc">
      <li><strong><u>E-mail</u></strong><strong> </strong></li>
	  </ul>
	<p>By allowing you to send e-mail to  us, we are not attempting to collect any personal information about you. We  will only use personal information (such as name, mailing address and e-mail  address) contained in your e-mail to respond to your specific inquiry or  comments in the e-mail. Although we may retain your e-mail for a period of  time, we will not use any personal information contained in your e-mail for any  purpose other than responding to your specific inquiry or comments. </p>
	<p> By allowing you to send postcards  or pages to friends, we are not attempting to collect any personal information  about you or the person you are e-mailing. We will use the personal information  supplied (such as your friend’s name and e-mail address) only to send the  postcard or page as you request and allow the recipient to respond to you. This  is a one-time e-mail initiated by the user of the site and this information is  not stored or used by Hasbro, other than to execute the e-mail. </p>
	<ul type="disc">
      <li><strong><u>Resumes</u></strong><strong> </strong></li>
	  </ul>
	<p>Some of our sites allow for the online  submission of resumes. Personal information collected from resumes is not  subject to this Privacy Policy. However, we can assure you that such  information will be used solely for the purpose of accepting and evaluating  candidate submissions for job postings.</p>
	<ul type="disc">
      <li><strong><u>Online Surveys</u></strong><strong> </strong></li>
	  </ul>
	<p>In order to improve the user experience at  our Web sites, we may employ online surveys for visitors to volunteer anonymous  demographic information about themselves and provide us feedback about why they  visit our sites and what we can do to make them better. Information collected  through these surveys is anonymous; we cannot identify who is submitting the  information or tie it to other personally identifiable information a user may  have provided us through another means.</p>
	<p> Whatever the activity may be, we will only  collect information to the extent deemed reasonably necessary to fulfill your  requests and our legitimate business objectives. If you do not want to submit  personal information when requested, you will not be able to access certain  areas on our site. However, you do not need to provide personal information to  Hasbro in order to use our Web sites.</p>
	<p>        <strong><u>Who is collecting my information and  how will it be used?</u></strong></p>
	<p>	  Hasbro collects the personal information you  provide on our sites. We will use the information you submit to our Web sites  to send you advertising or promotional materials, including information about  new products, contests, features and enhancements, special offers and other  events of interest. We also use your personal information for our internal  marketing and demographic studies, so we can constantly improve the products  and services we provide you and can better meet your needs. </p>
	<p> The demographic information (e.g., age and  gender) you provide us is collected by Hasbro and may be disclosed in aggregate  to third parties. This aggregate demographic information cannot be used to  personally identify you or your computer.</p>
	<p>        <strong><u>With whom does Hasbro share my personal  information?</u></strong></p>
	<p>	  From time to time, Hasbro may  employ and share its customers' personal information (including that of children  under 13) with entities who use it solely to provide support for the internal  operations of the Hasbro website (e.g., online product fulfillment, online  registration and email services, or technical support). These entities will not  use your personal information for any other purpose, and have agreed to  maintain the confidentiality, security, and integrity of the personal  information they obtain from us.</p>
	<p> Similarly, some of our support  provider entities may collect your personal information directly, such as when  applying for a job through our Careers section or when submitting photos and/or  videos for posting. In these instances, even though the pages where you enter  your personal information have the look and feel of the Hasbro Web site, the  support provider will be prominently identified by a “Powered by” logo. The  Hasbro privacy statement will apply to personal information you submit to these  third party sites. These entities will not use your personal information for  any purpose other than that stated when you submit the information, and have  agreed to maintain the confidentiality, security, and integrity of the personal  information they obtain from you. </p>
	<p> We may disclose personal  information (including that of children under 13) in the good faith belief that  we are required to do so by law,  including but not limited to disclosure to law enforcement or other government  officials in connection with an investigation of fraud, intellectual property  infringements, or other activity that is illegal or may expose you or us to  legal liability.<br>
	  Hasbro does not sell, rent, or  otherwise disclose personal information collected from and about its users  (including children under 13) to third parties for promotional purposes.  However, in the event of a merger, acquisition, reorganization, bankruptcy, or  other similar event, Hasbro's customer information may be transferred to  Hasbro's successor or assign, if permitted by and done in accordance with  applicable law. Please see our “Questions and Complaints” section below for  instructions on how we will notify you of such an event.</p>
	<p>        <a name="cookies"><strong><u>Cookies and Clear GIFs</u></strong></a> </p>
	<p>Hasbro uses cookies and clear GIFs to enhance  your experience at our Web sites. These cookies and clear GIFs let us know how  many people are coming to individual sites, how frequently, and how they are  using the sites, allowing us to make updates to content and improve navigation  as appropriate. </p>
	<p> Cookies are pieces of information that we  place on your computer to help us accurately understand how many consumers are  visiting a particular site, how often they visit that site, what content they  are most interested in, and how they prefer to shop for our products. For  example, a cookie will allow us to remember certain things based on your  Internet Protocol or "IP" address (an IP address is the string of numbers  that identifies each sender or receiver of information that is sent across the  Internet), such as your login information, the time and duration of your  visits, how you navigated through our content and where you exited a particular  site. To save you the time of re-entering your login information every time you  come back to our Web sites, Hasbro may link information contained in a cookie  to your email address (including that of registered  children under 13). We do not use cookies to retrieve information from your  computer that we did not originally send in a cookie. </p>
	<p> Clear GIFs, sometimes called "Web  bugs," are file objects, usually a graphic image such as a transparent one  pixel-by-one pixel GIF (Graphics Interchange Format, one of the two most common  file formats for images on the Web), that are placed on a Web page or in an  e-mail message to monitor user behavior. The GIF tells us the IP address of the  computer that fetched our page, the URL of the page the GIF is on, the time the  page was viewed, the type of browser used, and can tell us a previously set  cookie value. This anonymous information is returned by the clear GIF to Hasbro  and we use this information to accurately count visitors across multiple Hasbro  sites and understand how they navigate and use our network of sites. Hasbro  does not combine information gathered through clear GIFs with your personal  information.</p>
	<p>        <strong><u>Log Files</u></strong> </p>
	<p>    Other information passively collected by  Hasbro is in the form of logs - files that record website activity and gather statistics  about web users' browsing habits. These entries are generated anonymously, and  help Hasbro determine (among other things) how many and how often users have  visited our Web sites, which pages they've visited, and other similar data. We  also use the log file entries for our internal marketing and demographic  studies, so we can constantly improve the online services we provide you. Log  files are used internally only, and are not associated with any particular  user, computer, or browser.</p>
	<p>        <strong><u>Linking to third party sites</u></strong> </p>
	<p>    To provide relevant information not found on  our Web sites and to facilitate online shopping, Hasbro may provide links from  our Web sites to third party Web sites. Hasbro will notify users when they are  leaving a Hasbro site and we encourage our users to read third party sites'  privacy policies before submitting personal information.</p>
	<p> To provide users with the ability to  comparison shop and purchase online, Hasbro has affiliate relationships with  some of our retail affiliates. We may use cookies and/or clear GIFs (described  above) to track shopping behavior on our sites and on our retail affiliates'  sites. No personally identifiable information is tied to this shopping  behavior. Tracking this behavior helps us better understand user preferences  and plan product listings with our affiliates.</p>
	<p>        <strong><u>Opt-out</u></strong> </p>
	<p> If you do not want Hasbro to send you e-mail  or regular mail about our products and/or services, you can opt-out at the time  of registration or at the time of information collection. If you are receiving  e-mails or regular mail and at a later date you choose to opt-out and have your  name removed from Hasbro’s e-mailing list, you can do so by using the link  included with a Hasbro e-mail or by sending an e-mail to <a href="mailto:hasbroregistration@hasbro.com">hasbroregistration@hasbro.com</a>.<br>
	  Please note that “welcome” and  service e-mail communications are not promotional in nature and, therefore, an  opt-out is not provided. These are simply to notify the user of a service they  recently signed up for or to notify the user of Web site issues.</p>
	<p>        <a name="safeguarding"><strong><u>Safeguarding your  personal information</u></strong></a> </p>
	<p>Hasbro will only collect personal  information to the extent deemed reasonably necessary to serve our legitimate  business purposes, and we will take appropriate steps to ensure the security  and integrity of any information (including that of children under 13) you  provide to us. Any information provided to Hasbro on the Hasbro Web site is  housed in a secure datacenter, and sensitive information such as credit card  numbers are secured using SSL encryption.</p>
	<p>        <strong><u>Review, update and removal of personal  information</u></strong></p>
	<p>	  If you have registered with our site, you may  at any time review and/or update the contact information we have for you or  inform us that you want us to remove your information from our database by  either visiting the online profile section of one of our sites or contacting us  at hasbroregistration@hasbro.com. <em>If you choose to send us an e-mail, please  be sure to include in your message the name of the site at which you registered  and the e-mail address you used to register so that we can verify your request.</em><strong><u></u></strong></p>

	<p>	  Any questions or complaints about Hasbro or  this privacy statement can be addressed by contacting us at  hasbroregistration@hasbro.com.</p>
	<p>	  If we decide to change our  privacy policy, we will post those changes to this privacy statement, the home  page, and other places we deem appropriate so that you are aware of what  information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we  disclose it.</p>
	<p>	  We reserve the right to modify  this privacy statement at any time, so please review it frequently. If we make  material changes to this policy, we will notify you here, by e-mail, or by  means of a notice on our home page. If we make material changes to how we use  Personal Information collected from children under age 13, we will notify  parents by e-mail in order to obtain verifiable consent for the new uses of the  child’s Personal Information.</p>

	<p><a name="parents"><strong>NOTE TO PARENTS</strong></a> </p>
	<p>	  Hasbro has developed its Web site to be an  enjoyable experience for children (and adults) of all ages. Hasbro recognizes  that some younger children may not understand some of the information contained  on the Web site or how the site operates. That is the purpose of the Privacy  Statement. Please discuss this statement with your children so that they will  better understand how to use the site and the information they may be asked to  provide. Hasbro strongly believes that providing its visitors with accurate and  adequate notice about the Web site will lead to informed choices and decisions  about how to use the site, as well as protect its users' privacy. If you have  any questions or comments about our policy, please contact us using the Contact  Information provided below. For all other issues, please contact <a href="/default.cfm?page=customer_care" target="_blank">Customer Service</a>. </p>
	<p><strong><u>Children Under 13</u></strong></p>
	<p><strong>Collection and Use of Children's Personal Information</strong> </p>
	<p> Hasbro may collect and store personal  information about children under 13 ("children" or "child") if it is submitted by the parent or guardian in  connection with any of our website registrations. To determine who is younger  than 13 years old and whether parental consent is required, we ask all users  who wish to register to submit their date of birth. Those users that indicate  they are less than 13 years of age are taken through a parental consent  process. If provided by the parent or guardian, Hasbro may collect and store  the following types of personal information about a child under 13: name, email  address, parent's or guardian's name, and parent's or guardian's email address.  Hasbro may also collect the child’s mailing address when necessary to fulfill a  transaction, such as sending the winner of a contest or sweepstakes the awarded  prize. Hasbro may also collect demographic information about a child such as  the child's date of birth, gender, and other preferences; and, combine such  information with the child's personal information. Hasbro will only collect  this information if it is voluntarily submitted to us by the child’s parent or  guardian. For information on how we use cookies and other information  collection tools, please see our section on <a href="/home/privacy.html#cookies">"Cookies  and Clear GIFs"</a> (above). </p>
	<p>	  Once collected, a child's registration  information may be used to: (a) fulfill a transaction, such as sending the winner of a  contest or sweepstakes the awarded prize and, (b) allow us to send the child requested  promotional materials, including information about new products, contests,  features and enhancements, special offers, and other events of interest (e.g.,  Birthday Club e-mails). We may also use the information for our internal  marketing and demographic studies, so that we can constantly improve the  products and services we provide our visitors and to better meet their needs.</p>
	<p> Please note that we are prohibited from  conditioning a child's participation in an activity - like contests - on the  child's disclosure of more personal information than is reasonably necessary to  participate in the activity. This means that if we don't need a specific piece  of information (like the child's phone number) to allow the child to  participate in a contest, we simply won't ask for it. To read about the steps  Hasbro takes to protect the confidentiality, security, and integrity of  children's personal information, please see our section on <a href="/home/privacy.html#safeguarding">"Safeguarding  your personal information"</a> (above).</p>
	<p>	  <strong>Hasbro Contact Information</strong> </p>
	<p>    Any personal information that a child  provides to our Web site(s) for purposes of registration is collected by  Hasbro. Hasbro's contact information is as follows</p>
	<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hasbro,  Inc.<br>

	<p>	  <strong>Parental Access</strong> </p>
	<p>    A parent who has already given Hasbro  permission to collect and use his or her child's personal information can, at  any time, do the following: (1) review, correct, or have deleted the child's  personal information; and/or, (2) discontinue further collection or use of the  child's personal information. To do so, please refer to the confirmation email  provided to you when you gave consent or contact us at  hasbroregistration@hasbro.com and be sure to include your child's name and  email address, your name and email address, and the name of the site at which  your child is registered.
