	<h1><a name="top" id="top">HASBRO WEB SITE PRIVACY POLICY</a></h1>
	<p name="header" id="header">(Last Updated: 12/11/2014)<br><br>

	</p>
	<h2>WELCOME!</h2>
	<p>This Privacy Policy ("Policy") explains how Hasbro, Inc. and its subsidiaries and affiliated companies that operate within the United States ("Hasbro") collect, use and disclose your personal information. This Policy applies to information we collect when you use our websites, mobile applications and other online products and services where this Policy is posted (collectively, the "Services").</p>

	<p>This Privacy Policy and the ESRB certification seals shown on our websites confirm that Hasbro is a valid licensee, and participating member, of the <a href="http://www.esrb.org/privacy/index.jsp" target="_blank">Entertainment Software Rating Board's Privacy Certified Program</a> (“ESRB”). To protect your privacy, we have voluntarily undertaken this privacy initiative and have had all of our websites where this Privacy Policy is posted reviewed and certified by ESRB Privacy Certified to meet established online information collection and use practices. As a licensee of this privacy program, we are subject to frequent audits of our sites and other enforcement and accountability mechanisms administered independently by the ESRB. If you are a parent or guardian and are interested in knowing more about Hasbro's policy regarding the collection of information from children, we recommend reviewing the <a href="#parents">Note to Parents</a> below.</p>

	<p>We may change the provisions of this Policy at any time and will indicate when changes have been made by revising the date at the top of this Policy. Your use of the Services, or any portion thereof, following the posting of such changes shall constitute your consent to such changes. We encourage you to review this Policy whenever you access the Services to make sure that you understand our information collection, use and disclosure practices. If we make material changes to this Policy, we will provide you with additional notice of such changes and request your affirmative consent before using or sharing previously collected information in a materially different way. If we make material changes to how we use personal information collected from children under 13, we will notify parents by email in order to obtain verifiable consent for the new uses of the child's personal information.</p>

	<h3>What information does Hasbro collect?</h3>
	<h4>Information That You Provide</h4>
	<p>Hasbro may collect information that you provide when you use the Services, such as when you: (1) create an account; (2) make a purchase; (3) participate in contests, events or promotions; (4) send questions or comments via email or live chat to Hasbro customer support; (5) submit your resume to us online; (6) fill out online surveys; (7) otherwise communicate with us through the Services; or (8) provide information necessary to obtain parental consent. The types of personal information that you provide may include your name, email address, parent’s or guardian’s name, parent's or guardian’s email address, telephone number, postal address, credit card information, birth date and other contact or identifying information that you choose to provide. We may also collect your gender, toy and game ownership and preferences when you provide this information at the same time as your name or other contact or identifying information, or we may combine these data points with your personal information in the future. If you are under the age of 13, only your parent or guardian can provide any personal information to us for purposes of registration and other online activities. See <a href="#parents">Note to Parents</a> below for more information.</p>

	<h4 name="information" id="information">Information We Collect Automatically From You</h4>
	<p>When you access or use our Services, we may also automatically collect information about you. For example, when you visit our websites, we collect information about your computer's operating system, Internet Protocol ("IP") address, access times, browser type and language and the URL of the website you visited before navigating to our Services. If you access our Services via a mobile device, we may also collect your first name or username (depending on which you would like to use), device make and model, mobile carrier, operating system version, language your device is set to, mobile web browser type and version, the country in which you are using your device, and analytics used to collect aggregate data on app usage, downloads, number of users, sessions, frequency of use, retention, territories, and in-game events.</p>


	<p>We do not ask you for, access, or track any location-based information, other than country-level information, from your mobile device at any time while downloading or using our mobile applications or Services.  We will collect your country-specific location so that we are able to provide you the appropriate version of the application.</p>

	<p>We send out push notifications to inform you of new features within the games and inform you when we have updated themes within the application.  If you do not wish to receive these types of communications, you may opt-out when you install the application or turn them off at the device-level.</p>

	<p>To collect this information, we use the technologies identified below:</p>

	<p><b>Cookies:</b>Cookies are small data files stored on your computer or mobile device by a website. Among other things, cookies help us improve our Services and your experience, see which areas and features of our Services are popular, and count visits. In addition, when you view a video on our Services, we may set a "flash cookie" (sometimes called a "flash object") on your computer or device. For more information about cookies, and how to disable them, please see <a href="#choices">"What are my information choices?"</a> below.</p>

	<p><b>Clear GIFs:</b>Clear GIFs, sometimes called "web bugs" or "web beacons," are small electronic images that are placed on a web page or in an email message. We use clear GIFs to monitor user behavior, deliver cookies, collect information, count visits, understand usage and campaign effectiveness and to tell if a recipient has opened and acted upon an email.</p>

	<p><b>Log Files:</b>Log files record website activity on our Services and enable us to gather statistics about our users' browsing habits. These entries help Hasbro determine (among other things) how many and how often users have accessed or used our Services, which pages of our Services they've visited, and other similar data.</p>

	<p>We may associate the information we collect from these technologies with other personal information that you provide for the purposes described in this Policy.</p>

	<h3>Information We Collect from Third Parties</h3>
	<p>We may also obtain information from other sources and combine that with information we collect through our Services. For example, if you create or log into your account through a third-party social networking site, we will have access to certain information from that site, such as your name, account information and friends, in accordance with the authorization procedures determined by such third-party social networking site.</p>

We do not link the information we store within the analytics software to any personal information you submit within the mobile application.</p>

	<h3>Third Party Advertising </h3>
	<p>We allow third parties to serve ads on our Services and we engage third parties to place ads for our products and services on other websites. These third parties place cookies, web beacons and other devices or technologies within the ads. When you click or scroll over any of these ads, these third parties collect information about your use of the Services and other third party websites. The data collected typically includes information such as your IP address, your web browser, web pages viewed, time spent on pages, links clicked and whether you purchased an advertised product. These third parties use this information to deliver advertising and/or content targeted to your interests.

Please discuss this Policy with your children so that they will better understand how to use the Services and the information they may be asked to provide.

	<h3>Children Under 13</h3>
	<h3>Collection and Use of Children's Personal Information</h3>

	<p>Hasbro may collect and store personal information about children under 13 years of age ("children" or "child") if this information is submitted by the parent or guardian in connection with any of our website registrations. To determine who is younger than 13 years old and whether parental consent is required, we ask all prospective registrants to submit their date of birth. Those users that indicate they are less than 13 years of age are taken through a parental consent process. When provided by the parent or guardian, Hasbro may collect and store the following types of personal information about a child under 13: name, email address, parent's or guardian's name, and parent's or guardian's email address. Hasbro may also collect the child's mailing address when necessary to fulfill a transaction, such as sending the winner of a contest or sweepstakes the awarded prize. Hasbro may also collect demographic information about a child such as the child's date of birth, gender, toy and game ownership and other preferences, and combine such information with the child's personal information. Hasbro will only collect this information if it believes that it is voluntarily submitted to us by the child's parent or guardian. For information on how we use cookies and other information collection tools, please see our section entitled <a href="#information">"What information does Hasbro collect?"</a> (above).</p>

	<p>Once collected, a child's registration information may be used to: (a) fulfill a transaction, such as ship products that have been purchased or send the winner of a contest or sweepstakes the awarded prize, or (b) send the child requested promotional materials, including information about new products, contests, features and enhancements, special offers, and other events of interest (e.g., Birthday Club emails). We may also use the information for our internal marketing and demographic studies so that we can improve the products and services we provide our visitors in order to better meet their needs, or as otherwise described in this Policy. For further information, please see our section entitled <a href="#usemyinfo">"How does Hasbro use my information?"</a> (above). </p>

	<p>Please note that we are prohibited from conditioning a child's participation in an activity - like contests - on the child's disclosure of more personal information than is reasonably necessary to participate in the activity. This means that if we don't need a specific piece of information (like the child's phone number) to allow the child to participate in a contest, we simply won't ask for it. To read about the steps Hasbro takes to protect the confidentiality, security, and integrity of children's personal information, please see our section on <a href="#safeguard">"Safeguarding your personal information"</a> (above).</p>

	<h3>Hasbro Contact Information</h3>
	<p>Any registration information that a child provides to our Services is collected by Hasbro. Hasbro's contact information is as follows:</p>

	<h3>Disclosure of Children's Personal Information</h3>
	<p>We follow our standard policy <a href="#share">("With whom does Hasbro share my personal information?" (above))</a> for the disclosure of personal information collected from and about children under 13.</p>

	<h3>Parental Access</h3>
	<p>A parent who has already given Hasbro permission to collect and use his or her child's personal information can, at any time, do the following: (1) review, correct, or have deleted the child's personal information; and/or, (2) discontinue further collection or use of the child's personal information. To do so, please refer to the confirmation email provided to you when you gave consent or contact us at <a href="mailto: hasbroregistration@hasbro.com">hasbroregistration@hasbro.com</a> and be sure to include your child's name and email address, your name and email address, and the name of the site on which your child is registered. To make changes to your child's demographic information, you may also visit the online profile section of one of our Services. We will be happy to honor your request.
