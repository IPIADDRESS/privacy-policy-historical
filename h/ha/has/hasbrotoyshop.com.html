When you provide this information at the same time as you provide certain personal information (e.g., your name or other contact or identifying information), we may combine these data points. Standing alone, these pieces of non-personal information we collect cannot be used to identify or directly contact you. However, when we combine your non-personal information with your personal information, it may become personally identifiable (e.g., first and last name combined with birth date).</p><p><strong>Information We Collect Automatically From You</strong></p><p>When you access or use our Services, we may also automatically collect personal and non-personal information about you. When you visit our websites, the personal information we collect is your computer's Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, which we use for the support of our internal operations. The non-personal information we collect includes your operating system, access times, browser type and language, country, and the URL of the website you visited before navigating to our Services. If you access our Services via a mobile device, we may also collect your device make and model, mobile carrier, operating system version, language your device is set to, mobile web browser type and version, the country in which you are using your device, and non-personal analytics and statistical data regarding use of the websites (e.g., downloads, number of users, sessions, frequency of use, retention, territories, and in-game events).

Among other things, cookies help us improve our Services and your experience, see which areas and features of our Services are popular, and count visits. In addition, when you view a video on our Services, we may set a "flash cookie" (sometimes called a "flash object") on your computer or device. For more information about cookies, and how to disable them, please see <a href="#F">"What are my information choices?"</a> below.</p><p><strong>Clear GIFs: </strong> Clear GIFs, sometimes called "web bugs" or "web beacons," are small electronic images that are placed on a web page or in an email message. We use clear GIFs to monitor user behavior, deliver cookies, collect information, count visits, understand usage and campaign effectiveness, and to tell if a recipient has opened and acted upon an email.</p><p><strong>Log Files: </strong> Log files record website activity on our Services and enable us to gather statistics about our users' browsing habits. These entries help Hasbro determine (among other things) how many and how often users have accessed or used our Services, which pages of our Services they've visited, and other similar data.</p><p>We may associate the information we collect from these technologies with other personal information that you provide for the purposes described in this Policy.</p><p><strong>Information We Collect from Third Parties</strong></p><p>We may also obtain information from other sources and combine that with information we collect through our Services. For example, if you create or log into your account through a third-party social networking site, we may have access to certain information from that site, such as your name, account information and friends, in accordance with the authorization procedures determined by such third-party social networking site.</p><p>For a list of third party partners we have integrated on our site, please click <a href="/en-us/thirdpartieslist" target="_blank">here</a>.

These tools and services place cookies, web beacons and other devices or technologies on our Services to enable them to track traffic data. The data collected typically includes information such as your IP address, your Internet Service Provider, your web browser, the time spent on web pages, the links clicked and the advertisements viewed on those pages. We use this information to improve our Services and your experience, to see which areas and features of our Services are popular, and to count visits.</p><p><strong>Third Party Advertising </strong></p><p>We engage third parties to place ads for our products and services on other websites.

How does Hasbro handle children’s information?</strong></p><p><strong>NOTE TO PARENTS</strong></p><p>Hasbro has developed its Services to be an enjoyable experience for users of all ages, including those under 13 (“Children” or “Child”). Please discuss this Policy with your Children so that they will better understand how to use the Services and the information they may be asked to provide when using the Services.

If you have any questions or comments about this Policy, please contact us using the contact information provided below.</p><p>Hasbro is committed to compliance with the <a href="http://www.esrb.org/privacy/faq.aspx#12">Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”)</a>, a federal law designed to protect kids online.

To determine who is a Child and whether parental consent is required, we ask all prospective registrants submitting personal information to provide us with their date of birth. Depending on the nature of the activity, those users that indicate they are Children are either blocked from the activity or taken through a parental consent process.</p><p>Hasbro may collect and store the following types of personal information about a Child: first and/or last name, email address, parent's or guardian's name, and parent's or guardian's email address. Hasbro may also collect the Child's mailing address and/or telephone number when necessary to respond to an inquiry or fulfill a transaction, such as sending the winner of a contest or sweepstakes the awarded prize. Hasbro may also collect demographic information about a Child such as the Child's date of birth, gender, toy and game ownership and other preferences, and combine such information with the Child's personal information. Please refer to the sections entitled <a href="#B"> "What information is collected from me?" </a> and <a href="#C"> “How does Hasbro use my information?” </a> for further details on the information we collect and the tools we use to collect it.</p><p>When registering an account to play online games, we may collect a username and password from registrants for the purpose of saving that user’s gaming activities (e.g., pets collected in Littlest Pet Shop). Once collected, a Child's registration information may be used to: (a) fulfill a transaction, such as ship products that have been purchased or send the winner of a contest or sweepstakes the awarded prize; or (b) send the Child requested promotional materials, including information about new products, contests, features and enhancements, special offers, and other events of interest. We may also use the information for our internal marketing and demographic studies so that we can improve the products and services we provide our visitors in order to better meet their needs, or as otherwise described in this Policy. Please note that we use aggregated (i.e., non-personal) information for analytics purposes.</p><p>Additionally, we are prohibited by COPPA from conditioning a Child's participation in an activity - like contests - on the Child's disclosure of more personal information than is reasonably necessary to participate in the activity. This means that if we don't need a specific piece of information (like the Child's phone number) to allow the Child to participate in a contest, we simply won't ask for it. To read about the steps Hasbro takes to protect the confidentiality, security, and integrity of all users’ personal information, please see our section on <a href="#G"> "Safeguarding your personal information" </a> .</p><p><strong>Disclosure of Children's Personal Information</strong></p><p>We follow our standard policy <a href="#E"> ("With whom does Hasbro share my personal information?") </a> for the disclosure of personal information collected from and about Children.</p><p><strong>Parental Access</strong></p><p>A parent who has already given Hasbro permission to collect and use his or her Child's personal information can, at any time, do the following: (1) review, correct, or delete the Child's personal information; and/or (2) discontinue further collection or use of the Child's personal information. To do so, please refer to the confirmation email provided to you when you gave consent or contact us at <a href="mailto:%20hasbroregistration@hasbro.com">hasbroregistration@hasbro.com</a>.
