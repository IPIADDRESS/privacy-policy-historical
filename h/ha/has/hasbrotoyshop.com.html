    <p><font size="2">Ir order to give you the most exciting Internet experience possible, Hasbro may request and/or collect information from you on a voluntary basis when you: (1) register with us; (2) shop at any of our online stores (when available); (3) participate in contests, events or promotions; (4) send questions or comments via e-mail to Hasbro customer support; (5) submit your resume to us online; and/or, (6) fill out online surveys. The requested information may include personal information such as your name, e-mail address, telephone number, and home address. For some activities, we may also ask you to create a password and to provide demographic information such as your age, the gender and birthdates of children in your household, and toy and game ownership and preferences.   If demographic information is collected for an activity that also requires personal information, we may combine the demographic information with your personal information.  This allows us to tailor the notices we send you and the content we provide you according to your preferences and interests.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">If you are under the age of 13, you will need your parent or guardian's
    consent before you can provide any personal information to us for purposes of registration and other online activities. Kids, if you are ever unsure about anything you are seeing on this site, ask your parent or guardian for help.

We will use the information you submit to our Web sites to send you advertising or promotional materials, including information about new products, contests, features and enhancements, special offers and other events of interest. We also use your personal information for our internal marketing and demographic studies, so we can constantly improve the products and services we provide you and can better meet your needs. </font></p>

    <p><font size="2">The demographic information (e.g., age and gender) you provide us is collected by Hasbro and may be disclosed in aggregate to third parties. This aggregate demographic information cannot be used to personally identify you or your computer. </font></p>


<u><b></b></u><p><u><b><font size="2">With whom does Hasbro share my personal information?</font></b></u></p>

<p><font size="2">From time to time, Hasbro may employ and share its customers' personal information with entities who use it solely to provide support for the internal operations of the Hasbro website (e.g., online product fulfillment, online registration and email services, or technical support). These entities will not use your personal information for any other purpose, and have agreed to maintain the confidentiality, security, and integrity of the personal information they obtain from us.</font></p>   

<p><font size="2">We may disclose personal information in the good faith belief that we are required to do so by law, including but not limited to disclosure to law enforcement or other government officials in connection with an investigation of fraud, intellectual property infringements, or other activity that is illegal or may expose you or us to legal liability.</font></p>

<p><font size="2">Hasbro does not sell, rent, or otherwise disclose personal information collected from and about its users (including children under 13) to third parties.  However, in the event of a merger, acquisition, reorganization, bankruptcy, or other similar event, Hasbro's customer information may be transferred to Hasbro's successor or assign, if permitted by and done in accordance with applicable law.</font></p>

    <a name="cookies"><u><b></b></u><p><u><b><font size="2">Cookies and Clear GIFs</font></b></u><font size="2"> </font></p></a>
    <p><font size="2">Hasbro uses cookies and clear GIFs to enhance your experience at our Web sites.  These cookies and clear GIFs let us know how many people are coming to individual sites, how frequently, and how they are using the sites, allowing us to make updates to content and improve navigation as appropriate. </font></p>
	
	<p><font size="2">Cookies are pieces of information that we place on your computer to help us accurately understand how many consumers are visiting a particular site,	how often they visit that site, what content they are most interested in, and how they prefer to shop for our products. For example, a cookie will allow 
	us to remember certain things based on your Internet Protocol or "IP" address (an IP address is the string of numbers that identifies each sender or receiver of information that is sent across the Internet), such as your login information, the time and duration of your visits, how you navigated through our content 
	and where you exited a particular site. To save you the time of re-entering your login information every time you come back to our Web sites, Hasbro may link information contained in a cookie to your email address. We do not use cookies to retrieve information from your computer that we did not originally send in a cookie. </font></p>
	
	<p><font size="2">Clear GIFs, sometimes called "Web bugs," are file objects, usually a graphic image such as a transparent one pixel-by-one pixel GIF (Graphics Interchange Format, one of the two most common file formats for images on the Web), 
	that are placed on a Web page or in an e-mail message to monitor user behavior. The GIF tells us the IP address of the computer that fetched our page, the URL of the page the GIF is on, the time the page was viewed, the type of browser used, and can tell us a previously set cookie value. This anonymous information is returned by the clear GIF to Hasbro and we use this information to accurately count visitors across multiple Hasbro sites and understand how they navigate and use our network of sites. 
	Hasbro does not combine information gathered through clear GIFs with your personal information.
	</font></p>
	<u><b></b></u><p><u><b><font size="2">Log Files</font></b></u><font size="2"> </font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Other information passively collected by Hasbro is in the form of logs - files that record website activity and gather statistics about web users' browsing habits.  These entries are generated anonymously, and help Hasbro determine (among other things) how many and how often users have visited our Web sites, which pages they've visited, and other similar data.  We also use the log file entries for our internal marketing and demographic studies, so we can constantly improve the online services we provide you.  Log files are used internally only, and are not associated with any particular user, computer, or browser.
	</font></p>	
	<u><b></b></u><p><u><b><font size="2">Linking to third party sites</font></b></u><font size="2"> </font></p>
    <p><font size="2">To provide relevant information not found on our Web sites and to facilitate online shopping, Hasbro may provide links from our Web sites to third party Web sites.  Hasbro will notify users when they are leaving a Hasbro site and we encourage our users to read third party sites' privacy policies before submitting personal information.</font></p>
<p><font size="2">To provide users with the ability to comparison shop and purchase online, Hasbro has affiliate relationships with some of our retail affiliates.  We may use cookies and/or clear GIFs (described above) to track shopping behavior on our sites and on our retail affiliates' sites.  No personally identifiable information is tied to this shopping behavior.  Tracking this behavior helps us better understand user preferences and plan product listings with our affiliates.
	</font></p>	
    <u><b></b></u><p><u><b><font size="2">Opt-out</font></b></u><font size="2"> </font></p>
    <p><font size="2">If you do not want Hasbro to send you e-mail or regular mail about our products and/or services, you can opt-out at the time of registration or at the time of information collection. If you are receiving e-mails or regular mail and at a later date you choose to opt-out and have your name removed from Hasbro’s e-mailing list, you can do so by using the link included with a Hasbro e-mail or by sending an e-mail to hasbroregistration@hasbro.com.</font></p>

    <p><font size="2">Parental Consent</font></u></p>
    <p><font size="2">Children under 13 may not participate in online activities that require registration without the prior written consent of a parent or legal guardian ("parent"). The consent form must be signed by the child's parent or guardian and returned to Hasbro by fax at (978) 921-1194 or by mailing to Hasbro Internet Registration, 1027 Newport Avenue, Mailstop A906, Pawtucket, RI 02861. Until we receive and process verifiable permission from a parent, a child under 13 will not be allowed to register on our site. Once we have obtained parental consent, we only ask the child for information that is reasonably necessary for the child to participate in our online activities. Please be advised, however, that certain portions of our site will allow children under 13 to submit personal information such as e-mail address without first obtaining their parents' consent.  Such portions of our site operate activities or provide services in a way that does not require prior parental consent under the law.</font></p>
    <u><p><font size="2">Parental Access</font></u></p>
    <p><font size="2">A parent who has given Hasbro permission to collect his or her child&#146;s information can, at any time, do the following: (1) review, correct or remove the child&#146;s personal information; (2) discontinue further use of the child&#146;s information and communication with the child; and/or, (3) revoke his or her earlier consent to collect the child&#146;s information. To do so, please contact us at hasbroregistration@hasbro.com and be sure to include your child's name and e-mail address, your name and e-mail address, and the name of the site at which your child is registered. We will check and update information as appropriate. </font></p>-->

Personal information collected from these visitors is subject to the policies set forth above.</p>

	<u></u><p><u><font size="2"><b>Children Under 13</b></font></u></p>
<b>Collection and Use of Children's Personal Information</b>
<p><font size="2">Hasbro may collect and store personal information about children under 13 ("children" or "child") if it is submitted in connection with our website registration and with the parent's verifiable consent. To determine who is younger than 13 years old and whether parental consent is required, we ask all users who wish to register to submit their date of birth. Those users that indicate they are less than 13 years of age are taken through a parental consent process. If given verifiable permission from a parent, Hasbro may collect and store the following types of personal information about a child under 13: name, email address, mailing address, parent's or guardian's name, and parent's or guardian's email address. Hasbro may also collect demographic information about a child such as the child's date of birth, gender, and other preferences; and, combine such information with the child's personal information. Hasbro will only collect this information if it is voluntarily submitted to us by the child or parent and provided with the parent's verifiable permission. For information on how we use cookies and other information collection tools, please see our section on <a href="#cookies">"Cookies and Clear GIFs"</a> (above).  </font></p><font size="2">

<p><font size="2">Once collected, a child's registration information may be used to: (a) allow the child to participate in activities on our site (e.g., contests); and, (b) allow us to send the child promotional materials, including information about new products, contests, features and enhancements, special offers, and other events of interest. We may also use the information for our internal marketing and demographic studies, so that we can constantly improve the products and services we provide our visitors and to better meet their needs.</font></p><font size="2">

We may also use the information for our internal marketing and demographic studies, so that we can constantly improve the products and services we provide our visitors and to better meet their needs.  </p> --->
 
<p><font size="2">Please note that we are prohibited from conditioning a child's participation in an activity - like contests - on the child's disclosure of more personal information than is reasonably necessary to participate in the activity.  This means that if we don't need a specific piece of information (like the child's phone number) to allow the child to participate in a contest, we simply won't ask for it.
