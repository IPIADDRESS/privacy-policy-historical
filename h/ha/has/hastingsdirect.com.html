<h2 id="section04">4. How we use your information</h2>

<p>So we can provide you with Quotes and policies, and to manage your policy, we must have a legal reason to use your personal data, and this is usually:</p>

<ul class="bullets-secondary">

	<li>For the performance of <a href="#" onclick="return false" data-toggle="tooltip" title="This means using your data where it's needed to carry out a contract that involves you or to take steps at your request before entering into a contract." data-original-title="contractual requirements">contractual requirements</a></li>

We, or our Product providers, don't use your personal data for activities where our interests are overridden by the impact on you (unless we have your consent or are otherwise required or allowed to by law).

	<li>For the performance of a task carried out in the public interest, or</li>
	<li>Under Data Protection Law, it's in the public interest for the insurance industry to process information about your health and criminal convictions where it's needed to provide insurance Quotes and insurance services. We ask you to tell us about your health and unspent criminal convictions so we can assess the risk allocated to your policy, such as the validity and extent of potential claims and to detect and prevent fraud.</li>
	<li>With your consent.</li>
</ul>

<p>Our legitimate interest for processing personal data includes validating the data you've given us against third party sources (both public and private), keeping our records updated, being efficient about how we fulfil our legal and contractual duties, identifying and detecting fraud and using it to build pricing models and risk acceptance criteria. You have a right to object to this processing, as detailed in <a href="#section08">Section 8</a>.</p>
