			</ul>

					<ul>
						<li>Electronic Licensing;</li>
						<li>Continuous Insurance Enforcement;</li>
						<li>Law enforcement (prevention, detection, apprehension and or prosecution of offenders);</li>
						<li>The provision of government services and or other services aimed at reducing the level and incidence of uninsured driving.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>If you are involved in a road traffic accident (either in the UK, the European Economic Area or certain other territories), insurers and or the MIB may search the MID to obtain relevant information.</p>
			<p>Persons (including his or her appointed representatives) pursuing a claim in respect of a road traffic accident (including citizens of other countries) may also obtain relevant information which is held on the MID.

			<p>Your data may be transferred to any country, including countries outside of the European Economic Area, for any of the purposes mentioned above.</p>
			<p>Under the conditions of your policy, you must tell us about any incident (such as an accident or theft) which may or may not give rise to a claim. When you tell us about an incident, we will pass information relating to it to IDSL.</p>

		<h3><a href="#" name="do-we-share-your-personal-information-with-anyone-else">Do we share your personal information with anyone else?</a></h3>
		<div>
			<p>The nature of our online services means that from time to time we may have to share your personal information with third parties. In respect of those third parties with whom we may have to share your personal information, we will take all reasonable endeavours to obtain their agreement to collect and process your personal information (including any sensitive information) on terms equivalent to those of this Privacy Policy, to keep such information strictly confidential and to use it solely for the purpose(s) for which we provide it to them.</p>
			<p>Third parties with whom we may have to share your personal information as outlined above may include:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>insurers who provide and administer the insurance policies you purchase through us and any third party insurance administrators who may provide services to you under the terms of such policies.</li>
				<li>independent contractors or other third parties we may engage from time to time to provide services to us.</li>
				<li>our professional advisers.</li>
				<li>any regulatory or governmental body, or other supervisory body with rules and/or codes of practice to which we are subject, which requests or requires access to it.</li>
				<li>insurers who in turn will give your data to Insurance Database Services Limited (IDSL) in relation to the Claims Underwriting and Exchange Database (CUE) and Motor Insurance Anti-Fraud and Theft Register (MIAFTR).</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Credit checks</p>
			<ul>
				<li>we and/or your insurer may pass information about you to credit reference agencies, where it is necessary to carry out a credit check search on you before we and/or your insurer provide you with any services (including quotations and prior to offering a renewal). You should be aware that the results of those searches will be recorded by the credit reference agencies and that we and/or your insurer and other organisations may use those records in order to help make credit decisions about you, people financially linked to you and others in your household. Often insurance and other financial services providers will only request a credit check once you have decided on a particular supplier.</li>
				<li>every application you submit for a loan or credit card, however, may affect your credit score so you may wish to keep applications to a minimum to protect your credit rating.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Vehicle checks</p>
			<ul>
				<li>we/and or your insurer may run checks against the vehicle you wish to insure with us, via our chosen third 	party HPI. These checks may include searches for outstanding finance, write off information and whether a vehicle has been registered as stolen.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>In addition, in order to prevent and detect fraud we may at any time:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>share personal information about you with other insurers or financial institutions.</li>
				<li>pass on your personal information to the operator of any database or register used to check new information provided against existing information held to prevent fraudulent claims, including the Claims and Underwriting Exchange Register, and the Insurance Hunter Database (a central insurance and claims checking system), which may result in your details being shared with other insurers.</li>
				<li>check your personal information with fraud prevention agencies (please note that where you have provided us with false or inaccurate information and we suspect fraud, we will record this and pass this information on to fraud prevention agencies).</li>
				<li>in respect of motor insurance, pass your personal information on to the Motor Insurance Anti-Fraud and Theft register (please see below for further information on this register).</li>
			</ul>

			<p>The Register is run by the Association of British Insurers. When we deal with your request for an online quote or a policy, and/or when you report a claim to us, relating to motor insurance, we may search the register. When you tell us about an incident, we will pass on information in respect of that to the register.</p>
			<p>Your policy details will be added to the Motor Insurance Database ("MID") which has been established by the Motor Insurers' Information Centre ("MIIC") to help identify uninsured drivers, and may be searched by the police to confirm the identities of those insured to drive a vehicle and/or for preventing and detecting crime. MID data may be used by the DVLA and DVLNI for the purposes of Electronic Vehicle Licensing. It may be used by the MICC, insurers and the Motorists Insurers' Bureau to help identify relevant policy information in the event of an accident. Persons pursuing a claim in respect of a road traffic accident (including citizens of other countries) may also obtain relevant information, which is held in the MID.
