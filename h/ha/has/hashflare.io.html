<h3>FAIR INFORMATION PRACTICES PRINCIPLES</h3>
<p>The Fair Information Practices Principles form the backbone of privacy law in the United States and
the concepts they include have played a significant role in the development of data protection laws
around the globe. Understanding the Fair Information Practice Principles and how they should be
implemented is critical to comply with the various privacy laws that protect personal
information.</p>
<p>In order to be in line with Fair Information Practices we will take the following responsive action,
should a data breach occur:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>We will notify the users via email within 7 business days;</li>
<li>We will notify the users via in site notification within 7 business days;</li>
<li>When the personal data breach is likely to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of
natural persons, without undue delay.
</li>
</ol>
<p>We also agree to the individual redress principle, which requires that individuals have a right to
pursue legally enforceable rights against data collectors and processors who fail to adhere to the
law.</p>
<p>This principle requires not only that individuals have enforceable rights against data users, but
also that individuals have recourse to courts or a government agency to investigate and/or prosecute
non-compliance by data processors.</p>
<h3>SECURITY</h3>
<p>We regularly monitor our systems for possible weaknesses and attacks. The technologies we use are
designed to provide a level of security appropriate to the risk of processing your personal
information. We have proven many times that your data is safe with us.</p>

transmitted to our site; any transmission is at your own risk. Once we have received your
