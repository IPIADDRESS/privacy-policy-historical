You must agree to this Privacy Policy, in its entirety, including our use of cookies in order to: a) access or use our Site; and/or (b) subscribe to any of the Adapp affiliate network management products and/or services (the “Services”) offered on the Site (each, a “Subscription”).  Your acceptance of both this Privacy Policy and our use of cookies on the Site shall be deemed a blanket acceptance of such Privacy Policy and cookie usage for all future attempts to access the Site and/or any Subscription of the Services. If you do not agree to this Privacy Policy in its entirety, you are not authorized to become a subscriber (“Subscriber”) to the Services and/or use the Site in any manner or form whatsoever.</p>
<h2>Privacy Policies Used in Connection with Your Subscription.</h2>
<p>Potential affiliates that sign up for the affiliate program that you establish by and through the Services do so from links on your website or via a Uniform Resource Locator (“URL”) supplied to you via the Services (collectively, “Subscription Website”). Such affiliates’ information is stored on the password-protected portal established by and through the Services. Adapp will not access the affiliate information stored on your password-protected portal unless you specifically request that we do so. You are solely responsible for choosing, and uploading to applicable areas of your Subscription Website, a privacy policy to govern your affiliate program, in which conspicuous written notice is given to internet users who access your Subscription Website (“Subscription Users”) that cookies may be used to collect anonymous traffic data, and for which you receive consent prior to placing cookies on the internet device of any such Subscription User. Adapp is in no way responsible for the collection, storage, use and/or distribution of any data that is submitted by and through your Subscription Website.  </p>
<h2>Personally Identifiable Information.</h2>
<p>We collect personally identifiable information on the Site when you attempt to become a Subscriber or otherwise choose to provide personally identifiable information to us. Personally identifiable information is any information that can be used to identify or locate a particular person or entity.

<h2>Cookies and Web Beacons.</h2>
<p>To enhance your experience with the Site, we use “cookies.”  You cannot use this site or the Services without agreeing to accept the cookies that we use with the Site.  For more specific information on the cookies we use, please see Exhibit A, below.  Cookies are small packets of data stored on your computer. Cookies are used by your computer’s browser to store your preferences. Cookies, by themselves, do not tell us your e-mail address or other personally identifiable information. We use cookies to understand Site usage and to improve the content and offerings on the Site. You may set your browser to warn you that cookies are in use, or to block the use of cookies. Most browsers are set to accept cookies. If your browser is not set to accept cookies, certain uses of the Site may require you to go to your browser user preferences to enable cookies. Each browser is different, so check the “Help” menu of your browser to learn how to change your cookie preferences. If you change computers, operating systems or browsers, or use multiple computers or browsers, you will need to repeat this process for each computer and each browser. To find out more about cookies, please visit <a href="www.cookiecentral.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">www.cookiecentral.com</a>.</p>
<p>We may additionally collect information using Web beacons, which are commonly referred to in the industry as web bugs, pixel tags or Clear GIFs. Web beacons are electronic images that may be used on the Site, in our Services, or in our emails to deliver cookies, count visits and determine if an email has been opened and acted upon. </p>
<p>HasOffers also utilizes a third party retargeting campaign that uses cookies to keep track of your interaction with HasOffers. You may opt-out of such retargeting by clicking here <a href="https://www.adroll.com/about/privacy" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">https://www.adroll.com/about/privacy</a> and following the opt-out procedure.</p>

The aforementioned includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection.</p>
<h2>International Transfer of Data.</h2>
<p>In the process of providing the Services to you, we may transfer information that we collect about you and your Subscription Users and any end users, including personal information, to affiliated entities, or to other third parties across borders and from your country or jurisdiction to other countries or jurisdictions around the world. If you or your End Users are located in the European Union or other regions with laws governing data collection and use that may differ from U.S. law, please note that you are transferring information and permitting the transfer of information, including personal information, to a country and jurisdiction that does not have the same data protection laws as your jurisdiction.

<h2>Security.</h2>
<p>We endeavor to safeguard and protect our users’ information.

Only employees, and third party agents, that need the information to perform a specific job are granted access to personally identifiable information. Our employees are dedicated to ensuring the security and privacy of all user information. Employees not adhering to our written firm policies are subject to disciplinary action. In compliance with applicable federal and state laws, we shall notify you and any applicable regulatory agencies in the event that we learn of an information security breach with respect to your personally identifiable information. You will be notified via e-mail in the event of such a breach. Please be advised that notice may be delayed in order to address the needs of law enforcement, determine the scope of network damage, and to engage in remedial measures.</p>
