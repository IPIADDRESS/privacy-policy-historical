                  Use of   Cookies<br>
                  <br>
                  The Have Fun Teaching Web site use "cookies" to help you   personalize your online experience. A cookie is a text file that is placed on   your hard disk by a Web page server. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or   deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you, and can   only be read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to   you.<br>
                  <br>
                  One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience   feature to save you time. The purpose of a cookie is to tell the Web server that   you have returned to a specific page. For example, if you personalize Have Fun   Teaching pages, or register with Have Fun Teaching site or services, a cookie   helps Have Fun Teaching to recall your specific information on subsequent   visits. This simplifies the process of recording your personal information, such   as billing addresses, shipping addresses, and so on. When you return to the same   Have Fun Teaching Web site, the information you previously provided can be   retrieved, so you can easily use the Have Fun Teaching features that you   customized.<br>
                  <br>
                  You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most Web   browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser   setting to decline cookies if you prefer. If you choose to decline cookies, you   may not be able to fully experience the interactive features of the Have Fun   Teaching services or Web sites you visit.<br>
                  <br>
                  Security of   your Personal Information<br>
                  <br>
                  Have Fun Teaching secures your personal   information from unauthorized access, use or disclosure. Have Fun Teaching   secures the personally identifiable information you provide on computer servers   in a controlled, secure environment, protected from unauthorized access, use or   disclosure. When personal information (such as a credit card number) is   transmitted to other Web sites, it is protected through the use of encryption,   such as the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol.<br>
                  <br>
                  Changes to this Statement<br>
