The website cannot function properly without these cookies and therefore cannot be switched off in our systems. They are usually only set in response to actions made by you which amount to a request for services, such as filling in forms. You can set your browser to block or alert you about these cookies, but some parts of the site will not then work. These cookies do not store any personally identifiable information.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Preferences</strong> – these cookies enable a website to remember information that changes the way the website behaves or looks, like your preferred language or the region that you are in. They may be set by us or by third party providers whose services we have added to our pages. If you do not allow these cookies, then some or all of these services may not function properly.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Statistics</strong> – these cookies allow us to count visits and traffic sources and improve performance of our site. They help us to know which pages are the most and least popular and see how visitors move around the site. All information these cookies collect is aggregated and therefore anonymous. If you do not allow these cookies we will not know when you have visited our site and will not be able to monitor its performance. Statistical/performance cookies do not collect personal data.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Marketing</strong> – these cookies may be set through our site by our advertising partners. They may be used by those companies to build a profile of your interests and show you relevant adverts on other sites. They do not store directly personal information but are based on uniquely identifying your browser and internet device. If you switch these cookies off at browser level you will experience less targeted advertising.&nbsp;</li></ol><p>Our lawful basis for collecting your personal information by using cookies is our 'legitimate interest' to develop and market our services. We believe that users of our websites have reasonable expectations that cookies will be collected and that you can opt out using browser settings.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Third Party Cookies</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>Some of the cookies on our website are not related to Haven and are placed by our advertising partners and other Third Parties. For example, if you visit a web page that contains embedded content, such as a YouTube video, the other website may send cookies to you.

You are able to manage your Facebook related marketing through the settings on your Facebook account.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Google Analytics</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>Our website uses Google Analytics Premium, a web analytics service provided by Google Ireland Limited ('Google').

The information generated by the cookies about your use of the website will be transmitted by your browser to Google on servers in the United States and other countries.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Google Marketing Platform</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>The website uses pixels, or transparent GIF files, to help manage online advertising. These GIF files are provided by our ad management partner, Google Marketing Platform. These files enable Google to recognize a unique cookie on your Web browser, which in turn enables us to learn which advertisements bring users to our website. The cookie was placed by us, or by another advertiser who works with Google. With both cookies and pixels, the information that we collect and share is anonymous and not personally identifiable.
