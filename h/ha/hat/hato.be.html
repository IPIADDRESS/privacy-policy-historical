				<h2>How Hato Responds To Civil Investigations?</h2>
				<p>Hato will not sell or otherwise release a member's identifying information - minimal information reasonably calculated to identify and no more - or usage information to investigators, attorneys, or agencies unless we are directed to do so by a court of competent jurisdiction in the matter. If there is a hearing in court, the member will be notified so they will have an opportunity to contest the surrender of personal information.</p>

				<p>Hato cooperates fully with law enforcement agencies, yet there must still be a subpoena before Hato provides a member's identifying information - minimal information reasonably calculated to identify and no more.

Hato also collects anonymous information about how visitors use our web site; for example, Hato utilizes web analytics software to track, in aggregate, the number of unique views received by the pages of the web site, the domains from which users originate along with many other analytical data points. Through the use of web analytics software, the Hato website may use "cookies" to assist the tracking of how users engage our website.
