<h4>The Information Haporn Collects</h4>
<ul>
  <li><strong>User Provided Information - </strong> You provide   certain personally identifiable information (such as your name and email   address) to Haporn when choosing to participate in various activities on the   Haporn Sites such as uploading videos, posting messages in our forums or in   the video comments section, entering contests or sweepstakes, taking advantage   of promotions, responding to surveys, or subscribing to newsletters or other mailing lists.</li>
  <li><strong>Cookies Information - </strong> When you visit the   Haporn Sites, we may send one or more cookies – a small text file containing   a string of alphanumeric characters – to your computer that uniquely identifies   your browser. Haporn uses both session cookies and persistent cookies. A   persistent cookie remains after you close your browser. Persistent cookies may   be used by your browser on subsequent visits to the site. Persistent cookies can   be removed by following your web browser help file directions. A session cookie   is temporary and disappears after you close your browser. You can reset your web   browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent.   However, some features of the Haporn Sites may not function properly if the   ability to accept cookies is disabled. </li>
  <li><strong>Log File Information - </strong> When you use the   Haporn Sites, our servers automatically record certain information that your   web browser sends whenever you visit any website. These server logs may include   information such as your web request, Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, browser   type, browser language, referring / exit pages and URLs, platform type, number   of clicks, domain names, landing pages, pages viewed and the order of those   pages, the amount of time spent on particular pages, the date and time of your   request, and one or more cookies that may uniquely identify your browser. </li>
</ul>
<br>

<h4>The Way Haporn Uses Information</h4>	
<ul>
	<li>If you submit personally identifiable information to us   through the Haporn Sites, then we use your personal information to operate,   maintain, and provide to you the features and functionality of the Haporn   Sites. </li>
	<li>Any personal information or video content that you   voluntarily disclose online (on discussion boards, in messages and chat areas,   within your public profile page, etc.) becomes publicly available and can be   collected and used by others. Your account name (not your email address) is   displayed to other Users when you upload videos or send messages through the   Haporn Sites and other Users can contact you through messages and comments.   Any videos that you submit to the Haporn Sites may be redistributed through   the internet and other media channels, and may be viewed by the general public. </li>
	<li>We do not use your email address or other personally   identifiable information to send commercial or marketing messages without your   consent or except as part of a specific program or feature for which you will   have the ability to opt-in or opt-out. We may, however, use your email address   without further consent for non-marketing or administrative purposes (such as   notifying you of major Haporn Site changes or for customer service purposes). </li>
	<li>We use both your personally identifiable information and   certain non-personally-identifiable information (such as anonymous User usage   data, cookies, IP addresses, browser type, clickstream data, etc.) to improve   the quality and design of the Haporn Sites and to create new features,   promotions, functionality, and services by storing, tracking, and analyzing User   preferences and trends. </li>
	<li>We use cookies, clear gifs, and log file information to:   (a) remember information so that you will not have to re-enter it during your   visit or the next time you visit the Haporn Sites; (b) provide custom,   personalized content and information; (c) monitor the effectiveness of our   marketing campaigns; (d) monitor aggregate metrics such as total number of   visitors, pages viewed, etc.; and (e) track your entries, submissions, and   status in promotions, sweepstakes, and contests. </li>
</ul>
<br>

<h4>When Haporn Discloses Information</h4>
<ul>
	<li>We provide personally identifiable information and   non-personally-identifiable information to our subsidiaries, affiliated   companies, or other businesses or persons for the purpose of processing such   information on our behalf. We require that these parties agree to process such   information in compliance with our privacy policy, and we use reasonable efforts   to limit their use of such information and to use other appropriate   confidentiality and security measures. </li>
	<li>We do not share your personally identifiable information   (such as name or email address) with other, third-party companies for their   commercial or marketing use without your consent or except as part of a specific   program or feature for which you will have the ability to opt-in or opt-out. </li>
	<li>We do share non-personally-identifiable information (such   as anonymous User usage data, referring / exit pages and URLs, platform types,   number of clicks, etc.) with interested third-parties to assist them in   understanding the usage patterns for certain content, services, advertisements,   promotions, and/or functionality on the Haporn Sites. </li>
	<li>We may release personally identifiable information and/or   non-personally-identifiable information if required to do so by law, or in the   good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with state and federal   laws (such as U.S. Copyright Law) or respond to a court order, subpoena, or   search warrant. </li>
	<li>Haporn also reserves the right to disclose personally   identifiable information and/or non-personally-identifiable information that   Haporn believes, in good faith, is appropriate or necessary to enforce our <a href="/tos">Terms of Use</a>, take precautions against liability, to   investigate and defend itself against any third-party claims or allegations, to   assist government enforcement agencies, to protect the security or integrity of   our web site, and to protect the rights, property, or personal safety of   Haporn, our Users or others.</li>
