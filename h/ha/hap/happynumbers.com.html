A cookie will typically contain the name of the domain from which the cookie has originated, the "lifetime" of the cookie, and a value, usually a randomly generated unique number.

    <h3>6.	How Do We Protect Your Information?</h3>

    <p>
      We want you to feel confident about using Happy Numbers. For that reason, we have implemented reasonable technical and organizational measures designed to secure your information from accidental loss and from unauthorized access, use, alteration or disclosure:
    </p>

    <p>
      - All data is transferred only via HTTPS<br>
      - Production environment is located in a private network and fully isolated from other company systems.<br>
      - We utilize Google Cloud Platform which meets rigorous privacy and compliance standards that test for data safety, privacy, and security: https://cloud.google.com/security/compliance
    </p>

    <p>
      However, the Internet is an open system and we cannot guarantee that unauthorized third parties will never be able to defeat those measures or use your information for improper purposes.
    </p>

    <p>
      Keep the information confidential.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you communicate with us by email, you should note that the secrecy of Internet e-mail is uncertain. By sending sensitive or confidential email messages or information which are not encrypted you accept the risk of such uncertainty and possible lack of confidentiality over the Internet.
    </p>

      - teachers will be notified by email if the teacher account or any related student accounts are affected.<br>
      - the appropriate person in the school or school district who has purchased the valid school-wide or district-wide Happy Numbers access will be notified by phone if the users from this school or school district are affected.
    </p>

    </p>

    <h3>9.	Phishing</h3>

    <p>

    <p>
      You are entitled to see the information held about you. If you wish to do this, please contact us using information at the end of this page. We may require you to provide verification of your identity and to pay an administration fee to provide a copy of the information we hold. Please note that, in certain circumstances, we may withhold access to your information where we have the right to do so under current data protection legislation.
    </p>

    </p>

    <h3>12.	Links to Other Sites</h3>

    <p>
      If any part of Happy Numbers links to other Websites, those Websites do not operate under this Privacy Policy. If you choose to click on another third party link, you will be directed to that third party’s web site. We do not exercise control over third party websites and therefore recommend you to examine the privacy statements posted on these other Web sites to understand their procedures for collecting, using and disclosing Personal Information.
    </p>

    <h3>13.	Our Policy towards Minors</h3>

    <p>
      As stated in our Terms of Service, minors are only allowed to use our Website with their legal representative’s consent. Happy Numbers strictly adheres to the Family Education Rights Protection Act of 1974 (FERPA). FERPA protects the privacy of students' data by specifying how and with whom schools can share information from these records. Happy Numbers has been granted the iKeepSafe California Student Privacy Badge, which validates our compliance with FERPA.
    </p>

    <p>
      We agree that students’ personally identifiable information stays under the direct control of the school. We will not use personally identifiable information in student records to engage in targeted advertising. Nor will we use any information in the student record for any purpose other than those required or specifically permitted by our Privacy Policy and our Terms of Services.
    </p>

    <p>
      If a legal representative becomes aware that his / her represented minor has provided us with Personal Information without their consent, he or she should contact us using information at the end of this page. We will delete such information from our files within 5 working days.
    </p>

    <h3>14.	Changes to this Privacy Policy </h3>

      This policy may be amended from time to time. If we amend the Privacy Policy in any way we will:
    </p>

      - place an updated version on this page, and/or update the Privacy Policy issue date;<br>
      - place an announcement on happynumbers.com for 2 weeks from the Privacy Policy issue date.
    </p>

    <p>
      In case the changes to the Privacy Policy include new or additional data collection, or changes that would lessen the previously noted protections around student data privacy, we will notify in advance the appropriate person in the school or school district who has purchased the valid school-wide or district-wide Happy Numbers access.
    </p>

    <h3>15.	Jurisdiction and Applicable Law</h3>
