Your crossing points are only collected with your <b>consent.</b> In fact, you will be asked to authorize the collection and processing of your location data to allow HAPPN to identify your crossing points with other Members who agreed to be geolocated.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>The crossing points let HAPPN show you profiles of Members you have crossed paths with and who meet your search criteria. These crossing points can be displayed as a news feed or as a Map (Mapping).</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>You are free to <b>withdraw your consent at any time</b> and disable the geolocation option on your smartphone. If you choose to do so, your news feed will no longer be updated, and you will not be able to see who you have crossed paths with after disabling the geolocation option.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>You can also ask that your profile, and therefore your crossing points, are no longer displayed on the Map (Mapping). In this case, you will only appear in the news feed of other Members. Equally, you will no longer be able to see the profiles of Members you have crossed paths with on the Map (Mapping); you will only see these profiles on your news feed. For this, go to the application and click on “My preferences” then go to the bottom of your screen and disable the option “Share my crossing cluster”.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <ul><li><b>Geographical position (private)</b></li></ul> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>HAPPN can, <b>if you expressly agree</b>, access your position, approximately or more precisely depending on the technology you use. After you have given consent, you are free to <b>withdraw your consent at any time</b> and disable your smartphone’s geolocation option. If you choose to do so, your news feed will no longer be updated, and you will not be able to see who you have crossed paths with after disabling the geolocation option. The exact position or the itinerary of a Member is never available to other Members.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <ul><li><b>Text messages and voice messages sent and received (private)</b></li></ul> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Messages are sent and stored on HAPPN’s servers, to provide the Service to allow Members with a Crush to have a conversation. <b>Messages and voice messages are strictly private</b> and only implicate the Members involved. HAPPN’s authorized managers do not exercise any rights to view these conversations. These Messages are not transmitted or communicated to third parties except in cases of judicial requests, and/or in compliance with the applicable legislative or regulatory provisions. Moreover, Messages are strictly private and are not accessible to other Members who are not involved in the conversation, nor to any third party.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <ul><li><b>Search preferences - people whom you would like to cross paths with (age and gender) (private)</b></li></ul> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>The Application lets you set search preferences by age and gender. You can change these settings in the Application and specify the age range and, after agreeing to HAPPN collecting and processing your data, the gender of people you are looking for, so you can be matched exclusively with profiles you crossed paths with and who meet your search criteria. You will then only see the Members you have crossed paths with and who share your search preferences on your news feed.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <ul><li><b>Technical data of the cell phone</b> (IP, mobile ID, application version, advertisement ID, etc.) <b>(private)</b></li></ul> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>We collect information from the devices and equipment you use to access our Services, including server logs, which may contain information such as IP addresses, version of the application, mobile model, mobile ID, language used, operating system, application crashes, and advertisement ID.
