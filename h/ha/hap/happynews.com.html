The information that we collect varies depending upon how you use our  Service.&nbsp; Our account registration  process requires that you provide us with your user name, birthday and email  address, and that you create and provide us with a password.&nbsp; We may also request other information, such  as but not limited to, your actual first and last name, gender, and zip code. <br>
                            <u>Information in Public Areas of the Site</u>.&nbsp; Please keep in mind that whenever you  voluntarily provide information in public areas of the Service, such as the  user profile pages or forums, that information can be viewed and possibly used  by others.&nbsp; We therefore advise visitors  not to disclose contact information, including phone number, email address,  street address or instant messenger address (within these public areas) that  they do not wish to share.&nbsp; We are not  responsible for PII you choose to submit in these public areas.&nbsp; Also, we may highlight content you post to  the public areas of the Service such as reviews or comments, such as by  featuring your content on the Site’s home page.&nbsp; <br>
                            <u>Minors</u>.&nbsp;  We do not knowingly collect or solicit personal information from anyone  under the age of 13 or knowingly allow such persons to register.&nbsp; If you are under 13, do not attempt to  register for our Site or send any information about yourself to us.&nbsp; We recommend that prospective users between  the ages of 13 and 17 ask their parents or other legal guardians for permission  before sending any information about themselves to anyone over the Internet. <br>
                            <u>Cookies</u>.&nbsp;  Like many websites, we use “cookies.”&nbsp;  Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer’s  hard drive through your Web browser to enable our systems to recognize your  browser.&nbsp; We use persistent, identifying  cookies to remember your information and to link your activities to you.&nbsp; While you can take steps to warn off, block  or disable cookies, if you do, the Service may not function and appear as we  have designed it.&nbsp; Nonetheless, if you  want to take these steps, you can do so by following the instructions  associated with your browser.&nbsp; Our  cookies do not collect PII that you provide to us during the registration  process, but they do collect other information such as the following:</p>
                        <ul>
                          <li>the domain name and host from which you access  the Internet and the Internet address of the site from which you direct-linked  to ours;</li>
                          <li>the date and time you access the Site and pages  you visit;</li>
                          <li>your computer's IP address and information about  its operating system, platform and the Web browser type and version you use;</li>
                          <li>demographic and other non-personally  identifiable profile information about you; and</li>
                          <li>information to combat fraud or misuse.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><u>Pixel Tags</u>.&nbsp;  In our emails to you, we may use “pixel tags” to determine if your email  software or service can display html-formatted email (this helps us optimize  the size of our email messages and conserve bandwith).<br>
                            <u>Collection of Information by Third Parties</u>.&nbsp; Our Site may include third-party advertising,  links to other websites, and other content from third party businesses. The  content posted by these parties will be reasonably identifiable as coming from  a third party.&nbsp; We do not provide any PII  to these advertisers, third-party websites, or other businesses, although on  occasion we may mutually share non-personally identifiable (e.g., demographic)  information to facilitate delivery of relevant advertisements.&nbsp; These third-party websites, businesses, and  advertisers, or advertising companies working on their behalf, sometimes use  technology to deliver (or "serve") the advertisements that appear on  our Site directly to your browser. They automatically receive your IP address  when this happens. They may also use cookies, JavaScript, web beacons (also  known as action tags or single-pixel gifs), and other technologies to measure  the effectiveness of their ads and to personalize or optimize advertising  content. We do not have access to or control over cookies or other technologies  that they may use, and the information practices of these advertisers and  third-party websites or businesses are not covered by this Policy but are  covered by their respective privacy policies. Some, but not all, third party  advertising companies provide a mechanism to opt-out of their technology.&nbsp; For more information and an identification of  advertisers that provide an opt-out mechanism, please click the following:  http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
                            <u>Promotions, Sweepstakes, and Contests</u>.&nbsp; From time to time, we may host a promotion,  sweepstake, or contest on the Service.&nbsp;  You may be asked to provide personal information or permit the transfer  to a third party of your personal information in connection with such  promotion, sweepstake or contest.&nbsp; It  will be disclosed at the point of collection or transfer who is collecting or  transferring the information and whose privacy statement applies, and it will  be your choice whether or not you wish to permit such transfer or collection of  personal information to a third party.</p>

                            <u>Opting-Out</u>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A user may, at any time, change, correct,  modify or delete any personal information they may have provided to HappyNews  by sending an e-mail to <a href="http://www.expertvillage.com/info@ExpertVillage.com">info@HappyNews.com</a>.  Users can also unsubscribe from any newsletters or opt out of various  promotional e-mailings at any time by sending an e-mail to the same address, or  by clicking on "unsubscribe" links in each of our newsletters or  emails. We reserve the right to send you customary business communications such  as acceptance/rejection notices regarding content submissions, general system  and administrative messages regarding the Service, address confirmations, and  transactional information about your account, and we may not offer you the  opportunity to opt-out of receiving such communications so long as you are  registered with the Site. <br>
                            <u>Use of Other Information</u>. We use non-PII  about our users for purposes such as measuring the number of visitors to  sections of our Site, making the Service more useful to visitors and delivering  targeted advertising and non-advertising content.&nbsp; We use IP addresses to analyze trends,  administer the Site, track a user’s movement, and gather broad demographic  information for aggregate, non-personally identifiable use.<br>

                            <u>Advertisers and Others</u>.&nbsp; We share non-personally identifiable  information with advertisers, service providers, and other persons with whom we  conduct business.

These third  parties may have access to your PII for use solely in connection with these  authorized business activities.<br>
                            <u>Business Transfer</u>.&nbsp;  As we develop our business, we might sell or buy businesses or their  assets, or engage in acquisitions, mergers, restructurings, changes of control,  or similar transactions.&nbsp; In such  transactions, customer information generally is one of the transferred business  assets, and your PII may be subject to such a transfer.&nbsp; Also, in the unlikely event of a bankruptcy,  customer information may be transferred to a bankruptcy trustee or debtor in  possession and then to a subsequent purchaser.<br>
                            <u>Affiliates</u>.&nbsp; We  may share PII, non-PII and other information with our corporate affiliates.  Some of our most significant affiliates are identified on the website of our  parent company, Demand Media, Inc. http://www.demandmedia.com.&nbsp; <br>

Any use of your  information by our corporate affiliates is subject to this Policy or another  policy no less protective of your privacy.&nbsp;  Conversely, we may obtain information about you from our corporate  affiliates or from your visits to other websites that we or our corporate affiliates  control.&nbsp; <br>

                            <u>Our Security Measures</u>.&nbsp; We take reasonable precautions to protect the  security of our users’ information.&nbsp; We  have physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to help safeguard, prevent  unauthorized access, maintain data security, and correctly use your  information.&nbsp; However, neither people nor  security systems are foolproof, including encryption systems.&nbsp; In addition, people can commit intentional  crimes, make mistakes or fail to follow policies.&nbsp; Therefore, while we use reasonable efforts to  protect your PII, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.&nbsp; If applicable law imposes any  non-disclaimable duty to protect your PII, you agree that intentional  misconduct will be the standards used to measure our compliance with that duty.</p>
