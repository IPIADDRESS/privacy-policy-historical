                            	<p align="left"><strong>WHAT INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT?</strong></p>
                            	<p>HCG Diet Direct believes it is important for you to know what types of information we collect when you use our site.&nbsp; We employ various methods for collecting information.&nbsp;</p>
                            	<p> To begin with, we use “cookies” that are needed to compile aggregate non-personally identifiable information about the visitors to our web site. Personally identifiable information consists of information that is unique to you, such as credit card numbers, bank accounts, social security numbers, home address, email address and the like.&nbsp; This is the type of information that most people consider private and deem the most important to protect from unauthorized access.&nbsp; </p>
                            	<p>Non-personally identifiable information most often consists of things such as your search preferences, the types of products you have bought, how many times you have visited a particular web site, etc.&nbsp; This type of information is usually associated with a particular computer or IP address but not with a particular person.&nbsp;</p>
                            	<p> “Cookies” are pieces of information generated by a Web server and stored in the user's computer, ready for future access.&nbsp; Each time you access our web site; our server finds the relevant cookie on your computer.&nbsp; The information contained within that cookie is then used to customize your experience with our site.&nbsp; The following is a list of the information we collect: <em>(insert all information you collect, names, numbers, social security, email, etc.) </em></p>
                            	<p>&nbsp;</p>
                           	  <p align="left"><strong>WHY DO WE COLLECT THIS INFORMATION?</strong></p>

                            	<p align="left"><strong>HOW IS YOUR INFORMATION PROTECTED?</strong></p>
                            	<p>We use the latest in encryption technology, including 128 bit SSL encryption in the cart section of our shopping cart to ensure that any sensitive information that is sent by you to us via the Internet is protected from unauthorized interception.&nbsp; </p>

                            	<p>All employees that we do hire have to sign a confidentiality agreement that forbids them from disclosing any information to which the employee has access, to other individuals or entities.&nbsp; </p>

                            	<p>When an employee is terminated or is no longer with the company, we change the access codes that the employee used to access any customer accounts.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
