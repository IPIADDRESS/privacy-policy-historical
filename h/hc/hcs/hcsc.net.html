          <p>At  Health Care Service Corporation, a Mutual Legal Reserve Company (HCSC), we know  how important your privacy is to you, and it is very important to us as well.  Whether you are a current customer or just visiting our Web site, we are committed  to attempting to protect the information you provide, just as we protect it  when you provide it to us over the phone, in person or through the mail. <br>
              <br>
            We value your relationship with us, so we want you to understand our privacy  objectives for our Web site, and how and why we collect, use and disclose the  personal information about you on our Web sites. </p>
          <hr size="2" width="100%" align="center">
          <p><strong>Personal Information We    Collect and Use at This Web Site</strong></p>
          <p>We do not collect any personal information about    you at our Web sites unless you choose to provide it to us voluntarily. We    define “personal information” as information that is unique to you and might    include your phone number, name, age, address or Social Security Number. If    you encounter a screen or page that requests information you do not want to    share with us, do not enter the information and do not proceed with that    screen or page.<br>
              <br>
            If you do provide us with personal information, we will restrict its use to    the purposes expressed where it was collected.

          <p>A cookie is a piece of    information which a Web server may place on your computer when you visit a    Web site. Cookies are commonly used by Web sites to improve the user    experience and have not been known to transmit computer viruses or otherwise    harm your computer. Many cookies last only through a single Web site session,    or visit. Others may have an expiration date, or may remain on your computer    until you delete them.<br>
              <br>
            We may use cookies for a number of purposes - for example, to maintain    continuity during a user session, to gather data about the usage of our Web    site for research and other purposes, to store your preferences for certain    kinds of information and marketing offers, or to store a user name or    encrypted identification number so that you do not have to provide this    information every time you return to our Web site. <br>
  <br>
            Our cookies will track only your activity relating to your online activity on    this Web site, and will not track your other Internet activity. Our cookies    do not gather personally identifiable information. <br>
  <br>
            You can decide if and how your computer will accept a cookie by configuring    your preferences or options in your browser. However, if you choose to reject    cookies, you may not be able to use certain online products, services or    features on our Web site. <br>
  <br>
            We may occasionally use other companies to set cookies on our Web sites and    gather cookie information for us. In some cases we may also use another    company to operate Web servers for our Web site. We use the cookie    information gathered by these companies in the same manner as stated above. <br>
  <br>
            In addition to the information we collect from cookies, we also obtain    information which you provide to us online - for example, when you submit an    application or otherwise communicate with us. In some cases, we retain both    the cookie information and/or the information you provide to us online - for    example, to complete a transaction you requested or to keep historical    records of your past transactions. <br>

            You may have the opportunity to provide information to us through online    surveys and forms. We use this information to better understand health care    needs and to provide quality products, services and other opportunities.
