<h2>How We Secure Information</h2>
<p>
We implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect the information we collect and store.

</p>
<p>
If you would prefer to block cookies or other tracking technologies, most browsers and mobile devices all you to change your settings so as to notify you when you receive cookies or other tracking technologies are being used, and to choose whether or not to accept/allow it. Most browsers also allow you to disable or delete existing cookies or to automatically reject future cookies. You may also use third party tools, including browser plug-ins, to control your cookie preferences.
</p>

Our Site and Service are not directed to children under the age of 13 and we do not knowingly collect Personal Information from children under the age of 13.

</p>
<h2>Changes to Privacy Policy</h2>
<p>
Any information that we collect is subject to the Privacy Policy in effect at the time such information is collected. We may, however, revise the Privacy Policy from time to time. If a revision is material, as determined solely by us, we will notify you, for example via email. The current version will always be posted to our Privacy Policy page.
