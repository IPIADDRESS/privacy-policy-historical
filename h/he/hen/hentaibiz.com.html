    <td><div align="justify">We have created this Privacy Policy in order to demonstrate 
        our firm commitment to privacy. This Privacy Policy explains our practices 
        with respect to the collection, use, and disclosure of personal and non-personal 
        information provided by visitors to our Web site. By using this site, 
        you signify your assent to these our privacy practices and the terms and 
        conditions of our Web site. </div>
      <p align="justify">If this policy is not agreeable to you, please do not 
        use this site.</p>
      <p align="justify"><strong>WHAT TYPE INFORMATION IS COLLECTED?</strong></p>
      <p align="justify"><strong><em>Personal Information</em></strong><br>
        We only collect personal information from visitors to our Web site when 
        they voluntarily provide it to us by completing our registration form 
        or electing to use one of our services. We may require visitors to provide 
        us with information including, but not limited to, their name, physical 
        address, email address, birth date, username and password. </p>
      <p align="justify"><strong><em>Non-Personal Information</em></strong><br>
        When visitors access our Web site, certain non-personal information may 
        be collected from them including, but not limited to, their browser type 
        (e.g., Netscape or Internet Explorer), operating system (e.g., Windows 
        or Macintosh), IP address, and the domain name from which they accessed 
        the site (e.g., lycos.com). In addition, we may collect information about 
        visitors' browsing behavior, such as the date and time they visit the 
        Web site, the areas or pages of our Web site that they visit, the amount 
        of time spent viewing the site, the number of times the visitor returns 
        to the site, and click-stream data. We use transparent tracking pixels 
        to determine the number of Web site visitors that have been sent to us 
        through our affiliate network. We do not track any information about visitors 
        once they leave our site. We may use cookies (small text files that are 
        stored on visitors computers when they access our Web site) to collect 
        this information. Information collected through cookies may be combined 
        with visitors' personal information. We may also allow unaffiliated third 
        parties, such as advertisers, to serve cookies to visitors of our Web 
        site. Visitors are always free to decline cookies, but in doing so they 
        may not be able to use certain features on our Web site. The "help" 
        segment of the toolbar on most browsers explains how to configure a browser 
        to not accept new cookies, how to have the browser inform a user when 
        they receive a new cookie, and how to erase cookies from their hard drives. 
      </p>
      <p align="justify"><strong>IN WHAT WAY DO WE USE YOUR PERSONAL AND NON-PERSONAL 
        INFORMATION?</strong><br>
        Our goal in collecting personal information is to provide visitors with 
        the most personalized Web experience possible and our advertisers with 
        an efficient means to reach the right audience. By knowing a little about 
        our visitors, we are able to deliver more relevant content and advertisements, 
        and provide better services. We may use information collected from visitors 
        to our Web site for any of the following purposes: (1) to send visitors 
        information and promotional materials about our company, (2) to send visitors 
        information and promotional materials from our marketing partners and 
        third parties (such as advertisers on our Web site), (3) to deliver targeted 
        display advertisements and offers by email (by matching criteria provided 
        by our advertisers with information collected from our visitors), (4) 
        to contact visitors to our Web site when necessary, (5) to allow one-click 
        purchases or access to proprietary content by pre-populating fields, within 
        registration or other transaction screens, with a visitor's name, billing 
        address, and credit or charge card information (among other things), as 
        provided by that visitor, (6) to help diagnose problems with our server, 
        (7) to administer our Web site, (8) to conduct internal reviews of our 
        site (e.g., to determine the number of visitors to the site), (9) to help 
        us better understand visitors' use of our site, and (10) to protect the 
        security or integrity of our site. Non-personal information will be used 
        for purposes of conducting internal reviews of the site, monitoring the 
        site, and providing a greater online experience for our visitors. </p>
      <p align="justify"><strong>DO WE DISCLOSE YOUR INFORMATION?</strong><br>
        We may transfer or disclose information collected from visitors to our 
        Web site to our employees and independent contractors, to our parent company, 
        subsidiaries and affiliates, and to our consultants, other business associates, 
        and suppliers, if the disclosure will enable that party to perform a business, 
        professional, or technical support function for us, or if required to 
        do so by law. We DO NOT disclose information we collect from our site 
        visitors to other marketing and business companies. We DO NOT share, rent, 
        sell, or transfer any personal information (including financial information) 
        provided by our visitors to third parties.</p>
      <p align="justify">During the registration process, and at certain times 
        during any member user session, we may present additional offers from 
        third party service providers. Our third party service providers have 
        their own terms and conditions and privacy policies. We suggest that visitors 
        access these third party sites and review their terms and conditions and 
        privacy policies before "subscribing" to any third party offer.</p>
      <p align="justify"><strong>WHAT SECURITY MEASURES DO WE TAKE TO PROTECT 
        YOUR DATA?</strong><br>
        To help prevent unauthorized access, maintain data integrity, and ensure 
        the appropriate use of information, we have put in place certain physical, 
        electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information 
        we collect from visitors to our Web site. We use SSL (Secure Socket Layer) 
        technology to protect any credit card information you provide us. We allow 
        access to personal information only to persons and entities engaging in 
        activities provided for by this Privacy Policy. Visitors should consider 
        any communication that they transmit to us (such as data, questions or 
        answers, comments, suggestions, or communications submitted to a chat 
        room) to be non-confidential. We will not be liable or responsible if 
        information that belongs to a visitor is intercepted and used by an unintended 
        recipient. </p>
      <p align="justify"><strong>WE PROTECT CHILDREN'S PRIVACY</strong><br>
        Protecting the privacy of children is VERY important to us. For that reason 
        we do not structure any part of our site to attract anyone under the age 
        of 18 (21 in some areas) and we do not allow anyone under the age of 18 
        (21 in some areas) to register and become a member of our site. </p>
      <p align="justify"><strong>CORPORATE CHANGES</strong><br>
        In the event of a merger, acquisition, asset or stock sale, bankruptcy, 
        or other asset transfer (regardless of legal formality), any of our assets 
        may be transferred to a third party, including personal information collected 
        from visitors to our Web site. </p>
      <p align="justify"><strong>ACCEPTANCE OF PRIVACY TERMS &amp; CONDITIONS</strong><br>
        By visiting this Web site, you are agreeing to the practices described 
        in this Privacy Policy. By visiting this site, you also accept, without 
        limitation or qualification, all terms and conditions concerning the use 
        of this site. We may at any time revise these terms and conditions. You 
        are bound by any such revisions and should therefore periodically visit 
        this page to review the then-current terms and conditions to which you 
        are bound. To the extent that any of the third-party sites accessible 
        through our Web site (such as our advertisers) have different privacy 
        practices from those stated in this Privacy Policy, those third-party 
        privacy practices govern the collection and use of information you provide 
        when visiting those sites. We are not responsible for the policies, content, 
        and practices of other companies. </p>
      <p align="justify"><strong>CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY</strong><br>
        There may be times when we need to change the terms of this Privacy Policy. 
        To ensure that you are aware of our current privacy practices, please 
        bookmark this page and check back often. </p>
