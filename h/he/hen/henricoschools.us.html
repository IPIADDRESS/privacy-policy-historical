      <p align="justify" class="style1">It is the policy of Henrico County Public Schools that personal information about citizens will be collected only to the extent necessary to provide the service or the benefit desired by the user; that only appropriate information will be collected; that the user shall understand the reason the information is collected and be able to examine their personal record.</p>
      <p align="justify" class="style1">The HCPS website <strong>uses</strong> Google Analytics which helps website owners measure how users interact with website content. As a user navigates between web pages, Google Analytics provides website owners JavaScript tags (libraries) to record information about the page a user has seen, for example the URL of the page. The Google Analytics JavaScript libraries use <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_cookie" target="_blank">HTTP Cookies</a>&nbsp;to "remember" what a user has done on previous pages / interactions with the website.<br>
