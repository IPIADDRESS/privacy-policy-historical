The exchanged shoes arrived quickly and I am very pleased with them. Good work! June 07</i>Connie H. Winston-Salem, NC',' <i>During the past two weeks I have purchased Socks and a pair of PW Minor LPXX Shoes.  When I spoke with your Customer Service Personnel, I received Professional and High Quality Service.  You have gained a new Customer, and all my shoes will be purchased from Healthy Feet Store.  June 07</i> Don, Pahrump, NV','<i>I didn&#96;t expect this kind of customer service.I appreciate the fact you took the time to track my order,and call me to let me know the ship date.I received the shoes today ,thanks. June 07</i> Steve, Santa Maria, CA.','<I>Thank you for your help in ordering my sandals.  I wore them on a sightseeing walking tour and they were the most comfortable shoes I&#96;ve ever worn! Then I went to a famous shoe store in Pittsburgh called "Littles", and to my surprize and delight there was a rep there from NAOT handing outinfo and free hand cream samples!  Thanks again! May 07</I> Pamela, Pittsburgh, Pa.','<i> I am sorry this took so long to get back to you.  Back in December of &#96;05 I bought some insoles and you threw in some (Powerstep)support insoles as well.  I was preparing to go to Iraq for my 3rd tour.  I was part of a Military Transition Team responsible for training and operating with the 1st Battalion, 3rd Brigade, 1st Iraqi Division near Khalidiyah, Iraq in the Al Anbar Province.  It was an experience that I will never forget.  Your insoles made all the difference in the world.  They kept me on my feet, sometimes for days at a time.  Thanks for providing me with such a great tool, I would recommend them to anyone who plans to spend a lot of time on their feet.  If they can hold up for a 7 month tour in Iraq, they can hold up anywhere!  Semper Fidelis. May 07</i> Capt Chris Cox','<i> Thank you so much for your amazing customer service. I had no idea that I could get help online picking out the right shoes for me, plus you understood about my foot problems! I rate your company an A+++++!</i> Mary Anne, Fort Worth, TX','<i>The service was excellent and I got my order delivered sooner than I had expected.

I am a new person because of your help and expertise. Thank you!</i> Mike A., Las Vegas, NV','<i>I just wanted to let you know that the shoes you recommeneded for my son are great. He has struggled fitting in with the other kids because he has to wear AFO braces. I was so happy to find a site that carried a selection of normal looking shoes for him. He is happy and I am happy.
