My shoes were ordered on Friday 11/30/07, on Tuesday 12/04/07, they were shipped, on Friday 12/07/07, they arrived.  And they are the best shoes I have ever put on my feet.  I can not believe how good they feel.  I have started having pain in both feet and these shoes are really helping to ease that pain.  So that you so much and I will order all my shoes from your company.  Again thank you for your very speedy service and the great new shoes.</b> Valerie T. Westminster, CO','<i>People are generally quick to complain when things do not go exactly as they wanted, but do not usually take a moment to thank folks when things go well.  I am, therefore, making sure that a "Thank You" is expressed from me for what I consider to be exceptional customer service. In my dealings with your firm, I have had nothing but rapid responses to questions, rapid receipt of return authorizations, friendly service and excellent advice.  Despite the fact that I have sent back shoes more than once, I have never discerned a bit of animosity or frustration on the part of you folks.  Additionally, your  crediting of my credit card was both quick and accurate. Purchasing shoes is not something one does frequently, but be assured that the next time I find myself needing a new pair of footwear, you folks are on top of my list. My thanks to you, Helen, and your entire staff. Please see that your supervisor has an opportunity to see this note. MARVIN W. Bellevue, Nebraska 68005  November 07</i>','<i> These (Pedors)shoes are unexcelled for people with painful feet from any cause whatsoever. I am grateful for having found them. Sincerely, Robert S. MD, Mill Creek, Wa. October 07  </i>','<i>I have ordered before and I love your shoes - I can now walk without pain.  August 07</i> Jean J. Savoy, Illinois','<i>Your Customer satisfaction personal may be interested in knowing that the size 14EEEE (4E) in the new Thunder shoe was too narrow to put on easily-----but, the new Force 14EEEE (4E) fit perfectly and I am very pleased with both the shoe and your customer service. All of my future purchases will be through your HEALTHYFEETSTORE. Thank You Again,July 07</i> Fred P.

Then I went to a famous shoe store in Pittsburgh called "Littles", and to my surprize and delight there was a rep there from NAOT handing outinfo and free hand cream samples!  Thanks again! May 07</I> Pamela, Pittsburgh, Pa.','<i> I am sorry this took so long to get back to you.  Back in December of &#96;05 I bought some insoles and you threw in some (Powerstep)support insoles as well.  I was preparing to go to Iraq for my 3rd tour.  I was part of a Military Transition Team responsible for training and operating with the 1st Battalion, 3rd Brigade, 1st Iraqi Division near Khalidiyah, Iraq in the Al Anbar Province.  It was an experience that I will never forget.  Your insoles made all the difference in the world.  They kept me on my feet, sometimes for days at a time.  Thanks for providing me with such a great tool, I would recommend them to anyone who plans to spend a lot of time on their feet.  If they can hold up for a 7 month tour in Iraq, they can hold up anywhere!  Semper Fidelis. May 07</i> Capt Chris Cox','<i> Thank you so much for your amazing customer service. I had no idea that I could get help online picking out the right shoes for me, plus you understood about my foot problems! I rate your company an A+++++!</i> Mary Anne, Fort Worth, TX','<i>The service was excellent and I got my order delivered sooner than I had expected.

Thank you for not sending out email after email with junk. Hope your site brings you lots of business...I will refer my friends.</i> Wayne H., Massilon, OH','<i>Very Fast, Very Easy to navigate, Very good experience, I would buy from HFS.com again and will recommend to friends.</i> Son S. - Roseville, California','<i> The Powerstep Arch Supports have changed my life. I have tried everything, and I was so skeptical until your girl that answers the phone told me to try these. I couldn&#96;t believe that something so inexpensive could help so much! I am a new person because of your help and expertise. Thank you!</i> Mike A., Las Vegas, NV','<i>I just wanted to let you know that the shoes you recommeneded for my son are great. He has struggled fitting in with the other kids because he has to wear AFO braces. I was so happy to find a site that carried a selection of normal looking shoes for him. He is happy and I am happy.
