We use SSL encryption to protect your personal information online, and we also take several steps to protect your personal information in our facilities. Access to your personal information is restricted. Only employees who need access to your personal information to perform a specific job are granted access to your personal information. Finally, we rely on third-party service providers for the physical security of some of our computer hardware. We believe that their security procedures are adequate. For example, when you visit our Site, you access servers that are kept in a secure physical environment, behind a locked cage and an electronic firewall. </font><p><font color="#000000">While we use industry-standard precautions to safeguard your personal information, we cannot guarantee complete security. 100% complete security does not presently exist anywhere online or offline. </font></p><p><font color="#000000"><strong>OPT OUT/CORRECTIONS</strong> Upon your request, we will (a) correct or update your personal information; (b) stop sending emails to your email address; and/or (c) disable your account to prevent any future purchases through that account. You can make these requests by telephoning, or emailing your request to Healthwarehouse.com's Customer Service Department 1-866-885-0508 or </font><a href="mailto:support@healthwarehouse.com"><font color="#000000">support@healthwarehouse.com</font></a><font color="#000000">. Please do not email your credit-card number. </font></p><p><font color="#000000"><strong>OFFLINE COLLECTION, USE &amp; DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION</strong> As you might expect from Healthwarehouse.com, the majority of information that we collect is obtained through our Site, and this Privacy Policy applies only to that online collection of personal information. We also collect information offline, where we also try to protect the privacy of you personal information. One example involves someone calling us to place an order or to ask questions. When someone calls, we will ask only for the personal information we need in order to place the order or to answer the question. When we need to store information (such as order information), we will enter it into our database through SSL encryption. (See the Data Security section above for more information). Another example involves faxes. If you fax something to us, we will act upon the fax and then either store it a locked repository or we will shred the fax if there is no need to retain the information. There are other ways we could learn of personal information offline (for example, we suppose someone could send us a letter including some return address information), and this Policy doesn't discuss or try to predict all of those methods or uses. As we mentioned, we primarily sell merchandise, not information, and we will try to treat offline collection, uses, and disclosures consistently with our relevant online practices. </font></p><p><font color="#000000"><strong>UPDATES TO THIS POLICY</strong> If we change or update this Privacy Policy, we will post changes and updates on this Site so that you will always be aware of what information we collect, use and disclose. We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy from time to time so you will know if the Privacy Policy has been changed or updated. If you have any questions about the Privacy Policy, please contact us at 1-866-885-0508 or </font><a href="mailto:support@healthwarehouse.com"><font color="#000000">support@healthwarehouse.com</font></a><font color="#000000">.
