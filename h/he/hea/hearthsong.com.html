				When you visit the HearthSong Online Store, our server automatically
				recognizes the address of your Internet Service Provider (ISP) and,
				in some cases, your domain name. We cannot identify you individually
				from your screen name if you are using America Online or one of the
				other major online services. Our server also identifies your browser,
				your browser version, the operating system you are using, the pages you
				visit in the HearthSong Online Store and the Uniform Resource Locator
				(URL) of where you were on the Internet if you clicked a link to
				www.hearthsong.com.

				<br>
				We intend to continue improving the content and function of the HearthSong
				Online Store. For this reason, we gather the information mentioned above
				so that we can provide content of interest to you and a site that functions
				correctly on your computer system.  
				<br>
				<br>
				If you place an order or request a catalog from us online, and do not
				indicate otherwise, we will add your e-mail address to the list of people
				who receive e-mail notification of special offers and other communications
				from us from time to time. We will also keep your e-mail address on file
				so we can contact you about your order. If you send e-mail to us, we will
				ask you, in our reply, if you would like to be added to our e-mail address
				list. You will not be added to our e-mail address list without your
				permission. We may, in the future, share your e-mail address with other
				businesses or organizations that have products or services we feel may
				be of interest to you. 
				<br>
				<br>
				If you should change your mind and decide that you do not wish to receive
				e-mail from us or do not wish us to share your e-mail address with others,
				you may let us know by e-mail, send us a letter or give us a call.
				<br>
				<br>
				If you give us your telephone number online, we may call you about your 
				order. If you would rather we not call you and communicate by e-mail only, 
				please let us know by <a href="comments.cfm">E-Mail</a>, send us a letter or give us a call. We will
				make every effort to comply with your request. 
				<br>
				<br>
				Other information that may be requested of you includes: your name, address, 
				city, state, zip code, the name(s) and full address(es) of your recipients 
				and their phone number, also at times a gift message and your requested 
				delivery date. Also, we collect your comments so we can better serve you in 
				the future. Of course for orders, your items, the quantity of each item and
				bank card number with its expiration date is collected. 
				<br>
				<br>
				We are committed to data security and the accuracy of our information (see 
				Our <a href="security.cfm">Security Policy</a>) received from domestic and foreign visitors to our 
				site. Likewise, your recipient(s)' information is never shared with third 
				parties. In addition, none of your information is merged with outside data 
				for marketing purposes. 
				<br>
				<br>
				We do ask that you please review the acknowledgment of your request that you 
				will receive to insure the accuracy of the information submitted to us. As 
				noted earlier, your information is never shared with any third party when 
				you let us know by <a href="comments.cfm">E-Mail</a>, letter, phone or the do not solicit option on 
				each location where we are collecting information. The only exception in 
				response to your specific request for merchandise or information. It should 
				be noted that if you do allow us to share information, the other companies 
				may be governed by different privacy policies.
				<br>
				<br>
				If you would like to receive a copy of your personal information on file at 
				HearthSong, please <a href="comments.cfm">E-Mail</a> us with the following information: E-mail 
				address you use for correspondence with HearthSong, Last Name, Zip 
				code and your Account/Order number if available. After we receive your 
				E-mail we will process your request and advise you on how to make any 
				corrections.

				policies or practices, we would like to know what they are so we 
				can address them.&nbsp; Please contact us at 1-800-638-5279.  We also participate 
				in the Council of Better Business Bureaus' BBBOnLine Privacy Program, and comply
