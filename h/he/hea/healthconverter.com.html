      <p><strong>This page sets forth the  privacy policies and practices of the Health Converter Ad Agency and  its affiliated companies within the HealthConverter Marketing Network ("HealthConverter  Network" "HealthConverter" "we" or "us") and  includes the following principal Internet sites: </strong><br>
        </p>
      <p><strong>HealthConverter.com</strong><br>
        Please read this privacy policy carefully since by visiting  a HealthConverter Network site and sharing information with one our companies  you agree to be bound by the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy unless  you offer different terms which are accepted by HealthConverter, Inc. in  writing. For more information about the HealthConverter Network and other HealthConverter  companies please visit &nbsp;www.HealthConverter.com.</p>
<p>        STATEMENT OF RESPONSIBLE ONLINE MARKETING<br>
The HealthConverter Network's information usage practices are based on two  beliefs: first, that protecting user privacy is essential to the growth and  prosperity of the Internet; second, that a personalized web experience can  provide significant benefits to Internet end users if done properly. In  accordance with these beliefs, the HealthConverter Network creates results for  advertisers and publishers in revolutionary ways without compromising  individual privacy.</p>
      <h3 class="common"><strong>Consumer Privacy | Client Privacy</strong></h3>
      <p><strong>CONSUMER PRIVACY</strong> </p>
      <p><strong>I. INFORMATION WE COLLECT:  INDIVIDUAL INTERNET CONSUMERS </strong> </p>
      <p><strong>A. Personally Identifiable  Information (PII).</strong> <br>
The HealthConverter Network sites are designed to promote  and facilitate the business of the HealthConverter companies with advertisers  and marketers. These sites are not directed towards individual Internet  consumers nor do they seek any PII from such consumers. PII may be collected  should a consumer contact a HealthConverter company on his/her own initiative  or respond to a HealthConverter advertisement and provide any PII. Under no  circumstances does the HealthConverter Network request or collect sensitive PII  such as an Internet user's medical/health conditions; racial or ethnic origin;  political, religious or philosophical beliefs or affiliations; trade union  membership or sex life.</p>
      <p><strong>B. Non-Personally Identifiable  Information (Non-PII). </strong> <br>
        When a consumer responds to or views an Internet  advertisement served by a HealthConverter company (such as through third-party  Web sites or email solicitation) or visits a HealthConverter Network site, we  send a cookie and/or gif file ("Cookies") to assign an anonymous,  unique identifier to the end user's Internet browser. Cookies are small data  files commonly used on the Internet to help optimize and personalize the  Internet end user experience and identify repeat visitors to Web sites.</p>
      <p>        The function of these Cookies is to provide HealthConverter  with information for the purpose of paying third-parties commissions when an  Internet user clicks on a link, creates a lead, or makes a purchase on an  advertiser's Web site; and also to optimize and personalize the Internet user's  experience. If the Internet user re-visits the advertiser's site directly, HealthConverter  is able to continue to track the user's activities on the advertiser's site and  reward the third-party Web site that referred the user. We reserve the right to  retain all ad delivery and reporting data as long as may be reasonably  necessary for accounting and audit purposes.<br>
        Like most standard Web site servers, we use log files to  collect Internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, Internet service  provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, platform type, and date/time stamp. We  use the information to analyze site usage, administer the site, understand  usage and navigation trends in aggregate, and determine the relevance of  content. This information, however, is not linked to any personally  identifiable information.<br>
        We also may use Internet browsing and online purchase data  associated with an anonymous identifier to develop a predictive statistical  user profile of the end user's needs and interests. HealthConverter does not  use Cookies or log files to collect end users' names, physical addresses, email  addresses, phone numbers, credit card numbers, social security numbers, or any  other information which can be used to identify a specific person. We may match  the IP address and user profile with email address data obtained separately in  order to better target campaigns to meet user's interests, but will not share  this information with third parties.</p>
      <p>        For improved audience targeting, some HealthConverter  Network sites use marketing technology that allows advertisers to add  non-personally-identifying demographic information, such as age, gender, area  code, or ZIP code, to the non-identifiable profile data. Thus, there is no  direct connection between an end user's online choices and his or her personal  identity.</p>
      <p>        In some cases, HealthConverter receives and records partial  email addresses of Internet users, only in circumstances where the user  voluntarily provided its identity and contact information through the  Advertiser's site or third-party marketer's site. This partial email address  does not enable HealthConverter to personally identify an Internet User.</p>
      <p><strong>II. INFORMATION SHARING </strong> </p>
      <p>        The HealthConverter Network may make any PII provided in  responding to an advertisement available to the company sponsoring the  advertisement, as well as to other trusted third parties in accordance with the  terms of this privacy policy. As a result, you may receive information on  additional products, services and offers that may be of interest to you.</p>
      <p>        The HealthConverter Network and/or our marketing partners  may enhance and/or merge PII about consumers who have opted-in to receive  marketing communications with commercially-available third party data collected  from other sources in an effort to ensure that the messages being sent to the  consumer in online and/or offline marketing programs are relevant to their  interests. In the event we enhance and/or merge such personally identifiable  information with data collected from other sources, we will take reasonable  steps to maintain the integrity and quality of that information.<br>
        The HealthConverter Network may share PII (including  information that has been enhanced with information from other sources) with  advertisers, third party marketers, our affiliated entities for their online  and/or offline marketing programs or in connection with the sale, merger,  consolidation, change in control, transfer of substantial asset, reorganization  or liquidation of any of the HealthConverter Network companies. While HealthConverter  strongly encourages clients and partners to adopt responsible approaches to  online marketing, HealthConverter is not responsible for the information  practices of clients or their partners. The collection, use, and disclosure of  information by clients and partners are subject to their respective privacy  policies, which may differ from HealthConverter's policy.</p>
      <p>        The HealthConverter Network may release account and any  other personal information when we believe release is appropriate to respond to  a subpoena or otherwise comply with the law; enforce or apply our Terms and  Conditions and other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of HealthConverter  or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and  organizations for fraud protection.</p>
      <p><strong>III. CONSUMER CHOICE AND  ACCESS </strong> </p>
      <p><strong>A. Opting Out. </strong> <br>
        Some HealthConverter Cookies have an "opt-out"  option. This process does not remove the HealthConverter Cookie from your  system; it simply replaces it with an opt-out Cookie that does not contain any  unique identifiers. If this site provides such a process it is detailed below.<br>
        Some of HealthConverter's Cookies do not have an  "opt-out" option, yet you still have the option of blocking the use  of Cookies by changing a setting in your Internet browser. Please see your  browser supplier's Web site for details on how to do this.</p>
      <p>        This site does not maintain a process for an individual  consumer to opt-out of a HealthConverter ad serving Cookie. </p>
      <p>        <strong>B. Accessing Consumer Information. </strong><br>
        Because they are not directed towards individual Internet users, most HealthConverter  Network sites do not maintain a process for an individual consumer to review  and/or request changes to any PII collected.</p>
      <p>        Except as provided below, this site does not maintain a  process for an individual consumer to access his/her PII.</p>
      <p><strong>IV. SECURITY </strong> </p>
      <p>        The HealthConverter Network employs industry standard  security measures to ensure the security of all data. Any data that is stored  on HealthConverter's servers is treated as proprietary and confidential and is  not available to the public. HealthConverter has an internal security policy  with respect to the confidentiality of customer and other data, allowing access  only to those employees or third parties who have a need to know such  information for the purpose of effectively delivering HealthConverter products  and services by means of user login and password requirements. The HealthConverter  Network routinely evaluates its data security practices to identify security  threats or opportunities for improvement.</p>
      <p>        No transmission of data over the Internet is guaranteed to  be completely secure. It may be possible for third parties not under the  control of HealthConverter to intercept or access transmissions or private  communications unlawfully. While we strive to protect your PII, HealthConverter  cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us.  You acknowledge and assume this risk when communicating with a HealthConverter  Network company.</p>
      <p><strong>V. CONSENT AND CHANGES </strong> </p>
      <p>        The HealthConverter Network may find it necessary or be  legally obligated to update this Privacy Policy from time to time. When we do,  we will post those changes on this page and update the effective date so that  you are always aware of the information we collect, how we use it, and under  what circumstances we disclose it. Except as otherwise required by law,  modifications to this Privacy Policy will not affect the privacy of data  collected by HealthConverter prior to the effective date of the policy change.</p>
      <p><strong>VI. CHILDREN'S PRIVACY AND  SPAM </strong> </p>
      <p>        The HealthConverter Network is very sensitive to the issue  of children's privacy and makes every effort to protect the privacy of children  using the Internet. HealthConverter's Web site, products, and services are not  developed for or directed at children. Children (persons under the age of 18)  are not eligible to do business with us and we do not collect personal  information from any person we actually know is under the age of 13. If you  believe your child has provided the HealthConverter Network with any personally  identifiable data by registering at a HealthConverter Web site, please contact  us at http://www.HealthConverter.com/contact.php to have them removed.</p>
      <p>        The HealthConverter Network is committed to proper Internet  practices and full compliance with the CAN-SPAM Act of 2003 (15 U.S.C. § 7701).  It is our policy to prohibit the sending of unsolicited or "Spam"  e-mail by HealthConverter or any of its marketing partners.</p>
      <p>        Please note that under the CAN-SPAM Act, an advertiser is  required to provide an opt-out mechanism for consumers to unsubscribe from  future emails about the advertiser. Although not required to by law, many email  marketers also include an opt-out mechanism to enable consumers to be removed  from their mailing list. This has caused some confusion for consumers in opting  out. The table below clarifies which opt-out mechanism you should use for  commercial emails.</p>

      <p><strong>VII. DATA PROCESSING/SAFE  HARBOR </strong> </p>
      <p>        The European Union ("EU") maintains strict privacy  laws. These rules differ significantly from US laws. To reconcile these  differences, the US  and the EU have created a Safe   Harbor  that defines mutually acceptable privacy operations. HealthConverter, Inc.  adheres to the Safe   Harbor  principals. For more information see www.export.gov/safeharbor.</p>
      <p>        By providing information to HealthConverter Network sites,  you acknowledge that they operate in the United States and agree to (i) permit HealthConverter  to transmit and use your User information anywhere necessary, including across  international boundaries, to affect the services and transactions provided by  this Site; and (ii) that such use by HealthConverter shall be subject to the  terms and conditions stated in this Privacy Statement and our Terms and  Conditions.</p>
      <p><strong>VIII. NETWORK ADVERTISING  INITIATIVE </strong> </p>
      <p>        HealthConverter, Inc. is a member of the Network Advertising  Initiative ("NAI"). The NAI is a group of third party network  advertisers committed to increasing consumer confidence and contributing to the  growth of electronic commerce. We, along with other members of the NAI, are  committed to providing consumers with a clear explanation of what data we  collect, how we use them, and why the use of data can benefit consumer's  experience online.

      <p><strong>IX. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY,  THIRD PARTY INFORMATION &amp; LANGUAGE </strong> </p>

      <h3 class="common"><strong>CLIENT PRIVACY </strong></h3>
      <p><strong>I. INFORMATION WE COLLECT:  ADVERTISERS AND PUBLISHERS </strong> <br>
        A. Personally Identifiable Information (PII).<br>
        The HealthConverter Network collects personally identifiable information from  all Advertisers and Publishers (collectively "Clients") wishing to  work with any HealthConverter company. The collection of this information is a  part of our normal business practices. Advertisers or their representatives  will be asked to provide personally identifiable data through the host sign up  and registration process. Examples of personally identifiable data that may be  requested include name, address, phone number, email address, and social security  number, tax ID number, etc. The HealthConverter Network will never request or  collect data from a Client on subject areas including medical/health  conditions; racial or ethnic origin; political, religious or philosophical  beliefs or affiliations; trade union membership or sex life. </p>
      <p><strong>B. Non-Personally Identifiable  Information (Non-PII). </strong><br>
        The HealthConverter Network may use cookies and log files to optimize and  personalize the Clients' experience and allow HealthConverter to monitor site  traffic patterns.</p>
      <p><strong>II. INFORMATION SHARING </strong> </p>
      <p>        The HealthConverter Network does not use any personally  identifiable data about a Client for profiling purposes. All PII that HealthConverter  collects from Clients is principally intended for administrative needs (e.g.,  accounting and pay-out and performance reporting), for which purpose such data  are required.<br>
        </p>
      <p>The HealthConverter Network may provide email address and  basic account data to an Advertiser or Publisher to facilitate a potential or  continued working relationship between the Advertiser and Publisher. Once an  affiliation is established, Advertiser and Publisher (or their agents or other  third parties as designated by a Client) are privy to their respective campaign  information and PII, including anonymous Internet user transaction data for  Internet users referred by Publisher and any other information that a Client  may instruct HealthConverter to disclose. While HealthConverter strongly  encourages Clients to adopt responsible approaches to online marketing, HealthConverter  is not responsible for the information practices of Clients or their partners.  The collection, use, and disclosure of information by clients and partners are  subject to their respective privacy policies, which may differ from HealthConverter's  policy.</p>
      <p>        Periodically HealthConverter Network sites may use Clients'  PII in order to communicate with our network of hosts via email newsletters or  other avenues to offer strategic marketing information and other communications  to assist in business related activities. In the event that a Client of the HealthConverter  Network wishes not to have their PII used for these purposes, they may elect to  opt-out from future communications. For more information on opting-out please  see the "Client Choice Concerning Data Collection" section below.</p>
      <p>        Except as may be agreed between a HealthConverter company  and a Client, all PII data provided by individual Clients will be kept in  strict confidence by HealthConverter Network companies and will be treated with  the same level of respect and care that they treat other proprietary  information and trade secrets. HealthConverter will never sell, rent, exchange  or barter any personally identifiable Client information to or with any third  party for financial gain or marketing purposes. The HealthConverter Network  may, from time to time, provide such information to certain third-party  administrative vendors for efficiency purposes in providing administrative or  program management services such as billing, delivery and payouts. Any  third-party vendor so used has agreed to protect the confidentiality of  information provided by HealthConverter.</p>
      <p>        The HealthConverter Network may share PII in connection with  our affiliated entities or in connection with the sale, merger, consolidation,  change in control, transfer of substantial asset, or reorganization or  liquidation of any of the HealthConverter Network companies. The HealthConverter  Network may release account and any other personal information when we believe  release is appropriate to respond to a subpoena or otherwise comply with the  law; enforce or apply our Advertiser Terms of Use*, Publisher Terms of Use* and  other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of HealthConverter  or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and  organizations for fraud protection.</p>
      <p><strong>III. CLIENT CHOICE AND ACCESS </strong> </p>
      <p>        When a Client registers for services with a HealthConverter  Network company, PII is required as a part of doing business. HealthConverter's  primary intent in collecting personally identifiable information is for  administrative purposes including accounting and payouts. However, the HealthConverter  Network may periodically use personally identifiable information for marketing  and communication purposes targeted to our Clients. Clients wishing not to  receive such communications from a HealthConverter Network company may do so by  "opting-out" during the registration and application procedure  process. A Client may change their "opt" status at anytime during  their tenure with HealthConverter by accessing their online account.</p>
      <p>        When a Client logs on any browser-based HealthConverter  Network reporting system, a "Cookie" is placed within their computer.  The purpose of the Cookie is to allow HealthConverter to validate the identity  of the Client and maintain the security and privacy of the Client's account  data. This Cookie is required to log into HealthConverter's reporting systems  and there is no method to opt-out of this Cookie.</p>
      <p><strong>IV. SECURITY </strong> </p>
      <p>        The HealthConverter Network employs industry standard  security measures to ensure the security of all data.
