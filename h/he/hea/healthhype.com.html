<p align="center"><strong>PRIVACY POLICY</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Version  Date: 2-16-2010</p>
<p><strong>GENERAL</strong><br>
  J2Network (“Company”  or “we” or “us” or “our”) respects the privacy of its users (“user”  or “you”) whether they use our website located at www.HealthHype.com, including  other media forms and media channels related or connected thereto (collectively,  the “Website”) to search  for and read materials on a variety medical topics as well as ask medical and  health professionals (the “Experts”) questions on a variety of medical and  health-related topics &nbsp;or simply view the Website. The following  Company privacy policy (“Privacy Policy”)  is designed to inform you, as a user of the Website, about the types of  information that Company may gather about or collect from you in connection  with your use of the Website. It also is intended to explain the conditions  under which Company uses and discloses that information, and your rights in  relation to that information. Changes to this Privacy Policy are discussed at  the end of this document. Each time you use the Website, however, the current  version of this Privacy Policy will apply. Accordingly, each time you use the  Website you should check the date of this Privacy Policy (which appears at the beginning  of this document) and review any changes since the last time you used the Website.  &nbsp;<br>
  Our Website is hosted in the United   States of America and is subject to U.S. state and federal law. If you  are accessing our Website from other jurisdictions, please be advised that you  are transferring your personal information to us in the United States, and by using our Website, you  consent to that transfer and to abide by the applicable laws of applicable states  and U.S.  federal law concerning your use of the Website and your agreements with us. Any  persons accessing our Website from any jurisdiction with laws or regulations  governing the use of the Internet, including personal data collection, use and  disclosure different from those of the jurisdictions mentioned above may only  use the Website in a manner lawful in their jurisdiction. If your use of our Website  would be unlawful in your jurisdiction, please do not use the Website.<br>
  BY USING OR ACCESSING THE WEBSITE, YOU ARE ACCEPTING THE  PRACTICES DESCRIBED IN THIS PRIVACY POLICY.<br>
  <strong>CHILDREN</strong></p>
<p>The Website is not intended for children  under 13 years of age. Company does not knowingly collect personal information  from children under 13.</p>
<p><strong>GATHERING, USE AND DISCLOSURE OF  NON-PERSONALLY-IDENTIFYING INFORMATION</strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Users of the Website Generally</em></strong></p>
<p>“Non-Personally-Identifying Information” is information that, without the aid of  additional information, cannot be directly associated with a specific person. “Personally-Identifying Information,” by contrast, is information such as a  name or email address that, without more, can be directly associated with a  specific person. Like most website operators, Company gathers from users of the  Website Non-Personally-Identifying Information of the sort that Web browsers,  depending on their settings, may make available. That information includes the  user’s Internet Protocol (IP) address, operating system and browser  type, and the locations of the Web pages the user views right before arriving  at, while navigating and immediately after leaving the Website. Company  analyzes Non-Personally-Identifying Information gathered from users of the  Website to help Company better understand how the Website is being used. By  identifying patterns and trends in usage, Company is able to better design the  Website to improve users’ experiences, both in terms of content and ease of  use. From time to time, Company may also release the Non-Personally-Identifying  Information gathered from Website users in the aggregate, such as by publishing  a report on trends in the usage of the Website.</p>
<p>We may also periodically obtain both Personally-Identifying  Information and Non-Personally-Identifying Information about you from other  Company-affiliated businesses, business partners, contractors and other third  parties and add it to our account information or other information we have collected.  Examples of information that we may receive include: updated address  information, purchase history, and additional demographic information.</p>
<p><strong><em>Web Cookies</em></strong></p>
<p>A “Web Cookie” is a string of  information that a website stores on a user’s computer, and that the user’s  browser provides to the website each time the user submits a query to the site.  Company uses Web Cookies to track the pages that users visit during each  Website session, both to help Company improve users’ experiences and to help  Company understand how the Website is being used. As with other  Non-Personally-Identifying Information gathered from users of the Website,  Company analyzes and discloses in aggregated form information gathered using  Web Cookies, so as to help Company, its partners and others better understand  how the Website is being used. Company does not attempt to link information  gathered using Web Cookies to Personally-Identifying Information. COMPANY USERS  WHO DO NOT WISH TO HAVE WEB COOKIES PLACED ON THEIR COMPUTERS SHOULD SET THEIR BROWSERS  TO REFUSE WEB COOKIES BEFORE ACCESSING THE WEBSITE, WITH THE UNDERSTANDING THAT  CERTAIN FEATURES OF THE WEBSITE MAY NOT FUNCTION PROPERLY WITHOUT THE AID OF  WEB COOKIES. WEBSITE USERS WHO REFUSE WEB COOKIES ASSUME ALL RESPONSIBILITY FOR  ANY RESULTING LOSS OF FUNCTIONALITY. </p>
<p><strong><em>Third Party Advertisers</em></strong></p>
<p>We use third-party advertising companies to  serve ads when you visit the Website. These companies may use information (not  including any Personally-Identifying Information) about your visits to this and  other websites that are contained in Web Cookies in order to provide  advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. Using a tool  created by the <a href="http://networkadvertising.org/">Network Advertising  Initiative</a>, you can <a href="http://networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp">opt out</a> of several third party ad servers’ and networks’ Web Cookies simultaneously. If  you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices  about not having this information used by these companies, please follow the  following link: <a href="http://networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp">http://networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp</a>.  Please contact us if you would like to know the identity of the third-party advertising  companies we are currently using to serve ads.</p>
<p><strong><em>Web Beacons</em></strong></p>
<p>A “Web Beacon” is an object that is  embedded in a web page that is usually invisible to the user and allows website  operators to check whether a user has viewed a particular web page or an email.  Company may use Web Beacons on the Website and in emails to count users who  have visited particular pages, viewed emails, and to deliver co-branded  services. Web Beacons are not used to access users’ Personally-Identifying  Information; they are a technique Company may use to compile aggregated  statistics about Website usage. Web Beacons collect only a limited set of  information including a Web Cookie number, time and date of a page or email view,  and a description of the page or email on which the Web Beacon resides. You may  not decline Web Beacons, however, they can be rendered ineffective by declining  all Web Cookies or modifying your browser setting to notify you each time a Web  Cookie is tendered and permit you to accept or decline Web Cookies on an  individual basis. &nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><em>Aggregated  and Non-Personally-Identifying Information</em></strong></p>
<p>We may share aggregated and  Non-Personally Identifying Information we collect under any of the above  circumstances. We may also share it with third parties and our affiliate  companies to develop and deliver targeted advertising on our Website and on  websites of third parties. We may combine Non-Personally Identifying  Information we collect with additional Non-Personally Identifying Information  collected from other sources. We also may share aggregated information with  third parties, including advisors, advertisers and investors, for the purpose  of conducting general business analysis. For example, we may tell our  advertisers the number of visitors to our Website and the most popular features  or services accessed. This information does not contain any  Personally-Identifying Information and may be used to develop website content  and services that we hope you and other users will find of interest and to  target content and advertising. </p>
<p><strong>COLLECTION, USE AND DISCLOSURE OF  PERSONALLY-IDENTIFYING INFORMATION </strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Website Registration</em></strong></p>
<p>As defined above, Personally-Identifying  Information is information that can be directly associated with a specific  person. Company collects a range of Personally-Identifying Information from and  about Website users. Much of the Personally-Identifying Information collected  by Company about users is information provided by users themselves at the time  they register for the Website sign up to submit questions or comments for a  Website interactive program. That information may include each user’s name,  address, email address, and telephone number, and, if you transact business  with us, financial information such as your payment method (valid credit card  number, type, expiration date or other financial information). We also may  request information about your interests and activities, your gender, age, date  of birth, username, hometown and other demographic information, and other  relevant information as determined by Company from time to time. Users of the  Website are under no obligation to provide Company with Personally-Identifying  Information of any kind, with the caveat that a user’s refusal to do so may  prevent the user from using certain Website features.</p>
<p>BY REGISTERING WITH OR USING THE WEBSITE,  YOU CONSENT TO THE USE AND DISCLOSURE OF YOUR PERSONALLY IDENTIFYING  INFORMATION AS DESCRIBED IN THIS “COLLECTION, USE AND DISCLOSURE OF PERSONALLY-IDENTIFYING  INFORMATION” SECTION.</p>
<p><strong><em>Online Forums and Public Postings; Other  Collections</em></strong></p>
<p>Certain Personally-Identifying Information  collected from users is disclosed as a matter of course as a result of those  users’ use of the Website. We provide areas on our Websites where you can post  information about yourself and others and communicate with others or upload  content. Such postings are governed by our&nbsp;<a href="http://www.match.com/registration/membagr.aspx">Terms of Use</a>. In addition,  such postings may appear on other websites or when searches are executed on the  subject of your posting. Also, whenever you voluntarily disclose personal  information on publicly-viewable web pages, that information will be publicly  available and can be collected and used by others. For example, if you post  your email address, you may receive unsolicited messages. We cannot control who  reads your posting or what other users may do with the information you  voluntarily post, so we encourage you to exercise discretion and caution with  respect to your personal information. USERS ASSUME ALL RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY  LOSS OF PRIVACY OR OTHER HARM RESULTING FROM THEIR VOLUNTARY DISCLOSURE OF  PERSONALLY IDENTIFYING INFORMATION.</p>
<p><strong><em>Company Communications</em></strong></p>
<p>We may occasionally use your name and email  address to send you notifications regarding new services offered by the Website  that we think you may find valuable. We may also send you service-related  announcements from time to time through the general operation of the service.  Generally, you may opt out of such emails at the time of registration or  through your account settings, though we reserve the right to send you notices  about your account even if you opt out of all voluntary email notifications.</p>
<p><strong><em>DMCA Infringement Notifications, Notices of  Violations of Website Terms of Use and Other Communications Directed to Company</em></strong></p>
<p>By submitting a copyright infringement notification  under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) (explained further in our Infringement  Policy) or other communication (including communications about content stored  on or transmitted through the Website) you consent to have such communication  forwarded to the person or entity who stored, transmitted or linked to the  content addressed by your communication, in order to facilitate a prompt  resolution. For notices of violations of our Terms of Use or other  communications (but not DMCA copyright infringement notifications), upon  request Company will edit out your name and contact information. However, DMCA copyright  infringement notifications (including any personally identifiable information  set forth in the notifications) will be forwarded as submitted to Company  without any deletions.</p>
<p><strong><em>Company Disclosures</em></strong></p>
<p>Company will disclose  Personally-Identifying Information under the following circumstances: </p>
<ul type="square">
<li><strong>By Law or to Protect Rights</strong>. When we       believe disclosure is appropriate in connection with efforts to       investigate, prevent, or take other action regarding illegal activity,       suspected fraud or other wrongdoing; to protect and defend the rights,       property or safety of our Company, our users, our employees, or others; to       comply with applicable law or cooperate with law enforcement; or to       enforce our Terms of Use or other agreements or policies, in response to a       subpoena or similar investigative demand, a court order, or a request for       cooperation from a law enforcement or other government agency; to       establish or exercise our legal rights; to defend against legal claims; or       as otherwise required by law. In such cases, we may raise or waive any       legal objection or right available to us.</li>
<li><strong>Direct mail partners.</strong>&nbsp;From time to time we may share our postal mailing list with       selected providers of goods and services that may be of interest to you.       If you prefer not to receive mailings from these providers, you may opt-out       at the time you register for our Website, or at any time thereafter by going       to your account settings or contacting us using the contact information       below.</li>
</ul>
<ul type="square">
<li><strong>Marketing Communications</strong>. Unless users opt-out from receiving       Company marketing materials upon registration, Company will email users       about products and services that Company believes may be of interest to       them and Company also will provide users’ email information to third       parties, so that those third parties may directly contact users about       additional products and services. If a user wishes to opt-out of receiving       marketing materials from Company or having their email information       provided to third parties at any time after registration, users may do so by going to your account settings or contacting us       using the contact information below. Even after opting-out, a user may continue to       receive marketing emails from third parties to whom Company already has       provided the user’s email information. Users will be responsible for       directly contacting such third parties to request cessation of further marketing       emails.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul type="square">
<li><strong>Third Party Service Providers</strong>. We may share your       Personally-Identifying Information, which may include your name and       contact information (including email address) with our authorized service       providers that perform certain services on our behalf. These services may       include fulfilling orders, providing customer service and marketing       assistance, performing business and sales analysis, supporting our website       functionality, and supporting contests, sweepstakes, surveys and other       features offered through our Website. We may also share your name, contact       information and credit card information with our authorized service       providers who process credit card payments. These service providers may       have access to personal information needed to perform their functions but       are not permitted to share or use such information for any other purpose. </li>
</ul>
<ul type="square">
<li><strong>Business Transfers; Bankruptcy</strong>. Company reserves the right to       transfer all Personally-Identifying Information in its possession to a       successor organization in the event of a merger, acquisition, or       bankruptcy or other sale of all or a portion of Company’s assets. Other       than to the extent ordered by a bankruptcy or other court, the use and       disclosure of all transferred Personally-Identifying Information will be       subject to this Privacy Policy, or to a new privacy policy if you are       given notice of that new privacy policy and are given an opportunity to       affirmatively opt-out of it. Personally-Identifying Information submitted       or collected after a transfer, however, may be subject to a new privacy       policy adopted by the successor organization. </li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><em>Changing Personally-Identifying Information;  Account Termination </em></strong><br>
  You may at any time review or change your  Personally-Identifying Information by going to your account settings or contacting  us using the contact information below. &nbsp;Upon  your request, we will deactivate or delete your account and contact information  from our active databases. Such information will be deactivated or deleted as  soon as practicable based on your account activity and accordance with our  deactivation policy and applicable law. To make this request, either go to your  account settings or contact us as provided below. We will retain in our files  some personal information to prevent fraud, to troubleshoot problems, to assist  with any investigations, to enforce our Terms of Use and to comply with legal  requirements as is permitted by law.

Additionally, we keep a history of changed information to investigate  suspected fraud with your account. <br>
  <strong><em>General Use</em></strong></p>
<p>We use  the Personally-Identifiable Information in the file we maintain about you, and  other information we obtain from your current and past activities on the Website  to: deliver the products and services that you have requested, manage your  account and provide you with customer support, communicate with you by email,  postal mail, telephone and/or mobile devices about products or services that  may be of interest to you either from us, our affiliate companies or other  third parties, develop and display content and advertising tailored to your  interests on our Website and other sites, resolve disputes, troubleshoot  problems, measure consumer interest in our services, reward you for the ads you  watch, inform you of updates, customize your experience, detect and protect us  against error, fraud and other criminal activity, enforce our Terms of Use, and  as otherwise described to you at the time of collection.

We may use financial information or payment method  to process payment for any purchases made on our Website, enroll you in the  discount, rebate, and other programs in which you elect to participate, to  protect against or identify possible fraudulent transactions, and otherwise as  needed to manage our business.</p>

<p><strong>COLLECTION AND USE OF INFORMATION BY THIRD  PARTIES </strong><strong>GENERALLY</strong></p>
<p>Company contractually prohibits its  contractors, affiliates, vendors and suppliers from disclosing  Personally-Identifying Information received from Company, other than in  accordance with this Privacy Policy. Third parties are under no obligation to  comply with this Privacy Policy, however, with respect to  Personally-Identifying Information that users provide directly to those third  parties or that those third parties collect for themselves. Company neither  owns nor controls the third-party websites accessible through the Website.  Thus, this Privacy Policy does not apply to information provided to or gathered  by the third parties that operate them. Before visiting a third-party, whether  by means of a link on the Website or otherwise, and before providing any  Personally-Identifying Information to any third party, users should inform  themselves of the privacy policies and practices (if any) of the third party  responsible for that website, and should take those steps necessary to, in  those users’ discretion, protect their privacy.</p>
<p><strong>SECURITY</strong></p>
<p>We take security of  your Personally-Identifying Information seriously and use reasonable electronic,  personnel, and physical measures to protect it from loss, theft, alteration, or  misuse.&nbsp; However, please be advised that even the best security measures  cannot fully eliminate all risks.</p>
<p><strong>PRIVACY POLICY CHANGES</strong></p>
<p>Company may, in its sole discretion, change  this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any and all changes to Company’s Privacy  Policy will be reflected on this page and the date new versions are posted will  be stated at the top of this Privacy Policy. Unless Company obtains your  express consent, any revised Privacy Policy will apply only to information  collected after such time as the revised Privacy Policy takes effect, and not  to information collected under any earlier Privacy Policies. Users should  regularly check this page for any changes to its Privacy Policy. Company will  always post new versions of the Privacy Policy on the Website. However, Company  may, as determined in its discretion, decide to notify users of changes made to  this Privacy Policy via email or otherwise. Accordingly, it is important that  users always maintain and update their contact information.</p>
