<p><strong>Your rights to access and control your health information</strong></p>

You will have the right to have certain information related to your requested amendment included in your records.</p>
<p><strong>3. Right to an Accounting of Disclosures</strong>. You have a right to request an “accounting of disclosures,” which identifies certain other persons or organizations to whom we have disclosed your health information in accordance with applicable law and the protections afforded in this Notice.

Once we have agreed to a restriction, you have the right to revoke the restriction at any time. Under some circumstances, we will also have the right to revoke the restriction as long as we notify you before doing so.
