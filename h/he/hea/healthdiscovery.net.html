//Configure the below array to hold the 31 possible tips of the month
tips[1]='DRINK YOUR JUICE...Vegetable juices can be an excellent source of nutrients and count toward the recommended 3 to 5 vegetable servings per day. A serving of tomato juice provides about 35 calories and is an excellent source of vitamin A and C, and a good source of Iron. '
tips[2]='DO NOT LISTEN TO THEM... Consider that the limitations others place on you are really their own. Do not believe those who tell you that you cannot do something. That is just their opinion. It is not your reality. '
tips[3]='MAKE IT HAPPEN...The world is full of successful people who were told time and time again that their dream was impossible. They chose not to listen. They chose not to burden themselves with the limitations of the people around them. They chose to make it happen in spite of their detractors. '
tips[4]='MAKE EXERCISE FUN... You can make it more interesting and fun. Exercise with other people. Entertain yourself with a headset and musical tapes or listen to the radio. Vary your activities and your walking routes. '
tips[5]='MAKE A CONTRACT... with yourself. Decide how long you will stick with these particular exercises. Eight to 12 weeks is a reasonable time commitment for a new program. '
tips[6]='EXPECT SETBACKS... During the first year, people average two to three interruptions in their exercise schedule, often because of minor injuries or illnesses unrelated to their exercise. You may find yourself sidelined or derailed temporarily. Do not be discouraged. Try a different activity or simply rest. When you are feeling better, resume your program, but begin at a lower, more gentle level '
tips[7]='BE A COACH...Think of your head as the coach and your body as your team. For success, all parts of the team need attention. Be a good coach. Encourage and praise yourself.'
tips[8]='IT TAKES TIME...Give your exercise plan a chance to succeed. Set reasonable goals and enjoy your success. Stay motivated. When it comes to your personal fitness program, sticking with it and doing it your way makes you a definite winner. '
tips[9]='PLAN YOUR DAY... to the smallest detail possible. Write down what you are going to eat before you start, and stick to that plan. You definitely want to avoid snacking and unplanned eating. '
tips[10]='DRINK LOTS OF WATER. It will help clean out your system and help control your hunger. By the end of the first day, you should feel fresh and clean.'
tips[11]='FAST FOOD FRENZY... Everywhere you look today, it seems a new fast food restaurant is popping up. Do your best to simply avoid these places. '
tips[12]='WIN THE WAR...Do not let one lost battle end the war. If you do break down and give in to temptation, do not quit! Just get right back on track, not tomorrow BUT RIGHT NOW! '
tips[13]='BE PREPARED… If you know of an upcoming event where eating fatty food is involved, eat low fat food ahead of the engagement, snack on veggie right before and eat less during. '
tips[14]='MAKE A LIST... of 10 foods that have no fat in them. When you crave a snack, allow yourself to eat, but only from that list. This will help you make a good decision when you stomach is doing the thinking. Avoid cheese, Mayonnaise, Ground Beef, Peanuts, Coconut and Buttered Popcorn. These items are loaded with fat!  '
tips[15]='SALADS… Many people think they are eating healthy by ordering a salad. Make sure you order "lowfat" or "nofat" dressing, standard dressing is usually loaded with fat.'
tips[16]='BE SOCIAL... Go out dancing. It is a great way to get your exercise in while having fun. You should look into other activities that are "exercise in disguise" such as going to the zoo, walking around the shopping mall, taking in an amusement park , or going swimming at the beach.'
tips[17]='OUT TO LUNCH... Many of us find ourselves going out to lunch with our coworkers on a daily basis. This usually means that we do not always get to pick the place to eat. Take the time to research the restaurants surrounding your job. Have a couple of "low fat" meals picked from each restaurant so you know what to order even before you arrive at the place. The less of a decision you have to make, the easier it will be to stay on track.'
tips[18]='WAKE UP!  Doctors say that your metabolism does not really kick into gear until you eat your first meal of the day. Make it a point to have a good nutritional breakfast to start the day.'
tips[19]='DEDICATION… Think of how almost every area of your life can be improved if you lost weight. Then, think about how much your life is hampered by eating unhealthy. Remember to think of the "pros & cons" before you eat.'
tips[20]='AVOID SMELLS… The sense of smell can be a big factor in increasing hunger. Try to avoid strong food smells if possible. For example: Every time you dive by a certain restaurant, your car fills with the smell of cheeseburgers. Simply take an alternative route on route to you destination. '
tips[21]='CHEW GUM… Chewing gum is a great way to keep your mouth busy instead of eating. Plus the flavor in your mouth can help take away some of your craving for food. '
tips[22]='ORDER WISELY… When you go out to eat, remember that the restaurants are there to serve you. They will make substitutions on their menu for health reasons. All food dishes can be made healthier simply by removing the cheese and dressing. Be creative and you can still have a very tasty meal.'
tips[23]='REWARD YOURSELF… Do not be afraid to reward yourself with new clothes once you have reached a certain goal. This kind of positive reinforcement goes a long way towards you continuing your diet.'
tips[24]='PLAN LONG TERM… Remember your diet is for the rest of your life. Once you have reached your overall goal, the second part is maintaining your weight. Do not forget this takes as much effort as losing the weight, and you should plan accordingly.'
tips[25]='OTHERS ADVISE… It seems like whenever anyone knows you are on a diet, they all have great advice for you. Listen, but do what you feel fits into your lifestyle. If you are successfully losing weight, do not change your pattern, continue with what your doing. Not all things work for all people.'
tips[26]='KEEP PICTURES… If you have a picture of yourself that you absolutely hate because you are fat in it, bring it around with you and bring it out every time you feel like eating unhealthy. Drastic: Yes. Effective: Yes.'
tips[27]='SIT-UPS… Do not underestimate the value of sit-ups. Anything that increases your stomach muscles will have a chain effect and help your whole body digest food.'
tips[28]='ALL ABOUT YOU… Get your hair done and buy new clothes. Improving your appearance can go a long way towards motivating you to lose weight. Losing weight and keeping it off will require a positive outlook.'
tips[29]='MAGAZINES…Subscribe to at least one health magazine. You will be updated monthly on: new diet breakthroughs, great exercise tips, and lowfat cooking tips. You can subscribe to them on our online store.'
tips[30]='VACATIONING… can be a diet killer since your there for enjoyment and your always eating out. Just keep in mind that most major hotels have a workout facility onsite. You can also exercise by taking a walk, going to the beach or using the hotel pool for swimming, they are all great vacation exercise activities. Make it a point to engage in at least one exercise activity a day.'
tips[31]='DO NOT TORTURE YOURSELF… by thinking of food or watching cooking programs and such, they are by very nature designed to make you hungry. Stick to the "out of sight - out of mind" philosophy. '

              Discovery takes the issue of safeguarding your privacy on-line very 
              seriously. We have very strict policies and procedures designed 
              to protect the privacy of our visitors. We will never share your 
              personal information with any external organization without your 
              consent. We do not sell any personal information about our visitors, 
              including email addresses. Any personal information you do wish

              to any personally identifiable information while on our site (who 
              you are, your email address, or anything personal). The cookie helps 
              the user to save time. For instance, by setting a cookie on our 
              site, the user would not have to log in a password more than once, 
              thereby saving time while on our site. Web browsers can be set to 
              reject cookies. If a user rejects the cookie they may still use 
              our site, but may not be able to take advantage of certain features.

              only once. The next time you return to the Web site you will not 
              necessarily need to "sign in" again. Remember that cookies

              Online Discussion Groups have a bulletin board format that allows 
              our visitors the opportunity to interact with our online community. 
              These areas are moderated by volunteer hosts strictly to keep inappropriate 
              messages from being posted. You are offered the opportunity to include 
              your email address with your message but you are not obligated to 
              do so. If you do include your email address then it is visible to 
              the general public on the bulletin board and we cannot control the 
              actions of any third parties. We will not sell email addresses from 
              our bulletin boards. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Please 
              keep in mind that whenever you voluntarily disclose personal information 
              online - for example on message boards, through email, or in chat 
              areas - that information can be collected and used by others. In 
              short, if you post personal information online that is accessible 
              to the public, you may receive unsolicited messages from other parties 
              in return. </font></p>

              separate emails from other marketers as a result of joining our

              time to time Health Discovery requests information from users via 
              surveys or contests. Participation in these surveys or contests 
              is completely voluntary and the user therefore has a choice whether 
              or not to disclose this information. Some of the information requested 
              is of a personal nature but there is certainly no obligation to 
              answer every question. In particular, submission of your email address 
              is entirely optional. Information requested may include contact 
              information (such as name and shipping address), and demographic 
              information (such as zip code, age level). Contact information will 
              be used to notify the winners and award prizes. Survey information 
              will be used for purposes of monitoring or improving the use and 
              satisfaction of this site. Large population demographics may be 
              compiled and published using this data but no individual information 
              is ever disseminated. </font></p>
