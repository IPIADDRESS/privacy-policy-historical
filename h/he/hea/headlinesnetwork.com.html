			information about how users use the Services.&nbsp; Using technologies such as cookies, web beacons and similar technologies, we may automatically collect information about your computer, mobile devices, and online activity when you access the Services,
			including information about your browsing history. If you use our Services, we may collect information about the browser you’re using. We might look at what site you came from, or what site you visit when you leave us.&nbsp; Learn more about
			these tools and how you can control them, <u><a href="http://headlinesnetwork.com/ads">here</a></u> (or by visiting <u><a href="http://headlinesnetwork.com/ads">http://headlinesnetwork.com/ads</a></u>).</p>

			about you we get from third parties.</p>
		<p><strong>How we use your information.</strong></p>
		<p><strong>We use information to improve our products and services. </strong>We might use your information to customize your experience with us.&nbsp; We may use your information for research on our users’ demographics, interests, and behavior to
			help us operate the Services or for other business purposes.&nbsp; We may use your information to serve you with advertising content in which we think you’ll be interested.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
		<p><strong>We use information to look at site trends and customer interests. </strong>We may use your information to make our website and products better. We may use your information to customize your experience with us.</p>
		<p><strong>We use information for security purposes. </strong>We may use information to protect our company, our customers, or our Services.</p>
		<p><strong>We use information for marketing purposes. </strong>For example, we might send you information about special promotions or offers. We might tell you about new features or products. These might be our own offers or products, or third party offers
			or products we think you might find interesting.</p>
		<p><strong>We use information as otherwise permitted by law or as we may notify you. </strong>For example, we may use your IP address for identification purposes in cooperation with internet service providers or law enforcement agencies.</p>

			marketing purposes. For example, these partners may serve you with advertising content based on your interests.&nbsp;</p>

			enforce compliance with our internal policies and applicable laws. We will share information to respond to a court order or subpoena. Or, we might share information when we are investigating potential fraud. We may share your information whenever we
			believe disclosure is necessary to limit our liability or to protect or enforce the rights, interests or safety of our products and services, our users or others.</p>
