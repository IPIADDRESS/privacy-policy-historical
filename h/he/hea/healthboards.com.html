<p><b>Reach Out Before You Feel Alone</b> (<i>or If You Are Suicidal</i>)</p>

<p>
With HealthBoards.com, you never have to feel alone. Get connected and reach out for others' understanding and support. If loneliness has already set in ... reach out and help someone else... or reach out and ask for help.
</p>  

<p>
<i>If you have thoughts of suicide</i>, immediately call <b>911</b> if in America, or call a hospital, or call local police for emergency help.<br> 

</p></a><p><a name="1">
Please feel free to talk about your depression, and let members here encourage you or help you with solutions to problems. 
But, the boards are NOT an appropriate place for threats to commit suicide, hurt others, or to hurt yourself. 
Such posts will be removed. They are inappropriate here.<br> 
<i>If you are suicidal, contact a professional suicide counselor immediately.  Please don't try to go it alone.</i>

</p>


<a name="2"><p><b>Use Good Personal Judgment</b></p> 

</a><p><a name="2">
First and foremost, NEVER rely on information or member opinions in posts to replace necessary, personal consultation(s) with qualified health or medical professionals. This forum is for support, empowerment, sharing opinions and entertainment. Healthboards.com is not a professional advice forum, and no one should use it as such.
Also, remember that what's right or has worked for one person may not be what's right for you. Your personal set of circumstances will always influence what's best or right for you. Talk with your physician or personal health professional about the benefits, risks and costs of various options and alternatives in order to make an informed, confident personal choice. [</a><a href="pgppd.htm#policiesguidelines">up</a>]
</p>


<a name="3"><p><b>Keep Personal Information Personal</b></p> 

<p>
Do not post your real name, email, home address or telephone number on the public message boards. This forum is for the purpose of on-board sharing only. Please keep personal information personal, and remind your children to do so, too. Posting the age of young people is not safe, so please do not do it. Remember that anything on the Internet may may circulate on the Internet for years and be accessed by anyone using a search engine. The World Wide Internet truly is open to the world.
</p>

</a><p><a name="3">
Similarly, do not ask for personal information from others. Posts that request anyone to submit personal information or off-board contact information will be removed and may lead to banning. This includes, but is not limited to, communications that ask for personal information submitted via your personal profile, posts, e-mail, mail, telephone, surveys, polls, and research studies.
[</a><a href="pgppd.htm#policiesguidelines">up</a>]
</p>


<a name="4"><p><b>Share Information Within the Guidelines</b></p>

<p>
You may always name products or services and tell your opinions about them. Naming doctors/cities/states is OK, just do not post any off-board contact information; again, on-board sharing only. If it is inappropriate for the open forum, it doesn't need to be shared from this website. Messages that break any law are inappropriate and will be removed.
</p>

</a><p><a name="4">
Information-only websites, such as .gov, always are welcome.  The informational.edu and other strictly informational websites are fine, but if any is primarily for message forums/chats, then it may not be posted unless pre-approved. Promoting websites that have or link to message boards/chats is not permitted on the boards. You may request pre-approval of a website by the Administrator, 
<script>
var name = "moderator1";

. Appeals will be considered, but the final decision must be respected.

</p>


<a name="5"><p><b>Don't Be Afraid To Post</b></p><p> 

</p></a><p><a name="5">
If you're new to our community, taking the step for the first time to post publicly to a message board can sometimes seem intimidating. Don't be afraid to jump into a discussion. We have a very supportive community that serves up heavy doses of support, encouragement and enthusiasm. We love meeting new people and being friendly. While we hope that you'll become an active participant and join in our discussions, you're welcome, of course, to simply hang out silently until you feel more comfortable posting a message.
[</a><a href="pgppd.htm#policiesguidelines">up</a>]
</p>


<a name="6"><p><b>Get Loose, Get Serious, Be Yourself</b></p>

<p>
Be yourself! There are no community rules about how best to get in touch with yourself or with others (as long as your 
communications are within the HealthBoards.com's Policies &amp; Guidelines). If you feel like getting loose: get loose. If you feel like being serious: be serious. Share your tears, fears and laughter. This is the key to connecting with others who understand it is OK to just be yourself.
</p>

</a><p><a name="6">
If you're feeling alone or hurting, don't be afraid to share. If you're rejoicing about the results of a recent medical test or treatment, share that too. If something funny happened to you today that can help lighten others' hearts, we want to hear about it so that we can laugh too. Sharing who you are is considered healthy medicine in HealthBoards.com. 
[</a><a href="pgppd.htm#policiesguidelines">up</a>]
</p>


<a name="7"><p><b>Agree to Disagree</b></p> 

</a><p><a name="7">
<u>Do not attack each other.</u> Negative communications, especially those aimed at sexual orientation, gender, race, color, religious views, national origin, or DISABILITY -- will not be permitted. BEFORE you post a message that is intended to embarrass, humiliate or harass another person or group of people, stop and THINK first!  Harassing communications is deemed as any words  that may cause distress, embarrassment, unwanted attention or other discomfort. [</a><a href="pgppd.htm#policiesguidelines">up</a>]
</p>

<p>
Please remember to agree to disagree. What is good for one may very well not be the answer for another. Please stay on-topic, which is SUPPORTING OTHERS, in their health decisions for themselves. Providing your opinion should not result in disparaging remarks or religious discussions, or one-upsmanship over who has the most education. NO one is an expert on what is appropriate for someone else. Both medical and alternative solution opinions belong on the boards.  Even if you disagree with an idea, it still may be the solution for others. Decisions about health and well-being are highly personal, individual choices. If you disagree with a person's post or opinion state your opinion, then move on before making it an argument.  Agree to disagree, agreeably.  If a member asks for support only, please respect the request; do not reply with contradictory comments.
</p>

<p>
SHOUT &amp; let it out, But don't shout at one another. Shouting online (typing in all capital letters LIKE THIS) is considered by some to be rude and difficult to read. To others, especially individuals with some types of disabilities, typing in all caps (or in all lower case) is a necessity. (Using the shift key can be a struggle for a lot of folks.)  If it is necessary for you to use all caps be sure to inform others so they understand.

<a name="8"><p><b>Welcome Newcomers</b></p> 

</a><p><a name="8">
When newcomers arrive, say "hi" and welcome them to our growing community. Help new folks "learn the ropes" about how to find information and resources, save time, and how to get involved. 
[</a><a href="pgppd.htm#policiesguidelines">up</a>]
</p>


<a name="9"><p><b>Keep Your Posts Clean</b></p> 

</a><p><a name="9">
There may be places where explicit, obscene or vulgar language, graphics or behavior is appropriate: But HealthBoards.com is not one of them. Message board posts that contain explicit, sexual, obscene or vulgar language will be removed. Similarly, any message board posts that solicit or offer explicit or X-rated GIFs, JPEGs or other graphic files will be deleted without notice!
Usernames with sexual implication/content will be banned. 
[</a><a href="pgppd.htm#policiesguidelines">up</a>]
</p>


<a name="10"><p><b>Don't Post Other's Copyrighted Information</b></p>

</a><p><a name="10">
Information copyrighted or owned by any individual or entity other than the person posting should not be posted on the message 
boards or software libraries without the consent of the owner. If such an event occurs, the individual posting the information shall 
be held solely responsible. HealthBoards.com shall not be held responsible for posted information that may violate copyright law. Such posts will be removed as soon as possible. 
[</a><a href="pgppd.htm#policiesguidelines">up</a>]
</p>

<a name="11"><p><b>Be Courteous: Avoid Duplicate Posts</b></p> 

</a><p><a name="11">
Do not post the same message more than once on a message board. Duplicate messages can be frustrating for other visitors, especially for those whose time and energy is valuable. Remember that many participants in our community are in pain or have a DISABILITY. Weeding through the same message in multiple locations can be not only frustrating, but down right annoying. Duplicate messages will be deleted as soon as possible.
