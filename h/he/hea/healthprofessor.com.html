<p><b>How We Collect Information</b></p>

<p><i>The Company gathers information in the following ways:</i></p>

<p><b>Cookies</b><br>
A cookie is a small text file stored on a user's computer for record-keeping
purposes. The Company uses cookies only to enable users to be routed properly
through our site. We also provide links to external advertisers and marketing
Partner companies; these sites may choose to use cookies to better promote
their products and services. These advertisers and marketing partner companies
have their own privacy procedures and policies that are not controlled by the
Company.</p>

<p>We encourage our users to be aware of the individual privacy policies of every Web site that the user contacts. </p>

<p><b>Clear Gif's (Web Beacons/Web Bugs)</b><br>
The Company may also use a software technology called clear gif's (Web Beacons or Web Bugs), that help us determine what content on our site is most effective.
Clear gif's are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users. 
We do not tie the information gathered by clear gif's to our customers' personally identifiable information.</p>

<p>We also use clear gif's in our HTML-based emails so that we know which emails have been opened. 
We use this information to monitor the effectiveness of our email campaigns and to validate our results to our marketing partners.</p>

<p><b>Log Files</b><br>
Log files are also used to track and monitor traffic patterns on our site. They
are not used to track or monitor personally identifiable information.</p>

<p><b>Tell-A-Friend</b><br>

this particular offer. The information is used only to forward the information
to that person and is not retained for any other purpose.</p>

All information provided to the Company by the users of this site may be used
to support our suppression, validation and enhancement services to other

<p>As an example, opt-out information may be shared with other marketing partners so that those users opting out of further offers are suppressed from the partner's mailings or promotions, as well as our own. 
In addition to complying with our users' preferences, it simply makes good business sense to mail only to those customers who have indicated a desire to receive such mailings. </p>

<p>The Company's business model includes participating in affiliate network programs and other co-marketing partnerships to promote our site. We reserve the right to share with 3rd parties the information we collect on this site for any purpose.</p>
