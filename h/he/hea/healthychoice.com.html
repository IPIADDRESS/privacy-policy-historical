	<p><b class="header">CONAGRA FOODS  PRIVACY POLICY</b></p>
	<p>ConAgra Foods, Inc. ("ConAgra Foods") recognizes that
many adults and children who visit our web site are
concerned about how personal information they provide
on-line is maintained and used by ConAgra Foods. To
address these concerns and to demonstrate our firm
commitment to privacy, especially for children who visit our
sites, we have developed and implemented this privacy
policy so you will know how ConAgra Foods gathers, and
provides, information. Please review our privacy policy
from time to time as we may update or change it
periodically.
</p>
	<p><b class="subhead">Gathering and Use of Information</b><br>ConAgra Foods collects personally identifiable information
from visitors to our sites solely on a voluntary basis. Such
personally identifiable information may include your name,
postal address, e-mail address, company name and/or
telephone numbers, et cetera (collectively referred to herein as
"Personal Information"). We will never sell, transfer, or
disclose any Personal Information we gather at our web
sites to any third parties without your prior consent, except
in cases when we believe in good faith that we have a legal
obligation to disclose such Personal Information. We never require
that this Personal Information be provided in order to
 gain access to our sites. We collect
Personal Information primarily for the following reasons: 1) to
e-mail consumers with updates and news, 2) to notify
winners of contests, games and sweepstakes, and to
distribute prizes, 3) to send out brochures, etc. via
regular mail to subscribers, 4) to distribute items that are part of "give aways" that you have registered for, and 5) for use in our online and off-line marketing and advertising campaigns.  There may be times when we
share aggregate information about our users (for example,
the % of male and female visitors to our sites) with
advertisers, business partners, sponsors, and other third
parties in any effort to customize or enhance the content and
advertising on our sites for our users.</p>
<p>We recognize there are unique issues raised about the
protection of our children's privacy over the Internet. All
children-directed ConAgra Foods web sites are designed
to comply with the requirements of the Children's Online
Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) and Children's
Advertising Review Unit (CARU) guidelines for web sites
gathering identifiable information from children (under age
13). Consistent with these requirements and guidelines, and
provided that we have been given accurate information by
the child when asked, we do NOT:
</p><ol>
<li><p>collect personally identifiable off-line contact information without prior parental consent;</p></li>
<li><p>distribute to third parties any personally identifiable information without prior parental consent;</p></li>
<li><p>entice children by the prospect of a special game, prize or other activity, to divulge more information than is needed to participate in the activity;</p></li>
<li><p>use or disclose on-line contact information without prior parental consent or parental notification, which will include an opportunity for the parent to prevent use of the information and participation in the activity. Without prior parental consent, on-line information will only be used to respond directly to the child's request and will not be used for other purposes without prior parental consent. We collect on-line contact information from children only in connection with on-line contests and sweepstakes; our policy with respect to using this information is provided below in the "Contests/Sweepstakes" section; or</p></li>
<li><p>enable children to publicly post or otherwise distribute personally identifiable contact information without prior parental consent.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Parents can always ask to review any Personal Information
about their child that may have been collected at one of our
sites, have us delete any such Personal Information, and/or
instruct us not to collect or use such Personal Information
about their child in the future. To do so, simply contact us
following the procedure outlined below in the "How To
Contact Us" section.
</p>
<p>As the new technology of the Internet evolves, and the
COPPA requirements and CARU guidelines evolve as well,
ConAgra Foods intends to comply with these requirements
and guidelines in a manner and in as timely a fashion as is
technologically feasible in order to protect our children and
their privacy.
</p>
<p><b class="subhead">About Other Privacy Laws</b><br>
ConAgra Foods abides by many privacy laws in the United States and around the world, including the Safe Harbor framework as set forth by the United States Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use and retention of information collected from European Union countries.
</p>
	<p><b class="subhead">Contests/Sweepstakes</b><br>We periodically run contests and sweepstakes on our sites
for which we ask users/participants to provide contact
information (like their e-mail address). This information is
used to contact the participant only when necessary in
accordance with the rules of the contest or sweepstakes.
</p>
<p>If a participant has indicated upon entering a contest or
sweepstakes that he/she is under 13 years of age, the
participant is instructed to enter the e-mail address of
his/her parent or guardian. Further, for any game or contest
where the screen names of the high scorers are posted, a
user under 13 can only select a generic screen name from a
list that has been developed in advance. This prevents the
disclosure of any personally identifiable information.
</p>
<p>When a participant under the age of 18 is selected as a
prize-winner in a contest or sweepstakes, an e-mail is sent
to the parent or guardian. This e-mail contains a form that
requests the participant's real name and address and a
parental permission form. For the participant to receive the
prize, the parent or guardian must fill out and sign the form
and then mail or fax it to the address or number indicated
on the form.
</p>
	<p><b class="subhead">Cookies/IP Addresses</b><br>Like many companies, ConAgra Foods may use "cookie"
technology to track customer visits through our sites.
Cookies are pieces of information that a web site transfers
to an individual's hard drive for record-keeping purposes.
They enhance the on-line experience by saving your
preferences while you are visiting a particular site.
</p>
<p>The cookies ConAgra Foods uses do not contain any
personally identifying information and cannot profile your
system or collect information from your hard drive. And
although you may receive cookies from many different sites,
each cookie can only be read by the Web server that
originally issued it. You are not even identified by name or
e-mail address, just by a unique string of numbers that we
assign the first time you come to our site.
</p>
<p>We use your IP address in two ways: to help diagnose
problems with our server and to administer our web sites,
and also to gather broad demographic information.
</p>
	<p><b class="subhead">Polls &amp; Surveys</b><br>Information gathered from polls and surveys are only for
internal use of ConAgra Foods. If sample answers to polls
or surveys are posted on the web site, then no identifiable
Personal Information is ever included.
</p>
	<p><b class="subhead">Choice/Opt-Out</b><br>Our sites will provide users the opportunity to opt out of
receiving communications from us at the point where we
request information about the visitor. Simply follow the
procedure outlined at each site. Likewise, we will provide
users with the opportunity to change any personal information
previously provided, or to opt out of receiving future email communication from us.
</p>
	<p><b class="subhead">How To Contact Us</b><br>If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, the
Legal Policy, the practices of this site, your dealings with
this web site, or your Personal Information, you can always
contact us at our e-mail address,
 <a href="mailto:consumeraffairs@conagrafoods.com">consumeraffairs@conagrafoods.com</a>.</p>
	<p><b class="subhead">Final Note</b><br>Our goal at ConAgra Foods is to provide a safe Internet
environment for you and your children. While children and
young adults are encouraged to play our games and explore
the web sites, we remind them often that their parents will
be notified if they give us their e-mail address and their
parent's written permission is required for them to be
eligible to win prizes. We urge parents to spend time with
their children on our web sites. Sit with them and share the
experience. While ConAgra Foods does everything we can
to ensure your child's privacy and safety, informed parents
are the best protectors of their children.
