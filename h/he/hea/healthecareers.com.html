        <p>If you are an EU resident, you may have certain rights including: the right not to provide your Personal Information to us; the right of access to your Personal Information; the right to request rectification of inaccuracies; the right to request the erasure, or restriction of Processing, of your Personal Information; the right to object to the Processing of your Personal Information; the right to have your Personal Information transferred to another controller; the right to withdraw consent; and the right to lodge complaints with supervisory authorities. We may require proof of or need to verify your identity before we can give effect to these rights.</p>

    <p>You may directly take steps to change your preferences as follows:</p>
    <p><span class="italic">Your Newsletter and Email Subscriptions.</span> You can opt out or unsubscribe from a newsletter or other email list at any time by following the instructions at the end of the newsletters or emails you receive. Please allow five to ten business days for changes to take effect. On some Services, member service-related communications are an integral part of such Services to which you subscribe and you may continue to receive emails as part of that particular portion of the Services unless you cancel your account, even if you opt out of the newsletters or email list.  If you have provided more than one email address to us, you may continue to be contacted unless you request to unsubscribe each email address you have provided.</p>
    <p><span class="italic">Push Notifications.</span> We send you push notifications from time-to-time in order to update you about any events or promotions that we may be running. If you no longer wish to receive these types of communications, you may turn them off at the device level. To ensure you receive proper notifications, we will need to collect certain information about your device such as operating system and user identification information.</p>
    <p><span class="italic">Location Based Services.</span> You may opt-out of having your Precise Location Data collected by Everyday Health at any time by editing the appropriate setting on your mobile device (which is usually located in the Settings area of your device).</p>
    <p><span class="italic">OBA.</span> Everyday Health is a subsidiary of Ziff Davis, LLC, a member of the Digital Advertising Alliance (<strong>"DAA"</strong>) in the U.S., E.U. and Canada and uses third party assurance platforms to comply with the DAA principles. Everyday Health strives to adhere to the self-regulatory organization principles for the DAA (US), the DAAC (Canada) and the EDAA (EU). Online ads on the Services using Online Data are delivered with the DAA Ad Marker Icon <img src="https://c.evidon.com/pub/icong1.png" class="evidon-consent-link-image" style="vertical-align: bottom;"> , which helps users understand how their data is being used and provides choices for users who want more control. This icon is also on each of our web pages and applications where Online Data is collected that will be used for OBA purposes.</p>
    <p>The DAA Ad Marker Icon <img src="https://c.evidon.com/pub/icong1.png" class="evidon-consent-link-image" style="vertical-align: bottom;">  provides information (and links to other information) on online behavioral ads, who is collecting and using your Online Data, how you can opt out and more. If you would prefer that we not collect Online Data that may be used to help determine which advertisements to serve you, opt out by clicking this icon <img src="https://c.evidon.com/pub/icong1.png" class="evidon-consent-link-image" style="vertical-align: bottom;">, which can be found on most of our webpages and mobile applications.</p>

    <p><span class="italic">Cookies and Pixel Tags</span>. You may stop or restrict cookies and pixel tags on your computer or purge cookies from your browser by adjusting your web browser preferences. However, if you “turn off,” purge, or disable cookies or pixel tags, although you may still use the Services, you may not be able to use all of the features, functions, or services available on the Services.</p>
    <p><span class="italic">Applicants for Healthcare-Related Positions</span>.  If you are looking for a job and using the Health eCareers website, or that of our partners, you may change your profile or resume at any time.  At any time, you may elect that your profile and resume not be searchable by prospective employers by logging into your account and changing the status of your profile.  If that is not possible, please contact <a href="mailto:info@healthecareers.com">info@healthecareers.com</a> and we will make the change for you.  In addition, you may elect to make your profile searchable by prospective employers on a confidential basis only. In this case, your name and contact information will not be displayed to prospective employers. If a prospective employer desires to contact a confidential job seeker regarding an employment opportunity, the prospective employer will send an email to the confidential job seeker through Health eCareers, who will then forward the email to the job seeker’s email address. The job seeker’s email address will not be provided directly to the prospective employer. When posting a resume confidentially, it is your responsibility to ensure that your contact information is not included within the resume attachment.</p>
    <p><span class="italic">California Residents</span>. In accordance with the California Online Privacy Protection Act, we may collect Personal Information about your online activities when you use the Services. While we give our users many avenues to opt out of providing Personal Information, we do not respond to Web browsers’ “do not track” signals. California’s “Shine the Light” law, Civil Code Section 1798.83, permits our users who are California residents to periodically request and obtain certain information about any Personal Information disclosed to third parties for direct marketing purposes. If you are a California resident and wish to make such a request or if you wish for us to refrain from gathering your Personal Information, please submit your request in writing to the contact details set out in Section 17 below.</p>
    <p><span class="italic">EU Residents</span>. GDPR provides certain rights for EU residents. You may decline to share certain information with us, in which case we may not be able to provide some of the features and functionality of the Services. These rights include, in accordance with applicable law, the right to object to or request the restriction of processing of your information, and to request access to, rectification, erasure and portability of your own information. Where we process your information on the basis of your consent, you have the right to withdraw that consent (noting that such withdrawal does not affect the lawfulness of any Processing performed prior to the date on which we receive notice of such withdrawal, and does not prevent the Processing of your Personal Information in reliance upon any other available legal bases).  Requests should be submitted by contacting us (using the contact instructions in Section 17 below).  If you are an EU resident and have any unresolved privacy concern that we have not addressed satisfactorily after contacting us, you have the right to contact the appropriate EU Supervisory Authority and lodge a complaint.</p>
