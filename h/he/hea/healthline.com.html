      <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

<p>
Internet
privacy is an issue that we take very seriously, and Healthline is
committed to protecting your privacy. We believe it is important for you
to know what information is being collected about you, how that
information is being used, with whom it is being shared, and how to
contact us if you have additional questions or concerns.
</p>

<h3>What information does Healthline gather/track, and how is it used?</h3>
<p>
Information
gathered online can generally be categorized as either anonymous or
personally identifiable. Anonymous information is information that cannot
be traced back to a specific individual. For example, Healthline knows how
many searches are queried each day at each of its Web sites but does not
know the names, e-mail addresses or gender of the people searching. Even
after you have signed up for MyHealthline, we do not know your name or
email address when you are conducting searches.
</p>
<p>
Personally
identifiable information is information you provide that lets us know
specific facts about you so that we can customize the information
Healthline Delivers to you accordingly. This information can include your
name, address, zip code, age, etc. It is our belief that you will find it
beneficial to provide us with personal information so that your experience
with Healthline is more satisfying.
</p>

<h3>Gathering and Use of Anonymous Information </h3>
<p>
Each time a visitor comes to a Healthline
Web site, we collect some information to improve the overall quality of
the online experience, including product monitoring, product improvement,
and targeted advertising. At the Healthline Web sites, we collect the
visitor's domain name (e.g. whether the user is logged on from compaq.com
or whitehouse.gov), referral data (e.g., we record the address of the last
URL a user visited prior to clicking through to an Healthline Web site),
and browser and platform type (e.g., a Internet Explorer browser on a
Windows platform).
</p>
<p>
In addition to collecting these types of
information, Healthline collects aggregate queries for internal reporting
and targeted advertising. We also count, track, and aggregate the
visitor's activity into our analysis of general traffic flows at our sites
(e.g. tracking where traffic comes from, how traffic flows within the
Healthline properties, etc.). To these ends, we may merge information
about you into group data, which may then be shared on an aggregated basis
with our advertisers; but Healthline will not disclose your individual
identity or personal data without your permission. When Healthline does
present aggregated information to outside companies, no one will be able
to identify or contact you for MyHealthline.
</p>

<h3>Use Of 'Cookies'</h3>
<p>
Healthline's Web sites use cookies to monitor traffic
flow, patterns of travel within and through the sites, and to dynamically
generate advertising and content. Cookies are a standard Internet
technology that allows us to both store and retrieve login information on
a user's system. Our Web server automatically asks a new user whether his
or her browser will agree to accept a Healthline cookie file. If a visitor
accepts, our Web server will identify the user's cookie for Healthline's
use in internal reporting. If a user accepts a Healthline cookie, but
would later like to remove it from his or her computer, he or she can just
remove it from the browser.
</p>

<h3>Web Beacons</h3>
<p>
Some Healthline Web pages use Web beacons in conjunction with cookies to
compile aggregate statistics about website usage. A Web beacon is an electronic
image, called an action tag, or single-pixel (1x1), or clear GIF. Web beacons
can recognize certain types of anonymous information (non-personally
identifiable information, or non-PII) on a visitor's computer, such as a
visitor's cookie number, time and date of a page view, and a description of the
page where the Web beacon is placed. You have the option to render some Web
beacons unusable by rejecting their associated cookies.
</p>

<h3>Third-party Media Companies</h3>
<p>
Healthline uses a third-party advertising company to serve ads when you visit
our Web site. Our advertising partner?s Ad Server may use cookies when you view
pages on our site; these cookies collect anonymous (non-PII) information as a
way of measuring the effectiveness of advertising sold on Healthline. Our
sponsors and advertisers have agreed that they will not collect any personally
identifiable information from our site visitors while they are on Healthline.
If you click on an advertisement on Healthline and visit a site maintained by
one of our sponsors or advertisers, please be aware that we are not responsible
for the privacy practices of those sites. You should read the privacy policies
of each site you visit to determine what information that site may be
collecting about you.
</p>
<p>
Some Ad Servers allow you to opt out of anonymous data collection through the
use of cookies. To do so, you must opt out of such data collection with each
individual site. You can opt out of cookies for several Ad Servers by visiting
the Network Advertising Initiative gateway opt-out site <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/optout_nonppii.asp">
http://www.networkadvertising.org/optout_nonppii.asp</a>. At that site you can
also review the privacy policies of those Ad Servers.
</p>

<h3>Gathering and Use of Personally Identifiable Information</h3>
<p>
We collect personally
identifiable information that you provide to us when you register as a
member of Healthline and/or when you update your member profile. We use
the personally identifiable information that you supply to provide you the
specific services you select, send you emails about Web site maintenance
and updates, which may include new features and enhanced
functionality.
</p>
<p>
Personally identifiable information is not shared
with third parties unless Healthline has your permission to do so.
Healthline occasionally sponsors sweepstakes, contests, or other events
that require the collection, processing, and storage of individual contact
and demographic information is likely to be shared with participating
sponsors. A registrant's personal contact and demographic information will
not be released to third party or non-participating organizations without
the user's consent, and Healthline will request that co-sponsors of such
events maintain the privacy of the registrants' information. When
appropriate, users will be given the opportunity to receive information
from third-party organizations in connection with services or events
offered by Healthline. This option may be made available through
Healthline 's registration and/or through registration processes
maintained by a participating third-party. In all cases, you will be
informed before you register for the event of service that a third party
will be receiving the registration information you provide, and you will
have the option not to participate in any service or event that requires
third party involvement.
</p>

<h3>With whom does Healthline share the information it gathers/tracks?</h3>
<p>
Healthline does not
provide third-party access to your personal information except in the
aggregate and only after the information has been de-identified. The
information will be in the form of grouped statistics compiled from our
users' answers to survey questions and on-site behavior. Healthline will
not disclose the contact or demographic information of any individual user
to advertisers or any other outside organization without the express
