          <p><b>a. General.</b> Sickbay Health Media recognizes the premium you 
            place on privacy protection on the Internet. Our employees share the 
            same concerns! Working together, we strive to protect your privacy, 
            including the non-identifying information you share in the personal 
            profile that you must complete in order to become a participating 
            member ("Member") within the Interactive Areas of this Site. </p>
          <p>Sickbay Health Media does not collect personally identifiable information 
            about Members or other Healthline.com, Sickbay.com, or Netsweat.com 
            users ("Users") except when such individuals specifically provide 
            such information on a voluntary basis. A Member's or User's access 
            to and use of the Healthline.com, Sickbay.com, or Netsweat.com Sites 
            or services constitutes information voluntarily given by the Member 
            or User.</p>
          <p><b>b. Use of Registration Information.</b> Personally identifiable 
            information of individual Members and Users will not be sold or otherwise 
            transferred to unaffiliated third parties without the Member's or 
            User's prior consent. Sickbay Health Media stores the Internet Protocol 
            (IP) address of your computer when you visit our site. This information 
            is only used to create broad demographic summaries of where our Members 
            and Users come from: for example, we know what percentage of Members 
            or Users come from Asia or South America, but our use of the IP addresses 
            does not include identifying who those users actually are. However, 
            Sickbay Health Media may use registration information and other voluntarily 
            submitted information in the following ways:<br>
          </p>
        </dir>
        <ul>
          <ul>
            <li>To provide our editors with information that is useful in developing

              Members and Users;</li>
            <li>To provide advertisers with aggregate - never individual - information 
              about our Member base and User usage patterns; and</li>
            <li>To allow us to potentially vary advertising based on Member and 
              User preference. </li>

              Sickbay Health Media reserves the right to perform statistical analyses 
              and profiling of Member and User behavior and characteristics in 
              order to measure interest in and use of the various areas of the 
              site and to inform advertisers of such information. Sickbay Health 
              Media will provide only aggregate data from these analyses to third 
              parties; no personally identifiable information will be disclosed. 
              Sickbay Health Media may sometimes permit third parties to offer 
              subscription and/or registration-based services through Healthline.com, 
              Sickbay.com, or Netsweat.com. In this event, Sickbay.com is not 
              responsible for any actions or policies of such third parties and 
              Members and Users should check the applicable privacy policy of

            <p>It is not possible for a Member or User to delete his or her profile 
              from our database, nor is it feasible to delete all traces of a 
              Member's or User's activity in the system. Messages posted to the 
              boards are examples of user activities that are not feasible to 
              delete. However, we do offer you the opportunity to request deletion 
              of your email address-the only individually identifiable piece of 
              information about your account - from Sickbay Health Media's database.</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>Healthline.com, Sickbay.com, and Netsweat.com send regular email 
              updates to Members. If you wish to have your email address deleted 
              from our database, follow the directions included at the bottom 
              of the email you received. Please allow two to three business days 
              for the actual cancellation to take effect. We will not share your
