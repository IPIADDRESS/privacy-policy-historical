  <title>Healthline - Privacy Policy</title>


<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p>
Internet
privacy is an issue that we take very seriously and Healthline is
committed to protecting your privacy. We believe it is important for
you
to know what information is being collected about you, how that
information is being used, with whom it is being shared, and how to
contact us if you have additional questions or concerns.
</p>
<h3>What information does Healthline gather/track, and how is it used?</h3>
<p>
Information
gathered online can generally be categorized as either anonymous or
personally identifiable. Anonymous information is information that
cannot
be traced back to a specific individual. For example, Healthline knows
how
many searches are queried each day at each of its Web sites but does
not
know the names, e-mail addresses or gender of the people searching.
Even
after you have signed up for MyHealthline, we do not know your name or
email address when you are conducting searches.
</p>
<p>
Personally
identifiable information is information you provide that lets us know
specific facts about you so that we can customize the information
Healthline delivers to you accordingly. This information can include
your
name, address, zip code, age, etc. It is our belief that you will find
it
beneficial to provide us with personal information so that your
experience
with Healthline is more satisfying.
</p>
<h3>Gathering and Use of Anonymous Information </h3>
<p>
Each time a visitor comes to a Healthline web site, we collect some
information to improve the overall quality of
the online experience, including product monitoring, product
improvement,
and targeted advertising. At the Healthline web site, we collect the
visitor's domain name (e.g. whether the user is logged on from aol.com
or whitehouse.gov), referral data (e.g., we record the address of the
last
URL a user visited prior to clicking through to the Healthline web
site),
and browser and platform type (e.g., Microsoft Internet Explorer 6.0
browser on a
Windows XP platform).
</p>
<p>
In addition to collecting these types of
information, Healthline collects aggregate queries for internal
reporting
and targeted advertising. We also count, track, and aggregate the
visitor's activity into our analysis of general traffic flows at our
sites
(e.g. tracking where traffic comes from, how traffic flows within the
Healthline properties, etc.). To these ends, we may merge information
about you into group data, which may then be shared on an aggregated
basis
with our advertisers; but Healthline will not disclose your individual
identity or personal data without your permission. When Healthline does
present aggregated information to outside companies, no one will be
able
to identify or contact you.
</p>
<h3>Use Of 'Cookies'</h3>
<p>
Healthline's web sites use cookies to monitor traffic
flow, patterns of travel within and through the sites, and to
dynamically
generate advertising and content. Cookies are a standard Internet
technology that allows us to both store and retrieve login information
on
a user's system. Our web server automatically asks a new user whether
his
or her browser will agree to accept a Healthline cookie file. If a
visitor
accepts, our web server will identify the user's cookie for
Healthline's
use in internal reporting. If a user accepts a Healthline cookie, but
would later like to remove it from his or her computer, he or she can
just
remove it from the browser.
</p>
<h3>Web Beacons</h3>
<p>
Some Healthline web pages use web beacons in conjunction with cookies
to
compile aggregate statistics about web site usage. A web beacon is an
electronic
image, called an action tag, or single pixel (1x1), or clear GIF. Web
beacons
can recognize certain types of anonymous information (non-personally
identifiable information, or non-PII) on a visitor's computer, such as
a
visitor's cookie number, time and date of a page view, and a
description of the
page where the web beacon is placed. You have the option to render some
web
beacons unusable by rejecting their associated cookies.
</p>
<h3>Third-party Media Companies</h3>
<p>
Healthline uses third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you
visit
our web site. Our advertising partners' Ad Server may use cookies when
you view
pages on our site; these cookies collect anonymous (non-PII)
information as a
way of measuring the effectiveness of advertising sold on Healthline 


 and to help tailor ads at other web sites you visit.
Our
sponsors and advertisers have agreed that they will not collect any
personally
identifiable information from our site visitors while they are on
Healthline.
If you click on an advertisement on Healthline and visit a site
maintained by
one of our sponsors or advertisers, please be aware that we are not
responsible
for the privacy practices of those sites. You should read the privacy
policies
of each site you visit to determine what information that site may be
collecting about you.
</p>
<p>
Some Ad Servers allow you to opt out of anonymous data collection
through the
use of cookies. To do so, you must opt out of such data collection with
each
individual site. You can opt out of cookies for several Ad Servers by
visiting
the Network Advertising Initiative gateway opt-out site <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/optout_nonppii.asp">
http://www.networkadvertising.org/optout_nonppii.asp</a>. At that site
you can
also review the privacy policies of those Ad Servers.
</p>
<h3>Gathering and Use of Personally Identifiable Information</h3>
<p>
We collect personally
identifiable information that you provide to us when you register as a
member of Healthline and/or when you update your member profile. We use
the personally identifiable information that you supply to provide you
with the
specific services you select and to send you emails about web site
maintenance
and updates, which may include new features and enhanced
functionality.
</p>
<p>
Personally identifiable information is not shared
with third parties unless Healthline has your permission to do so.
Healthline occasionally sponsors sweepstakes, contests, or other events
that require the collection, processing, and storage of individual
contact
and demographic information that may or may not be shared with
participating
sponsors. A registrant's personal contact and demographic information
will
not be released to third party or non-participating organizations
without
the user's consent, and Healthline will request that co-sponsors of
such
events maintain the privacy of the registrants' information. When
appropriate, users will be given the opportunity to receive information
from third-party organizations in connection with services or events
offered by Healthline. This option may be made available through
Healthline 's registration and/or through registration processes
maintained by a participating third-party. In all cases, you will be
informed before you register for the event of service that a third
party
will be receiving the registration information you provide, and you
will
have the option not to participate in any service or event that
requires
third party involvement.
</p>
<h3>With whom does Healthline share the information it gathers/tracks?</h3>
<p>
Healthline does not
provide third-party access to your personal information except in the
aggregate and only after the information has been de-identified. The
information will be in the form of grouped statistics compiled from our
users' answers to survey questions and on-site behavior. Healthline
will
not disclose the contact or demographic information of any individual
user
to advertisers or any other outside organization without the express
permission of the individual. Healthline uses a third-party company to
serve ads when you visit our web site. This company may use certain
information (not including your name, address, email address or
telephone
number) about your visit to our web site in order to provide
advertisements to our web site, our third-party advertiser may place or
recognize a unique cookie on your browser.
</p>
<h3>E-mail Choice/Opt-Out</h3>
<p>Each e-mail newsletter and special offer sent by Healthline contains
an easy, automated way for you to cease receiving our e-mail
newsletters. One click of the mouse is all that is required — the
system automatically excludes you from future mailings without needing
additional human intervention. To unsubscribe, click the "unsubscribe"
link in the footer of any e-mail newsletter from Healthline. If you do
not have Internet access, please reply to your Healthline e-mail and
type the word "UNSUBSCRIBE" in the subject line. Healthline will not
rent, sell or barter your email address to third parties, nor will we
share your name with marketing partners unless you check a special box
on our site to request third-party offers sent from Healthline.<br>
</p>
<p>Members of MyHealthline may also elect to receive News Alerts and
Blog Alerts via email. To change mailing frequency, or to unsubscribe
from New Alerts or Blog Alerts, MyHealthline Members should log into
their account to update their preferences.<br>
</p>
<h3>User Research</h3>
<p>
On
occasion, Healthline will make available to potential advertisers and
research firms aggregated results from research it has conducted on its
user base. Once again, Healthline will only provide such demographic
information on an aggregated basis and does not disclose individual
member
profiles without user consent.
</p>
<h3>Special Policy With Regards to Information from Children Under
Thirteen</h3>
<p>
In accordance with
the Federal Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 (COPPA),
Healthline will never knowingly request personally identifiable
information from anyone under the age of 13 without parental consent.
When
we do receive information (with parental consent) from users under the
age
of 13, we will never voluntarily share their personally identifiable
information with third parties, regardless of their stated preference
given at registration.
