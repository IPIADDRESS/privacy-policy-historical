<p><a name="hsg"></a> <span class="headings">Herbal Safety Guidelines</span></p>
<p><font color="#000000">Before using an herb you are unfamiliar with, find out
its medicinal properties. Research it thoroughly and/or consult with an
appropriately qualified practitioner or expert. If you are taking prescription
drugs, or have a medical condition check with an appropriately qualified
practitioner before using herbs medicinally. Herbs have shown overwhelming
evidence that they work. Just because a small amount works well does NOT mean
that more is better. As individuals we all have different constitutions,
sensitivities, allergic reactions and possible health conditions. The following
are merely guidelines. They include herbs offered on our websites. This list
does not help with administering information on possible interactions and
contraindications with prescription medicine. This needs to be discussed with
your physician.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000"><strong>Should I check with my doctor or healthcare
provider before using a supplement?</strong><br>
This is a good idea, especially for certain population groups. Dietary
supplements may not be risk-free under certain circumstances. If you are
pregnant, nursing a baby, or have a chronic medical condition, such as,
diabetes, hypertension or heart disease, be sure to consult your doctor or
pharmacist before purchasing or taking any supplement. While vitamin and
mineral supplements are widely used and generally considered safe, you may
wish to check with your doctor or pharmacist before taking these or any
other dietary supplements. If you plan to use a dietary supplement in place
of drugs or in combination with any drug, tell your health care provider
first. Many supplements contain active ingredients that have strong
biological effects and their safety is not always assured in all users. If
you have certain health conditions and take these products, you may be
placing yourself at risk.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000"><strong>Some supplements may interact with
prescription and over-the-counter medicines.</strong><br>
Taking a combination of supplements or using these products together with
medications (whether prescription or OTC drugs) could under certain
circumstances produce adverse effects. Be alert to advisories about these
products, whether taken alone or in combination. For example: Coumadin (a
prescription medicine), ginkgo biloba (an herbal supplement), aspirin (an
OTC drug) and vitamin E (a vitamin supplement) can each thin the blood, and
taking any of these products together can increase the potential for
internal bleeding.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000"><strong>Some supplements can have unwated effects
during surgery.</strong><br>
It is important to fully inform your doctor about the vitamins, minerals,
herbals or any other supplements you are taking, especially before elective
surgery. You may be asked to stop taking these products at least 2-3 weeks
ahead of the procedure to avoid potentially dangerous supplement/drug
interactions -- such as changes in heart rate, blood pressure and increased
bleeding - that could adversely affect the outcome of your surgery.</font></p>
