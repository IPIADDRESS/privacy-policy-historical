                    </ul>

                <h3>Our information security standards</h3>
                    <p>We have developed policies and procedures to keep your personal information confidential and secure. We restrict access to those employees and other persons who must use that information to provide services on our behalf. We maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards, in compliance with applicable laws, regulations and industry standards, to protect the confidentiality of the personal information we obtain.</p>

                    <p>We require our service providers to maintain the same level of confidentiality and security that we do. We continually update and improve our security standards and procedures to help protect against anyone gaining unauthorized access to your confidential information and to prevent fraud.</p>

                <h3>Online Privacy and Security</h3>
                    <p>We collect and use the information you provide us online to respond to your needs, service your accounts, and provide online transaction services. We do not collect personally identifiable information about you unless you voluntarily provide us with that information through email or online applications. </p>

                <h3>Use of "Cookies" on HealthEquity’s Web Sites</h3>
                    <p>While visitors to our Web site(s) remain anonymous, we do occasionally utilize "cookies" to provide a more valuable experience. Such cookies are used only to enhance the customer’s experience. We do not use cookies for marketing purposes. (A cookie is a small text file sent by a Web server and stored on your hard drive in your browser. Cookies cannot "read" information about you from your computer or be used to "steal" information about you; cookies do not carry viruses and are not programs that can perform functions on your computer. Most browsers will allow you to disable cookies, or can be set to notify you when you receive a cookie, thus giving you the opportunity to decide whether or not to accept it.) If you choose to disable cookies certain functionality on the website may be impaired or may not work at all.</p>

                <h3>IDs and passwords</h3>
                    <p>To access certain online services, you will need a User ID and a Password. This information may either be provided to you or you will be allowed to choose your own. The User ID and Password are designed to protect you by confirming your identity to our computer network systems, and are to be kept confidential. Our employees do not have access to your password. It is very important that you not share this information or allow a computer to "remember" your password, particularly if you are using a computer with public access such as one located in a library. For additional security, you may be required to change your password from time to time.</p>

                <h3>Other Authorized Users of the Account</h3>
                    <p>Depending on the type of account, the primary account holder may grant the authority to someone else to use the account (such as a spouse, dependent, or a legal representative). The primary account holder is at all times responsible for the transactions those authorized individuals made. Those authorized users will have access to the account balance if they are properly authenticated by our system. The primary account holder should inform those individuals that he/she can see ALL of the transactions those individuals made, and therefore, should have no expectations of privacy.</p>

                    <p>Depending on the type of account, the primary account holder may grant the authority to someone else to access the account information, including all transaction history. This authority is different from the right to use the account. If the primary account holder grants authority to access the account, once we authenticate the individual’s identity, that individual will have full access to the account information, just like the primary account holder.</p>

                <h3>Encryption and Security</h3>
                    <p>Information provided via our web portal is submitted within a secure session. These sessions utilize Transport Layer Security (TLS, formerly known as SSL) technology in order to ensure that the information is encrypted while in transit. Your browser must be able to support this technology in order to use our web services.</p>

                <h3>E-mail</h3>
                    <p>E-mail, by nature, is not secure and may be intercepted and viewed by others. Therefore, you should refrain from sending email that contains any confidential or private information, such as your member ID, your social security, or credit card number. We will not send you any email that contains confidential information that would allow identity theft (such as SSN) or contains protected information (such as your health information).</p>

                <h3>Other HealthEquity services</h3>
                    <p>If you have a Health Savings Account, and your account balance exceeds a certain minimum (normally $7,500, but varies depending on how your account was established), you will be eligible to use our web-only investment advisor services offered by HealthEquity Advisors, LLC, a wholly owned company of HealthEquity, Inc. If you choose to use HealthEquity Advisors, LLC services, your consent to make all account information contained in HealthEquity, Inc.’s system available to HealthEquity Advisors, LLC, and further authorize the use of those information to provide you with the services. Finally, in order for HealthEquity Advisors, LLC to provide you with meaningful information, you will be asked to provide complete and accurate financial information not contained in our system. If you provide such information, you are consenting to the use of the information as described in HealthEquity Advisors, LLC user/services agreement. </p>

                <h3>Links to other web sites</h3>
                    <p>HealthEquity works with a number of other companies to ensure that we are providing the value and service you expect. Some of these companies offer "co-branded" or "alliance" products; others may be third parties who provide additional online products and services. By using their services you are authorizing us to share and/or provide private information to them, which may be stored on their servers. You will see a disclosure on our site that alerts you when you are leaving our Web site. These parties often have their own privacy policies, and may have online data collection policies that may differ from ours. Although we encourage these parties to adopt and follow privacy procedures, we are not responsible for their use of your personal information and our Privacy Notice does not cover their information practices. Therefore, for your protection, we recommend that you review the privacy notices provided on their Web sites.</p>

                <h3>Links from employers or health plans</h3>
                    <p>If your account was established by your employer or your health plan, they may have requested that we set up a communication channel whereby you can log into HealthEquity’s portal (known as Single Sign on) or access your account information through their site without entering your user name and password again. Your employer or health plan also may have contracted with another vendor that provides additional services, such as personal health care costs management, that allows you to log into HealthEquity’s portal or access your HealthEquity’s account information through that vendor’s website, also without entering your HealthEquity user name and password. When you use those websites to sign into HealthEquity’s portal or access your account information, you are authorizing HealthEquity’s system to pass on certain personal information, such as your account balances, to those systems.</p>

                <h3>Opt out instructions</h3>
                    <p>If you wish to be excluded from HealthEquity’s marketing efforts, or terminate the sharing of information where permitted by your health plan or employer service agreement with HealthEquity , simply call HealthEquity toll-free at 866.346.5800.</p>

                <h3>California and Vermont privacy notice</h3>
                    <p>For California and Vermont residents, the information sharing practices described above are in accordance with federal law. California and Vermont law places additional restrictions on sharing information about their residents, and our policies comply with such restrictions.</p>

                    <p>California Civil Code Section 1798.83 permits you, if you are a California resident, to request certain information regarding disclosure of personal information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes. To make such a request, please send an e-mail to legal@healthequity.com or write us at Privacy Officer, HealthEquity, Inc., 15 W Scenic Pointe Drive, Suite 100, Draper, UT 84020.</p>

                    <p>Cal. Bus. And Prof. Code Section 22575 also requires us to notify you how we deal with the "Do Not Track" settings in your browser. Currently, HealthEquity’s system does not respond to the Do Not Track settings.</p>

                <h3>Nevada privacy notice</h3>
                    <p>Nevada law requires that we also provide Nevada residents with the following contact information: Bureau of Consumer Protection, Office of the Nevada Attorney General, 555 E Washington St., Suite 3900, Las Vegas, NV 89101; phone: 702.486.3132; e-mail: <a href="mailto:BCPINFO@ag.state.nv.us">BCPINFO@ag.state.nv.us</a>.</p>

                    <p>We hope our Privacy Notice will help you understand how we collect and share information. If you have any questions, please contact us. We are required by federal and state law to provide you with a copy of our Privacy Notice every twelve months. We reserve the right to change this Privacy Notice, in whole or in part, by providing notice in accordance with applicable law.</p>

                <h3>Entities covered by this privacy policy</h3>
                    <p>Unless we specifically named an entity, this privacy policy covers both HealthEquity, Inc. and its subsidiaries, including but not limited to HealthEquity Advisors, LLC. </p>
