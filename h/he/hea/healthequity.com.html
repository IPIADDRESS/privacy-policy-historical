                        <li>From information you provide us on our website</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Our information security standards</h3>
                    <p>We have developed policies and procedures to keep your personal information confidential and secure. We restrict access to those employees and other persons who must use that information to provide services on our behalf. We maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards, in compliance with applicable laws, regulations and industry standards, to protect the confidentiality of the personal information we obtain.</p>

                    <p>We require our service providers to maintain the same level of confidentiality and security that we do. We continually update and improve our security standards and procedures to help protect against anyone gaining unauthorized access to your confidential information and to prevent fraud.</p>

                    <h3>Online Privacy and Security</h3>
                    <p>We collect and use the information you provide us online to respond to your needs, service your accounts, and provide online transaction services. We do not collect personally identifiable information about you unless you voluntarily provide us with that information through email or online applications. </p>

                <h3>Use of "Cookies" on HealthEquity's Web Sites</h3>
                    <p>While visitors to our web site(s) remain anonymous, we do occasionally utilize "cookies" to provide a more valuable experience. Such cookies are used only to enhance the customer's experience. We do not use cookies for marketing purposes. (A cookie is a small text file sent by a Web server and stored on your hard drive in your browser. Cookies cannot "read" information about you from your computer or be used to "steal" information about you; cookies do not carry viruses and are not programs that can perform functions on your computer. Most browsers will allow you to disable cookies, or can be set to notify you when you receive a cookie, thus giving you the opportunity to decide whether or not to accept it.) If you choose to disable cookies certain functionality on the website may be impaired or may not work at all.</p>

                    <h3>IDs and passwords</h3>
                    <p>To access certain online services, you will need a User ID and a Password. This information may either be provided to you or you will be allowed to choose your own. The User ID and Password are designed to protect you by confirming your identity to our computer network systems, and are to be kept confidential. Our employees do not have access to your password. It is very important that you not share this information or allow a computer to "remember" your password, particularly if you are using a computer with public access such as one located in a library. For additional security, you may be required to change your password from time to time.</p>

                    <h3>Other Authorized Users of the Account</h3>
                    <p>Depending on the type of account, the account holder may grant the authority to someone else to use the account (such as a spouse, dependent, or a legal representative). The account holder is at all times responsible for the transactions those authorized individuals made. Those authorized users will have access to the account balance if they are properly authenticated by our system. The account holder should inform those individuals that he/she can see ALL of the transactions those individuals made, and therefore, should have no expectations of privacy.</p>

                    <p>Depending on the type of account, the account holder may grant the authority to someone else to access the account information, including all transaction history. This authority is different from the right to use the account. If the account holder grants authority to access the account, once we authenticate the individual's identity, that individual will have full access to the account information, just like the account holder.</p>

                    <h3>Encryption and Security</h3>
                    <p>Information provided via our web portal is submitted within a secure session. These sessions utilize Transport Layer Security (TLS, formerly known as SSL) technology in order to ensure that the information is encrypted while in transit. Your browser must be able to support this technology in order to use our web services.</p>

                    <h3>E-mail</h3>
                    <p>E-mail, by nature, is not secure and may be intercepted and viewed by others. Therefore, you should refrain from sending email that contains any confidential or private information, such as your member ID, your social security, or credit card number. We will not send you any email that contains confidential information that would allow identity theft (such as SSN) or contains protected information (such as your health information).</p>

                <h3>HealthEquity Advisor services</h3>
                    <p>If you have an HSA, and your account balance exceeds a certain minimum (normally $7,500, but varies depending on how your account was established), you will be eligible to use our <a href="https://healthequity.com/learn/hsa/advisor" target="_blank">web-only investment advisor services</a> offered by HealthEquity Advisors, LLC, a wholly owned company of HealthEquity, Inc. If you choose to use HealthEquity Advisors, LLC services, your consent to make all account information contained in HealthEquity, Inc.'s system available to HealthEquity Advisors, LLC, and further authorize the use of those information to provide you with the services. Finally, in order for HealthEquity Advisors, LLC to provide you with meaningful information, you will be asked to provide complete and accurate financial information not contained in our system. If you provide such information, you are consenting to the use of the information as described in HealthEquity Advisors, LLC user/services agreement. </p>
                
                <h3>Employer, health plan, or insurance company disclosures</h3>
                     <p>If you open or maintain an HSA through or in association with an employer, health plan, health insurance company, benefits administrator, benefits aggregator, or other entity, or those operating on behalf of such entities (each, an "Agent"), we may disclose HSA information, including but not limited to personally identifiable information, to your Agent related to the opening and maintenance of your HSA, and to ensure the security of our network and services, to protect against or prevent potential fraud or unauthorized transactions, or as otherwise permitted or required by law. When your Agent notifies us that your association with the Agent has been terminated, we will cease disclosing your information to that Agent, with a reasonable time for us to act on such notification.</p>
                    <p>If your Agent is subject to any rules of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") that may indirectly or directly require the Agent of monitor your beneficial ownership of securities issued by clients of the Agent, we may disclose to your Agent the fact that you have or have not invested in securities through your HSA, the value of your ownership interest in such securities, detail regarding your transactions in such securities, and any other information that the Agent reasonably requests for purposes of facilitating its compliance with such SEC rules, unless you opt out of such sharing. To opt out, contact Member Services. Note that this opt-out only extends to the sharing described in this paragraph.</p>

                <h3>SSO or links to other web sites</h3>
                    <p>Your Agent, retirement plan, or 401k recordkeeper, as part of a service offering, may have set up the capability whereby you can access the Agent's, retirement plan's, 401k recordkeeper's, or another third party's website from our website without the need to enter your login credentials to access the third party;s website. This is often called "single sign on". You may see a disclosure on our website that alerts you when you are leaving our website and accessing the website of the third party. If you have questions about this arrangement, please contact your Agent, retirement plan, or 401k recordkeeper.</p>
                <h3>Data sharing arrangements</h3>
                   <p>Your Agent, retirement plan, or 401k recordkeeper, as part of a service offering and for your convenience, may have enabled functionality that would permit you to view your HSA information on the Agent's, retirement plan's, 401k recordkeeper's, or another third party's website or for other purposes that support the data sharing arrangement. If you have such an arrangement, we will share the information defined in the arrangement (such as account balance or investment information) that is necessary to provide the service with your Agent, retirement plan, 401k recordkeeper or another third party, which may be stored on their servers or systems. We are not responsible for the privacy and security practices of your Agent or another third party, and do not control their use or further disclosure of HSA information.</p>

               
            <h3>Notice of Privacy practices</h3>
