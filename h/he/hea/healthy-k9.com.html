      <p><strong>Providing Visitors with Anonymous Access</strong><br>

        You can access our Web site home page and browse our site without disclosing your personal data. </p>

      <p><strong>The services and links of our Web site</strong><br>

        Our Web site  enables our visitors to communicate with other visitors and to post information to be accessed by others. </p>

      <p><strong>Automatic Collection of Information</strong><br>

        As is typical, our web host logs http requests to their server. This means that we know the originating IP (e.g. 18.29.0.1) address of a user agent requesting a URL. We also know the Referrer and User-Agent information accompanied with an HTTP request. They do not log the specific identity of visitors. We occasionally analyze the log files to determine which files are most requested and the previous site or user agent which prompted the request. Our logging is passive; we do not use technologies such as cookies to maintain any information on users. Logged information is kept indefinitely as administrative and research material; it is not disclosed outside of our organization. Aggregate (completely non-identifying) statistics generated from these logs may be reported as part of research results. </p>
