<p>Each third party website and social media network has its own terms and privacy policy regarding information stored, collected, processed and shared on those respective website and networks. &nbsp;So, your participation with Hearsay on those websites and social media networks is subject to the websites’ and social media networks’ terms and privacy policy, not ours.</p>
<p>You should not provide Hearsay with any personally identifiable information (or post any personally identifiable information to the Hearsay Website) unless you would like that information to be used in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</p>
<h3>Do Not Track Statement</h3>
<p>Certain internet web browsers allow a “do not track” (DNT) setting that relies on a technology known as a DNT header, which sends a signal to websites visited by the individual about the individual’s browser DNT setting. At this time, we do not currently commit to respond to DNT signals, whether that signal is received on a computer or on a mobile device. &nbsp;Learn more about DNT<a href="https://allaboutdnt.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'https://allaboutdnt.com/', ' here']);"> here</a>.</p>

<h2 id="service">Service-Specific Privacy and Customer Data</h2>
<p>All Services are accessible via an internet browser and certain services also have a mobile app. Generally, our Customers are companies who give their employees, contractors and agents access to the Hearsay Services (those individuals are collectively, “End Users”).</p>
<h3>Collection of personally identifiable information we control</h3>
<p>Hearsay Social collects the email addresses of those who communicate with us via email, contact information of Users that communicate through other channels (such as phone number and physical address), information on what pages Users visit on the Hearsay Website, IP addresses of those accessing the Hearsay Website, information volunteered by the user (such as survey information), and information collected from the User of the Service (e.g. name) (“Hearsay Data”). &nbsp;This also includes information on the senders and recipients of communications sent using Hearsay Services (including Mail and Messages), by the User of the Service and the people they are communicating with.</p>
<h3>Use of personally identifiable information</h3>
<p>The Hearsay Data we collect and process is used to improve the content of our website and the quality of our Services and to contact Users.</p>
<h3>Data we process as a data processor to provide the Hearsay Social Service</h3>
<p>We act as a data processor for our Customers that use the Service. We process information that our Users and/or Customer’s End User Contacts provide, or grant us access to, after either (i) giving their explicit consent to connect their social media accounts to the Service; or (ii) submitting their contact information (name, job title, company name, business address, and/or phone number to the Service (“Services Data”). &nbsp;We may use Services Data across multiple products to enable End User Contact communications, such as sending and receiving email, sending and receiving text messages, populating website information at the request of End User’s organization, and other digital communications. Services Data processed includes the content of any posts End User Contacts make to social media sites in order to enable our Customers to monitor the social media activity of its Users. We use the Services Data solely in order to provide the Service in accordance with our license agreement. &nbsp;Such use includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Monitoring: Our Service monitors content posted to connected social media accounts in accordance with the terms our license agreement.</li>
<li>Multi-Service Use: If an End User purchases or is otherwise granted a license to another Hearsay Service, we may use Services Data derived from the End User’s social media account to populate information within the additional Hearsay Service. &nbsp;For example, we may populate Hearsay Sites contact information with a Customer’s business address or an individual End User’s business address from his or her social media account. &nbsp;&nbsp;When an End User deactivates his or her Hearsay Social account from the Hearsay Social Engage Solution platform, the token will be deleted from our Service and our Service will have no access to such accounts. &nbsp;We may, however, continue to include Services Data derived from social media within another Hearsay Service for as long as the End User maintains a license for the particular Hearsay Service, unless the End User (or the Customer on behalf of the End User) submits a request for deletion of Services Data to <a href="mailto:privacy@hearsaysocial.com">privacy@hearsaysocial.com</a>.</li>
<li>Authentication: Once a registered End User links his or her social media account to our Hearsay Social Engage Solution platform, we request and subsequently store an End User access token for such account. This will only occur if the End User explicitly grants permission. Our platform is then able to access content of posts and other interactions within that social media account and also write information to that social network account when explicitly instructed to do so by the registered End User.</li>
<li>Analysis: Our Services monitor information posted or sent, and the corresponding responses or engagements (any actions taking on the piece of content that is trackable) to report on, analyze and better understand the expected responses to posting or sending additional content broadly, or to a specific individual.</li>
<li>Disclosure to Customers: Our Service provides supervision capability for each Customer to report on content, and review of content, posted by their employees, contractors and personnel that have connected their accounts to our service.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Confidentiality</h3>
<p>We have comprehensive security controls to protect against unauthorized review and use of the personal information that is submitted to or processed by us, including electronic safeguards such as encryption software and firewalls. Access to personal information is restricted to authorized employees only.</p>
<h3>Disclosure to third parties</h3>
<p>Hearsay Data and Services Data are not shared with or sold to other organizations except under the following circumstances:</p>
<ul>
<li>To the extent permitted by applicable law, we may disclose information where it is necessary in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities (including cooperating with governmental authorities and law enforcement agencies regarding the investigation of illegal activities), suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, or as otherwise required by law.</li>
<li>To the extent permitted by applicable law, we may transfer information about you to a successor or acquirer of Hearsay Social, in which case such successor’s or acquirer’s use of such information shall be subject to this Privacy Policy and our contractual obligations.</li>
<li>We do not share your information with third parties for the third parties’ own and independent direct marketing purposes unless we receive your permission.</li>
</ul>
