<h3>What is a cookie?</h3>
<p>A cookie is a small text file that we, and in certain circumstances third parties, place on your browser when you visit our websites or open some of our emails.<br>
Cookies, amongst other things, allow HEALTHY FIFTY to recognise you each time you re-visit one of our websites and provide you with a more personalised user experience. There are in existence a variety of different cookies which are designed for use in specific sets of circumstances.</p>
<h3>How do we and third parties use cookies?</h3>
<p>You should be aware that information on you may be collected through the use of cookies when you use HEALTHY FIFTYMedia websites and/or selected third party sites. It is essential that we use some cookies in order to provide you with the services you have requested from us. Some cookies, however, whilst useful, are not essential, and when using HEALTHY FIFTY websites you agree to the use of these non-essential cookies unless you specifically set your browser to reject them. Please see ‘How to manage or refuse cookies’ below for further details.</p>
<p>When you initially enter one of our sites we may place an anonymous cookie on your browser to enable us to recognise you the next time you visit the website. We may also place a further cookie on your browser when you register for one of our services, this will enable us to remember you next time you come to sign in, eliminating the need for you to re-enter your login details and customising your future uses of our sites.</p>
<p>Cookies may also be used to track your use of HEALTHY FIFTYMedia websites to better develop them, for example, determining which parts of the websites are more popular and determining content accordingly.</p>
<p>We may also place cookies on your browser to provide you with behavioural advertising and monitor the advertising on our sites to, amongst other things, ensure that you are not subjected to intrusive advertising.</p>
<p>Small pieces of code called pixel tags, web beacons or GIF files, are used in conjunction with cookies to help us manage and monitor our online advertising and wider business arrangements with third parties. These files will allow us to aggregate anonymous information relating to advertising and website usage. The type of information collected includes, but is not limited to, information relating to advertising responses, page views, promotion views and purchases made. Such pixel tags may be used to recognise third party cookies (cookies generated by third parties) and inform us and/or third parties of which advertisement or link brought you to our website, allowing us to monitor the efficacy of our business relationships with third parties. Please see the section below entitled ‘Use of different cookies’ for more detail on the various cookies in use by HEALTHY FIFTYMedia and how they work.</p>
<h3>How to manage or refuse cookies</h3>
<p>If you do not want your browser to accept cookies and use them in the ways described above it is possible to change your browser settings. It is also possible to delete existing cookies from your browser. However blocking all cookies will affect your web experience and may result in some parts of HEALTHY FIFTY websites not functioning properly. Some cookies are designed to help save you time, for example, by remembering your contact details when you are making an order for the second time â€” this means that you will not have to complete the contact section again unless your details have changed. The procedure for modifying your privacy preferences is different for each internet browser and we recommend you visit the following websites for further information on altering your cookie settings:</p>
