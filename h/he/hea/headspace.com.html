<h2 id="4-tracking-technologies">4. TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES</h2>
<p>Headspace and our analytics partners use technologies such as cookies, beacons, tags, and scripts to enable a service to recognize your device so you don't have to provide the same information several times during one task, recognize that you may have already given a password so you don't need to do it for every web page requested, and to measure how people are using the Products.</p>
<p>We use local storage, such as HTML5, to store content information and preferences. Third parties with whom we partner to provide certain features on the Products also use HTML5 to collect and store information. Various browsers may offer their own management tools for removing HTML5.</p>
<p>We partner with third parties, such as Facebook and Google, to manage our advertising of the Products on other sites or platforms as well as across your other devices based on your past visits to our website. Our third party partners may use technologies such as cookies to gather information about your activities within the Products to deliver such advertising to you, such as retargeting ads. We will acquire consent from you in order to use such trackers for advertising purposes to the extent required by applicable law. We currently do not respond to do-not-track signals. For more information about interest-based ads, including how to opt-out of having your web-browsing information used for behavioral advertising purposes, please visit <a href="http://www.aboutads.info/choices">www.aboutads.info/choices</a>. Please note that this does not opt you out of being served ads. You may continue to receive generic ads on these third party platforms.

<p>We use third party trackers to let us know when users have visited the Products by “clicking-through” our sponsored advertising or content hosted on third party platforms.

This is done to ensure that the Products are available when you want them and are fast.

<h3 id="mobile-analytics">MOBILE ANALYTICS</h3>

<h2 id="5-where-we-store-your-personal-information">5. WHERE WE STORE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION</h2>

<h2 id="6-corporate-and-other-community-sharing">6. CORPORATE AND OTHER COMMUNITY SHARING</h2>
<p>There is interest by large consumer communities (companies, universities, hospitals, etc.) (“Communities”) to introduce the Products to their employees and members. If you have registered to use the Products through a code or other registration credential furnished by a Community (a “Community Subscription”), the Community will have access to your email address, and the date you registered to use the Products, and the date on which you last used the Products. The Community will also have access to general usage information on an anonymized and aggregated basis with all other members of the Community that are using the Products.</p>
<p>Your Community may also have access to your usage information on an individual basis if you have provided appropriate consent under applicable law for such sharing. For example, many employers are offering incentive programs based on employee participation in health &amp; wellness programs and desire to better understand how each of their individual employees is using the Products.</p>

(“Headspace,” “us,” \\\"we,\\\" or “our”) is committed to protecting and respecting your privacy in connection with your use of our website, www.headspace.com (the “Website(s)”), applications (“Apps”) and other products, services and features thereof (the Website, the Apps and such other products, services and features are collectively referred to herein as the “Product” or “Products”, which may be updated from time-to-time at the sole discretion of Headspace). This privacy policy (“Privacy Policy”) and any other documents referred to herein set forth the basis on which any personal information we collect from you, or that you provide to us, in connection with the Products will be processed by us. Please read the following carefully to understand our practices regarding your personal information and how we will collect, use and disclose your personal information. If you have an unresolved privacy or data use concern that we have not addressed satisfactorily, please contact our U.S.-based third party dispute resolution provider (free of charge) at http://go.adr.org/privacyshield.html.\\n\\n## 1. INFORMATION WE MAY COLLECT FROM YOU\\n\\nWe may collect and process the following information about you:\\n•\\tPersonal information including, for example, your name, e-mail address, telephone, information about your usage of the Products and information collected by tracking technologies as further described below that may identify you as an individual or allow online or offline contact with you as an individual.\\n\\n•\\tFor individuals who participate in a Headspace Family plan, we may collect additional personal information, for example, home address in order to verify family member status.\\n\\n•\\tIf, as a primary account holder of a Headspace Family plan, you choose to invite additional family members to become subsidiary account holders, we will ask you for their name and email address.

If your subsidiary account holder(s) would like us to delete their information, they can do so by contacting the primary account holder of their family plan to be removed.\\n\\n•\\tHeadspace does not collect or process credit or debit card (“Payment Card”) information. Apple and Google collect Payment Card information with respect to in-app purchases made through the Apps, and our payment processor collects Payment Card information with respect to purchases made through the Websites.

We follow generally accepted standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once it is received. If you have any questions about the security of your personal information, you can contact us at [help@headspace.com](mailto:help@headspace.com \\\"Help\\\").

Standard text message rates will apply.\\n \\n\\n## 4. TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES\\n\\nHeadspace and our analytics partners use technologies such as cookies, beacons, tags, and scripts to enable a service to recognize your device so you don't have to provide the same information several times during one task, recognize that you may have already given a password so you don't need to do it for every web page requested, and to measure how people are using the Products.\\n\\nWe use local storage, such as HTML5, to store content information and preferences. Third parties with whom we partner to provide certain features on the Products also use HTML5 to collect and store information. Various browsers may offer their own management tools for removing HTML5.\\n\\nWe partner with third parties, such as Facebook and Google, to manage our advertising of the Products on other sites or platforms as well as across your other devices based on your past visits to our website. Our third party partners may use technologies such as cookies to gather information about your activities within the Products to deliver such advertising to you, such as retargeting ads. We will acquire consent from you in order to use such trackers for advertising purposes to the extent required by applicable law. We currently do not respond to do-not-track signals. For more information about interest-based ads, including how to opt-out of having your web-browsing information used for behavioral advertising purposes, please visit www.aboutads.info/choices. Please note that this does not opt you out of being served ads. You may continue to receive generic ads on these third party platforms. You may also opt out of receiving ads across devices by adjusting your ad preference in your Google account.\\n\\nWe use third party trackers to let us know when users have visited the Products by “clicking-through” our sponsored advertising or content hosted on third party platforms. The Products use Google Analytics code to gather statistical information. Google Analytics sets cookies to help us accurately estimate the number of visitors to the Products and the volumes of usage of the Products. This is done to ensure that the Products are available when you want them and are fast. For more information on how Google Analytics processes this information, visit [www.google.com/analytics](https://www.google.com/analytics \\\"Google Analytics\\\").\\n\\n### MOBILE ANALYTICS\\n\\nWe use mobile analytics software to allow us to better understand the functionality of our mobile software on your phone.

Your clicks on links in the newsletter are also saved. These and the open statistics are used in aggregate form to give us an indication of the popularity of the content and to help us make decisions about future content and formatting.\\n\\n## 5. WHERE WE STORE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION\\n\\nAll information you provide to us through the Products is stored on our secure servers located in the US.

CORPORATE AND OTHER COMMUNITY SHARING\\n\\nThere is interest by large consumer communities (companies, universities, hospitals, etc.) (“Communities”) to introduce the Products to their employees and members. If you have registered to use the Products through a code or other registration credential furnished by a Community (a “Community Subscription”), the Community will have access to your email address, and the date you registered to use the Products, and the date on which you last used the Products. The Community will also have access to general usage information on an anonymized and aggregated basis with all other members of the Community that are using the Products.\\n\\nYour Community may also have access to your usage information on an individual basis if you have provided appropriate consent under applicable law for such sharing.
