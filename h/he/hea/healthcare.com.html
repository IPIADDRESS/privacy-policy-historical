<br>
</p>
<h3>1. Collection and Use of Information</h3>
<p>In general, you can visit our Site without telling us who you are or revealing any personal information about yourself. In order to better provide you with numerous products and services, our Site collects two types of information about its visitors: Personally Identifiable Information ("PII") and Non-Personally Identifiable Information.</p>

<br>

Personally Identifiable Information</strong></span><br>

<p><span class="blueTxtLnk"><strong>Registration</strong></span><br>

When you place an order, we require you to provide us with PII. We use this information to give you a customized experience and to process the orders that you place with us.

Our database stores your billing and delivery information, and will automatically transfer it to the order form each time you place an order so that you do not have to re-enter this information when you sign in at subsequent visits.<br>

</p>
<h3 class="blueTxtLnk"><strong>2. Communications from the Site</strong></h3>

<br>
</p>
<p><span class="blueTxtLnk"><strong>Promotional Communications</strong></span><br>
From time to time, we make the e-mail addresses of those who access our site available to other reputable organizations whose products or services we think you might find interesting.

<br>
</p>
<h3>3. Cookies</h3>
<p>A "cookie" is a piece of information that our web site sends to your browser, which then is stored on your system. You may disable or delete cookies at any moment. We use cookies to store visitors preferences, record session information, record user-specific information on what pages users access or visit, alert visitors to new areas that we think might be of interest to them when they return to our site, record past activity at a site in order to provide better service when visitors return to our site, ensure that visitors are not repeatedly sent the same banner ads, and customize Web page content based on visitors' browser type or other information that the visitor sends. We do not link the information we store in cookies to any personally identifiable information you submit while on our site. Some of our business partners (e.g., advertisers) may use cookies on our site. We have no access to or control over these cookies. This privacy statement covers the use of cookies by this site only and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.<br>
<br>
</p>
<h3>4. IP Addresses</h3>

<br>
</p>
<h3>5. Security</h3>
<p>We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personally identifiable information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personally identifiable information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.<br>
<br>

<br>
HealthCare.com uses technology provided by a third-party advertising company to serve ads when you visit this Web site.  This technology may use information about your visit to this Web site in order to provide advertisements about goods and services that may be of interest to you.  In the course of serving advertisements to this Web site, such third-party advertising technology may place or recognize a unique cookie on your browser.  If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used to target ads to you, please visit &lt;<a href="http://www.doubleclick.net/us/corporate/privacy" target="_blank">http://www.doubleclick.net/us/corporate/privacy</a>&gt;. In addition, you have the ability to accept or decline cookies by modifying the settings in your browser.<br>
<br>
HealthCare.com may also use a third party ad network provider to help present advertisements on this Web site. Third-party ad serving enables HealthCare.com to target advertisements to you for products and services you might be interested in. These third party network advertisers, along with other advertisers and sponsors on the Web site, may use cookies, web beacons (also called single pixel gifs or action tags) or similar technologies (and, in the case of cookies, access them on your computer if you choose to have cookies enabled in your browser) to serve you advertisements tailored to interests you have shown by browsing on this and other sites you have visited, to determine whether you have seen a particular advertisement before and to avoid sending you duplicated advertisements. In doing so, the provider collects non-personal data such as your browser type, your operating system, Web pages visited, time of visits, content viewed, ads viewed and other clickstream data. The use of third party cookies, web beacons and similar technologies by these ad network providers is governed by each third party's specific privacy policy, not this one. Please visit <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/optout_nonppii.asp" target="_blank">http://www.networkadvertising.org/optout_nonppii.asp</a> to learn more about the information collection practices and "opt-out" procedures of third party ad networks we may use.<br>
