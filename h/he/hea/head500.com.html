      <br>
      <strong>The Way We Use Information</strong> <br>
      <br>
      We use   your personal information to provide requested information and services to you   and to help ensure that the information we provide to you is relevant to your   specific needs. <br>
      <br>
      When you buy something, your information will be stored   on our system to complete the buying process. It must be shared with an outside   party in order to verify your credit card information. We also record   information about your questions to us and your purchases so that we and you can   keep track of what you have asked about or ordered directly on our site.   Additionally, we may need to contact you about your questions and/or your   orders. <br>
      <br>
      We use email addresses to send you the Alerts or newsletters   you have requested, to answer the email we receive and to communicate with you   about publications which you have told us you would be interested in hearing   about. <br>
      <br>
      <strong>Other Parties' Collection and Use of Your   Information</strong> <br>
      <br>
      We do not share, sell, rent, or trade personal   identifiable information with third parties for their promotional purposes. <br>
      <br>
      We do use agents, service providers and other third parties to provide   some services on our site. These companies do not retain, share, store or use   personally identifiable information for any other purposes then those described   below: <br>
      <br>
      <strong>Agents</strong> <br>
      <br>
      Publishers: <br>
      We may share your   contact information with the publisher(s) whose reports you purchase. The   publisher(s) may send you marketing materials. If you do not wish to receive   these materials you will need to contact the publisher directly in order to   opt-out (providing the publisher offers an opt-out). <br>
      <br>
      <strong>Service   Providers</strong> <br>
      <br>
      Shipping: <br>
      Our publishers use an outside shipping   service provider to fulfill orders. These orders will be shipped to you directly   from the publisher. In these cases, the publisher receives your contact   information. <br>
      <br>
      Credit Card Processing: <br>
      When you buy something with a   credit card, we use a credit card processing service provider to verify your   credit card and bill you. In addition, the name of your company (but not your   name or contact information) will be shared with the publisher of the   information you bought. <br>
      <br>
      <strong>Other Third Parties</strong> <br>
      <br>
      Tracking Service: <br>
      A third party tracking service provider may set   cookies on our website to help us track to what extent sales are being generated   from various marketing efforts. This information is only used in the aggregate.   We do not link the information we store in cookies to any personally   identifiable information you submit while on our site. <br>
      <br>
      Also, our third   party tracking service employs a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a.   Web Beacons/Web Bugs), that help us better manage content on our site by   informing us what content is effective. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a   unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the   online movements of website users. The main difference between the two is that   clear gifs are invisible on the page and are much smaller, about the size of the   period at the end of this sentence. Clear gifs are tied to users' personally   identifiable information but are used only by Head500.com to determine   the effectiveness of various marketing programs. <br>
      <br>
