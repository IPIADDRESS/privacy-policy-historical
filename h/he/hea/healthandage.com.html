      <p><a name="log"></a><br>
        <b>2.1 Log Files</b><br>
        HealthandAge.com will record the following information from any visitor 
        going through its site: browser type, IP address, domain name, access 
        time, and operating system. This aggregate data helps HealthandAge.com 
        have a "macro-view" of the visitor traffic and understand what sections 
        of the site the users like most. HealthandAge.com also uses the information 
        to see what kind of technology is available on the visitors' computers 
        so it can better serve them by utilizing more advanced technologies (e.g.: 
        Macromedia Flash). None of this information is linked to any Personal 
        Data.</p>

        <b>2.2 Cookies</b><br>
        HealthandAge.com also places small data files, called "cookies," in the 
        browser file of your computer's hard drive. These cookies automatically 
        identify your browser to our server whenever you interact with HealthandAge.com. 
        Most browsers automatically accept these cookies, but usually you can 
        change your browser setting to prevent the acceptance of cookies. In addition, 
        HealthandAge.com usually collects e.g. the domain name of the server from 
        which you are visiting. This can provide HealthandAge.com with information 
        relating to the sources of the traffic. None of this information is linked 
        to any Personal Data.</p>

        <i>3.2.1 Senior Meeting Place section</i> <br>
        To register to the senior meeting database, a user has to provide his 
        or her e-mail address as mandatory information as well as a username and 
        a password. The e-mail address is requested so that other seniors can 
        contact this registrant directly for future communications and is therefore 
        freely accessible for everybody. HealthandAge.com does store the e-mail 
        addresses in a database, but does not intend to use them in any other 
        way.<br>
        Optional Personal Data such as "country, town, and state" can also be 
        entered. This serves other participants in that they know where all the 
        other users come from and whether or not they live close to each other. 
        HealthandAge.com does store this Personal Data in a database, but does 
        not intend to use them in any other way.<br>
        Your personal profile can be modified or deleted by you at any time using 
        the available options "edit" or "delete" (cf. Section 7).<br>
        <b>Since the information you provide at the Senior Meeting Place section 
        is public and accessible to an unlimited number of parties, the respective 
        information may be transferred in countries and jurisdictions with less 
        restrictive or no data protection rules. By submitting your information 
        you hereby expressly consent to such transfers.</b><br>
        If you do not want your information made public and accessible to an unlimited 
        number of parties from countries or jurisdictions with less restrictive 
        or no data protection rules, do not participate in the Senior Meeting 
        Place section.<br>
