        <b>3.2 Public Forums Services (freely accessible for everybody)</b> <br>
        <i>3.2.1 Senior Meeting Place section</i> <br>
        To register to the senior meeting database, a user has to provide his 
        or her e-mail address as mandatory information as well as a username and 
        a password. The e-mail address is requested so that other seniors can 
        contact this registrant directly for future communications and is therefore 
        freely accessible for everybody. HealthandAge.org does store the e-mail 
        addresses in a database, but does not intend to use them in any other 
        way. </p>
      <p>Optional Personal Data such as "country, town, and state" can also be 
        entered. This serves other participants in that they know where all the 
        other users come from and whether or not they live close to each other. 
        HealthandAge.org does store this Personal Data in a database, but does 
        not intend to use them in any other way. </p>
      <p>Your personal profile can be modified or deleted by you at any time using 
        the available options "edit" or "delete" (cf. Section 7). </p>
      <p>Since the information you provide at the Senior Meeting Place section 
        is public and accessible to an unlimited number of parties, the respective 
        information may be transferred in countries and jurisdictions with less 
        restrictive or no data protection rules. By submitting your information 
        you hereby expressly consent to such transfers. If you do not want your 
        information made public and accessible to an unlimited number of parties 
        from countries or jurisdictions with less restrictive or no data protection 
        rules, do not participate in the Senior Meeting Place section. </p>
      <p>HealthandAge.org registers your e-mail address to be able to send you 
        the newsletter on a regular basis. To opt-out cf. Section 6 below. HealthandAge.org
