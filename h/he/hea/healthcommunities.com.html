  to disclose personal information. </p>

<p> A user must only insert name and e-mail address (and he/she may use an inaccurate name or e-mail address) to post a question in the forums.

  answers to your questions.</p> 

<p> The management of Healthcommunities.com will periodically review the security policy to make sure it is clear to employees that Healthcommunities.com only collects information from users on the "Contact Us" feature. That information is limited to the name, address, and e-mail address of the user, and it does not require an actual name for e-mail. It requires only the insertion of characters within the space. In the event that a user signs up for a forum, we retain the information relative to the user and we remind them of the forum. </p>

<p> The Web security is reviewed by the Board of Directors annually.</p>
