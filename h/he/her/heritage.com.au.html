For starters, we’re owned by customers, not shareholders, so our focus is always on putting ‘<em>People first</em>’ by providing customer benefits – in the form of better rates and better service - rather than maximising profits. In everything we do, we put ‘<em>People first’. </em></p><p></p><h2>Privacy background</h2><p>Heritage Bank Limited ABN 32 087 652 024, Australian Financial Services Licence and Australian Credit Licence 240984 (also referred to as “Heritage”, “we”, “our” or “us” in this Privacy Policy) considers the protection and maintenance of your personal information to be of the utmost importance. We take very seriously the ongoing trust that you place in us to protect your personal information.</p><p>When handling your personal information we are bound and committed to complying with the Australian Privacy Principles in the <em>Privacy Act 1988</em>. We are also bound by Division 3 of Part IIIA of the Privacy Act and the Credit Reporting Privacy Code (CR Code), which regulates the handling of credit information, credit eligibility information and related information by credit providers, like us and credit reporting bodies (CRBs) like Veda Advantage Limited, Dun &amp; Bradstreet (Australia) Pty Ltd and Experian Australia Pty Ltd.</p><p>This Privacy Policy outlines how we deal with your personal information (including credit-related information), as well as our legal obligations and rights as to that information. If we agree with you to use or disclose any of your personal information in ways which differ to those stated in this Privacy Policy, the provisions of that agreement will prevail to the extent of any inconsistency.</p><p></p><h2>What does "personal information" mean?</h2><p>Personal information is information that may identify you or by which your identity may be reasonably determined. The types of personal information that Heritage collects and holds includes the following information about customers, potential customers, and associated persons (such as guarantors) which is relevant to our relationship with that person. Such information may include an individual's name, address, other contact details, date of birth, financial details such as income, savings and lending history and expenses, credit reports from CRBs, employment details, tax file number and the reason a person might be applying for a financial product from us.</p><p></p><h2>What does "credit eligibility information" mean?</h2><p>"Credit eligibility information" means information that has been obtained from a CRB (e.g. a consumer credit report), or personal information that has been derived from that information, that is about an individual's consumer credit worthiness.</p><p>The kind of information we might derive from an individual's consumer credit report includes:</p><ul><li>a credit assessment relating to the individual;</li><li>an unsuitability assessment relating to the individual; and</li><li>any internal credit scores. </li></ul><h2>What does "credit information" mean?</h2><p>"Credit information" includes identification information, consumer credit liability information, repayment history information, credit enquiry, type of credit sought, default information, court proceedings and personal insolvency information, publicly available information that relates to the individual’s credit worthiness and information about a serious credit infringement.</p><p>We will hold all of this information about an applicant for credit, a guarantor, or related person (for example, a director of a company which has applied for credit).</p><h2>Why do we collect your personal information?</h2><p>We will only ask for personal information (including credit information and credit eligibility information) relevant to our business relationship with you.</p><p>We will tell you why we are asking for your personal information when we seek it from you. If you do not provide some personal information, we may not be able to provide you with the products or services you want.</p><p>We will seek personal information from you:</p><ul><li>to check your eligibility for or to provide you or some related person (for example, a person you are acting as guarantor for, or a company you are a director of) with financial products or services; </li><li>(unless you ask us not to) to send you information about, products or services offered by Heritage or those provided by third parties that may be of interest to you;</li><li>to assist you with your enquiries or concerns;</li><li>to verify your identity and undertake customer due diligence; </li><li>for research, training, product development, risk assessment, risk modelling and marketing requirements; and </li><li>for any other purpose required or authorised by law.</li></ul><p>If you have a credit facility with us or are a guarantor we may also collect your information for the purpose of collecting overdue payments relating to credit you owe or a guarantee you have given and for our internal management purposes related to credit provided.</p><p>We may also ask for your personal information because we are obliged to collect it under the <em>Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing Act 2006</em>, which requires us to ask you for information to check your identity (for instance, by referring to your driver’s licence, birth certificate or passport). </p><p>The <em>National Consumer Credit Protection Act 2009</em> also requires us to make reasonable enquiries when you apply for credit or a credit limit increase. </p><p>Finally, we may collect your TFN in order to calculate our withholding obligations as authorised by the <em>Taxation Administration Act 1953</em> and the <em>Income Tax Assessment Act 1936</em>. You are not required to provide your TFN, however if you do not, we may be required to withhold amounts from you and remit them to the Australian Taxation Office.</p><h2>How do we collect your personal information</h2><p>We collect most personal information directly from you. We may do this when you apply for membership, complete an application for one of our products and services, deal with us over the telephone, send us a letter, visit our web site or when you visit our branches (including community and mini branches) or if we call you.</p><p>From time to time there may also be occasions (such as where we need to verify your identity, undertake customer due diligence, prevent or detect money laundering or terrorist financing and where we are required or authorised by law) when we need to obtain personal information (including credit information and credit eligibility information) about you from a third party. These parties may include banks, financial advisers, family members, your employer, CRBs, government authorities and publicly available sources of information.</p><p>When you ring Heritage (or if Heritage rings you), we may also monitor and/or record telephone calls for the purpose of staff training, to verify statements made during the phone call and to assist with our dispute resolution process.</p><p>Our website and Heritage on-line internet banking do not use cookies to identify or monitor visitors to the site.</p><p>We do not generally collect sensitive information and if we do, we will only collect sensitive information with your consent.</p><p></p><h2>How do we store your personal information?</h2><p>We store your personal information (including credit information and credit eligibility information) in a number of ways including:</p><ul><li>in computer systems or databases;</li><li>in hard copy or paper files; and</li><li>in telephone recordings.</li></ul><p>See our comments below about how we protect your information.</p><h2>Do we ever disclose your personal information to third parties?</h2><p>We may disclose your personal information (including credit information and credit eligibility information) to third parties where they help us with our business, or you request us or consent to do so. Where your personal information is disclosed to third parties, we will seek to ensure that the information is held, used or disclosed consistently with the Australian Privacy Principles in Part IIIA of the <em>Privacy Act 1988 and the CR Code</em>.</p><p>Types of third parties include:</p><ul><li>parties involved in providing, managing or administering your products or services such as third party suppliers, printers, bulk mail services, statement production providers, authorised representatives and our legal, tax, audit and accountancy advisers; </li><li>parties maintaining, reviewing and developing our business systems, procedures and infrastructure including testing or upgrading our computer systems; </li><li>alliance partners, for example, where you have a cobranded product such as the Heritage Visa credit card; </li><li>advisers or agents which may include lawyers, mortgage brokers, real estate agents, financial advisers, insurance companies, executors, administrators, trustees or attorneys; </li><li>CRBs, debt collecting agencies, your guarantors, organisations involved in valuing, surveying, insuring or registering a security property; </li><li>lenders mortgage insurers (if insurance is required because the amount you borrow exceeds a certain percentage of the property’s value as insured by Heritage);</li><li>parties involved in what is known as “securitisation”, under which we sell a pool of home loans. These third parties include trustees of securitisation arrangements, lenders mortgage insurers, investors and their advisers; </li><li>other financial institutions, merchants and payment organisations; and</li><li>the Financial Ombudsman Service and the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal.</li></ul><p>We may also disclose your personal information (including credit information and credit eligibility information) to third parties in circumstances where:</p><ul><li>we must fulfil our legal obligations (for example, disclosure to Australian (and international) enforcement bodies such as the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC), the Australian Taxation Office (ATO), the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre (AUSTRAC), Centrelink or the Courts); </li><li>it is in the public interest (that is, to protect our interests or where we have a duty to the public to disclose, or where it is necessary in proceedings before a court or tribunal) and where a crime or fraud is committed or is suspected; or </li><li>it can be reasonably inferred from the circumstances that you consent to your personal information being disclosed to a third party.</li></ul><p>We may also send your personal information outside Australia where, for example:</p><ul><li>you have requested or consented that we send your personal information; </li><li>we outsource a function or service to an overseas contractor with whom we have a contractual arrangement; and </li><li>it is necessary to investigate or facilitate a transaction on your behalf.</li></ul><p>We will not send your personal information outside Australia unless it is authorised by law and we are satisfied that the recipient of the personal information has adequate data protection arrangements in place. </p><p>The countries to which we are likely to disclose your personal information include New Zealand, Singapore, India, China, United Kingdom, France and the United States of America.</p><p></p><h2>How do we protect your personal information?</h2><p>We take all reasonable precautions to protect your personal information, whether it is stored in hard copy or electronic form from loss, unauthorised access, modification and unauthorised disclosure.
