<h1>Effective Date: October 2007</h1>
	          <p>The following Privacy Policy governs the online information collection practices 
            of herald-dispatch.com ("we" or "us"). Specifically, it outlines 
            the types of information that we gather about you while you are using the herald-dispatch.com website (the "Site"), and the ways in which we use this 
            information. This Privacy Policy, including our children's privacy statement, 
            does not apply to any information you may provide to us or that we may collect 
            offline and/or through other means (for example, at a live event, via telephone, 
            or through the mail).</p>
          <p>Please read this Privacy Policy carefully. By visiting and using the Site, 
            you agree that your use of our Site, and any dispute over privacy, is governed 
            by this Privacy Policy and our <a href="http://www.herald-dispatch.com/terms">Terms of Service</a>. 
            Because the Web is an evolving medium, we may need to change our Privacy Policy 
            at some point in the future, in which case we'll post the changes to this Privacy 
            Policy on this website and update the Effective Date of the policy to reflect 
            the date of the changes. By continuing to use the Site after we post any such 
            changes, you accept the Privacy Policy as modified.</p>
          <h3>Your California Privacy Rights</h3>
          <p>California Civil Code Section 1798.83, also known as the "Shine The Light" 
            law, permits our customers who are California residents to request and obtain 
            from us once a year, free of charge, information about the personal information 
            (if any) we disclosed to third parties for direct marketing purposes in the 
            preceding calendar year. If applicable, this information would include a list 
            of the categories of personal information that was shared and the names and 
            addresses of all third parties with which we shared information in the immediately 
            preceding calendar year. If you are a California resident and would like to 
            make such a request, please submit your request in writing to:</p>
          <p>Online Privacy Coordinator<br>
            The Herald-Dispatch <br>
            946 Fifth Avenue<br>
            Huntington, WV 25701</p>
          <h3>How We Collect and Use Information</h3>
          <p>We may collect and store personal or other information that you voluntarily 
            supply to us online while using the Site (e.g., while on the Site or in responding 
            via email to a feature provided on the Site).</p>
          <p>We also collect and store information that is generated automatically as you 
            navigate online through the Site. For example, we may collect information about 
            your computer's connection to the Internet, which allows us, among other things, 
            to improve the delivery of our web pages to you and to measure traffic on the 
            Site. We also may use a standard feature found in browser software called a 
            "cookie" to enhance your experience with the Site. Cookies are small 
            files that your web browser places on your hard drive for record-keeping purposes. 
            By showing how and when visitors use the Site, cookies help us deliver advertisements, 
            identify how many unique users visit us, and track user trends and patterns. 
            They also prevent you from having to re-enter your preferences on certain areas 
            of the Site where you may have entered preference information before. The Site 
            also may use web beacons (single-pixel graphic files also known as "transparent 
            GIFs") to access cookies and to count users who visit the Site or open 
            HTML-formatted email messages.</p>
          <p>We use the information we collect from you while you are using the Site in 
            a variety of ways, including using the information to customize features and 
            advertising that appear on the Site. We also may provide your information to 
            third parties, such as service providers, contractors, and advertisers, for 
            a variety of purposes. Unless you inform us in accordance with the process described 
            below, we reserve the right to use, and to disclose to third parties, all of 
            the information collected from and about you while you are using the Site in 
            any way and for any purpose, such as to enable us or a third party to provide 
            you with information about products and services. If you do not wish your information 
            to be used for these purposes, you must send a letter to the Online Privacy 
            Coordinator whose address is listed at the end of this Privacy Policy requesting 
            to be taken off any lists of information that may be used for these purposes 
            or that may be given or sold to third-parties.</p>
          <p>Please keep in mind that whenever you voluntarily make your personal information 
            available for viewing by third parties online - for example on message boards, 
            web logs, through email, or in chat areas - that information can be seen, collected 
            and used by others besides us. We cannot be responsible for any unauthorized 
            third-party use of such information.</p>
          <p> Some of our third-party advertisers and ad servers that place and present 
            advertising on the Site also may collect information from you via cookies, web 
            beacons or similar technologies. These third-party advertisers and ad servers 
            may use the information they collect to help present their advertisements, to 
            help measure and research the advertisements' effectiveness, or for other purposes. 
            The use and collection of your information by these third-party advertisers 
            and ad servers is governed by the relevant third-party's privacy policy and 
            is not covered by our Privacy Policy. Indeed, the privacy policies of these 
            third-party advertisers and ad servers may be different from ours. If you have 
            any concerns about a third party's use of cookies or web beacons or use of your 
            information, you should visit that party's website and review its privacy policy.</p>
          <p>The Site also includes links to other websites and provides access to products 
            and services offered by third parties, whose privacy policies we do not control. 
            When you access another website or purchase third-party products or services 
            through the Site, use of any information you provide is governed by the privacy 
            policy of the operator of the site you are visiting or the provider of such 
            products or services.</p>
          <p>We also make some content, products and services available through our Site 
            through cooperative relationships with third-party providers, where the brands 
            of our provider partner appear on the Site in connection with such content, 
            products and/or services. We may share with our provider partner any information 
            you provide, or that is collected, in the course of visiting any pages that 
            are made available in cooperation with our provider partner. In some cases, 
            the provider partner may collect information from you directly, in which cases 
            the privacy policy of our provider partner may apply to the provider partner's 
            use of your information. The privacy policy of our provider partners may differ 
            from ours. If you have any questions regarding the privacy policy of one of 
            our provider partners, you should contact the provider partner directly for 
            more information.</p>
          <p>We are an affiliate of the Yahoo HotJobs online careers service. Through our 
            cooperative relationship with Yahoo HotJobs, we are able to provide you with 
            access to the Yahoo HotJobs products and services through a co-branded Yahoo HotJobs 
            site. When you provide information through the co-branded Yahoo HotJobs site, 
            Yahoo HotJobs may share your information with us and we may use the information 
            consistent with this Privacy Policy.</p>
          <p>Be aware that we may occasionally release information about our visitors when 
            release is appropriate to comply with law, to enforce our <a href="http://www.herald-dispatch.com/terms.asp">Terms of Service</a> agreement, or to protect the rights, property or safety of users of the Site or the public.</p>
          <p>Please also note that as our business grows, we may buy or sell various assets. 
            In the unlikely event that we sell some or all of our assets, or one or more 
            of our websites is acquired by another company, information about our users 
            may be among the transferred assets.</p>
          <h3>Children's Privacy Statement</h3>
          <p>This children's privacy statement explains our practices with respect to the 
            online collection and use of personal information from children under the age 
            of thirteen, and provides important information regarding their rights under 
            federal law with respect to such information.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>This Site is not directed to children under the age of thirteen and we do 
              NOT knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 
              the age of thirteen as part of the Site.  If we become aware that we have inadvertently 
              received personally identifiable information from a user under the age of 
              thirteen as part of the Site, we will delete such information from our records. 
              If we change our practices in the future, we will obtain prior, verifiable 
              parental consent before collecting any personally identifiable information 
              from children under the age of thirteen as part of the Site.</li>
            <li>Because we do not collect any personally identifiable information from children 
              under the age of thirteen as part of the Site, we also do NOT knowingly distribute 
              such information to third parties.</li>
            <li>We do NOT knowingly allow children under the age of thirteen to publicly 
              post or otherwise distribute personally identifiable contact information through 
              the Site.</li>
            <li>Because we do not collect any personally identifiable information from children 
              under the age of thirteen as part of the Site, we do NOT condition the participation 
              of a child under thirteen in the Site's online activities on providing personally 
              identifiable information.</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Questions Regarding Privacy</h3>
          <p>If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, our privacy practices, 
            or your dealings with us, you can contact:</p>
