  OUR COMMITMENT TO PRIVACY</b><br>
  Your privacy is important to us. To better protect your privacy we provide
  this notice explaining our online information practices and the choices you
  can make about the way your information is collected and used. To make this
  notice easy to find, we make it available on our home page and at every point
  where personally identifiable information may be requested.
      </p><p>This notice applies to all information collected from or submitted to
        the following Hershey Entertainment &amp; Resorts Company ("HE&amp;R")
        Websites, but to make this notice easier to read we will refer here only
        to "our Website", meaning either <i>HersheyPA.com, Hersheypark.com,
        ZooAmerica.com, TheHotelHershey.com, HersheyLodge.com, SpaAtHotelHershey.com,
        HersheyMeetings.com, GolfHershey.com, DiningInHershey.com,

        TourHershey.com,

        Hershey Entertainment &amp; Resorts Company Websites may operate under
        their own privacy notices.</p>
      <p>Our Website contains links to other Websites operated by third parties.
        HE&amp;R is not responsible for the privacy practices or policies of
        such third party Websites.</p>
      <p><b>THE INFORMATION WE COLLECT</b><br>
  Our Website is not set up to automatically collect personally identifiable
    information from each visitor to our Website. It does recognize the home
    server of visitors, but not email addresses. For example, we can tell which
    Internet Service Provider our visitors use, but not the names, addresses
    or other information about our visitors that would allow us to identify the
    particular visitors to our Website. This information is used only for internal
    purposes by our technical support staff.</p>
      <p>Our Website does track certain information about the visits to our Website.
        For example, we compile statistics that show the numbers and frequency
        of visitors to our Web Site and its individual pages. These aggregated
        statistics are used internally to improve our Website and for product
        development and marketing purposes generally. Those aggregated statistics
        may also be provided to advertisers and other third parties, but again,
        the statistics contain no personal information and cannot be used to
        gather such information.</p>
      <p>In a few areas on our Website, we ask you to provide information that
        will enable us to verify whether you are entitled to access and use certain
        information, materials and services available from our Website, or to
        enable us to enhance your site visit, to assist you with customer service
        or technical support issues, or to follow up with you after your visit,
        or to otherwise support your customer relationship with HE&amp;R. It
        is completely optional for you to participate. However, failure to participate
        may mean that you cannot access and use certain information, materials
        and services.</p>
      <p>For example, we request information from you when you:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Register or sign-up to use a service such as our email newsletters. </li>
        <li>Subscribe to a newsletter or desire to be added to our mailing lists
          for other products or services. </li>
        <li>Place an order. </li>
        <li>Participate in a sweepstakes or other promotional offer. </li>
        <li>Provide feedback in an online survey. <br>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>In each of the instances above, we typically ask for your name, email
        address, phone number, address, law practice information, product preference
        information, as well as other similar personal information that is needed
        to register or subscribe you to services or offers. On occasion, we may
        ask for additional information to enable us to provide you with access
        to and use of certain information, materials and services. In the case
        of newsletters or mailing lists, you will be able to "unsubscribe" to
        these mailings at any time.<br>
      </p>
      <p><b>HOW WE USE INFORMATION</b><br>
  HE&amp;R only uses your personal information for specific purposes.</p>
      <p>The personal information you provide to us when using our Website, such
        as your name, postal or email address or telephone number will be kept
        confidential and used to support your customer relationship with HE&amp;R,
        and to notify you of special offers, updated information and new products
        and services from HE&amp;R, or offers from third parties that we think
        may be of interest to you. Agents or contractors of HE&amp;R who are
        given access to your personal information will be required to keep the
        information confidential and not use it for any other purpose than to
        carry out the services they are performing for HE&amp;R.</p>
      <p>HE&amp;R may enhance or merge your information collected at its Website
        with data from third parties for purposes of marketing products or services
        to you.</p>
      <p>With respect to network advertising companies (companies that manage
        and provide advertising for numerous unrelated companies), to the extent
        that HE&amp;R utilizes such advertising companies to provide advertisements
        on our Website, HE&amp;R may provide them with your log-in name and any
        demographic information about you that we collect. Those advertising
        companies may combine that data with non-personally identifiable data
        collected by the advertising company from your computer solely for the
        purpose of delivering on our Website advertisements that are targeted
        to you.</p>
      <p>Circumstances may arise where we are required to disclose your personal
        information to third parties for purposes other than to support your
        customer relationship with HE&amp;R, such as in connection with a corporate
        divestiture or dissolution where we sell all or a portion of our business
        or assets (including our associated customer lists containing your personal
        information), or if disclosure is required by law or is pertinent to
        judicial or governmental investigations or proceedings.</p>
      <p><b>YOU CAN OPT OUT OF RECEIVING FURTHER MARKETING FROM HE&amp;R AT ANY
          TIME</b><br>
  We will send you information about our various products and services, or other
  products and services we feel may be of interest to you. Only HE&amp;R (or
  agents or contractors working on behalf of HE&amp;R and under confidentiality
  agreements) will send you these direct mailings. If you do not want to receive
  such mailings, simply tell us when you give us your personal information. Or,
  at any time you can easily opt out of receiving further marketing from HE&amp;R
  by emailing us at <a href="mailto:Webmaster@HersheyPA.com">Webmaster@HersheyPA.com</a>.</p>
      <p><b>OUR COMMITMENT TO DATA SECURITY</b><br>
  To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the correct
    use of information, we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic,
    and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect
    online.</p>
      <p><b>HOW YOU CAN ACCESS OR CORRECT YOUR INFORMATION</b><br>
  You can request a copy of the personally-identifiable information that HE&amp;R
  has collected about you via the Internet by contacting our Website Manager
  at the address below. You can also have factual inaccuracies in this information
  corrected by contacting this same person.</p>
