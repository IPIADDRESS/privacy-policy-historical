• Communicate with us; or<br>
• Post user-generated content, including comments, to or on any of our Services, including on community forums and blogs.<br>
</ul>
The information you provide directly to us may concern you or others and include, but is not limited to: (i) name; (ii) email address; (iii) age; (iv) home or business address; (v) username and password associated with your account; (vi) phone numbers;  (vi) demographic information; and (vii) birthdate.

</dd>
<dt>2.  Information that is Passively or Automatically Collected</dt>
<dd>
a.  Device/Usage Information<br>
We may automatically collect certain information about the computer or devices (including mobile devices or tablets) you use to access the Services. As described further below, we may collect and analyze information such as (a) IP addresses, geolocation information, unique device identifiers, IMEI and TCP/IP address, and other information about your computer or device(s), browser types, browser language, operating system, mobile device carrier information, the state or country from which you accessed the Services; and (b) information related to the ways in which you interact with the Services, such as: referring and exit web pages and URLs, platform type, the number of clicks, domain names, landing pages, pages and content (such as advertisements) viewed and the order of those pages, statistical information about the use of the Services (such as barcodes scanned through certain of our mobile apps), the amount of time spent on particular pages, the date and time you used the Services, the frequency of your use of the Services, error logs, and other similar information.  As described further below, we may use third-party analytics providers and technologies, including cookies and similar tools, to assist in collecting this information.<br><br>
b.  Location Information<br>
We and our service providers may automatically collect location information, including general information (e.g., IP address, zip code) from your computer or mobile device.  If you access the Services through a mobile device, we may also ask you to share your specific geo-location information with us.  The Services use this location information to provide customized location-based services, content, promotional offers and other information that may be of interest to you.  For example, if you use our ShopSavvy mobile application, with your permission, we collect geolocation information from your device that will allow us to present location-based alerts such as nearby retailers or coupons, or organize products searched or scans based on the closest applicable retailer.  We may also use location information to improve the functionality of the Services and our other products services.  We and our service providers may also collect other information based on your location and your device’s proximity to “beacons” and other similar indoor proximity systems, including, for example, the strength of the signal between the “beacon” and your device and the duration that your device is near the “beacon.”  If you do not wish to have this location information collected and used by us and our service providers, you may disable the location features on your device.  Please note that if you disable such features, you will not be able to access or receive some or all of the services, content, features and/or products made available via the Services.  Also see the “Tailored Advertising” section below for more choices regarding the delivery of interest-based content and advertising. <br><br>
c.  Cookies and Other Electronic Technologies<br>
We may also collect data about your use of the Services through the use of Internet server logs, cookies and/or tracking pixels. A web server log is a file where website activity is stored. A cookie is a small text file that is placed on your computer when you visit a website, that enables us to: (i) recognize your computer; (ii) store your preferences and settings; (iii) understand the web pages of the Services you have visited; (iv), enhance your user experience by delivering content specific to your interests; (v) perform searches and analytics; and (vi) assist with security administrative functions. Some cookies are placed in your browser cache while those associated with Flash technologies are stored with your Adobe Flash Player files. Tracking pixels (sometimes referred to as web beacons or clear GIFs) are tiny electronic tags with a unique identifier embedded in websites, online ads and/or email, and that are designed to provide usage information like ad impressions or clicks, measure popularity of the Services and associated advertising, and to access user cookies.  As we adopt additional technologies, we may also gather additional information through other methods.<br><br>
Please note that you can change your settings to notify you when a cookie is being set or updated, or to block cookies altogether. Please consult the "Help" section of your browser for more information (e.g., Internet Explorer; Google Chrome; Mozilla Firefox; or Apple Safari). You can also manage the use of Flash technologies, including cookies and local storage objects with the Flash management tools available at Adobe's website. Please note that by blocking any or all cookies, you may not have access to certain features or offerings of the Services.
</dd>
<dt>3.  Information Collected By and From Social Media and Other Content Platforms</dt>
<dd>
If you access the Services through a third-party connection or log-in (e.g., through a social network), you may allow us to have access to and store certain information in your social network profile.  This may include your first name, last name, gender, general location, a link to your profile, your time zone, birthday, profile picture, your “likes” and your list of friends.  If you do not wish to have this information shared, do not use a social networking connection to access the Services.  For a description on how social networking sites handle your information, please refer to their privacy policies and terms of use, which may permit you to modify your privacy settings.  If you signed up using a social media log-in by mistake, you may be able to delete your account through your account settings at any time, or you can email us at <a href="mailto:privacy@purch.com">privacy@purch.com</a> for help.<br><br>
When you “like” or “follow” us on Facebook, Instagram, Pinterest, Twitter or other social media sites, we may collect some information from you including your name, e-mail address, and any comments or content you post relevant to us.

</dd>
<dt>WHEN WE DISCLOSE USER INFORMATION</dt>
<dd>
Purch may disclose and/or share your information to or with any non-affiliated third parties under the following circumstances:<br><br>
<ul>
• Consent. We may disclose your information to any third parties based on your consent to do so. <br>
• Service Providers.  We may provide access to or share your information with select third parties who perform services on our behalf and for any other legitimate business purpose. These third parties provide a variety of services to us, including without limitation billing, sales, marketing, advertising, market research, customer support, fulfillment, data storage, analysis and processing, and legal services. <br>
• Business Partners.  We may provide your information to individuals and companies with whom we have business relationships to provide you with special coupons, discounts, or promotions, or to offer products and services to you for purchase.   We encourage these partners to adopt and post privacy policies. However, the use of your Information by such parties is governed by the privacy policies of such parties and is not subject to our control.<br>
• Protection of Purch and Others. By using the Services, you acknowledge, consent and agree that we may access, preserve and disclose your information, including, but not limited to, any user content, if required to do so by law or in a good faith belief that such access, preservation or disclosure is reasonably necessary to: (a) comply with legal process; (b) enforce our Terms of Service, this Policy, or other contracts with you, including investigation of potential violations thereof; (c) respond to claims that any content violates the rights of third parties; (d) respond to your requests for customer service; and/or (e) protect the rights, property or personal safety of Purch, its agents and affiliates, its users and/or the public.  This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection, and spam/malware prevention, and similar purposes.<br>
• Business Transfers. As we continue to develop our business, we may buy, merge or partner with other companies. In such transactions, (including in contemplation of such transactions, e.g., due diligence) user information may be among the transferred assets. If a portion or all of Purch’s assets are sold or transferred to a third-party, customer information (including your email address) would likely be one of the transferred business assets. <br>
• Public Forums.  Our Services offer publicly accessible blogs and community forums. You should be aware that any information you provide in these areas may be read, collected, and used by others who access them.  Please also remember that if you choose to provide information on public features of the Services, individuals reading such information may use or disclose it to other individuals or entities without our control and without your knowledge, and search engines may index that information. We therefore urge you to think carefully about what you choose to disclose publicly and make sure it’s information you want to share with the public.
</ul>
</dd>
<dt>PERSONALIZED CONTENT, ADVERTISING, AND YOUR CHOICES</dt>
<dd>
</dd><dt>1.  Online and Email Analytics</dt>
<dd>
We may use third-party web analytics services on our Services, such as those of Google Analytics.  These service providers use the sort of technology previously described in the “Cookies and other electronic technologies” section to help us analyze how users use the Services, including by noting the third-party website from which you arrive, and provide certain features to you.  For example, the Google Trusted Store badge displayed on some of the Services is served to you through the use of cookies.  The information (including your IP address) collected by the technology will be disclosed to or collected directly by these service providers, who use the information to evaluate your use of the Services.  We also use Google Analytics for certain purposes related to advertising, as described in the following section. To prevent Google Analytics from using your information for analytics, you may install the Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on by <a href="http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout">clicking here</a>.<br><br>
If you receive email from us, we may use certain tools, such as clear GIFs to capture data such as when you open our message or click on any links or banners our email contains.  This data allows us to gauge the effectiveness of our communications and marketing campaigns.
</dd>
<dt>2.  Tailored Online and Mobile Advertising</dt>
<dd>
We may personalize the content and advertising that you see when using the Services through the use of third-party advertising technologies that allow for the delivery of relevant content and advertising on the Services, as well as other websites you visit and other applications you use. The ads may be based on various factors such as the content of the page you are visiting, information you provide such as your age and gender, your searches, demographic data, user-generated content, and other information we collect from you. These ads may be based on your current activity or your activity over time and across other websites and online services and may be tailored to your interests.<br><br>
Also, third parties whose products or services are accessible or advertised via the Services may place cookies or other tracking technologies on your computer, mobile phone, or other device to collect information about your use of the Services in order to (i) inform, optimize, and serve ads based on past visits to our websites and other sites and (ii) report how our ad impressions, other uses of ad services, and interactions with these ad impressions and ad services are related to visits to our websites and use of our Services. We also allow other third parties (e.g., ad networks and ad servers such as Google Analytics, DoubleClick and others) to serve tailored ads to you on the Services, other sites, and in other applications, and to access their own cookies or other tracking technologies on your computer, mobile phone, or other device you use to access the Services. We also may share with third-party advertisers a hashed version of your email address, solely in non-human readable form and content that you share publicly when using the services (e.g, user-generated content) for purposes of delivering tailored advertising. We neither have access to, nor does this Policy govern, the use of cookies or other tracking technologies that may be placed on your computer, mobile phone, or other device you use to access the Services by non-affiliated, third-party ad technology, ad servers, ad networks or any other non-affiliated third parties. Those parties that use these technologies may offer you a way to opt out of ad targeting as described below. You may receive tailored advertising on your computer through a web browser. If you are interested in more information about tailored browser advertising and how you can generally control cookies from being put on your computer to deliver tailored advertising, you may visit the <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices">Network Advertising Initiative’s Consumer Opt-Out</a> link , the <a href="http://www.aboutads.info/choices/">Digital Advertising Alliance’s Consumer Opt-Out</a> link or <a href="http://preferences-mgr.truste.com/">TRUSTe’s Advertising Choices Page</a> to opt-out of receiving tailored advertising from companies that participate in those programs. You may also use the links available in advertisements that appear in the Services and learn more about our advertising practices through the About Our Ads link available through the Services.<br><br>
To opt out of Google Analytics for display advertising or customize Google display network ads, you can visit the <a href="https://www.google.com/settings/ads">Google Ads</a> Settings page. Please note that to the extent advertising technology is integrated into the Services, you may still receive advertisements even if you opt-out of tailored advertising. In that case, the ads will just not be tailored. <br><br>
When using a mobile application you may also receive tailored in-application advertisements. Each operating system, iOS for Apple phones, Android for Android devices and Windows for Microsoft devices provides its own instructions on how to prevent the delivery of tailored in-application advertisements. You may review the support materials and/or the privacy settings for the respective operating systems to opt-out of tailored in-app advertisements. For any other devices and/or operating systems, please visit the privacy settings for the applicable device or contact the applicable platform operator. We do not control how the applicable platform operator allows you to control receiving personalized in-application advertisements; thus, you should contact the platform provider for further details on opting out of tailored in-application advertisements. We also may use third-party service providers to deliver advertisements on mobile applications or for mobile application analytics.  You can opt-out from third-party interest-based advertising on some Android devices and Google apps by visiting Google Settings, Ads and then click on ‘Disable ads based on interests.’&nbsp; You can also opt out of some interest-based advertising on your mobile device by downloading the Truste Privacy App available at:&nbsp; <a href="https://www.truste.com/consumer-resources/privacy-app/">https://www.truste.com/consumer-resources/privacy-app/</a>.<br>
Please note that to the extent advertising technology is integrated into the Services, you may still receive advertisements even if you opt-out. In that case, the advertising will not be tailored to your interests. Also, we do not control any of the above opt-out links or whether any particular company chooses to participate in these opt-out programs.  We are not responsible for any choices you make using these mechanisms or the continued availability or accuracy of these mechanisms.
</dd>

<dt>Notice Concerning Do Not Track Signals</dt>
<dd>
Do Not Track (“DNT”) is a privacy preference that users can set in certain web browsers. DNT is a way for users to inform online services that they do not want certain information about their webpage visits collected over time and across websites or services. We are committed to providing you with meaningful choices about the information collected on the Services for third party purposes, and that is why we provide links to the <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/consumer/opt_out.asp">Network Advertising Initiative</a> and the <a href="http://www.aboutads.info/choices/">Digital Advertising Alliance</a> opt-out pages, as well as choices provided by Google Ads, Google Analytics, and Truste. However, we do not recognize or respond to browser-initiated DNT signals, as the Internet industry is currently still working toward defining exactly what DNT means, what it means to comply with DNT, and a common approach to responding to DNT. To learn more about Do Not Track, you can do so here.
</dd>
<dt>UPDATING YOUR INFORMATION AND DATA RETENTION</dt>
<dd>
You may access certain of your information and delete, change, or modify that information through your relevant account settings on the Services.  For additional assistance with modifying or deleting information provided to us, contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@purch.com">privacy@purch.com</a>. <br><br>
We will retain your information to continue offering the Services to you. If you terminate your account, any association between your account and information we store will no longer be accessible through your account. However, if you have engaged in any public sharing prior to termination, that information will remain on our services and accessible to the public. We will also retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.
</dd>
<dt>SECURITY</dt>
<dd>
We have implemented administrative, technical, and physical security measures to protect against the loss, misuse and/or alteration of your information. These safeguards vary based on the sensitivity of the information that we collect and store.  However, we cannot and do not guarantee that these measures will prevent every unauthorized attempt to access, use, or disclose your information since despite our efforts, no Internet and/or other electronic transmissions can be completely secure.<br><br>
We recommend that you change your password periodically. You are responsible for maintaining the security of your account username and password. You may not provide these account credentials to any third party. If you believe that your account username and/or password have been stolen or been made known to others, you must contact us immediately at <a href="mailto:privacy@purch.com">privacy@purch.com</a> and change your password immediately. We are not responsible if someone else accesses your account through information that they have obtained from you.
</dd>
<dt>YOUR CHOICES</dt>
<dd>
If you have provided contact information through the Services and decide that you do not want Purch to use that information for marketing purposes in accordance with this Policy, you can opt-out of future use at any time by: (i) going to the link provided at the bottom of any email you receive and opting out of receiving future information; or (ii) by sending us an email at <a href="mailto:privacy@purch.com">privacy@purch.com</a>.  Please note that you may not be able to opt out of emails about your transactions and relationship with us, such as emails regarding a your account, requests or inquiries, and purchases of products and/or services.

</dd>
<dt>THIRD PARTY LINKS AND SERVICES</dt>
<dd>
The Services may contain links to third-party websites, applications and other services. Please be aware that we are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites and services. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our Services and to read the privacy statements of each and every site they visit that collects their information.  Some of these links may be affiliate marketing links encoded by third parties.  This means that we may earn a commission when you click on or make purchases via affiliate links, and affiliate partners may use cookies to understand your use of the Services.  For more information about our affiliate marketing practices, please see the Purch Advertising Disclosure.<br><br>
The Services may also include widgets and social media features such as the Facebook "Like" button, which are interactive mini-programs that provide specific services from another company (e.g. displaying the news, opinions, music, etc.). Information such as your email address may be collected through these features. These features may collect your IP address and set cookies to enable them to function properly.  We are not responsible for nor do we endorse the privacy practices or the content of such third-party services.  Any information you provide via those services is subject to their applicable privacy policies and is not covered by this Policy.
</dd>
<dt>YOUR CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS</dt>

If you believe we have any information from or about anyone under the age of 13, please contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@purch.com">privacy@purch.com</a>.
</dd>
<dt>CHANGES TO THIS POLICY</dt>

We reserve the right to change this Policy at any time to reflect changes in the law, our data collection and use practices, the features of our Services, or advances in technology.
