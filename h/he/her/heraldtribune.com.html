If you do not want any personal information  shared, you may always decline to participate in the sweepstakes, contest or  special offer.</p>
      <p><strong>Special Events and  Promotions:</strong> We  often receive information regarding customers who may also attend Special  Events and Promotions. Such information will be used as indicated at the time  of collection.</p>

      <strong>Cookies:</strong> Our Web sites employ cookies to recognize you  and your access privileges on <strong>HeraldTribune.com, snn6.com, http://sarasota.careercast.com,  www.people2people.com, www.udigtv.com</strong>, as well as to track site usage.
      For  detailed information about our use of cookies see our <span class="nyTextMedium"><a href="/apps/pbcs.dll/misc?URL=/misc/registration/registration_faq.pbs#cookies">Frequently Asked Questions about Cookies.</a></span>
      <p><strong>HeraldTribune.com, snn6.com,  http://sarasota.careercast.com, www.people2people.com, www.udigtv.com</strong> use a commercial advertising  server (currently <strong>http://adx.heraldtribune.com</strong>) to display ads on our site. </p>
      <p>In addition, advertisers may elect to use third-party  advertising companies to serve ads onto our Web sites. In the course of serving  these advertisements, the third party advertisers may place or recognize a  unique "cookie" on your browser. We do not have access to these  cookies or any information that they may contain.</p>
      <p>We also reserve the right to place a <strong>Herald-Tribune</strong> cookie on your computer with a unique anonymous number to ensure that your  browser does not see the same ad over and over again, to sequence ads in a  series, and to measure the number of unique visitors that have viewed a  particular ad or visited a particular Web page.</p>
      <p><strong>Clear Gifs (Web  Beacons/Web Bugs):</strong> Third party advertisers may also use a software technology called clear gifs  (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs/action tags) to help better manage advertising on  our site. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in  function to cookies. Clear gifs may ping or alert the advertiser's server about  the online movements of Web users. For instance, advertisers may place a clear  gif allowing them to recognize an existing cookie on your browser if from the  same service. The main difference between cookies and clear gifs is that clear  gifs are invisible on the page and are much smaller, about the size of the  period at the end of this sentence. Please keep in mind that we do not have  access to any information collected by these clear gifs nor additional  information they may be tied to by the advertiser.</p>
      <p><strong>Usage Data:</strong> Our Web sites have currently  contracted with Omniture, a third party, to track and analyze non-personally  identifiable usage and volume statistical information from our visitors. We use  this information to track the site's traffic, usability, performance, and  effectiveness.

			York Times Regional Media Group by Text Messaging Service (SMS) (“SMS Service”) solely for the purposes of improving the SMS Service. The information will not
