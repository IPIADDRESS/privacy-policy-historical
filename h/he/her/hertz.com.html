The Hertz Corporation and its subsidiaries ("Hertz") believe it is very
important to protect the privacy of our customers.  The following
information concerning the gathering and use of data about our customers
is being provided to enable you to make knowledgeable choices about
whether to provide information to us and to give you the opportunity to
direct us to limit the manner in which your data is used.

		</p><p align="JUSTIFY">
Hertz does not knowingly solicit personal, family, residency or other
personal information from persons under the age of twenty-one years;
neither does it knowingly market to such people.

This Privacy Statement reflects only the policies of The Hertz

If you use this website to send personal data to Hertz, your transmission
will be protected by Secure Socket Layer (SSL).  SSL is a technology
employed by Hertz that encrypts your information during transmission.

			</p><p align="JUSTIFY">
It is our policy to take all reasonable steps to ensure that your personal
data is securely maintained with access limited to those who need such
access to serve you.  However, as discussed below, we may share your
personally identifiable information with unaffiliated companies where we
are legally permitted to do so, subject to your rights described under
			<a href="#options">Options to Limit Use of Data</a>.  It is a serious violation of Hertz policy
for any employee of Hertz or its subsidiaries to use your personal data
for any reason not described in this Privacy Statement.

Hertz gathers data about its customers from various sources during the
normal course of its business, including data supplied through this
website.  Personal data may also be available from reservation records,
Hertz #1 Club and Hertz #1 Club Gold enrollment forms, and rental
agreements.  The types of personal information collected include names,
addresses, employers, telephone numbers, fax numbers, e-mail addresses,
date of birth, driver's license numbers, credit card information, your
selections with respect to car class and optional services, and rental
history.  

			</p><p align="JUSTIFY">
In some cases, Hertz may create segments of information (known as "cookies")
that enable us to recognize you from your computer when you revisit the
Hertz website. Separate cookies may be created which recognize your name
(if you have transmitted it to us in a prior visit from the same computer)
and the date and time of your most recent visit.  When, during your visit
to the Hertz website, cookies containing your personal information are
about to be created, you will be given the option to direct us not to
create the cookie.  You may also avoid the use of cookies by websites with
which you communicate by turning off "cookies" on your computer's browser.

			</p><p align="JUSTIFY">
Hertz also obtains information about customers and prospective customers
from its affiliates and licensees and, where legally permitted, from other
companies with which Hertz has business relationships.  This information
may be merged with or used to enhance individually identifiable information
which we have collected previously for the purpose of marketing our
products and services.

The personally identifiable information which we collect through this
website is initially used to satisfy rental reservations or to enable us
to provide enhanced service, such as Hertz #1 Club and Hertz #1 Club Gold.
We also aggregate and analyze personal information that we have collected
from this website and other sources in order to enable Hertz to develop
targeted marketing programs and service offerings tailored to the relevant
customer base.  The data allows special offers to be made to those
customers most likely to avail themselves of the offers. If you breach a
rental agreement or other agreement with Hertz or any of its affiliates or
subsidiaries, your personal data may be used, disclosed or passed to third
parties to the extent necessary to assist recovery activities.

Personal information is transmitted among The Hertz Corporation and its

its majority stockholder, Ford Motor Company; and other subsidiaries of
Ford Motor Company.)   Where legally permitted, both aggregated information

companies for use in their marketing efforts.  This information may be
provided in exchange for similar data or for other business considerations.
