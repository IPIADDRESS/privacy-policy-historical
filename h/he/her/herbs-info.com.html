</p><p><b>Log files</b>
</p><p>As with most web sites, logs are automatically created which register the IP address and other information such as the date and time of access of This Website. I may use this information for general administrative, diagnostic or market research purposes. This web site uses common server-side statistics utilities, such as Awstats, that are provided by This Website's hosting provider.   These utilities provide user demographics such as the user's country and city of location, IP address, browser type, and keywords used in searches used to find this site - and I may use such data for the purposes of optimizing the "performance" and quality of This Website, and for market research.
</p><p><b>Cookies and Web Beacons</b>

<p>Most web browsers' default settings are to accept cookies automatically - however it is possible with almost all browsers to change browser preferences, in order to refuse cookies or to request confirmation before accepting them.  Browsers typically offer options to view and delete cookies that have already been placed on your browser.
