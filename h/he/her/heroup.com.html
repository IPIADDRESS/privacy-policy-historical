<h3>2. Scope of This Privacy Policy</h3><br>
This Privacy Policy applies to Personally Identifiable Information ("PII") collected on any website where this Privacy Policy is posted (the "Site") and to PII collected by Gazillion and its affiliated entities through other means where this Privacy Policy is referenced. Gazillion and its affiliated entities are collectively referred to in this Privacy Policy as "Gazillion," "we" or "us."

<br><a href="#top">Back to Top</a><br><br>

<a name="3"></a>
<h3>3. The Information We Collect</h3><br>
At Gazillion, we do not collect PII on our Site unless our visitors voluntarily provide it to us. For some activities, such as online polls or surveys, we may ask visitors to provide information that is not personally identifiable. This might include first name only, city or state of residence, age, gender, or a favorite color.

In connection with registration for a Gazillion Account, we may ask users to provide certain information that is not personally identifiable such as city or state of residence, date of birth, and gender. We collect and store an e-mail address to use in the case of forgotten passwords and to send newsletters and/or marketing information for which the individual has consented.&nbsp; We also collect Parent email addresses during the registration of children.

For other activities, such as sending an electronic postcard or e-mail to invite a friend to join Gazillion, we may also ask for personal information about other people. Gazillion stores the email addresses and first name that you provide and uses them solely to contact the owner of the email address. For these Site activities, Gazillion sends one initial invitation email and may send multiple reminders; for other email-based communications, Gazillion sends an email specific to that communication. Gazillion does not share, sell or rent these email addresses with any third parties.

On occasion, a Game could offer the opportunity to sign in and register an account using Facebook Platform credentials. We respect Facebook’s Privacy Policy, and only request and collect information necessary to complete a registration with our site. This information could include, but not limited to: email address, age, first name, last name, and IP address. Before Gazillion can collect any information from Facebook, it is Facebook’s policy to request confirmation from you, verifying that you agree to the information share from Facebook to Gazillion in order to create an account and play the Game. As part of the login process, Facebook may provide information beyond what we request in accordance with Facebook policies. If you wish to discontinue the use of your Facebook credentials, you must contact us via Customer Support and request a deactivation. At that time you will no longer be able to access the account created by using your Facebook credentials.

Recipients of invitations who are not registered Gazillion Account Holders can request that their emails be added to a "black list" to which Gazillion sends no further invitations.

For some limited activities, campaigns, or offers, we may ask you to provide your name, address, e-mail address, telephone number, fax number, credit card information, cable or satellite provider, and/or information about interests in and use of various products, programs, and services.

When visitors come to any of our Sites, we also may collect some non-personally identifiable information such as the type of computer operating system you are using (e.g., Windows or Mac OS), the type of browser you are using (e.g., Internet Explorer, Firefox), the domain name of the Internet service provider (e.g., Comcast, Earthlink), your activities while visiting our Site, certain other technical information that may be passed on automatically, and your activities while utilizing services on our Site. This non-personally identifiable information is not associated with any PII you may give us. The information collected will be used to enhance features and provide feedback for improvements to our Sites.

Special rules apply to Closed Beta Tests. <strong>Closed Beta Testers must be 18 years or older, or have verified permission from the parent/legal guardian.</strong> In order to become a Closed Beta Tester, you, or your parent/legal guardian, will have to provide certain Personally Identifiable Information ("PII"), and also agree to enter into a Non-Disclosure Agreement ("NDA") that will severely restrict your ability to discuss anything about the Site.

Closed Beta Tester information that you may have to disclose to us includes, but is not limited to: First and last name, e-mail address, MAC and IP addresses, demographic information such as sex, city/state/country, and age.

<h3>4. How We Use the Information</h3><br>
We use visitors' PII collected for internal purposes only, such as enabling visitors to enter our online contests or sweepstakes or to subscribe to an online newsletter. We may also use PII to send e-mails regarding special offers, new partners, or other reminders. We may also use a Parent email address for sending updates, marketing materials, and information about your child’s account.

We use information we collect about others to enable visitors to our Site to communicate with those other people, for example, by sending them electronic greeting cards or invitations to join Gazillion or play Gazillion Games. We routinely purge that content from our database, and do not store it for any purpose other than the one time usage.

We do not keep any PII we obtain through a contest or sweepstakes beyond when we have successfully selected a winner(s), awarded the prize(s), and administered the contest or sweepstakes.

We only use the e-mail addresses of subscribers to our Site's e-mail newsletters to send them the requested newsletter(s). Each newsletter also includes instructions for subscription removal via return e-mail. Customers are presented with the ability to opt-out during the registration process; we will not send commercial e-mails to customers or Parents who choose to opt-out of newsletters during the registration process or later.

<strong>In the event that you request that we no longer collect or maintain your PII, your access to the Site and the Services offered by Gazillion may be limited and you may not be able to participate in certain activities offered either free, or at a fee, by Gazillion, including participating in any Beta Test programs.</strong>

We never sell, rent, or otherwise share our visitors' PII with third parties without appropriate consent. Sometimes, we use agents or contractors to provide services, such as helping us conduct a sweepstakes, sending prizes to winners, shipping customer orders made on the Site, or providing customer service related to activities on the Site. In these cases, we require the agent or contractor to keep the information confidential and to use it only for the specific services they are performing. We sometimes use non-personally identifiable information that we collect to improve the design and content of our Site, and to improve our visitors' experience on the Site. We also may aggregate this information to analyze Site usage, as well as to offer products, programs, or services.

We may disclose PII in response to legal process, for example, in response to a court order or a subpoena. We also may disclose such information in response to a law enforcement agency's request, or where we believe it is necessary to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of our Terms of Service (TOS) or End User License Agreement (EULA), to verify or enforce compliance with the policies governing our Site and applicable laws, or as otherwise required or permitted by law or consistent with legal requirements. In addition, we may transfer PII about you if we or one of our business units are acquired by, sold to, or merged with another company to such company.

We will not use or transfer PII in ways that are materially different from the ones described above without also providing notification of such practices and obtaining consent for any materially different uses.

<strong>We reserve the right to retain any PII you provide us, even if you request that we remove that information, up to the maximum length of time allowed under Federal or state law in order to fight fraud or abuse on the Gazillion Service and in Gazillion Games, or for other purposes allowed under Federal and state laws.</strong>

Please note that any information, including personally identifiable information that you reveal in a bulletin board, chat room, news group or other public forum is publicly viewable on the Site. Please refer to the Terms of Service (TOS) if you wish to learn more about the information you choose to share within the Gazillion Service and Gazillion Games.

<h3>5. Cookies and Web Beacons</h3><br>
Our Site uses software technology called "cookies." Cookies are small text files that we place in visitors' computer browsers to store their preferences. Cookies themselves do not contain any personally identifiable information. Although cookies could enable us to relate a visitor's use of our Site to PII that the visitor has provided, such as an e-mail address, we do not use cookies for this purpose. For some activities, we may use session cookies to ensure that visitors under the age of 13 do not attempt to register an account, or to otherwise have a better user experience. We do use cookies to determine how many visitors we have, where they arrive from, and how often they visit various sections of our Site.

"Web beacons" are small pieces of code placed on a web page to monitor behavior and collect data about the visitors viewing a web page. For example, web beacons can be used to count the users who visit a web page or to deliver a cookie to the browser of a visitor viewing that page. We may use web beacons on our Site from time to time for this and other purposes.

<h3>6. Internet Protocol and MAC Addresses</h3><br>
An Internet Protocol ("IP") address is the unique number assigned to your server or Internet Service Provider ("ISP"). The Media Access Control ("MAC") address is a hardware address that uniquely identifies each node of a network and is normally assigned to the network interface card (NIC) or other network adapter that you use to connect to the internet. Gazillion may track such IP and MAC addresses for system administration, to report aggregate information, Site tracking, or to prevent our servers from being abused.

<h3>7. Collection of Information by Third-Party Sites</h3><br>
Our Sites may contain links to other websites, including those of our partners, sponsors and advertisers, whose information practices may be different from ours. Sometimes these third party websites might conduct contests or sweepstakes that are promoted on our Site. Visitors should consult those other third party websites' privacy notices, since those websites are not covered by our Privacy Policy and may follow different procedures. If you click on one of these third-party links from any of our kid-targeted Sites, you will receive a notification that you are about to leave the Site and travel to a third-party site.

<h3>8. Security</h3><br>
We have taken steps to assure that all information collected will remain secure and in its original form, i.e. free from any alteration. As such, access to all PII is strictly controlled. We have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures in an effort to help safeguard and prevent unauthorized access, maintain data security, and correctly use the information we collect online.

We are particularly sensitive to visitors' security concerns regarding the use of credit cards in connection with some services on our Sites, including playing Gazillion Games. For orders placed on our Site, we use a technology that automatically encrypts credit card data while information is being transmitted over the Internet, provided that the visitor's browser supports the Secure Socket Layer protocol (SSL).

To verify the security of your connection at our Site, check the lower left corner of your browser window after accessing the server. If you see an unbroken or a closed lock, then SSL is active and the server is secure. You may also check by looking at the URL line of your browser. When accessing a secure server, the Site address will change from "http" to "https".

<h3>12. A Final Note to Parents</h3><br>
We recognize a special obligation to protect PII about young children. We urge parents to instruct their children to never give out their real names, addresses, or phone numbers, without permission, when on- line. Minors between the ages of 13 and 18 should encourage their parents to review this policy and to contact us if they would like to evoke our opt-out policy or to raise any concerns. All commercial sites directed to children under 13 are prohibited by U.S. law from conditioning a child's participation in an online activity on the child providing more personal information than reasonably necessary. Children under the age of 13 are not allowed to create Gazillion Accounts without verified parental permission, as specified by COPPA legislation and approved by the ESRB Privacy Online Safe Harbor Program. Some games, like the Teen Rated games, age-block Children entirely. Please see the Terms of Service for further information.
