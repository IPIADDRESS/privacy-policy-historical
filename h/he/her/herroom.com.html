								<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif" size="2">Cookies are small pieces of information that many web sites use to make online

								browser provides for the purpose. A cookie can contain information such as a user ID.
								Our site can't read other data on your hard drive or read cookies created by other sites. 
								You do not need to have cookies turned on to view our site, but you will need to accept 
								cookies to register or order products.</font></p>

								identifiable information submitted for another person by you. For instance, if you want to 
								buy a gift for a friend and have it shipped to them; or, if you complete a "tell a friend" 
								form on our site. Also, we may release account information when we believe, in good 
								faith, that such release is reasonably necessary to 1) comply with the law, 2) enforce or
