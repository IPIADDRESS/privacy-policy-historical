	<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
	<br><br>
We, Playata GmbH, take the protection of your personal data very seriously and
rigorously comply with the rules of data protection laws. Person-related data is
only collected on this website to the extent technically necessary for providing
the service. Under no circumstances will the collected data be sold or unlawfully
provided to third parties for any other reasons.

<br><br>

The following explanation provides you with an overview of how we guarantee this
protection and what type of data is collected for what purpose.

<br><br>

<h2>1.) Data collection, processing and use on this internet site. </h2>

<br>

Playata GmbH collects person-related data

<br><br>

<ul>
    <li>that you provide during registration,
    </li><li>that you provide for the billing of goods and services requiring payment
    </li><li>to, upon your request, participate in advertising campaigns and surveys
        or to gather information about products and services (advertising).
</li></ul>

<br>

Playata GmbH automatically collects and stores information in their server log files,
which your browser transfers to us, within the scope of the use of their internet
sites and their games.  These are:

<br><br>

<ul>
    <li>Browser type/version
    </li><li>Operating system used
    </li><li>Referrer URL (the previously visited site)
    </li><li>Host name of the accessing computer (IP address)
    </li><li>Cookies
    </li><li>Time of the server request.
</li></ul>

<br>

This data cannot be assigned to certain individuals by Playata GmbH. It shall be
used by Playata GmbH in a pseudonymous and/or anonymous form to tailor and improve our
offer according to the needs of the user. This data will not be combined with other data
sources; the data will be deleted following a statistical evaluation.

<br><br>

Playata GmbH shall process and use their person-related data for providing services
and for billing our services as well as for advertising purposes. In individual cases,
we shall commission related companies or other third parties to provide services.
This particularly applies to the handling of payments via external service
providers (PayPal, Global Collect, etc.) as well as to collection agencies in the case
of late payments. These external companies are obligated to treat your data confidentially
and safely to the extent required in fulfilling their duties.

<br><br>

<h2>2.) Cookies</h2><br>
The internet sites use so-called cookies at multiple points. They serve to make our
offer more user-friendly, effective and secure. Cookies are small text files placed on
your computer and stored by your browser. Alone, cookies cannot be used to identify the user.
Most of the cookies we use are so-called “session cookies”. They are automatically deleted after
your visit is concluded. Cookies do not cause harm to your computer and do not contain viruses.
Naturally, the websites and games operated by Playata GmbH can in principle also be used
without cookies if the web browser is set in such a manner that cookies are generally denied
or you are notified if a cookie is received, thus allowing you to decide every time whether
you would like to accept it or not. You can manually delete cookies that are already on your
computer at any time from the hard drive. Playata GmbH would like to inform you that using the
website and games without cookies may only be possible on a limited basis.

<br><br>

<h2>3.) E-Mail Advertising</h2><br>
Subject to your consent, your person-related data shall be stored, processed and used
by Playata GmbH and our marketing partner, European Games Group AG, for sending e-mail
advertising for browser games (products and services). You may revoke your consent for
this at any time in writing (e.g. per e-mail) without costs being incurred, apart from
the costs for sending the revocation (at the basic rates). In every piece of information
and in every newsletter sent by Playata GmbH or our marketing partner, European Games Group AG,
you will be given the option of rejecting the receipt of further information and sending
a respective cancellation.

<br><br>

<h2>4.) Right to Information</h2><br>
You have the right to information regarding your stored personal data, its origin
and recipients as well as the purpose for storage. The data protection representative
will provide information regarding the stored data (the supplier, complete as an e-mail link)
upon request.

<br><br>

<h2>5.) Further Information</h2><br>
Your trust is important to us. Therefore, we will answer any of your questions
regarding the processing of your person-related data. If you have questions that
were not addressed in this declaration of data protection, please contact our data
protection representative at any time via our contact form <a href="mailto:support@herozerogame.com?setLanguage=en_US">support@herozerogame.com</a>.
