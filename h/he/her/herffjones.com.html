collect about how individual visitors use our site (such as the fact that a
visitor likes entertainment news or has purchased certain merchandise). It does
not include aggregate information, which is general demographic information
(such as the total number of visitors who are more than 35 years old).</p>
<p><strong>Personally Identifiable Information&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Herff
Jones (and herffjones.com) uses personal information only for the following
purposes:</p>

aware of editorial features, advertisements, and commercial offerings that may
be of interest;</p>
<p>to
communicate with visitors;</p>
<p>to
register a visitor for a contest or sweepstakes and to administer or make
related offers from the same;</p>
<p>to
serve visitors when they have questions or problems;</p>
<p>to
perform normal business operations, such as billing, collection, and
accounting; and</p>
<p>to
investigate complaints and protect visitors, in compliance with the law.</p>
<p>Your
profile information (any demographic information you provide to Herffjones.com
such as zip code, age) may be used to create personalized content, services,
and marketing on Herffjones.com so that we can deliver information to you based
on your interests and location. In addition, Herffjones.com may provide
affiliates with non-personally identifiable profile information to generate
aggregate reports and market research, for example, '30% of Herffjones.com

<p><strong>Agreement, Interactive Features Guidelines and Policies</strong></p>
<p>Herffjones.com

information are required to follow specific practices concerning its proper
handling, as specifically authorized or as required by law.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>A Special Note Concerning Privacy and Children Online</strong></p>
<p>Although
the Internet offers a wealth of information and exciting opportunities to
explore, some of its content may not be suitable for children. Understandably,
as the popularity of the Internet has grown, so have concerns among parents. Herffjones.com
believes that parents should supervise their children's online activities and
suggests that they consider using parental control tools such as Cyber Patrol,
and software manufacturers that help provide a child-friendly online
environment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please
instruct your children not to give us their name, address or e-mail address, or
provide any personal information to anyone without your permission. It may also
be wise to carefully note all the people with whom your child frequently
corresponds over the Internet or on any online service.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Chat, Newsgroups, Bulletin Boards and Kids</strong></p>
<p>Chat,
newsgroups, and bulletin boards offer children and parents alike the unique
opportunity to make friends and talk to people all over the world. Please
remember, though, that these interactive features are just like other public
places where strangers meet. If you allow your children to access interactive
features, please remind them of the dangers involved when corresponding or
communicating with strangers or new acquaintances on the Internet (especially
in Chat and Newsgroups, as well as when using e-mail). We strongly recommend
that you supervise your children's activities on these areas as you would in
any public area. You should help your children understand that people they do
not know will be reading their notes. They should be careful when choosing what
to post (particularly information about themselves), as well as when choosing
the people with whom they correspond. Also, only you, as a parent, can
establish which topics and individual notes are appropriate for your family,
just as you would for television programs or movies. Children and teenagers get
a lot of benefit from being online, but they can also be targets of crime and
exploitation in this as in any other environment. Trusting, curious, and
anxious to explore this new world and the relationships it brings, children and
teenagers need parental supervision and common sense advice to ensure that
their experiences in 'cyberspace' are happy, healthy, and productive.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>How Parents Can Reduce the Risks</strong></p>
<p>Take
advantage of Cyber Patrol. Also, to further restrict your child's access to
discussions, forums, or bulletin boards that contain inappropriate material,
some Internet sites and private bulletin boards have systems in place for
parents to block out parts of the sites that they feel are inappropriate for
their children. If you are concerned, you should contact the site find out how
you can add these restrictions to any accounts that your children can access.
The Internet and some private bulletin boards contain areas designed
specifically for adults who wish to post, view, or read sexually explicit
material. Most private bulletin board operators who post such material limit
access only to people who attest that they are adults but, like any other
safeguards, be aware that there are always going to be cases where adults fail
to enforce them or children find ways around them.</p>
<p>The
best way to ensure that your children are having positive online experiences is
to stay in touch with what they are doing. One way to do this is to spend time
with your children while they're online. Have them show you what they do and
ask them to teach you how to access the sites. While children and teenagers
need a certain amount of privacy, they also need parental involvement and
supervision in their daily lives. The same general parenting skills that apply
to the 'real world' also apply while online.</p>
<p>If you
have cause for concern about your children's online activities, talk to them.
Also seek out the advice and counsel of other computer users in your area and
become familiar with literature on Cyber Patrol and other filtering devices.
Open communication with your children, utilization of such computer resources,
and getting online yourself will help you obtain the full benefits of these
devices and alert you to any potential problem that may occur with their use.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Guidelines for Parents</strong></p>
<p>By
taking responsibility for their children's online computer use, parents can
greatly minimize the potential risks. Make it a family rule to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Never give out identifying information - home address, school
name, or telephone number - in a public message such as chat or bulletin
boards, and be sure you are dealing with someone that both you and your child
know and trust before giving it out via e-mail. Think carefully before
revealing any personal information such as age, marital status, or financial
information. Consider using a pseudonym or unlisting your child's name from
Internet sites in which they participate.</li>
<li>Consider keeping the computer in a family room rather than the
child's bedroom. Be sure to make this a family activity. Get to know their
'online friends' just as you get to know all of their other friends.</li>
<li>Get to know the Internet sites your child uses. If you don't
know how to get to them, get your child to show you. Find out what types of
information it offers and whether there are ways for parents to block out
objectionable material.</li>
<li>Never allow a child to arrange a face-to-face meeting with
another computer user without parental permission. If a meeting is arranged,
make the first one in a public spot, and be sure to accompany your child.</li>
<li>Never respond to messages or bulletin board items that are
suggestive, obscene, belligerent, threatening, or make you feel uncomfortable.
Encourage your children to tell you if they encounter such messages. If you or
your child receives a message that is harassing, or of a sexual nature, or
threatening, alert the appropriate law enforcement agency.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Should
you become aware of the transmission, use, or viewing of child pornography
while online, immediately report this to the Federal Bureau of Investigation
and to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children by calling
1.800.843.5678.</p>
<p>Remember
that people online may not be who they seem. Because you can't see or even hear
the person, it is easy for someone to misrepresent him - or herself. Thus,
someone indicating that 'she' is a '12-year-old girl' could really be a
40-year-old man.</p>
<p>Remember
that everything you read online may not be true. Any offer that's 'too good to
be true' probably is. Be very careful about any offers that involve your coming
to a meeting or having someone visit your house.</p>
<p>Set
reasonable rules and guidelines for computer use by your children. Discuss
these rules and post them near the computer as a reminder. Remember to monitor
their compliance with these rules, especially when it comes to the amount of
time your children spend on the computer. A child or teenager's excessive use
of the interactive features of the Internet, especially late at night, may be a
clue that there is a potential problem.</p>
