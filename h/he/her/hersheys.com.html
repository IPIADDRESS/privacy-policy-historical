                              </span>
                              <p>Our Privacy Policy applies to children as well as adults. There are some extra precautions that we take, however, with respect to collecting information from children under 13.</p>
                              <ul>
                                <li>All promotion
                                entrants will be requested to provide their age. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13 on-line without first obtaining permission from the child’s parent or guardian. 
                                When a child under 13 years old attempts to 
                                register for a promotion or sweepstakes, we send 
                                their parent or guardian an e-mail to get their 
                                permission to collect the child’s personally 
                                identifiable information as part of their 
                                registration. If we do not receive permission 
                                within 14 days, we will delete the child’s 
                                request and they will not be able to complete 
                                their registration or enter any promotions 
                                online. Once a parent or guardian gives their 
                                permission for their child to register, the 
                                parent will be asked to complete the child's 
                                mailing information on behalf of the child.&nbsp; 
                                When complete, the child will be able to enter 
                                future registration-based sweepstakes or 
                                contests without any further requests of consent 
                                to the parent; however the parent will be 
                                notified when the child enters a promotion.&nbsp; 
                                Should the child's personally identifiable 
                                information require updating, the parent will be 
                                required to make any and all updates to their 
                                child's online registration information on 
                                behalf of the child. If a child under 13 is a winner, we will contact you and/or your child by e-mail for prize fulfillment purposes.</li>
                                <li>We do not require a child to provide more personally identifiable information than is reasonably necessary to participate in an activity. (You may wish to be aware that, according to the FTC, web site operators are not permitted to collect more information than is needed for a child to participate in an on-line activity.)</li>
                                <li>Our web sites do not offer activities that allow your child or Hershey to disclose your child’s personal information publicly (for example through chat rooms or message boards).</li>
                                <li>We do not share your child’s personally identifiable information with third parties.</li>
