Privacy Policy</span></strong><br>
Welcome to the web sites of the Helena Independent Record, a LEE enterprises
newspaper located in Helena Montana. We believe in your right to know what information
is collected during your visit to our web sites and how the information is used
and safeguarded. <br>
The information gathered by the Helena Independent Record website falls into
two categories: <br>
<a class="full" href="#info">(1) information voluntarily supplied by visitors to our websites
through optional registration</a><br>
<span class="arial14">and</span> <br>
<a class="full" href="#tracking">(2) tracking information gathered as visitors navigate
through our sites. </a></p>

inlcudes</strong></span><strong>:</strong><br>

<a name="info"></a><span class="arial14"><strong>Information Gathered by Voluntary
Submission</strong><br>
</span>To make use of certain features on our websites (such as free email, personal
web pages, chatrooms and other interactive forums) visitors need to register
and to provide certain information as part of the registration or participation
process. (We may ask, for example, for your name, email address, sex, age, and
zip code, and we might request information on your interest in sports, personal
finance, the performing arts, and the like.)
</p><p>The information you supply will help us to offer you more personalized features,
to tailor our sites to your interests and make them more useful to you. The more
you tell us about yourself, the more value we can offer you. Supplying such information
is entirely voluntary. But if you don't supply the information we need, we may
be unable to provide you with services we make available to other visitors to
our sites. Of course, even if you want to remain completely anonymous, you're
still free to take advantage of the wealth of content available on our sites
without registration. [ <a href="#top">top</a> ] </p>
<p><a name="tracking"></a><strong><span class="arial14">Information Automatically
Gathered About All Visitors</span></strong><span class="arial14"><br>
</span>We collect aggregate and user-specific information on what pages consumers
access or visit. This information is used to generate reports that help the Helena
Independent Record assess the value of and interest in the various web sites.
The information we collect is used by us to improve the content of our web page.
We can build a better site if we know which pages our users are visiting and
how often.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our web servers automatically collect limited information about your computer's
connection to the Internet, including your IP address but not the e-mail address,
when you visit our sites. Your IP address does not identify you personally. We
use this information to deliver our web pages to you upon request, to tailor
our sites to the interests of our users, and to measure traffic within our sites.&nbsp; </p>
<p>To help make our sites more responsive to the needs of our visitors, we may
utilize a standard feature of browser software, called a "cookie". The cookie
doesn't actually identify the visitor, just the computer that a visitor uses
to access our site. A cookie can't read data off your hard drive. Our advertisers
or content partners may also assign their own cookies to your browser, a process
that we cannot control. We use cookies to help us tailor our site to your needs,
to deliver a better, more personalized service. It is a cookie, for example,
that allows us to deliver your personalized stock quotes each time you visit
a site.&nbsp; [ <a href="#top">top</a> ] </p>
<p><a name="others"></a><strong><span class="arial14">Information Shared With Other
Organizations</span></strong><span class="arial14"><br>
</span>When we present information to our advertisers -- to help them understand
our audience and confirm the value of advertising on our websites -- it is usually
in the form of aggregated statistics on traffic to various pages within our sites.
From time to time, we may share information on visitors to our sites with those
marketing products and services that we believe may be of interest to you. This
list can include your e-mail address and, other specific information (such as
your phone number or street address) you may have provided us while online. [ <a href="#top">top</a> ] </p>
<p><a name="children"></a><span class="arial14"><strong>Special Attention to Children</strong><br>
</span>Children should always get permission from their parents before sending
any information about themselves (such as their names, email addresses, and phone
numbers) over the Internet, to us or to anyone else. We do not specifically collect
information about children. We encourage parents to review and share safety tips
with their children participating in the online experience. [ <a href="#top">top</a> ] </p>
<a name="note"></a><span class="arial14"><strong>A final note:</strong><br>
</span>The Helena Independent Record is affiliated with other online companies,
some of which feature our branding. This policy statement does not apply to those
companies' web sites; please refer to these affiliated sites to obtain information
on their privacy policies. If you can't find the privacy policy of any of these
sites via a link from the site's homepage, you should contact the site directly
for more information.
<p>The Web is an evolving medium. If we need to change our privacy policy at
some point in the future, we'll post the changes before they take effect. Of
course, our use of information gathered while the current policy is in effect
will always be consistent with the current policy, even if we change that policy
later. [ <a href="#top">top</a> ] </p></td>
