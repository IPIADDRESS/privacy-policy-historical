<p>Serving customers well is very important to us.  As part of this service, we may use your personal information to identify a product or service that you may be interested in.  We may contact you from time to time to let you know about new or exciting products or services and special offers.  You may contact us at any time if you do not wish to receive marketing information.</p>
<p><strong>Third Party Advertisers</strong></p>
<p>We work with third parties to serve ads on our website and to serve ads on sites owned or operated by other companies. Our ad servers, and those of our partners, use cookies and pixel tags in order to anonymously identify your browser. Some ad companies, such as ad networks, may combine anonymous information obtained in connection with activity on our website with information obtained from other sources and/or sites. We do not use or share your personal information with our ad servers, media partners or ad networks without your authorisation.</p>
<p>We use anonymous Session Data, such as the destination of your search, in order to advertise to you on our website and on other sites. We do not sell your Session Data to any other party in connection with our ad programs but we may use it in order to run ads on behalf of others, such as travel suppliers. You can opt-out of this kind of advertising by <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp" target="_blank">clicking here</a>. By opting out of this kind of advertising you may still receive ads from helloworld or ads from other parties that are broadly targeted (not on the basis of your Session Data).</p>
<div><strong>Opting-Out</strong></div>
<p>As part of the registration process we give you the ability to receive commercial communications about products and services, updates to our website and customised advertisements and promotions that are targeted to your specific interests, such as flight specials, promotions and other travel opportunities available on our website and/or sponsored by our travel service providers and advertisers. We send these communications directly ourselves or via service providers. If you do not opt-out from receiving these communications, we will send them to you. At any time you may change your selection to receive or not receive these communications. In addition, these communications will include instructions on how to unsubscribe.</p>
<p><strong>Monitoring</strong></p>
<p>We may from time to time monitor and review any information transmitted or received through our website, or through telephone or e-mail communications, for quality assurance and other purposes. We reserve the right to censor, edit, remove or prohibit the transmission or receipt of any information that we deem inappropriate or in violation of our terms and conditions. During monitoring the information may be examined, recorded or copied.</p>
<p><strong>Links</strong></p>
<p>When you click on a third party’s link from our website, or from an ad for a third party served by one of our service providers, you will enter that third party’s site, over which we have no control. We are not responsible for third party sites. You should carefully review the privacy statements of any other sites you visit, because those privacy statements will apply to your visit to such other sites and may be very different from this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p><strong>Social Plug-Ins</strong></p>
<p>Our website includes social plug-ins, such as the Facebook or Twitter button, and gives you the option to post information about your activities on our Site to your social media accounts. These features may collect your IP address, which page you are visiting on our website, and may set a cookie to enable the feature to function properly. Social plug-ins are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our website. Your interactions with these features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing them.</p>
<div><br></div>
