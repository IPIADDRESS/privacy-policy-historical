At Help.com, we have a few fundamental principles:</p><ul><li>We don’t ask you for personal information unless we truly need it.</li><li>We don’t share your personal information with anyone except to comply with the law, develop our products, or protect our rights.</li><li>We don’t store personal information on our servers unless required for the on-going operation of one of our services.</li></ul><p></p><p>Below is our privacy policy which incorporates these goals:</p><p>If you have questions about deleting or correcting your personal data, please <a href="mailto:hello@help.com" target="_blank">contact us</a>.</p><p>Help.com, LLC (“<strong>Help.com</strong>”) operates the website Help.com, as well as customer service applications operating under the same or similar names. It is Help.com’s policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating our website and application.</p><h3>Website Visitors</h3><p>Like most website operators, Help.com collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Help.com’s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Help.com’s visitors use its website. From time to time, Help.com may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website or application.</p><p>Help.com also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users of its application. Help.com only discloses logged in user IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below, except that logged in user IP addresses and other information are visible and disclosed to the administrators of the company with which the user account is associated.</p><h3>Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</h3><p>Certain visitors to Help.com’s websites choose to interact with Help.com in ways that require Help.com to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that Help.com gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors to provide us with their email address to signup for our newsletter. Those who engage in transactions with Help.com – by purchasing access to our application, for example – are asked to provide additional information, including as necessary the personal and financial information required to process those transactions. In each case, Help.com collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor’s interaction with Help.com. Help.com does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.</p><h3>Aggregated Statistics</h3><p>Help.com may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites and users of its application. For instance, Help.com may identify trends in customer service responsiveness by looking at aggregate response time data. Help.com may display this information publicly or provide it to others. However, Help.com does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.</p><h3>Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information</h3><p>Help.com discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on Help.com’s behalf or to provide services available at Help.com’s websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using Help.com’s websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. Help.com will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, Help.com discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or when Help.com believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Help.com, third parties or the public at large. If you are a registered user of a Help.com website and have supplied your email address, Help.com may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what’s going on with Help.com and our products. We primarily use our blog and social media accounts to communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. Help.com takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.</p><h3>Cookies</h3><p>A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor’s computer, and that the visitor’s browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. Help.com uses cookies to help Help.com identify and track visitors, their usage of Help.com website and application, and their website access preferences. Help.com visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using Help.com’s websites, with the drawback that certain features of Help.com’s websites may not function properly without the aid of cookies.</p><h3>Business Transfers</h3><p>If Help.com, or substantially all of its assets, were acquired, or in the unlikely event that Help.com goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of Help.com may continue to use your personal information as set forth in this policy.</p><h3>Privacy Policy Changes</h3><p>Although most changes are likely to be minor, Help.com may change its Privacy Policy from time to time, and in Help.com’s sole discretion. Help.com encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to its Privacy Policy. Your continued use of this site after any change in this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such change.</p><h3>Miscellaneous</h3><p>Thank you to <a href="http://automattic.com/" target="_blank">Automattic</a> for releasing their privacy policy under the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.5/" target="_blank">Creative Commons Sharealike license</a>.</p><footer><a href="/">Home</a><a href="mailto:hello@help.com">Contact Us</a><a href="//blog.help.com">Blog</a></footer></div></body></html>
