          <h3>What information does Help Scout collect?</h3>

          <p>Depending on your use of the Help Scout Service, we collect two types of information: <em>personally identifiable information</em> and <em>non-personally identifiable information</em>.</p>

          <h4>Personally Identifiable Information </h4>
          
          <p>Personally identifiable information identifies you or can be used to identify or contact you. Examples of personally identifiable information include your name, company name, job title, address, e-mail address, telephone number, and billing and credit card information. </p>

          <h4>Non-Personally Identifiable Information</h4>
  
          <p>Non-personally identifiable information is information, any single of item of which, by itself, cannot be used to identify or contact you, including demographic information (such as age, profession, company industry, gender, current location, or zip code), IP addresses, browser types, domain names, and statistical data involving the use of the Help Scout Service. Certain non-personally identifiable information may be considered a part of your personally identifiable information if it were combined with other identifiers (for example, combining your zip code with your street address) in a way that enables you to be identified. But the same pieces of information are considered non-personally identifiable information when they are taken alone or combined only with other non-personally identifiable information (for example, your account preferences).</p>

It can also be used to further complete your Help Scout Services profile with an image or other form of information that is made publicly available by other online services.</p>

          <h4>Registering to Use the Help Scout Service and in the Course of Using the Help Scout Service.</h4>

          <p>"<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_cookie" target="_blank">Cookies</a>" are small text files that can be placed on your computer or mobile device in order to identify your Web browser and the activities of your computer on the Help Scout Service and other websites. Cookies can be used to personalize your experience on the Help Scout websites (such as dynamically generating content on webpages specifically designed for you), to assist you in using the Help Scout Service (such as saving time by not having to reenter your name each time you use the Help Scout Service), to allow us to statistically monitor how you are using the Help Scout Service so that we can improve our offerings, and to target certain advertisements to your browser which may be of interest to you or to determine the popularity of certain content.</p>

          <p>You do not have to accept cookies to use the Help Scout Service. Although most browsers are initially set to accept cookies, you may change your browser settings to notify you when you receive a cookie or to reject cookies generally. However, if you reject cookies, certain features or resources of the Help Scout websites may not work properly or at all and you may have a degraded experience.</p>

          <p>"<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_bug" target="_blank">Page tags</a>," also known as web beacons or gif tags, are a web technology used to help track website or email usage information, such as how many times a specific page or email has been viewed. Page tags are invisible to you, and any portion of the Help Scout Service, including advertisements, or e-mail sent on our behalf, may contain page tags.</p>

          <p>By using cookies and page tags together, we are able to improve the Help Scout Service and measure the effectiveness of our advertising and marketing campaigns.</p> 

          <p>Finally, you should be aware that this Privacy Policy does not govern the use of third-party websites or services or providers of third-party services.</p>
