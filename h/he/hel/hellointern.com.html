extremely important to us and is one of our top objectives when designing the 
website and its infrastructure. We recognize and respect the importance of 
maintaining the privacy of our customers and look forward to maintaining the 
trust in our business relationship. We have created this privacy policy to 
disclose and explain you why we gather customer and member information, what 
information we collect, how we collect it, what we use the information for and 
how you can instruct us to limit the use of that information. We have designed 
our procedures and processes for handling your data with the same high quality 
care and security that we would expect our own personal data to be handled.</font></p>
