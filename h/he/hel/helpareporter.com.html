<p>HelpAReporter.com is owned and run by Two Cats and a Cup of Coffee, LLC ("HelpAReporter.com", "HelpAReporter", "HARO", "us").  To contact us with questions about this privacy policy, e-mail us at email us at www.helpareporter.com, or via postal mail at:  </p>

<p>Two Cats and a Cup of Coffee, LLC, c/o Jerry S. Goldman, Esquire, Anderson Kill &amp; Olick, P.C., 1251 Avenue of the Americas, New York, New York 10020 USA (+1-212-278-1000).</p>

<h2>2. Scope</h2>
<p>Two Cats and a Cup of Coffee, LLC, has adopted this Privacy Policy to inform its customers and others about how it protects personally identifiable information and other information that may be collected when users visit the HelpAReporter.com web site.</p>

<p>This Privacy Policy covers HARO's treatment of personal or personally identifiable information ("Personal Information") that may be collected when you are on the HelpAReporter.com website, and when you use the services of HelpAReporter.com. The privacy of your nonpublic information is important to us.  This includes, but is not limited to, your name, email address and any other personally identifiable information.  We use safeguards to protect your privacy and confidentiality.  This Policy Statement discusses information we collect and the manner in which it is used.</p>

<h2>3. Information Collection</h2>
<p>Our primary goal in collecting personal information is to provide you with a smooth, efficient, and customized experience.</p>

<p>HelpAReporter.com is sensitive to the protection of customer identifiable information which an individual or another customer reasonably expects to be kept private.  Customer identifiable information means information which can be associated with a specific entity or individual, including, by way of example, a customer's name, e-mail address, and information about on-line activities which can be directly linked to him or her.</p>

<p>If you become a HARO Source member, we will create an account for you, at HelpAReporter.com, which will contain your name, e-mail, and other identifying information.  This account will be used to send out the periodic emails.  If you respond to an anonymous posting, we will retain that response (and even if you are not a Source member, we will  retain that email information).   </p>

<p>If you become a HARO Journalist member, we will create an account for you, at HelpAReporter.com, which will contain your name, e-mail, and other identifying information.  This information will be displayed on our emails we send out to the Source Members listing your request for information.  If you post a request for information anonymously, we will create a Google filter for incoming emails which will then forward those emails which properly comply with the instructions to you.  We will receive copies of those emails as well as any responses which did not properly comply with the instructions.
HARO may also collect Personal Information from your usage of the HelpAReporter.com website.  If you do nothing during your visit but browse through the website and read the information contained on the Web pages, we may gather certain information about your visit automatically, such as your IP address, the date and time you access a given page, and the pages you visit.
