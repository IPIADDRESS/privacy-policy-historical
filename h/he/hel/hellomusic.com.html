<h4>
            Hello Music, LLC Privacy Policy</h4>
        <p>
            This Privacy Policy is effective as of and was last updated on <b>September 2, 2011</b>.</p>
        <div class="h5_hAlt">
            <a name="PP_general">1. General</a></div>
        <p>
            This privacy policy (this <b>"Privacy Policy"</b>) is designed to inform
            you about the type of information that Hello Music (<b>"we,"</b> <b>"us,"</b>
            or <b>"our"</b>) may gather or collect from you in connection with your
            use of this site (this <b>"Site"</b>). It also explains the conditions
            under which we use and disclose that information, and your rights in relation to
            that information.</p>
        <p>
            The procedures for modifying or changing this Privacy Policy in the future are discussed
            in Section 5 of this document.</p>

            <a name="PP_non_personally">2. Gathering, Use and Disclosure of Non-Personally-Identifying Information</a></div>
        <p>
            We collect both Non-Personally-Identifying Information and Personally-Identifying
            Information from you. <b>"Non–Personally–Identifying Information"</b>
            is information that, without the aid of additional information, cannot be directly
            associated with a specific person or entity. <b>"Personally–Identifying Information,"</b>
            by contrast, is information such as a name or email address that, without more,
            can be directly associated with a specific person or entity.</p>

                <p>
                    Like most site operators, we gather Non-Personally-Identifying Information from
                    you of the sort that web browsers, depending on their settings, may make available.
                    That information includes your Internet Protocol (<b>"IP"</b>) address,
                    operating system and browser type, and the locations of the web pages you view right
                    before arriving at, while navigating and immediately after leaving this Site.</p>
                <div class="h6_alt">
                    (ii) Web Cookies</div>
                <p>
                    A <b>"Web Cookie"</b> is a string of information that a site stores on
                    your computer, and your browser provides to this Site, each time you submit a query
                    to this Site. We may use Web Cookies to track the pages that you visit during each
                    Site session, both to help us improve your experience and to help us understand
                    how this Site is being used.</p>
                <p>
                    IF YOU DO NOT WISH TO HAVE WEB COOKIES PLACED ON YOUR COMPUTER, YOU SHOULD SET YOUR
                    BROWSER TO REFUSE WEB COOKIES BEFORE ACCESSING THIS SITE, WITH THE UNDERSTANDING
                    THAT CERTAIN FEATURES OF THIS SITE MAY NOT FUNCTION PROPERLY WITHOUT THE AID OF
                    WEB COOKIES. IF YOU REFUSE WEB COOKIES, YOU ASSUME ALL RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY RESULTING
                    LOSS OF FUNCTIONALITY.</p>
                <div class="h6_alt">
                    (iii) Web Beacons</div>
                <p>
                    A <b>"Web Beacon"</b> is an object that is embedded in a web page. It
                    is usually invisible to you but allows site operators to check whether you have
                    viewed a particular web page or email communication. We may place Web Beacons on
                    pages of this Site and in emails we send to you.</p>
                <p>
                    You may not decline Web Beacons. However, they may be rendered ineffective by declining
                    all cookies or modifying your browser setting to notify you each time a cookie is
                    tendered and permit you to accept or decline cookies on an individual basis.</p>
                <div class="h6_alt">
                    (iv) Third Parties' Use of Web Beacons and Web Cookies</div>

                    This Site may include third-party advertising, links to other sites, and other content
                    from third party businesses. The content posted by these parties will be reasonably

                    Web Beacons and Web Cookies to measure the effectiveness of their ads, personalize
                    or optimize advertising content and to track users who link from their respective
                    sites to this Site, but this third party technology does not permit them to access
                    your Personal Information.</p>
                <p>
                    We do not have access to or control over Web Beacons or Web Cookies that these third
                    parties may use, and the information practices of these advertisers and third-party
                    websites or businesses are not covered by this Privacy Policy but are covered by
                    their respective privacy policies as is described in more detail in Section 5 below.</p>
                <p>
                    Some third party advertising companies may provide a mechanism to opt-out of their
                    technology. For more information about these partners and links to their privacy

            <p>
                We analyze Non–Personally–Identifying Information gathered from users of this Site
                to help us better understand how this Site is being used. By identifying patterns
