            Hello Music Privacy Policy</h4>
        <p>
            This Privacy Policy is effective as of and was last updated on <b>January 20, 2010</b>.</p>

            This privacy policy (this <b>"Privacy Policy"</b>) is designed to inform
            you about the type of information that Hello Music (<b>"we,"</b> <b>"us,"</b>
            or <b>"our"</b>) may gather or collect from you in connection with your
            use of this site (this <b>"Site"</b>). It also explains the conditions
            under which we use and disclose that information, and your rights in relation to
            that information.</p>
        <p>
            The procedures for modifying or changing this Privacy Policy in the future are discussed
            in Section 6 of this document.</p>

            This Site is not intended for children under 13 years of age. We do not knowingly

        <p>
            We collect both Non-Personally-Identifying Information and Personally-Identifying
            Information from you. <b>"Non–Personally–Identifying Information"</b>
            is information that, without the aid of additional information, cannot be directly
            associated with a specific person or entity. <b>"Personally–Identifying Information,"</b>
            by contrast, is information such as a name or email address that, without more,
            can be directly associated with a specific person or entity.</p>

                <p>
                    Like most site operators, we gather Non-Personally-Identifying Information from
                    you of the sort that web browsers, depending on their settings, may make available.
                    That information includes your Internet Protocol (<b>"IP"</b>) address,
                    operating system and browser type, and the locations of the web pages you view right
                    before arriving at, while navigating and immediately after leaving this Site.</p>
                <div class="h6_alt">
                    (ii) Web Cookies</div>
                <p>
                    A <b>"Web Cookie"</b> is a string of information that a site stores on
                    your computer, and your browser provides to this Site, each time you submit a query
                    to this Site. We may use Web Cookies to track the pages that you visit during each
                    Site session, both to help us improve your experience and to help us understand
                    how this Site is being used.</p>
                <p>
                    IF YOU DO NOT WISH TO HAVE WEB COOKIES PLACED ON YOUR COMPUTER, YOU SHOULD SET YOUR
                    BROWSER TO REFUSE WEB COOKIES BEFORE ACCESSING THIS SITE, WITH THE UNDERSTANDING
                    THAT CERTAIN FEATURES OF THIS SITE MAY NOT FUNCTION PROPERLY WITHOUT THE AID OF
                    WEB COOKIES. IF YOU REFUSE WEB COOKIES, YOU ASSUME ALL RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY RESULTING
                    LOSS OF FUNCTIONALITY.</p>

                    (iii) Web Beacons</div>
                <p>
                    A <b>"Web Beacon"</b> is an object that is embedded in a web page. It
                    is usually invisible to you but allows site operators to check whether you have
                    viewed a particular web page or email communication. We may place Web Beacons on
                    pages of this Site and in emails we send to you.</p>
                <p>
                    You may not decline Web Beacons. However, they may be rendered ineffective by declining
                    all cookies or modifying your browser setting to notify you each time a cookie is
                    tendered and permit you to accept or decline cookies on an individual basis.</p>

                    (iv) Third Parties' Use of Web Beacons and Web Cookies</div>
                <p>
                    This Site may include third-party advertising, links to other sites, and other content
                    from third party businesses. The content posted by these parties will be reasonably
                    identifiable as coming from a third party. These third-party sites, businesses,
                    and advertisers, or advertising companies working on their behalf, sometimes use
                    Web Beacons and Web Cookies to measure the effectiveness of their ads, personalize
                    or optimize advertising content and to track users who link from their respective
                    sites to this Site, but this third party technology does not permit them to access
                    your Personal Information.</p>
                <p>
                    We do not have access to or control over Web Beacons or Web Cookies that these third
                    parties may use, and the information practices of these advertisers and third-party
                    websites or businesses are not covered by this Privacy Policy but are covered by
                    their respective privacy policies as is described in more detail in Section 5 below.</p>
                <p>
                    Some third party advertising companies may provide a mechanism to opt-out of their
                    technology. For more information about these partners and links to their privacy
                    policies, please view each third party’s site.</p>

            that operate them. Before visiting a third-party site, whether by means of a link
            on this Site or otherwise, and before providing any Personally-Identifying Information
            to any third party, you should inform yourself of the privacy policies and practices
            (if any) of the third party responsible for that site, and should take those steps
            necessary to your discretion, to protect your privacy.</p>

            Because of changes in technology and the growth and development of our business,

            date on this Site. It is therefore important that you register with the site and
            notify us if you change your email address. If you do not provide us with a current
            email address, you should regularly review this policy to ensure that you are informed
            of any changes.</p>

	        Hello Music Deals Privacy Policy</h4>
        <p>
	        <a name="DPP_general">Your privacy should remain private, so: We don't give your email address to third parties. We don't give your home address or credit card number away, either. But we want you to know a few things about how we handle information you give us.</a></p>
        <p>
	        Hello Music Deals collects information from you that we need in order to: process your order; provide you with member support; allow you to participate in the community and enter contests and other site features; and send you newsletters and other communications such as polls, surveys, and special Hello Music Deals offers. This information includes, but is not limited to: name, shipping and billing address, credit card number, e-mail address, etc.</p>
        <p>
	        Hello Music Deals will set and access our own cookies on your computer to allow you to make purchases and interact at the site. We also use web beacons to gather anonymous, aggregated statistical information (e.g. unique hits, page views, etc.) about our website traffic.</p>
        <p>
	        Hello Music Deals may share information collected by us with third parties to help process your order (e.g. shipping companies, credit card processors, etc.) or to provide statistical and demographic analysis to Hello Music Deals to help us and our business partners provide you with better services and offerings.</p>
        <p>
	        Hello Music Deals will not share, rent, lease, or sell your personal information (e.g. your e-mail address, your credit card information, your name, your address, etc.) to any third party for their independent use or benefit. Never! Ever!</p>
        <p>
	        Basically, this is all the same mumbo-jumbo that other sites put into more legal terms so you become confused and don't read it all. The difference between us and them is...we mean it.</p>
        <p>
	        Future changes to this Privacy Policy may be made at any time by sending you an email or posting notice of the changes on the site, with the changes effective 30 days after Hello Music Deals' dispatch of the email or posting of the notice.
