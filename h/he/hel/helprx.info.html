If you do not agree with any terms, please do not use this site or submit any personal information.&nbsp;
 </p>
<p>
NOTE: We are not responsible for the privacy practices of web sites operated by third parties that are linked to or integrated with our sites, including the sites of our partners, or for the privacy practices of third party Internet advertising companies. Once you've left our site via such a link or by clicking on an advertisement, you should check the applicable privacy policy of the third party or advertiser site to determine how they will handle any information they collect from you. Healthcare Alliance does not act on behalf of, nor is an agency or business associate of, any of the pharmacies referenced on this website, who are independent companies.
</p>
<p>
Information posted to the Site may not be protected by any federal or state confidentiality, privacy, or security laws, including the administrative simplification provision of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 and its implementing regulations (HIPAA). This Site IS not intended to be, and must not be taken to be, the practice of medicine or the practice of other health care services BY HEALTHCARE ALLIANCE. Use of the Site and the Services does not create a physician/patient, provider/patient, confidential, or privileged relationship, or any other relationship that would give rise to any duties on the part of the Healthcare Alliance.
</p>
<p>
From time to time, Healthcare Alliance may find it necessary or be legally obligated to revise this Privacy Policy as we add new products and services, as we improve our current offerings, and as technologies or the law change, or for other reasons. If we make revisions that change the way we collect or use your personally identifiable information, those changes will be posted in this Privacy Policy, the effective date will be noted at the beginning of the Policy, and we will post clear and conspicuous notice of the changes, and we will email you if you have supplied us with your email address and you have not revoked our ability to contact you. Therefore, you should review this policy periodically so that you are up to date on our most current policies and practices.

<ul>
<li>What Information Does Healthcare Alliance Gather and How is it Gathered?</li>
<ul class="privacy_ul">
<li type="circle">
 Generally: When you visit our web site, we automatically collect non-personally identifiable information such as IP addresses and web site usage information from you. To become a Healthcare Alliance member, you will either be asked to provide a basic profile about yourself by filling out an online registration form with personal information such as your name, mailing address, email address, phone number, and related information, and in some cases payment information (including credit and/or debit card number and expiration date). A record of the fact that you are a member also is maintained.&nbsp;
</li>
<li type="circle">
Cookies: We use a standard Internet technology called "cookies" to store and track visitor information. A cookie is a small text file that is automatically stored on your computer for future retrieval. Cookies allow us to, among other things, count the number of unique visitors to the site to measure traffic patterns on our site, personalize a user experience to our site and facilitate the login for registered members. We also use web beacons (invisible images often referred to as pixel tags or clear GIFs) on our sites in order to recognize users and assess traffic patterns, and we include web beacons and cookies in our e-mail messages, including newsletters, in order to count how many e-mail messages have been opened.&nbsp;
</li>
<li type="circle">
Our Merchant Partners: When you choose to accept a special retail offer or otherwise interact with or receive benefits from our merchant partners, you may be asked to provide them with personally identifiable information. Once received from you, Merchant Partners may use that information in accordance with their own privacy policies, which may differ from our Privacy Policy.
</li>
<li>
Other Site Features: Certain other features such as "send this link to a friend," or any feature of substantially the same functions, may also require us to collect personally identifiable information, such as the name and e-mail address of both the sender and the recipient.&nbsp;

<li>How Do We Use and Disclose Your Information? </li>
 <ul class="privacy_ul">
 <li>
Traffic Analysis: To ensure what we offer matches your needs, we may provide third parties with aggregate statistics about our customers, traffic patterns, and related site information. This data reflects site usage patterns gathered during thousands of Member visits to our Web site each month but does not contain behavioral, personal, or identifying information about any individual member, unless that member has given us permission to share that information.&nbsp;

Occasionally, we may also use the information we collect to notify you about important changes to our Web site, new services, and special offers we think you will find valuable.&nbsp;
&nbsp;</li>
<li>
Third Parties: We may share your information with other companies whose products and services may be of interest to you. These third parties may contact you as part of their marketing efforts.
