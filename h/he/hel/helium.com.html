	</ul>


	<p><strong>Information Sharing and Disclosure</strong></p>


	<ul>
	<li>Helium is not in the business of renting or selling personal information you provide on this site with other people or nonaffiliated companies. Helium does share your information to provide products or services you've requested, when we have your permission, and under the following circumstances: 
	<ul>
	<li>We provide the information to trusted partners who work on behalf of or with Helium under confidentiality agreements. These companies may use your personal information to help Helium communicate with you about offers from Helium and our marketing partners.

		<li>We may share names and emails of members who join Helium as part of a co-branded partnership with Helium with that specific partner.</li>
		<li>We may share aggregate demographic information with third parties such as the media, advertisers, and government agencies.

		<li>We may share your information to respond to subpoenas, court orders, or legal process or to otherwise cooperate with law enforcement agencies or officials, or to establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims; </li>
		<li>We may share your information if we believe it is necessary in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of Helium's terms of use, or as otherwise required by law.</li>
		<li>We will transfer information about you if Helium is acquired by or merged with another company. In this event, Helium will notify you before information about you is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.</li>
	</ul></li>
	</ul>


	<p><strong>Cookies</strong></p>


	<ul>
	<li>Helium sets and accesses cookies on your computer. A cookie is a small bit of information used by the site to track your session. It does not contain any sensitive information.

		<li>You may opt out of receiving Helium emails by clicking on the “Unsubscribe” link. Please note that even if you do opt out of receiving marketing materials, we reserve the right, and will continue to send you certain infrequent communications relating to the Helium service and/or your account, such as service announcements and administrative messages, that are considered part of your Helium account, without offering you the opportunity to opt-out of receiving them.</li>
	</ul>


	<p><strong>Confidentiality and Security</strong></p>


	<ul>
	<li>We limit access to personal information about you to employees who we believe reasonably need to come into contact with that information to provide products or services to you or in order to do their jobs.</li>
		<li>We have physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards that comply with federal regulations to protect personal information about you.</li>
		<li>Your Helium Account Information is password-protected.</li>
		<li>In certain areas Helium uses industry-standard <span class="caps">SSL</span> encryption to protect data transmissions.</li>
		<li>Data you provide to us will be stored on our servers located either in our offices in Massachusetts, or elsewhere in the United States or abroad.  By providing us with your information, you understand and consent to the international transfer of your data. </li>
		<li>You should take steps to protect yourself as well.  For example:
	<ul>
	<li>Do not share your password with anyone else, and take measures to prevent it from unauthorized access or disclosure.</li>
		<li>To learn more about how to protect yourself online, visit the government website www.onguardonline.gov.</li>
	</ul></li>
	</ul>


	<p><strong>Links and Third Party Ads</strong></p>


	<ul>
	<li>We may post links to other web sites as a service to you.  These sites are operated by companies that are outside of our control, and your activities at those sites will be governed by the policies and practices of those third parties. We encourage you to review the privacy practices of these third parties before disclosing any personally identifiable information, as we are not responsible for the privacy practices of those sites.</li>
		<li>We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our site. These companies may use information (not including your name, address, email address or telephone number) about your visits to this and other web sites in order to provide advertisements on this site, other sites and other forms of media about goods and services that may be of interest to you. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies, <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/consumer/opt_out.asp" target="new" rel="nofollow"><strong>please click here</strong></a>.</li>
		<li>The advertising we display may be targeted to users of particular services and content. So if you view or click on a targeted ad, the advertiser (or other companies affiliated with the advertiser) may assume that you meet the targeting criteria — for example, men aged 30-40.</li>
	</ul>


	<p><strong>Changes to This Privacy Policy</strong></p>


	<ul>
	<li>This policy is effective as of April 4, 2007.  Helium may update this policy. We will notify you about significant changes in the way we treat personal information by sending a notice to the primary email address specified in your Helium account or by placing a prominent notice on our site.</li>
