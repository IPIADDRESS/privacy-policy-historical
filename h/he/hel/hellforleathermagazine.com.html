·  <strong>What do we do with the information we gather about you?</strong><br>

<p><strong>WHICH SITES ARE COVERED BY THIS POLICY?</strong><br>
This Privacy Policy applies to the following Hell for Leather Web sites:<br>
• Hell for Leather magazine (Free Content)<br>
Please note, our Web sites may contain links to other Web sites for your convenience and information. We are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of those sites. We encourage you to review the privacy policy of any company before submitting your personal information.</p>
<p><strong>WHAT INFORMATION DO WE GATHER ABOUT YOU?</strong><br>
The information we gather falls into two categories: 1) Personally identifiable information, which includes personal information you voluntarily supply when you order, complete a survey, register for an online discussion, enter a contest or provide your e-mail address and 2) Non-personally identifiable information, which includes tracking information collected as you navigate through our sites.</p>
<p><strong>Personally Identifiable Information</strong><br>
HellForLeathermagazine.com may require that you supply certain personally identifiable information, including a unique e-mail address and demographic information (zip code, age, sex, household income (optional), job industry and job title) in order to complete certain transactions like purchasing from our store or verifying user submitted content. By using hellforleathermagazine.com, you are agreeing to our Terms of Service.</p>
<p><strong>Subscription Registration for our Web sites via Third-Party Tools</strong><br>
To help facilitate Hellforleathermagazine.com subscriptions, we have partnered with PayPal to gather subscription information and fees. Subscription and registration through PayPal is governed by their privacy policy and terms of use which can be viewed on <a href="https://cms.paypal.com/us/cgi-bin/marketingweb?cmd=_render-content&amp;content_ID=ua/Legal_Hub_full&amp;locale.x=en_US">PayPal’s site</a>. Hell For Leather Magazine is not responsible for the privacy policy of PayPal and encourages you to read their privacy policy before supplying any personal information. Hell for Leather is not responsible for any actions PayPal relating to personal information you have supplied to PayPal. PayPal will be providing us with any subscriber information you have provided in connection with your subscription purchase. Information supplied to us will be governed by this privacy policy.</p>
<p><strong> Paid Products and Services</strong><br>
Some of our products are sold through third party vendors and are governed by their privacy policies. Hell For Leather is not responsible for the privacy policies of third party vendors and encourages you to read their policies before signing up. Additionally, by making a purchase of Hell For Leather products or Services through a third party vendor, you expressly grant permission through your action for Hell For Leather to share any personal information with that vendor.</p>
<p><strong> Contests, Sweepstakes and Special Offers</strong><br>
On occasion, Hell for Leather collects personal information from readers in connection with optional sweepstakes, contests or special offers. If this information is to be shared with a third party other than Hell For Leather, we will notify you at the time of collection. If you do not want any personal information shared, you may always decline to participate in the sweepstakes, contest or special offer.</p>
<p><strong> Surveys and Market Research</strong><br>
Hell For Leather may collect personal information from readers in connection with voluntary surveys. Data may be collected on our Web sites, on the phone or through the mail. The information you provide in answer to optional survey questions may be shared, but only in the aggregate, with advertisers and partners unless we notify you otherwise at the time of collection.<br>
All survey data is reported and/or used in aggregate form only, and no personally identifiable information is released. From time to time, we may use different technologies, including cookies, to better understand answers to our surveys. As a panel member, we require that you supply us with your e-mail address and name. Home address and telephone number are optional.</p>
<p><strong> Special Events and Promotions</strong><br>
We often receive information regarding readers who may attend Hell For Leather Special Events and Promotions. Such information will be used as indicated at the time of collection.</p>
<p><strong> Links</strong><br>
The Hell for Leather Site contains links to other sites. Please be aware that Hell for Leather is not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every Web site that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by Hell for Leather.</p>
<p><strong>Non-personally Identifiable Information</strong><br>
In addition to personally identifiable information, we also collect certain non-personally identifiable information through technology and tools, including cookies, Web Beacons and log data. We aggregate and analyze this information in order to learn more about how our Web sites are used.</p>
<p><strong> Cookies from Us</strong><br>
As is standard practice on many Web sites, we use “cookies” and other technologies to recognize you and provide personalization, as well as to help us understand, where our visitors are going and how much time they spend there. You will not be able to access certain areas of our Web sites, including HellForLeatherMagazine.com, if your computer does not accept cookies from us.</p>
<p><strong>Third Party Cookies</strong><br>
Some of our business partners may use cookies on our site (for example, advertisers). However, Hell for Leather has no access to or control over these cookies, once we have given permission for them to set cookies for advertising. This privacy statement covers the use of cookies by Hell for Leather only and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.</p>
<p><strong> Clear Gifs (Web Beacons)</strong><br>
HellForLeatherMagazine.com or its Business Partners may elect to use a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/action tags/pixel tags), alone or in conjunction with cookies, to better manage our site and the information gathered. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies. Clear gifs may alert HellForLeatherMagazine.com’s server about the online movements of Web users. The main difference between cookies and clear gifs is that clear gifs are invisible on the page and are much smaller, about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. Please keep in mind that we do not have access to any information collected by the clear gifs used by Hell for Leather’s Business Partners nor any additional related information.</p>
<p><strong> Analytics Technologies</strong><br>
We reserve the right to change the vendors who provide us with usage data.</p>
<p><strong>IP Addresses</strong><br>
Hell For Leather logs Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, or the location of your computer on the Internet, for systems administration and troubleshooting purposes. We use this information in an aggregate fashion to track access to our Web sites.</p>
<p><strong>Log Files</strong><br>
Like most standard Web site servers we use log files. This includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, and number of clicks to analyze trends, administer the site, track user’s movement in the aggregate, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses, etc. are not linked to personally identifiable information. We may use a tracking utility that uses log files to analyze user movement.</p>
<p><em>WHAT DO WE DO WITH THE INFORMATION WE GATHER ABOUT YOU?</em></p>
<p><strong>Statistical Analysis</strong><br>
Hell For Leather may perform statistical, demographic and marketing analyses of users, and their browsing and purchasing patterns, for product development purposes and to generally inform advertisers about the nature of our readers. We also use such information to allow advertising to be targeted, in aggregate, to the users for whom such advertising is most pertinent. HellForLeatherMagazine.com may share personal information with Hell For Leather Media or any other wholly owned subsidiary of Hell For Leather for analysis purposes, including analysis to improve customer relationships.</p>
<p><strong>Products and Services from Hell For Leather</strong><br>
From time to time, we may provide readers with information and offers about other products and services offered by Hell For Leather, including premium products and services. This information will only be shared internally.</p>
<p><strong>User Generated Content (Including Comments and Reviews)</strong><br>
We offer opportunities for you to engage in public activities on HellForLeatherMagazine.com, including submitting comments, recommendations, reader reviews and ratings in a number of areas. Any information you disclose in your submissions, along with your screen name or ID, or any image or photo, becomes public and may be used by Hell For Leather for online and offline promotional or commercial uses in any and all media. If you chose to engage in public activities on the site, you should be aware that any personally identifiable information you submit there can be read, collected, or used by other users of these areas, and could be used to send you unsolicited messages.
