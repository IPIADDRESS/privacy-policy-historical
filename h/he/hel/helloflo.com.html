				</p>
				<br>
				<h3>HOW MY INFORMATION IS SHARED</h3>
				<p>Personal Information about our users is an integral part of our business. We neither rent nor sell your Personal Information to anyone. We may share your Personal Information with third parties with your permission or as permitted in our TOS. </p>
				<p>We provide some of our services through affiliates, service providers, partners and other third parties. We, and our service partners, may use your personal information to operate our sites and to deliver their services. These affiliates and third party service providers are not permitted to use personal information for any purposes other than to complete the order, assist you in participating in the particular service and communicating with you. We will encourage our service partners to adopt and post privacy policies. However, the use of your personal information by our service partners is governed by the privacy policies of those service partners, and is not subject to our control.</p>
				<p>We may disclose information in the aggregate to third parties relating to user behavior in connection with actual or prospective business relationship with those third parties, such as advertisers and content distributors. For example, we may disclose the number of users that have been exposed to, or clicked on, advertising banners.</p>
				<p>In the future, may use third party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit the Service. These companies may use information about you and activity related to your use of the Service to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you.</p>
				<p>We employ other companies and people to perform tasks on our behalf, and need to share your information with them to provide services to you. Our agents do not have any right to use Personal Information we share with them beyond what is necessary to assist us, and they provide a comparable level of protection for your Personal Information.</p>
				<p><span style="text-decoration: underline">Law Enforcement and Protection.</span>  We may disclose your Personal Information to third parties in a good faith belief that such disclosure is reasonably necessary to (a) take action regarding suspected illegal activities; (b) enforce or apply our TOS and Privacy Policy; (c) comply with legal process, such as a search warrant, subpoena, statute, or court order; or (d) protect our rights, reputation, and property, or that of our users, affiliates, or the public. Please note that we are not required to question or contest the validity of any search warrant, subpoena or other similar governmental request that we receive.</p>
				<p><span style="text-decoration: underline">Invite Friends and Contacts. </span> You may choose to provide us with another person's e-mail address or social network profile information so that person may be invited to create an account on this site and become your friend.
