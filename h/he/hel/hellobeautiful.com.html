	<h1>Privacy</h1>
<p><strong><em>Last revised November 11, 2011</em></strong></p>
<p>This website, together with a network of related content and social networking websites (each, a “Site,” and collectively, the “Company Sites”), is owned and operated by or on behalf of Radio One, Inc. (“Radio One”), Interactive One, LLC, Community Connect Inc., and/or certain other Radio One subsidiaries and affiliated companies (collectively, “Company,” “we,” “our,” or “us”). This Privacy Policy describes the type of information we may collect from you and how we may use and share that information. This Privacy Policy also explains the choices you can make about the ways this information is used by us.</p>
<p>Please read this Privacy Policy carefully. In addition, please review the Terms of Use provided at each Site, which governs your use of the Company Sites. By accessing and using any of the Company Sites (including, without limitation, any social networking features, communities or other interactive content offered on the Sites), you agree to accept the terms of this Privacy Policy and the Terms of Use provided on the Site. If you do not agree with these terms, please do not use the Site. Please note that certain features or services discussed in this Privacy Policy may not be offered on the Company Sites at any particular time.</p>
<h2>APPLICABILITY AND USER RESTRICTIONS</h2>
<p>Unless specifically stated otherwise, this Privacy Policy applies to information collected on the Company Sites, which also may be governed by separate or additional policies and does not apply to information about you collected by our affiliated providers, third party web sites (e.g., ad serving and tracking services), applications or offerings linked to or otherwise accessible from the Company Sites. The information collected or received by such affiliated providers and third parties is subject to their own respective privacy policies, which we encourage you to review. We are not responsible for compliance with other websites’ privacy policies or practices.</p>
<p>The Company Sites are not directed to children under the age of thirteen (13). In compliance with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (”COPPA”), we use reasonable commercial efforts to adhere to the prohibition on the collection of personal information online from children under the age of thirteen (13) without first obtaining verifiable parental consent. At a minimum, the Company Sites prohibit registration by, and will not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from, anyone under the age of thirteen (13). Company Site use and membership is void where prohibited by law.<br>
<a name="about-our-ads"></a></p>
<h2>INFORMATION WE COLLECT AND HOW WE USE IT</h2>
<p><a name="about-our-ads"></a><br>
Whether you are a Company Site visitor or a registered member, we take certain steps to protect your information. Collection of information is usually grouped into two categories: Personal Information, which is information that is personally identifiable to a specific member (further defined below), and aggregate information, which is general demographic information that does not identify any individual member. We may use or disclose aggregate information for any purpose.</p>
<p>The Company adheres to the Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising (the “Principles”), developed by leading industry associations to apply consumer-friendly standards to online behavioral advertising across the Internet.&nbsp; To learn more about the Principles, please go to <a href="http://www.aboutads.info/">www.aboutads.info</a>.</p>
<h3>User Content</h3>
<p>Please note that whenever you publicly disclose information about yourself online (e.g., through email, social networking platforms, forums, message boards, chat areas, or similar web pages), such information may be collected, exported and used by people that you do not know. Posting personal information in public places may result in unsolicited communications, including unwanted email messages or other forms of contact. Always be smart about the information you provide online. We bear no responsibility for any action or policies of any third parties who collect any information you may disclose on the Company Sites.</p>
<h3>Personal Information</h3>
<p>As used in this Privacy Policy, “Personal Information” means personally identifiable information collected online about an individual, such as a first and last name, a physical street address, an e-mail address, a telephone number, a social security number, or any other information that permits the physical or online contacting of a specific individual.&nbsp; You can browse the Company Sites without telling us who you are or revealing any Personal Information about yourself. However, there are certain features and services (including social networking) that may not be available for your use without providing Personal Information. If you choose to provide us with Personal Information, you consent to the transfer and storage of that information on our servers.&nbsp; Further, you consent to e-mail or other marketing communications sent by us, unless you unsubscribe from such messages or opt-out, as described below.</p>
<h4>Registration</h4>
<p>Certain features and services of the Company Sites may require you to first complete a registration form and create a user name and password. During registration you are required to provide certain Personal Information. We may use this information to contact you about the services on our Site in which you have expressed interest. In addition to Personal Information collected for registration purposes, we may collect and store the following:</p>
<p>(a) your responses to the offerings and advertisements presented on the Sites;</p>
<p>(b) information about the Sites’ services or features that you use, and how frequently you use them;</p>
<p>(c) commercial transaction-related information (such as credit card or other preferred means of payment, billing or shipping information, or a history of products purchased through the Company Sites);</p>
<p>(d) your responses to or entries for surveys, sweepstakes, and contests and requests for services, products, newsletters or information;</p>
<p>(e) customer service information about you as a user of a Company Site, including any suggestions you submit to us for review;</p>
<p>(f) community discussions, chats, dispute resolution, correspondence through our Sites, and correspondence sent to us;</p>
<p>(g) your activity on the Company Sites, including adding a friend, sharing a photo or video, or accessing an application;</p>
<p>(h) your activity on certain third party sites or services for which you have consented to connect or share through your account on a Company Site;</p>
<p>(i) information from other companies, such as demographic and traffic data; and</p>
<p>(j) other information from your interaction with our Sites, services, content and advertising, including computer and/or mobile device connection and location information, browser type, statistics on page views, traffic to and from the sites, ad data, IP address and standard web log information.</p>
<h3>Profile and Preference Information</h3>
<p>So that you can make the most of our social networking features, your member name, profile photo and certain other profile information associated with your account with a Company Site or with any third party sites shared by you through a Company Site will not be private.&nbsp; Depending on your privacy settings, you can control other information shared on your member page.&nbsp; If you do not wish to share photos of yourself with other members, then delete them or do not post them.</p>
<p>We may combine information that you provide us with other information about you that we may obtain through your use of the Company Sites in order to provide promotions and marketing offers tailored to your preferences and to improve the content of the Company Sites for you.</p>
<h3>Cookies</h3>
<p>To enhance your experience with the Company Sites, we may use “cookies.” Cookies are small data files that we place in your computer’s browser when you visit the Company Sites. We may use cookies for a number of purposes, such as tracking usage patterns, measuring the effectiveness of advertising, to help serve advertisements, limiting multiple responses and registrations, facilitating your ability to navigate the Company Sites, and as part of a verification or screening process. Cookies automatically identify your web browser whenever you visit the Company Sites, help us determine which areas are popular and further personalize your experience on the Company Sites. If you do not wish to allow for use of cookies, you can generally opt-out of providing this information by setting your browser to reject cookies. However, please be aware that some areas of the Company Sites may not provide you with an acceptable user experience if you have disabled the use of cookies.&nbsp; Please refer to <a href="http://www.aboutads.info/">www.aboutads.info</a> for more information.</p>
<h3>Web Beacons and Similar Technologies</h3>
<p>The Company Sites and our e-mail messages may contain a small graphic image called a web beacon that monitors and collects certain limited information about the viewer of the web page or e-mail message. Web beacons typically are very small (generally 1-by-1 pixel) and invisible to the user, but, in general, any electronic image viewed as part of a web page or e-mail message, including an advertisement or HTML content, can act as a web beacon. We may use web beacons or similar technologies for a number of purposes, including without limitation, to count visitors to our web pages or to monitor how our users navigate the Company Sites, and we may include web beacons or similar technologies in e-mails in order to count how many e-mails (or particular articles, links, etc.) that we send are actually opened. Additionally, our advertising providers may use web beacons or similar technologies to personalize and measure the effectiveness of their advertisements using data gathered over time from users of the Company Sites.&nbsp; If you would like more information about the information collection practices of some of these third party advertising companies and to learn which of these companies allow you to opt out of this type of information collection, please click <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp">here</a>.</p>
<h3>IP Address and Log Files</h3>
<p>Upon visiting the Company Sites, we may collect and store your browser type and IP address to help diagnose problems with our server, to administer the Company Sites, to help identify and analyze user trends, to customize content and advertisements offered to you, and to gather broad demographic information for aggregate use.</p>
<h2>SHARING YOUR INFORMATION WITH THIRD PARTIES</h2>
<h3>Third Party Content</h3>
<p>When you are visiting the Company Sites, certain content may be served directly by third parties. This third party content may use cookies, web beacons, Javascript or other technologies. We do not have access to or control the use of such technology by third parties, including the information they collect or how they use such information.</p>
<h3>Applications and Websites</h3>
<h3>The Company does not own or operate certain applications or websites (e.g., games or tools) accessible through the Company Sites.&nbsp; As a result, when you use these third party applications or websites, we may share your information along with the location of your computer or mobile device to enable your use of such services and for age verification and security purposes, among other purposes.&nbsp; For example, the Company may offer you the option to connect your member profile and activity on the Company Sites with certain third party services such as Facebook, Foursquare or Twitter (“Third Party Services”).&nbsp; When you consent to publish your information or activity on the Company Sites to any Third Party Services, such information will be viewable by the communities on such Third Party Services and may be used by such Third Party Services in accordance with their posted privacy practices.&nbsp; Similarly, if another member in your friend list uses a third party application or website, it may receive your non-private member information so that you may be separately linked with your friend.&nbsp; If the application or website seeks any further information, your consent should be requested.&nbsp; We cannot guarantee that such applications or websites will follow our privacy practices, so we encourage you to always review their information sharing policies and to report any application or website that may be in violation of our privacy practices.</h3>
<h3>Online Shopping Services</h3>
<p>Company Sites may offer shopping services either directly or through a partner that operates a service under contract with us. If a Site offers shopping or other commercial services, the customer order form will ask you to provide certain Personal Information, including credit card or other payment data. The financial information that you provide will be used by the Company or its partners to bill you for products and services that you request and for any other uses to which you have consented. By giving the Site your payment data and related Personal Information, you are authorizing us to give that information to the merchant and credit card company and/or you are authorizing the Company’s partner directly to confirm and fulfill your order. In addition, the Company and/or its partners will use contact information from the order form to fulfill your orders and for customer service purposes. The Company will not otherwise use or distribute your financial information without your prior approval.</p>
<h3>Other Third Parties</h3>
<p>Our employees, agents and contractors must have a “need-to-know” business reason to obtain access to your Personal Information. We may share your Personal Information with those who help us manage or provide content or other services for the Company Sites (e.g., forum administration, order fulfillment, statistical analyses, data processing), or with outside contractors, agents or sponsors who help us with the administration, judging and prize fulfillment aspects of contests, promotions and sweepstakes. Such outside contractors, agents or sponsors may temporarily store some information on their servers, but they may only use your Personal Information to provide the Company Sites with a specific service and not for any other purpose. We may also provide your Personal Information to a third party where you have chosen to receive certain information and have been notified that the fulfillment of such a request requires sharing your Personal Information. We also may share your Personal Information with any affiliated companies and partners if we have a business reason to do so.</p>
<h3>Legal Compliance</h3>
<p>We may access or disclose your Personal Information without your consent in order to: (i) protect or defend our legal rights or property, including those of our affiliated companies or their employees, agents and contractors (including enforcement of our agreements); (ii) protect the safety and security of other users of the Company Sites or members of the public, including responding to claims that a listing or other content violates the rights of others, or protect anyone’s rights, property, or safety; (iii) protect against fraud or for risk management purposes; or (iv) comply with the law or legal process. In addition, if any Company Site is sold to or merges with another company not owned by or affiliated with Company, we may transfer your Personal Information to any acquiring or merging party as part of that transaction.</p>
<h2>YOUR PRIVACY CHOICES</h2>
<p>The following sub-headings apply only to those Company Sites for which user registration is available.</p>
<h3>Access to Personal Information</h3>
<p>You have the opportunity to correct, update or remove Personal Information you have provided to us at any time. Upon entering any Company Site, you may sign in using your previously issued login name and password. After signing in, click on “My Page” and you will have the option of either modifying or deleting your member profile settings through the “Edit Profile” or “My Account” links. If you have forgotten your login name or password, click the “Forgot your password?” link, and following verification, your login name and/or password will be sent to your email address.</p>
<h4>Activity Associated with Your Member Name</h4>
<p>Your member name is displayed to other members throughout the Company Sites and depending on your activity (e.g., blogging) on any Sites, may also be available to the public. All of your activity on our Sites is traceable to your member name. Therefore, if you associate your name with your member name, the people to whom you have revealed your name will be able to personally identify your Company Site activities.</p>
<h3>Opt-Out</h3>
<p>You may opt-out of receiving e-mail communications from us at any time by either following the instructions to unsubscribe within an email you receive from this Site or by logging in to your account and selecting “Email Alerts” under the “My Account” link. As explained above, if you choose not to provide us with information sought on registration or sign up forms, it is possible that you will not be able to access or use certain features of certain Company Sites.</p>
<h3>Your Member Profile</h3>
<p>When you register with certain Company Sites, you may set up your member profile, upload photos, provide additional information, search, add friends, send messages, perform searches and engage in other activities. Information transmitted during such activities is collected so that the Company may provide you with services and personalize certain features. Any content you post on the Company Sites is at your own risk. Certain privacy options exist on the Company Sites that allow you to limit access to your profile. However, such privacy options are not always available or perfect. We are not responsible for circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures contained on the Company Site. Furthermore, the Company cannot control the actions of third parties with whom you choose to share your profile or Personal Information. Because of the foregoing, the Company does not guarantee that any content or personal information you post on a Company Site will not be accessible by unauthorized persons. You understand and acknowledge that, even after removal, copies of your user content may remain viewable in cached and archived pages or if other users have copied or stored your user content.&nbsp; Any improper collection or misuse of information provided on any Company Site is a violation of the Site’s Terms of Use and should be reported to <a href="mailto:membersafetyteam@mail.blackplanet.com">membersafetyteam@mail.blackplanet.com</a>.</p>
<h3>Friend Referrals</h3>
<p>The Company Sites may allow you invite a friend to view or use certain features or services Company Sites, including online shopping services. To refer a friend, information including your friend’s email address is required. Such information is collected and stored to send this one-time invitation, to allow for your friend’s registration and to track the success of our referral program. Your friend may contact us at <a href="mailto:membersafetyteam@mail.blackplanet.com">membersafetyteam@mail.blackplanet.com</a> to request that we remove this information from our records.</p>
<h2>SECURITY OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION</h2>
<p>The Company employs reasonable security measures consistent with standard industry practice to secure information collected through the Company Sites. We also use internal protections to limit access to your Personal Information to only those people who need the information to perform a specific request. However, we cannot guarantee that your Personal Information will never be disclosed in a manner inconsistent with this Privacy Policy (e.g., as a result of unauthorized or otherwise unlawful third party access), and you transmit such information to us at your own risk.</p>
<h4>Account Protection</h4>
<p>Your member profile is password-protected so that you and only you have access to this information. Please use a unique combination of numbers, letters and special characters and do not disclose your Company Site password to anyone for greater protection. If you share your computer with other people, or use a publicly accessible computer, sign out of your account and close your browser window when you are done. If you do share your password or your Personal Information with others, remember that you are responsible for all actions taken under your member profile. If you lose control of your password, you may lose substantial control over your Personal Information and may be subject to legally binding actions taken on your behalf. If your password has been compromised for any reason, we encourage you to change it immediately or notify us to change your password on your behalf.</p>
<h4><strong>If Abuse Occurs</strong></h4>
<p>Although we make every effort to ensure that our e-mail list is safe, the Internet is such that we cannot guarantee that our list is invulnerable to attacks. If you believe there has been a breach of our security, please contact us at once at <a href="mailto:membersafetyteam@mail.blackplanet.com">membersafetyteam@mail.blackplanet.com</a>.</p>
<h2>CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY</h2>
<p>We reserve the right to change our Privacy Policy and our Terms of Use at any time. If we make changes, we will post them and will indicate at the top of this page the policy’s new effective date. We encourage you to refer to visit this Privacy Policy frequently to stay informed regarding our current privacy practices. Unless stated otherwise, our current Privacy Policy applies to all information that we have about you and your activity on our Company Sites.<br>
As the owner of this Site, the Company retains all ownership rights to the information collected at this Site. In the event the Company goes through a business transition, such as a merger, acquisition by another company, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, your Personal Information will likely be among the assets transferred.</p>
<h2>CONTACTING US</h2>
<p>If you have any additional questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy, please feel free to contact us any time by email at <a href="mailto:membersafetyteam@mail.blackplanet.com">membersafetyteam@mail.blackplanet.com</a> or at Privacy Request, c/o Interactive One LLC, 850 Third Avenue, Third Floor, New York, NY 10022, USA.</p>

The self-titled &quot;visual album&quot; sold over 1 million copies in the first five full days after its release (despite Target and Amazon refusing to stock it, on account of it having been released as an iTunes exclusive at first). On Saturday afternoon, Beyoncé screened the corresponding videos at New York's School of Visual Arts and appeared in person to answer some previously submitted fan questions about the project.  Among the topics addressed as fans ate popcorn from &quot;Beyoncé&quot; bags and drank sodas and huckleberry juice: motherhood, why Beyoncé shared more personal details of her life on this record than ever before and how she kept the entire effort under wraps until it hit iTunes. She also explained the birth of &quot;Yoncé,&quot; a nickname that's a motif throughout the album (a Justin Timberlake and The-Dream track on the LP is entitled &quot;Yoncé, and the singer wears a necklace with the word on it in multiple videos):  &quot;We were in the studio, and Justin Timberlake started beating on buckets. So, when you hear the beat, it's literally a bucket. It was really organic, and it reminded me of being in middle school during the lunch breaks, when you just start freestyling. So we kept the buckets, and we went back and forth. I was very adamant about keeping it organic, because that whole element is what is so beautiful about it. And Dream just started, 'Yoncé on his mouth like liquor,' and I'm like, 'What does that mean?' But I love it, I think Beyoncé is Beyoncé, Mrs. Carter is Beyoncé, Sasha Fierce is Beyoncé. And I'm finally at a place where I don't have to separate the two. It's all pieces of me, and just different elements of a personality of a woman, because we are complicated.&quot;    Beyoncé also took fans into what it was like to finally let the project hit iTunes (the album landed in the digital retailer at midnight Thursday on the East Coast). &quot;I just got off the stage, I had a glass of wine and my cousin Angie was like, 'Are you alright?' because I was talking to myself and I was terrified,&quot; Beyoncé shared. &quot;I was so scared. I had already gone through all the horrible ways it could go in my mind... I saw it live on iTunes and I waited for the first comment. Then I woke up the next morning and... [breaks into dance].&quot;  &quot;We went through everything to keep it sacred and a surprise,&quot; the singer said. &quot;Because there's joy in that and it's missing, and that's something I was able to experience as a kid.&quot;   Beyoncé also spoke freely about being a mother, telling the crowd that &quot;it's amazing how motherhood changes you.&quot; Framing the project as an exercise in opening up, the singer revealed that she &quot;took all the things about myself that I wanted to change and put it in my music.&quot;   &quot;More than the music, I'm proud of myself as a woman,&quot; she added. &quot;It's about loving your imperfections and the things that make you interesting, because I refuse to let anyone put me in a box.&quot;  When discussing why &quot;Beyoncé&quot; is more personal than previous albums (Beyoncé's husband Jay Z and daughter Blue Ivy appear in videos and the album's lyrics tend toward a more specific vision of her lifestyle over general pronouncements of emotions), the singer appeared to choke back tears. &quot;I have always been very generous, I have been generous on stage and take my pain and joy into my performance,&quot; she said. &quot;But I'm private... I think it just took me not being anyone's child. Once I had a child, I broke down that fourth wall. I feel liberated, and I feel like I can give my heart to people.&quot;    &quot;My father taught me so, so much,&quot; she said of Matthew Knowles, who managed Beyoncé until 2011. &quot;When I decided to manage myself, it was important to me not to sign to some big company. I wanted to follow in Madonna's footsteps and be a powerhouse. When you get to this level, you don't have to share your money or your success... And we did it. And it's my company.&quot;  &quot;This is my first album that -- of course I wanted people to love it and critics to love it and for it to be successful -- but my goal was not picking a No. 1 single,&quot; Beyoncé continued. &quot;My goal was putting together a body of work, and I just wanted to know that people cared about music. Honestly, I was at a point where everything feels the same. What I said in 'Ghost,' 'All the shit I do is boring,' is true. And if I could not challenge that, then maybe it was time for me to do something else or develop more artists, which is something that I could do, but just growth. I just hope that I continue to move forward and challenge myself. I think that now that I've become a mother, I just want my legacy to inspire people. That's the biggest goal, just having happiness and knowing that when people come to my shows, they can leave all the madness and leave there knowing that there is hope.&quot;">Beyoncé Explains The Birth Of 'Yoncé' And Breaking 'The Fourth Wall'</a></li><li><a class="rsswidget" href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/12/21/kanye-west-anti-semitic_n_4486583.html?utm_hp_ref=black-voices&amp;ir=Black+Voices" title="Back in November, Kanye West made the statement &quot;Black people don't have the same level of connections as Jewish people,&quot; during a radio interview, drawing a number of anti-semitic accusations.

Like Target's decision to opt out of stocking &quot;Beyonce,&quot; the online retailer is following suit in the wake of the album's iTunes exclusive week-long sale. However, physical copies can be found on Amazon via third-party sellers.  Bilboard also noted how Amazon has not provided &quot;Beyonce&quot; with any prime real estate, meaning that the album is only visible when searched. Considering the album's record-shattering numbers, it would be expected that retailers would promote heavily.   The question that immediately comes to mind is, &quot;Do people still buy CDs?&quot; Despite an MP3 driven world, physical copies do have their appeal. In 2012, physical sales may have continued to decline, but they still trumped the rising digital sales.   With Beyonce's success, can we expect to see more exclusive deals with Apple? If so, how deeply will this injure physical retailers? Or is this just an anomaly resulting from Beyonce's supreme clout? Let us know what you think in the comments.">Amazon Will Not Stock Beyonce's New Album</a></li><li><a class="rsswidget" href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/12/21/darlene-love-christmas-baby-letterman_n_4485773.html?utm_hp_ref=black-voices&amp;ir=Black+Voices" title="Darlene Love has performed &quot;Christmas (Baby Please Come Home)&quot; for David Letterman since 1986.   &quot;Darlene is a good friend and a fantastic singer who is a deserved member of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame,&quot; Letterman said recently through a representative. &quot;She's one of my favorite things about the holiday season. It isn't Christmas without Darlene Love.&quot;  It's not, but now it is: Love hit the &quot;Late Show With David Letterman&quot; stage this week to sing her Christmas classic, complete with a chorus of singers, Paul Shaffer and some fake snow.  [youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJwPM8UWwGk&amp;w=570&amp;h=315]  This past summer, Love told HuffPost Entertainment how she wound up becoming a fixture of Letterman's world:  We ended up doing the show &quot;Leader of the Pack&quot; at the Bottom Line. Paul Shaffer played Phil Spector in that play. So, David Letterman came down to see the show, and one night on his show, Dave said to Paul, &quot;That Christmas song the girl does in the play you're in is the greatest Christmas song I've ever heard. We need to get her on our show.&quot; It was just one coincidence after another! I started doing the first Christmas show in 1986; this year will be the 27th year I've done that show. I was just on his show a couple of months ago doing &quot;Lean On Me.&quot; Every now and then they let me sneak in another song. &quot;Christmas (Baby Please Come Home),&quot; however, is the song. And that's how all of that came about.  Watch Love perform for Letterman through the years in the mashup below.

The self-titled &quot;visual album&quot; sold over 1 million copies in the first five full days after its release (despite Target and Amazon refusing to stock it, on account of it having been released as an iTunes exclusive at first). On Saturday afternoon, Beyoncé screened the corresponding videos at New York's School of Visual Arts and appeared in person to answer some previously submitted fan questions about the project.  Among the topics addressed as fans ate popcorn from &quot;Beyoncé&quot; bags and drank sodas and huckleberry juice: motherhood, why Beyoncé shared more personal details of her life on this record than ever before and how she kept the entire effort under wraps until it hit iTunes. She also explained the birth of &quot;Yoncé,&quot; a nickname that's a motif throughout the album (a Justin Timberlake and The-Dream track on the LP is entitled &quot;Yoncé, and the singer wears a necklace with the word on it in multiple videos):  &quot;We were in the studio, and Justin Timberlake started beating on buckets. So, when you hear the beat, it's literally a bucket. It was really organic, and it reminded me of being in middle school during the lunch breaks, when you just start freestyling. So we kept the buckets, and we went back and forth. I was very adamant about keeping it organic, because that whole element is what is so beautiful about it.

It's all pieces of me, and just different elements of a personality of a woman, because we are complicated.&quot;    Beyoncé also took fans into what it was like to finally let the project hit iTunes (the album landed in the digital retailer at midnight Thursday on the East Coast). &quot;I just got off the stage, I had a glass of wine and my cousin Angie was like, 'Are you alright?' because I was talking to myself and I was terrified,&quot; Beyoncé shared. &quot;I was so scared. I had already gone through all the horrible ways it could go in my mind... I saw it live on iTunes and I waited for the first comment. Then I woke up the next morning and...

Honestly, I was at a point where everything feels the same. What I said in 'Ghost,' 'All the shit I do is boring,' is true. And if I could not challenge that, then maybe it was time for me to do something else or develop more artists, which is something that I could do, but just growth. I just hope that I continue to move forward and challenge myself. I think that now that I've become a mother, I just want my legacy to inspire people.

How else to describe the feeling we had after watching West and Kim Kardashian simulate the conception of their daughter North West with the video &quot;Bound 2&quot;? Or hearing about another profane Alec Baldwin meltdown? Or watching Lady Gaga and R. Kelly grinding up against each other on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;? Miley twerking with little people? Or digesting the news that Simon Cowell will be someone's father? It was bewildering, off-putting, jarring — yet entertaining at the same time. As bad as celebrity antics were this year, they remained our guilty pleasure. We'll never admit it, but these are the moments that had us riveted in 2013.  ISN'T THE COVER OF US WEEKLY ENOUGH?  Kanye West had many righteous things to rage about this year, from the fashion industry not giving him credit for brilliant, life-changing designs like leather jogging pants, to not getting respect from President Obama. But nothing seemed to upset him more than Vogue's apparent refusal to put his baby mama, Kim Kardashian, on the magazine cover. He likened her to this generation's Marilyn Monroe, called her the most beautiful woman on the planet, and scoffed that two-time Vogue cover girl Michelle Obama couldn't Instagram a selfie photo of her nearly bare backside like Kim and cause the stir that Kardashian did. We see a rant about an IRS audit coming in 2015.  AT LEAST HE GOT OUT OF THE KARDASHIAN CHRISTMAS CARD  Khloe Kardashian called it quits with troubled basketball star Lamar Odom after four years of marriage and months of endless tabloid headlines juicier than anything we'd seen in their reality show. The last straw for Kardashian allegedly came after video surfaced of a shirtless Odom and a male friend rapping semi-incoherently about smoking weed and scoring with lots of women. It doomed their marriage, but is a pretty good pilot for another Odom TV show.  CAN WE STOP NOW .  PLEASE?  This year felt like Miley Cyrus plowed into our consciousness with a concrete wrecking ball — oh wait, that really did happen. From her twerk-a-thon at awards shows to her nearly nude poses to that now- infamous tongue, we saw too many different sides (not to mention the backside) of the former teen queen. Please tell us that it was all a dream — and that Billy Ray is going to pop out and explain to Hannah Montana what can happen when you eat brownies but you don't know who baked them.  WE STOPPED BIEBLIEVING A WHILE AGO  What happened to our favorite teen moppet? Over the past year, Justin Bieber went on a world tour of mayhem, from speeding in the streets of Los Angeles, to suggestions of smoking weed to spraying illegal graffiti in Colombia to stepping on the Argentinian flag (he said he meant no offense). We expected more from a young Canadian lad. Let's hope Toronto mayor Rob Ford hasn't become his new role model.  A RECIPE FOR TROUBLE  Paula Deen let fly a career-ender when, during a deposition in a racial discrimination case, she admitted to using the N-word and described the vision she had of using all-black waiters to serve in a mock plantation  scenario. Deen fell on her butter knife during a tearful, defiant interview with Matt Lauer on the &quot;Today&quot; show, but her empire crumbled, with everyone from Walmart to the Food Network dropping her like a hot cinnamon roll.  WE'RE CRINGING ON PURPOSE  Brad Paisley and LL Cool J's &quot;Accidental Racist,&quot;  designed to be an ode to racial understanding, united people of all colors: We recoiled together after hearing lines like  &quot;If you don't judge my do-rag/I won't judge your red flag&quot; and perhaps the topper, &quot;If you don't judge my gold chains/I'll forget the iron chains.&quot; Paisley said he'd only wanted to try and have an honest conversation about race relations.  PAYING TRIBUTE, AL JOLSON STYLE  Julianne Hough's decision to don blackface for Halloween to portray her favorite character from the Netflix show &quot;Orange is the New Black&quot; sparked an uproar, and drew an eventual apology from the actress, who said she never intended to hurt anyone.  TALK ABOUT WATCHING YOUR MOUTH  Michael Douglas caused a stir — and in some circles, perhaps a panic — when, in an interview, he was quoted suggesting that he got his throat cancer from oral sex (though he later backtracked). We're hoping it's just a coincidence that he and Catherine Zeta-Jones announced a trial separation a few months later.  BEST PERFORMANCE ON FILM  Goes to Reese Witherspoon. Unfortunately for her, it was on a police video cam, not a movie screen. Witherspoon made headlines when she was arrested for drunkenly interfering in an officer's attempt to arrest her husband on a DUI charge. In the video, Witherspoon immediately went into character development, telling the officer she was pregnant (an admitted lie). She also trotted out that well-worn line of fading stars: &quot;Do you know my name?&quot; Given the box-office performance of her last few films, she should have expected that he wouldn't.  ___  Follow Nekesa Mumbi Moody at http://www.twitter.com/nekesamumbi">The 9 Best Guilty Pleasure Moments Of 2013</a></li><li><a class="rsswidget" href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/12/21/august-osage-county-review_n_4486649.html?utm_hp_ref=entertainment&amp;ir=Entertainment" title="Planning some extended family dinners over the holidays? Worried that folks might not get along, that festering tensions might surface, that people might get tipsy and say too much?  Well, here's an idea: First, go see &quot;August: Osage County,&quot; the blistering film adaptation of the Pulitzer-winning Tracy Letts play starring Meryl Streep and Julia Roberts. Because once you've witnessed the rollicking, vicious family dinner that's the dramatic centerpiece of this movie, you'll know you're safe. No family meal of your own will ever seem truly unpleasant after you've witnessed this scene. Festering tensions? Try brutal wounds, caused by the bitterest of insults lobbed across the table with those mashed potatoes. The kind of insults that only those closest to you — we're talking family — could ever dream up.  It is, of course, delicious that the most biting of these insults come from the mouth of the one and only Streep, who holds absolutely nothing back in a performance that could be called showy — except that's it's so compelling, and also deeply faithful to the script. Violet Weston, the 65-year-old matriarch of an Oklahoma clan, is simply one of the most spectacularly damaged characters in memory. And as written by the hugely talented Letts, who has both playwriting and acting Tonys to go with his Pulitzer, she's someone you'll want to meet — if only once.  Not that &quot;August: Osage County,&quot; directed by John Wells, works best as a movie, even with a screenplay by Letts himself. Those who saw the 2007 Broadway production will likely recall a nearly perfect theatrical experience, one that left you drained but grateful after three hours.  It feels less naturally suited to film, though if you haven't seen the play, you might not notice. And a brief final scene feels tacked on for cinematic purposes. But these are not fatal flaws.  Virtually all the action takes place in one home, in the heart of the Oklahoma plains, stifling in the August heat. It belongs to Violet and her husband, Beverly, a 69-year-old poet and raging alcoholic. &quot;My wife takes pills and I drink,&quot; he says. &quot;That's the bargain we've struck.&quot;  And, boy, does Violet take pills. It's a shock to see the regal Streep looking this way: wrinkled and pale, with a craggy fuzz of gray hair peeking out of a dark wig, a result of chemotherapy for mouth cancer. She has stains on her baggy sweater and can't keep her balance. She still smokes, and tufts of that smoke linger in the stifling air, because she doesn't believe in air conditioning. Plastic shades are taped shut, blocking out natural light.  Extended family is summoned home when emergency strikes: Beverly's disappearance. All are forced to sit together, talk together, eat together, and of course face some serious family truths. The nature of those truths won't be revealed here, except for the truth that it would be hard to assemble a more accomplished cast.  Margo Martindale, especially, is absolutely pitch-perfect as Violet's sister Mattie Fae, at once boisterous, flighty, warm, and witheringly insensitive to her awkward adult son, Charlie (Benedict Cumberbatch.) Or, as Mom calls him, Little Charlie, which should tell you a lot.  Also wonderful is Chris Cooper as Mattie Fae's long-suffering husband, and Julianne Nicholson as the lonely and misunderstood Ivy, one of Violet's daughters. The top-flight cast also includes Sam Shepard, Juliette Lewis, Ewan McGregor, Abigail Breslin and Dermot Mulroney. (And it's co-produced by George Clooney, no less.)  Much depends, though, on the dynamic between Violet and daughter Barbara (Roberts), who's in the throes of a disintegrating marriage. This is one of the meatiest roles Roberts has had in a good long time, and she handles it with an admirable lack of vanity. Gone is that high-wattage Roberts smile. Barbara is weary, bitter, and, at times, shrewish.  Watch her in that dinner scene, trying to dodge her mother's verbal missiles, until she no longer can. Come to think of it, though, watch absolutely everyone in that scene.  And then plan your own family dinner, secure in the knowledge that it could never, ever be as bad.  ___  &quot;August: Osage County,&quot; a Weinstein Company release, is rated R by the Motion Picture Association of America for &quot;language including sexual references, and for drug material.&quot; Running time: 121 minutes.

Considering the album's record-shattering numbers, it would be expected that retailers would promote heavily.   The question that immediately comes to mind is, &quot;Do people still buy CDs?&quot; Despite an MP3 driven world, physical copies do have their appeal. In 2012, physical sales may have continued to decline, but they still trumped the rising digital sales.   With Beyonce's success, can we expect to see more exclusive deals with Apple? If so, how deeply will this injure physical retailers? Or is this just an anomaly resulting from Beyonce's supreme clout? Let us know what you think in the comments.">Amazon Will Not Stock Beyonce's New Album</a></li></ul></li><li id="ione-rss-7" class="widgetcontainer widget_ione-rss"><h5 class="widgettitle"><a class="rsswidget" href="http://www.aol.com/" title="Pipes Output">AOL</a></h5><ul><li><a class="rsswidget" href="http://on.aol.com/video/best-tips-for-shucking-an-oyster-518059863" title="Shucking an oyster can be tough, but here are some tips for making it an easier process than you might have thought.">Best Tips For Shucking An Oyster</a></li><li><a class="rsswidget" href="http://on.aol.com/video/report--nearly-all-supermarket-chicken-tested-positive-for-gut-bacteria-518059861" title="A recently-released consumer report indicates that nearly 97% of all chicken breasts in nationwide supermarkets tested positive for gut bacteria.">Report: Nearly All Supermarket Chicken Tested Positive For Gut Bacteria</a></li><li><a class="rsswidget" href="http://on.aol.com/video/top-holiday-photo-beauty-tips-518059847" title="Here are the best beauty tips for taking photos this holiday season.">Top Holiday Photo Beauty Tips</a></li><li><a class="rsswidget" href="http://on.aol.com/video/terry-mcmillan-on-immigration--marco-rubio-is-an-uncle-tom-517938767" title="Terry McMillan joins HuffPost Live to share her thoughts on immigration, and Marco Rubio.">Terry McMillan On Immigration: 'Marco Rubio Is An Uncle Tom'</a></li></ul></li><li id="ione-rss-8" class="widgetcontainer widget_ione-rss"><h5 class="widgettitle"><a class="rsswidget" href="http://www.essence.com" title="Essence Magazine, Black Hairstyles, Black Women, Celebrity Photos, Entertainment News, Celebrity Gossip">Essence</a></h5><ul><li><a class="rsswidget" href="http://www.essence.com/2013/12/21/photo-fab-see-diddys-holiday-card-kids" title=" With Christmas just around the corner, Diddy is feeling the spirit, and the entertainment mogul took to Instagram to share his 2013 family holiday card with fans.For the photo, Diddy poses with his six children in style on a luxurious winding staircase.
