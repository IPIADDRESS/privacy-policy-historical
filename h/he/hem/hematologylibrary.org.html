<p><em>Last Updated: May 14, 2008</em>
</p><p> The  American Society of Hematology is committed to safeguarding the privacy of our  Web site users. This Privacy Policy  discloses the privacy practices for <em>hematology.org</em> and its affiliated sites (the "Site"), which is provided to you by the American Society of Hematology ("we" or "us" or "ASH").  This Privacy Policy governs our collection of information from you  through your use of the Site. 
</p><p>Please  read this Privacy Policy carefully. By  viewing, browsing, accessing, or otherwise using this Site, you agree that such  access and/or use, and any dispute regarding our online privacy practices, is  governed by this Privacy Policy and our <a href="terms.cfm">Terms of Service</a>. </p>
<p>We  reserve the right to modify this Privacy Policy in the future as we deem  necessary. If we do modify this Privacy  Policy, we will post the updated Privacy Policy on this Site and change the  "Last Updated" date above to reflect the date of the changes. By  continuing to use the Site after we post any such changes, you accept the  Privacy Policy as modified.</p>
<h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
<p>This  children's privacy statement explains our Site's practices with respect to the  online collection and use of personal information from children under the age  of thirteen, and provides important information on your rights under federal  law with respect to such information. </p>
<p>This  is a general audience Web site and we do not knowingly collect personally  identifiable information from children under the age of thirteen. If we become aware that we have inadvertently  received personally-identifiable information from a user under the age of  thirteen, we will delete such information from our records. </p>
<h2>Information Collection and Use</h2>
<p><strong>Information Voluntarily Supplied to  ASH by Our Members</strong><br>
  We  maintain data (including contact information, subspecialty, and ASH committee  participation) on all of our members that can be accessed through a secure <a href="https://store.hematology.org/Default.aspx?tabid=64&amp;redirecttabid=137" target="_blank">online member directory</a>. This directory may be accessed only by other  current ASH members through a password-protected, members-only area of the  Site. This directory is not made  available to the general public. Members  who wish to opt out of being included in the directory may do so by accessing  their<strong> </strong><a href="https://store.hematology.org/Default.aspx?tabid=64&amp;redirecttabid=137" target="_blank">member profile</a> online. 
</p><p>We  also offer a voluntary, publicly accessible online directory of members through <a href="http://www.findahematologist.org/" target="_blank">Find a Hematologist</a>. The Find a Hematologist directory allows  patients and other members of the public to search for hematologists and  provides users with contact information for members who have chosen to be  listed. Participation in the directory  is optional. ASH members must opt in to  be included and may opt out at any time by accessing their <a href="https://store.hematology.org/Default.aspx?tabid=64&amp;redirecttabid=137" target="_blank">member profile</a><strong> </strong>online.</p>
<p>We  do not share member e-mail addresses, phone numbers, or fax numbers with  non-members or other organizations, except that we may share member information  with third-party service providers, contractors, partners, and fulfillment  agencies to use only for purposes of providing a service relating to the Site. </p>
<p>We  do, however, make our membership mailing list available to outside groups for  educational purposes, including mailings about grant opportunities that could  be beneficial to members, educational publications (e.g., medical textbooks,  scientific journals), and educational programs or courses. ASH members who do not wish to have their  mailing addresses shared with outside parties in this manner may opt out by  contacting ASH Member Services at 202-776-0544 or <em><a href="mailto:membership@hematology.org">membership@hematology.org</a></em>. </p>
<p>Your  member data also may be governed by the terms and conditions of your  membership. In the event of a conflict  between this Privacy Policy and any term(s) of your membership, the terms of  your membership will govern.</p>
<p><strong>Information Voluntarily  Supplied by Web Site Users<br>
</strong>Both  ASH members and non-member users of this Site may be asked to enter personally  identifiable information (such as name, phone number, mailing address, e-mail  address) in order to perform certain functions on the Site, including ordering  products, registering for meetings, submitting abstracts, and requesting  additional information. By using the  Site, you agree that we may provide any or all of such information to third  parties, such as service providers, contractors, partners, and fulfillment  agencies, in order to complete your transaction (e.g., to confirm an order,  send materials, resolve billing issues).</p>
<p>You  also agree that we may use any information submitted by or collected from you  via the Site for any other purpose, including to contact you for customer  service purposes, to inform you of important changes or additions to our Site  or the services offered through our Site, and to send you administrative  notices, offers, promotional correspondence, and any other communications that  we believe may be of interest to you. </p>
<p><strong>Information That Is  Automatically Collected<br>
</strong>We  also may collect and store information that is generated automatically through  a Web site analytics program as you navigate through our Site. For example, to help make the Site more  responsive to the needs of users, we may employ, on our Site, or on certain  pages of our Site, a standard feature of browser software, called a  "cookie," to assign each user a unique, random number that resides on  a user's computer. The cookie doesn't actually identify  you, it just identifies the computer that you use to access the Site. The only personal information a cookie can  contain is information you supply (e.g., if you submit a username and password  and ask that the Site remember that information the next time you visit). A cookie cannot read unrelated data off your  hard drive. We use cookies to help us  tailor the Site to your needs, to deliver a better, more useful service. For example, we may use cookies to track the  pages on the Site visited by users, the number of site visitors, and search  queries. We can make the Site more  effective if we know which areas our users are visiting, how often, and the  information that is most important to our users. Of course, you are  free to set your Web browser not to accept cookies or delete the cookies that  have been placed; however, doing so may render your computer unable to take  advantage of the personalized features enjoyed by other users of the Site. </p>
<h2>Other Uses</h2>
<p>In addition to the uses described above, we may  occasionally release information about visitors when release is appropriate to  comply with law, to enforce our<strong> </strong><a href="terms.cfm">Terms of Service</a>, or to  protect the rights, property or safety of visitors to our Site, the public, or  to us or our Site. </p>
<h2>Credit Card Information</h2>
<p>Users  may be prompted to enter their credit card information, including, for example,  when making purchases, renewing membership, or making a gift online. Any credit card information you may provide  to us is secured during transmission over the Internet using industry-standard  secure socket layer (SSL) encryption. We use your credit card information only  to bill you for the products and services you order from us. We do not share  your credit card information with anyone, except as may be necessary to process  your transactions or comply with law.  Users may click on the Verisign logo included on each payment page to  view our Verisign certificate and to access information about the security  status of our site. </p>
<h2>Third-Party Sites</h2>
<p>Our  Site includes links to third-party Web sites whose privacy policies we do not  control. Once you leave our Site, any information  you provide at another site will be governed by the privacy policy of the  operator of the site you are visiting, which may differ from ours. If you can't find the  privacy policy of a third-party site via a link on the site homepage, you  should contact the third-party provider directly for more information. </p>
    
<h2>Storage of Information </h2>
<p>Information we gather on our Site is stored  within controlled databases (hosted by us or by a third party on our behalf). As effective as the reasonable security measures  implemented by us and our service providers may be, no security system is  impenetrable. We cannot guarantee the  security of any of our or our service providers' systems or databases nor can  we guarantee that information supplied will not be intercepted while being  transmitted over the Internet. </p>
<h2>Questions?</h2>
<p>Questions  regarding privacy issues should be directed to the <a href="mailto:webmaster@hematology.org">ASH Webmaster</a>.</p>
