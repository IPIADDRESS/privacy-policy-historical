<h1>Heyo Privacy Policy</h1>
<p class="light">Last Modified December 12, 2012</p>
<p>Your privacy is important to us. To better protect your privacy we
	provide this notice explaining our online information practices and the
	choices you can make about the way your information is collected and
	used.</p>
<p>Please note that participation in the Heyo Sites is primarily a
	public activity and much of the information you post to any Heyo Sites
	(whether directly through our site or via links with other social
	networking websites) is instantly publicly viewable. Therefore, you
	should not submit information that you consider confidential. We
	maintain the privacy of your email address and password submitted to us
	in the registration process (unless you enter such information as your
	username or in the text of your entries to user areas), but other
	information you provide should be considered nonconfidential and
	available for viewing by others.</p>
<p>Also, please note that information provided through facebook or other
	social networks, or for publication on fan pages, mobile apps or
	websites may be subject to different privacy policies which may vary
	materially from these terms applying to our web sites..</p>

<h2>The Information We Collect</h2>

<p>Any information gathered by us is used to customize the experience
	for you the user, and is not shared or sold to any third parties,
	except as expressly provided for in this Privacy Policy and our Terms
	of Service. However, we may in the future provide customized or
	targeted advertisements to you based upon your data (including usage
	statistics and characteristics), in which case we may allow third party
	applications to access such data for the purpose of customizing
	messages or advertising for you.</p>

<h2>Our Commitment to Data Security</h2>

<p>To prevent unauthorized access and maintain data accuracy, we use
	industry standard methods to safeguard and secure the information we
	collect online, although you recognize that data transmitted online or
	stored in a facility to which online access is provided cannot be made
	to be 100% secure. We believe in protecting your information just as we
	would want our information protected.</p>
<p>In the event that personal information is compromised as a result of
	a breach of security, we will promptly notify those persons whose
	personal information has been compromised as may be required by
	applicable law.</p>
<p>Please note that information you enter for your user profile or in
	your posts may be accessed and viewed publicly and therefore you should
	not post information that you consider confidential or that you do not
	want distributed publicly. Although in some areas you will have the
	ability to edit or delete information, please note that even this
	information may have been cached on servers, cut and pasted or
	otherwise incorporated into other posts or for other uses, and so once
	information is posted you should consider that it may be publicly
	available perpetually, and in different locations and/or media than
	your original submission.</p>

<h2>Notifications</h2>

<p>It is our policy to provide notifications, whether such notifications
	are required by law or are for marketing or other business related
	purposes, to our users via email notice, written or hard copy notice,
	or through conspicuous posting of such notice on a Heyo Site, as
	determined by us in our sole discretion. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
	we reserve the right to determine the form and means of providing
	notifications to our users.</p>

<h2>Child Protection</h2>

<p>We do not offer services to, or target, persons under the age of 13.
	In compliance with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act, we
	will purge any information we receive from people we believe to be
	children under 13 from our database and cancel the corresponding
	accounts.</p>

<h2>How You Can Access or Correct Your Information</h2>

<p>You can access your personally identifiable information that we
	collect online and maintain by logging in and "Editing" your account.
	Your password is needed to edit this information, even if you are
	already logged in. We use this procedure to better safeguard your
	information. You may not be able to edit or delete past entries and
	information collected regarding past updates.</p>

<p>To protect your privacy and security, we will also take reasonable
	steps to verify your identity before granting access or making
	corrections. The main form of identity management is your email
	address. Please always use a valid and up-to-date email address.</p>

<h2>Use of User Information</h2>

<p>Information you provide to us about yourself, or that we collect and
	infer based upon your entries and posts to a Heyo Site may be used to
	improve your user experience, provide or suggest targeted services and
	to allow third party advertises and messaging to be tailored or
	targeted. We may use or provide to third parties aggregated data
	entered by users or inferred from usage. We may collect IP addresses
	and cookies for the primary purpose of assisting with ease of use by
	you. However, except as legally required, we will not sell or provide
	your email address, IP address, cookies, address or phone number to
	third parties for advertising or other purposes. In the future we may
	provide third parties with the ability to provide customizable or
	targeted advertising or messages and in such cases we may allow third
	party applications to access your user data in determining the
	messaging or advertising applicable to you.</p>

	Should you have other questions or concerns about these privacy
	policies, please send us email at <a href="mailto:support@Heyo.com">support@Heyo.com</a>.
