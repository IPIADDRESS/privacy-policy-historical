           <p>MediaFriends, Inc. ("the Company") respects your personal privacy and is committed to adhering to U.S. Federal and state privacy laws and industry guidelines in order to protect you and your identity. This privacy policy ("Privacy Policy") describes how we handle the personal information that you provide to us through the Company's website, software and/or services (collectively, the "Services"). Please be sure to read this entire Privacy Policy before using, submitting, or uploading information and material to the Services.</p>

<p>If you are unwilling to accept the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy, we ask that you do not use the Services. By using the Services, you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy. When you submit information via the Services, you consent to the collection, use and disclosure of that information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</p>

<p>After reading this Privacy Policy, which is incorporated into and is a part of the Company's <a href="../terms/index.html">Terms of Use</a>, you will know:</p>

<ol>
	<li><a href="#1">What information the Company collects from you;</a></li>
	<li><a href="#2">How the Company uses and may disclose information obtained through the website;</a></li>

	<li><a href="#3">What about information you post;</a></li>

	<li><a href="#4">What about third party services you access through the Services;</a></li>
	<li><a href="#5">What choices you have about how the Company treats your information;</a></li>

	<li><a href="#8">How you can contact the Company.</a></li>

</ol>

<p>This Privacy Policy applies only to the Company's websites and Services and not to any third-party products, sites or services that may be accessed through the Services. The Company reserves the right to occasionally update this Privacy Policy. At such time, the Company will also revise the "last updated" date at the end of the Privacy Policy. For material changes to this Policy, the Company will notify you by placing prominent notice on the website applicable to the Services.

<h2>1. INFORMATION THE COMPANY COLLECTS FROM YOU</h2>

<p><b>Active Information Collection</b><br>

Like many other service providers and website operators, we actively collect information from our visitors both by asking specific questions through the Services and by permitting you to communicate directly with us via e-mail. If you choose to register with the Services, during the registration process you will be asked for both personal and demographic information, most of which is required in order to complete the registration. Some of the information that you submit during the registration process or while making a purchase may be personally identifiable (that is, information that can be uniquely identified with you, such as your name, address, mobile phone number, e-mail address, Facebook user identification, etc.). Also, if you purchase products or services, you may be required to provide financial information, including your credit card number. When you use the Services, we will not collect any personally identifiable information about you unless you provide it to us voluntarily.</p>

<p>We have the right, but not the obligation, to store any messages that pass through our Services as well as other chat session information, including the number of chats, length of chats, number of participants, chat device used, advertisements clicked on and other usage and demographic data.</p>

<p>For purposes such as improving personalization of our services, we may receive information about you from other sources. Like the information you provide to us, we do not share this information with anyone except authorized third parties in connection with providing you with our Services.</p>


<p><b>Passive Information Collection</b><br>
As you use the Services, certain information can be passively collected (that is, gathered without you actively providing the information) using various technologies and means, such as navigational data collection. For example, when using the Services through the Internet, we track IP addresses, use both session and persistent cookies, and assign Internet tags. Our system may also automatically gather information about the areas you visit through the Services and collects operational information about the technology you use, such as your browser, type of computer or mobile device, geographic location, operating systems, system and application software, peripherals, Internet service providers and the domain name of the website from which you linked to the Services.</p>

<p>In addition, when you use the Services, we may store some information on your computer. This information will be in the form of a cookie or similar file and will help us in many ways. For example, cookies allow us to tailor the Services or advertisements to better match your interests and preferences. Most Internet browsers enable you to erase cookies from your computer hard drive, block all cookies or receive a warning before a cookie is stored. Please refer to your browser instructions or help screen to learn more about these functions. The Company does not collect personally identifiable information automatically, but we may tie information collected automatically to your previously submitted personally identifiable information.</p>

<p>The Company's website pages may contain electronic images known as web beacons—also referred to as single-pixel gifs—that permit the Company to count users who have visited those pages and for other related website statistics—(e.g., recording the popularity of certain website content and verifying system and server integrity). Web beacons are not used to access your personal information on the Company's websites; they are solely used to compile aggregated statistics concerning the use of the Company's websites. Web beacons collect only a limited set of information including a cookie number, the time and date of a page view, and a description of the page on which the web beacon resides.</p>

<p>We passively collect information to understand what areas of the Services are most popular, which areas may require improvement and what technologies are being used by our visitors. This information helps us to update and improve the Services. We also use this information for security purposes, to detect and to block security breaches and to provide you with a safe online environment.</p>

<h2>2. HOW THE COMPANY USES AND MAY DISCLOSE INFORMATION OBTAINED THROUGH THE SERVICES</h2>

<p>Except as otherwise stated, we may use information collected via the Services to improve the Services, to customize the Services to your preferences, to communicate information to you, for our marketing and research purposes and for any other purpose specified. We may also use the information we gather to tailor the services and advertisements to your personal interests and/or demographics (e.g., behavioral, interest-based or geographic targeted advertising). In addition, we may make full use of all information acquired through the Services that is not in personally identifiable form.</p>

<p>Your contact information (e.g., e-mail addresses, mobile numbers), financial information (e.g., credit card number) and third party account information (e.g., Facebook UID and password) will be used for the purposes for which you supplied it to us (e.g., registering with and delivering the Services), to send you related notices or promotional materials and to respond to your comments or requests for information. If you direct comments to us or you request information from us, we may ask you to verify where you are doing business so that we can be assured that the response or information we provide is appropriate for that geographic location. We may also enhance or merge personally identifiable information with data obtained from third parties for the same purposes.</p>

<p>If you provide personally identifiable information to the Services, we may combine such information with other actively collected information unless we specify otherwise at the point of collection.</p>

<p>We may disclose personally identifiable information you provide via the Services to third parties, but only:</p>

<ol>

	<li>to carefully selected third parties who have made offers that may be of interest to you, provided you have consented to such offers, in which case we will require such third-parties to agree to treat it in accordance with this Privacy Policy;</li>

	<li>to contractors we use to support our business (such as technical support and financial institutions), in which case we will require such third parties to agree to treat it in accordance with this Privacy Policy and use it for the same purposes;</li>
	<li>in the event of a sale, merger, liquidation, dissolution, reorganization, assignment or other transfer of the Company or the business of the Services to which the information relates, in which case we will require any such buyer to agree to treat it in accordance with this Privacy Policy and use it for the same purposes;</li>
	<li>to respond to law enforcement requests or where required by applicable laws, court orders, or government regulations;</li>
	<li>in situations involving threats to the physical safety of any person; or</li>
	<li>as described below in Section 4.</li>

</ol>

<p>The Company does not otherwise distribute to third parties your personally identifiable information. The Company, however, will have no liability for disclosure of information obtained due to errors in transmission or the unauthorized intervention of third parties.</p>

<p>The Company may provide aggregate statistics about our customers, sales, online traffic patterns and related information to reputable third parties, but these statistics will not include any personally identifying information.</p>

<p>Some of our advertisers may display ads on the Services that solicit, or contain technology to collect, information about our users. This information is collected and used by our advertisers, and is outside of our control. If you have any questions about a banner advertisement, you should contact the responsible advertiser directly.</p>

<p style="float:right; margin-top:15px;">[ <a href="#top" style="text-decoration:none;">Δ top</a> ]</p>

<h2>3. WHAT ABOUT INFORMATION YOU POST</h2>

<p>When you post a message or other content through the Services, information about you, including user profile information may be visible to other users. If you post personal information online that is accessible to the public, that information becomes publicly available and can be collected and used by others and redistributed through the Internet and other media channels. You may receive unsolicited messages from other parties in return. We recommend caution when giving out personal information to others in these public online forums.</p>

<p style="float:right; margin-top:15px;">[ <a href="#top" style="text-decoration:none;">Δ top</a> ]</p>
<h2>4. WHAT ABOUT THIRD PARTY SERVICES YOU ACCESS THROUGH THE SERVICES</h2>

<p>There may be links on the Services provided to other sites and/or resources over which the Company has no control. These links are provided solely as a convenience to users and should not be construed as an affiliation with or endorsement by the Company. You access and use such other sites, including the content, items or services on those sites, solely at your own risk.</p>

<p>In addition, the Services necessarily interact with and allow you to post information to third party services (e.g. Facebook, Twitter, SMS/MMS through mobile phone services). These third parties may collect personal information from you when you enter their sites, use their services or transmit information and data through them.</p>

<p>This Policy does not apply to the practices of third parties that the Company does not own or control. To ensure protection of your privacy, always review the privacy policies of these companies. The Company makes no representations or warranties with respect to the content, ownership or legality of any such linked sites or services.</p>

<p style="float:right; margin-top:15px;">[ <a href="#top" style="text-decoration:none;">Δ top</a> ]</p>

<h2>5. CHOICES YOU HAVE ABOUT HOW THE COMPANY USES YOUR INFORMATION</h2>

<p>We strive to provide you with choices regarding the personal information you provide to us. We have created mechanisms to provide you with the following control over your information:</p>
<ol type="a">
	<li>You may view and modify the personal information you have provided to us by logging in to the Services and clicking on "Options."</li>
	
	<li>You may also send us an e-mail message at <a href="mailto:privacy@mediafriendsinc.com">privacy@mediafriendsinc.com</a>, to request access to, correct or delete any personal information that you have provided to us. Should you elect to have your information deleted, we will also delete your user account. However, copies of your information may remain in back up storage for some time after your deletion. We may also retain certain information to protect against identity theft or misconduct.</li>

	<li>If you do not wish us to collect cookies, you may set your browser to refuse cookies, or to alert you when cookies are being sent. If you do so, please note that some parts of the Services may then be inaccessible or not function properly.</li>

</ol>

<h2>6. HOW THE COMPANY PROTECTS YOUR INFORMATION</h2>

<p>We work hard to protect your personal information. We use both technical and procedural methods to maintain the integrity and security of our databases, including the use of firewalls, SSL encryption for data transfer, restricted access to data and employee training. But you should keep in mind that no Internet transmission is ever completely secure or error-free.</p>

<p>The safety and security of your information also depends on you. If you have access to password-protected features, never share your password with anyone else, notify us promptly if you believe your password security has been breached, and remember to log off of this site before you leave your computer.</p>

<h2>7. WHAT THE COMPANY DOES ABOUT CHILDREN USING THE SERVICES</h2>

<p>The Services are not intended for children under the age of 13. We will not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from visitors under the age of 13. We encourage parents to talk to their children about their use of the Internet and the information they disclose online. If a child has provided us with personally identifiable information, a parent or guardian of that child may contact us via e-mail at privacy@mediafriendsinc.com if they would like this information deleted from our records. We will use reasonable efforts to delete the child's information from our databases.</p>
