			By using the Heyzap Platform, you expressly consent to the information handling practices described in this notice. This Privacy Policy is incorporated into and is subject to the Heyzap Platform Terms of Use. Your use of the Heyzap Platform and any personal information you provide through the Heyzap Platform are subject at all times to this Privacy Policy and the Terms of Use.<br>

			<br>
			1. The Information Heyzap Collects:
			Information You Provide: You may provide to Heyzap what is generally called "personally identifiable" information (such as your name, age, zip code, email address, credit card number, postal mailing address, and telephone numbers) if you use certain services or products from the Heyzap Platform, enter contests or sweepstakes, or otherwise use the features and functionality of the Heyzap Platform.<br><br>
			"Automatically Collected" Information: When you access the Heyzap Platform (including through your computer or your mobile device) or open one of our HTML emails, we may automatically record certain information from your system by using different types of tracking technology. This "automatically collected" information may include Internet Protocol address ("IP Address"), a unique user ID, version of software installed, system type, your listening preferences, the content and pages that you access on the Heyzap Platform, and the dates and times that you visit the Heyzap Platform.<br><br>
			"Cookies" Information: When you access the Heyzap Platform, we may send one or more cookies - small text files containing a string of alphanumeric characters - to your computer. Heyzap may use both session cookies and persistent cookies. A session cookie disappears after you close your browser. A persistent cookie remains after you close your browser and may be used by your browser on subsequent visits to the Heyzap Platform. Persistent cookies can be removed. Please review your web browser "Help" file to learn the proper way to modify your cookie settings.<br><br>
			Your User ID. Your User ID is displayed throughout the Heyzap Platform and is therefore available to the public. Other people can see your feedback, ratings and associated comments, etc. Therefore, if you associate your actual name with your User ID, the people to whom you have revealed your name will be able to personally identify your activities on the Heyzap Platform.<br>
			<br>
			<h3>2. The Way Heyzap Uses Information:</h3>
			Heyzap uses the information that you provide or that we collect to operate, maintain, enhance, and provide all of the features and services found on the Heyzap Platform as well as to track user-generated content and Users to the extent necessary to comply as a service provider with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act and other applicable laws.<br><br>
			We may use your email address or other provided contact (e.g. mobile number), without further consent, for administrative communications such as notifying you of major Heyzap Platform updates, for customer service purposes, to address copyright infringement or defamation issues, or to contact you regarding any content that you have posted and to send privacy or security related notices.<br><br>
			Heyzap uses all of the information that we collect to understand the usage trends and preferences of our Users, to improve the way the Heyzap Platform works and looks, to create new features and functionality.<br><br>
			Heyzap may use "Automatically Collected" information and "Cookies" information to: (a) automatically update the Heyzap application on your system; (b) remember your information so that you will not have to re-enter it during your visit or the next time you access the Heyzap Platform; (c) provide customized third-party advertisements, content and information; (d) monitor and report on the effectiveness of third-party marketing campaigns; (e) monitor and report aggregate usage metrics such as total number of visitors and pages accessed; and (f) provide such metrics to Users as they pertain to such Userâ€˜s uploaded content; and (g) track your entries, submissions, and status in any promotions or other activities.<br>
			<br>
			<h3>3. When Heyzap Discloses Information:</h3>
			Heyzap does not share your personally identifiable information with other organizations for their marketing or promotional uses without your prior express consent. Please be aware, however, that any personally identifiable information that you voluntarily choose to display on any publicly available portion of the Heyzap Platform - such as when you publish contact information to complete your profile information - becomes publicly available and may be collected and used by others without restriction.<br><br>
			Heyzap may disclose Automatically Collected and other aggregate non-personally-identifiable information (such as IP addresses, anonymous User usage data, listening preferences, referring / exit pages and URLs, platform types, number of clicks, etc.) with interested third parties to assist those parties in understanding the usage and demographic patterns for certain content, services, advertisements, promotions, or other functionality on the Heyzap Platform.<br><br>
			We may disclose some limited User information to affiliated companies or other businesses or persons to: provide web site hosting, maintenance, and security services; fulfill orders; conduct data analysis and create reports; offer certain functionality; and assist Heyzap in improving the Heyzap Platform and creating new services features. We contractually require that these parties process such information in compliance with this Privacy Policy, we authorize only a limited use of such information, and we require these parties to use reasonable confidentiality measures.<br><br>
			Heyzap may disclose User information if required to do so by law or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with state and federal laws (such as U.S. copyright or trademark law) or respond to a court order, judicial or other government subpoena, or warrant in the manner required by the requesting entity.<br><br>
			Heyzap also reserves the right to disclose User information that we believe, in good faith, is appropriate or necessary to take precautions against liability; enforce our Terms of Use; protect Heyzap from fraudulent, abusive, or unlawful uses; to investigate and defend ourselves against third-party claims or allegations; to assist government enforcement agencies; to protect the security or integrity of the Heyzap Platform; or to protect the rights, property, or personal safety of Heyzap, our Users, or others.<br>
			<br>
			<h3>4. Your Choices and Access to your Personal Information</h3>
			You may, of course, decline to share your personally-identifiable information with Heyzap, in which case Heyzap will not be able to provide to you some of the features and functionality found on the Heyzap Platform. You may view, update, correct, or delete your user information and preferences by contacting us at privacy@heyzap.com<br><br>
			To protect your privacy and security, we take reasonable steps to verify your identity before granting you account access or making corrections to your information. YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR MAINTAINING THE SECRECY OF YOUR UNIQUE PASSWORD AND ACCOUNT INFORMATION AT ALL TIMES.<br><br>
			<br>
			<h3>5. Advertisers</h3>
			Heyzap allows other companies, called third-party ad servers or ad networks, to serve advertisements within the Heyzap Platform. These third-party ad servers or ad networks may use technology to send, directly to your browser, the advertisements that appear within the Heyzap Platform and they automatically receive your IP Address and other automatically collected information when this happens. Such third-party ad servers may also use other technologies (such as cookies, javascript, or web beacons) to measure the effectiveness of their advertisements and to personalize their advertising content.<br><br>
			Heyzap does not provide your personally identifiable information to these third-party ad servers or ad networks without your consent. However, please note that if an advertiser asks Heyzap to show an advertisement to a certain audience or audience segment and you respond to that advertisement, the advertiser or ad-server may conclude that you fit the description of the audience that they were trying to reach.<br><br>
			You should consult the respective privacy policies of these third-party ad servers or ad networks. This Privacy Policy does not apply to, and we cannot control the activities of, such other advertisers or web sites. Heyzap reserves the right the add or remove third-party ad networks or ad servers in its discretion and Heyzap may not at all times list such updated ad network or ad server partners in this Privacy Policy.<br>
			<br>
			<h3>6.     Our Commitment to Data Security:</h3>
			Heyzap uses commercially reasonable physical, managerial, and technical safeguards to preserve the integrity and security of your personal information.  We cannot, however, ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to Heyzap, and you do so at your own risk.  Once we receive your transmission of information, Heyzap makes commercially reasonable efforts to ensure the security of our systems.  However, please note that this is not a guarantee that such information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards.<br><br>
			If Heyzap learns of a security systems breach, then we may attempt to notify you electronically so that you can take appropriate protective steps. Heyzap may post a notice on the Heyzap Platform if a security breach occurs.  Depending on where you live, you may have a legal right to receive notice of a security breach in writing.  To receive a free written notice of a security breach you should notify us at privacy@Heyzap.com.<br>
			<br>
			<h3>7.     Our Commitment to Childrenâ€˜s Privacy:</h3>
			If you are under 13 years of age, then please do not use or access THE HEYZAP PLATFORM at any time or in any manner.<br><br>
			Protecting the privacy of young children is especially important.  For that reason, Heyzap does not knowingly collect or maintain personally identifiable information from persons under 13 years-of-age.  If Heyzap learns that personally-identifiable information of persons less than 13-years-of-age has been collected on or through the Heyzap Platform, then Heyzap will take the appropriate steps to delete this information.<br><br>
			If you are the parent or legal guardian of a child under 13 who has become Heyzap Platform member, then please contact Heyzap at privacy@Heyzap.com to have that childâ€˜s account terminated and information deleted.<br><br><br>
			The following are some resources that may help parents and legal guardians in monitoring and limiting your childrensâ€˜ access to certain types of material on the Internet.  While Heyzap does not endorse these products, we provide information about them as a public service to our community.<br><br>
			<ul>
				<li>"OnGuard Online," maintained by the Federal Trade Commission.</li>

				<li>The Child Safety Network</li>

			</ul>
			<br><br>
			<h3>8. International Visitors:</h3>
			For Users visiting the Heyzap Platform from the European Union or other non-U.S. territories, please note that any data you enter into the Heyzap Platform will be transferred outside the European Union or such other non-U.S. territory for use by Heyzap and its affiliates for any of the purposes described herein. In addition, because Heyzap operates globally, we may make information we gather available to worldwide business units and affiliates. By providing any data on the Heyzap Platform, you hereby expressly consent to such transfers of your data to the United States or other countries.<br>
			<br>
			<h3>9. In the Event of Merger or Sale:</h3>
			In the event that Heyzap is acquired by or merged with a third-party entity, we reserve the right, in any of these circumstances, to transfer or assign the information that we have collected from Users as part of that merger, acquisition, sale, or other change of control.<br>
			<br>
			<h3>10. Third Parties</h3>
			Except as otherwise expressly provided otherwise, this document addresses only the use and disclosure of information we collect from you or that you disclose to us. If you disclose your information to others besides Heyzap, whether they are users of the Heyzap Platform or on other sites or services, different rules may apply to their use or disclosure of the information you disclose to them. Heyzap does not control the privacy policies of third parties, and you are subject to the privacy policies of those third parties where applicable. We encourage you to ask questions before you disclose your personal information to others.<br>
			<br>
			<h3>11. Changes and Updates to this Privacy Policy:</h3>
			This Privacy Policy may be revised periodically without further notice to you and this will be reflected by a "last modified" date below. Please revisit this page to stay aware of any changes. In general, we only use your personal information in the manner described in the Privacy Policy in effect when we received that personal information. Your continued use of the Heyzap Platform constitutes your agreement to this Privacy Policy and any future revisions.<br><br>
			For revisions to this Privacy Policy that may be materially less restrictive on our use or disclosure of personal information you have provided to us, we will make reasonable efforts to notify you and obtain your consent before implementing revisions with respect to such information.<br>
			<br>
