                        the purpose of sending you important information about 
                        your accounts and relevant information on other “Publications”

                        legitimate interest in providing you important safety or

                        information from any of our “Publications”, We will then 
                        process your email address accordingly, allowing us to

                        provide in your account. The legal ground for processing 
                        this data for this purpose is of our “Publications” 
                        legitimate interest in reducing the number of marketing 
                        emails sent to each particular customer by selecting which 
                        customers receive a particular marketing email rather than 
                        sending every marketing email to every customer who has 
                        consented to receiving marketing emails.

                    <p>
                        We also process your email address to associate it with 
                        your “Publication” specific account when you interact 
                        with our customer support representatives. The legal 
                        ground for this processing is our legitimate interest 
                        in providing quality customer support.

                        Credentials if you choose them:

                    <p>
                        You may choose to sign in to your account using your

                        sign-in credentials). If you choose to do this, the 
                        first time you do so you will be asked whether you agree 
                        that the social media provider may provide certain 
                        information to us, such as your name, email address, 
                        profile photo, posts, comments and other information 
                        associated with your social media account.

                    <p>
                        All this information is made available to us by the 
                        social media provider due to the way the social sign-in 
                        configuration works. However, the only information that 
                        we retain and process is your email address. If you do 
                        not want your information to be shared within our group 
                        of “Publications” by the social media provider, then you 
                        can simply sign in to your account using your account 
                        credentials instead of your social media account credentials.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Our “Publications” associate the email address provided 
                        by the social media provider with your account so that 
                        you can use your email address (and/or Username) to 
                        sign in to your account in the future if you no longer 
                        wish to sign in using your social media account credentials. 
                        The legal ground for processing this information for this 
                        purpose is our legitimate interest in providing you an 
                        alternative sign-in method and in securing your account.

                        sign-in credentials). If you choose to do this, the 
                        first time you do so you will be asked whether you agree 
                        that the social media provider may provide certain 
                        information to us, such as your name, email address,

                        All this information is made available to us by the 
                        social media provider due to the way the social sign-in 
                        configuration works. However, the only information that 
                        we retain and process is your email address. If you do 
                        not want your information to be shared within our group 
                        of “Publications” by the social media provider, then you 
                        can simply sign in to your account using your account 
                        credentials instead of your social media account credentials.

                    <p>
                        Our “Publications” associate the email address provided 
                        by the social media provider with your account so that 
                        you can use your email address (and/or Username) to 
                        sign in to your account in the future if you no longer 
                        wish to sign in using your social media account credentials. 
                        The legal ground for processing this information for this 
                        purpose is our legitimate interest in providing you an 
                        alternative sign-in method and in securing your account.

                        To help analyse how you and other visitors navigate our 
                        “Publications”, and compile aggregate statistics about

                        If you do not want information collected through the 
                        use of these technologies, there is a simple procedure 
                        in most browsers that allows you to automatically decline 
                        many of these technologies, or to be given the choice 
                        of declining or accepting them.
