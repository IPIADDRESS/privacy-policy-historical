<h5 class="p4">3.2 HeiaHeia</h5>
<p class="p4"><b>HeiaHeia Privacy Principles:</b></p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li4">HeiaHeia (including HeiaHeia for Workplaces, HeiaHeia Pro Tools, Parempi vire, MarsMars) is a social wellbeing service, it is built around peer support.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; </span>We collect and process personal data in order to guide and visualise your habit creation journey, as well as social support from your friends and colleagues.</li>

<li class="li4">Location data (GPS&nbsp;data) created by you with HeiaHeia mobile applications or other compatible methods may be stored to create and annotate training log entries, and is treated with the same privacy principles as all training log data. Maps and “check-ins” created from&nbsp;GPS&nbsp;data have more privacy options than other training log data types, enabling stricter privacy.&nbsp;GPS&nbsp;data created on HeiaHeia mobile apps that is not used to create training log entries is not stored permanently by HeiaHeia.</li>
<li class="li4">Data created by members of the HeiaHeia for Workplaces service may be used for creating aggregate workplace statistics as well as “top lists” of most active members. Workplace admins do not have access to member data on the level of an individual entry, or detailed profile information, unless allowed by the member in HeiaHeia’s settings. Workplace admins will always know the names and email addresses of workplace community members, who are in most cases invited by the admin.
