    <div class="content"><p>If you have questions or concerns regarding this Policy, contact us by any means listed on our contact page.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Privacy Policy<br>
	Our Privacy Policy was developed as an extension of our commitment to combine the highest-quality products and services with the highest level of integrity in dealing with our clients and partners. The Policy is designed to assist you in understanding how we collect, use and safeguard the personal information you provide to us and to assist you in making informed decisions when using our site and our products and services. This statement will be continuously assessed against new technologies, business practices and our customers' needs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What Information Do We Collect?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When you visit our Web site you may provide us with two types of information: personal information you knowingly choose to disclose that is collected on an individual basis and Web site use information collected on an aggregate basis as you and others browse our Web site.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Personal Information You Choose to Provide</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you choose to purchase products or services from us or our partners, you may need to give personal information and authorization to obtain information from various credit services. For example, you may need to provide the following information:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Name<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mailing address<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Email address<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Credit card number<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Home and business phone number<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Other personal information (i.e. mothers maiden name)<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Email Information</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition to providing the foregoing information to our partners, if you choose to correspond further with us through email, we may retain the content of your email messages together with your email address and our responses. We provide the same protections for these electronic communications that we employ in the maintenance of information received by mail and telephone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Web Site Use Information</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Similar to other commercial Web sites, our Web site utilizes a standard technology called "cookies" and Web server logs to collect information about how our Web site is used. Information gathered through cookies and Web server logs may include the date and time of visits, the pages viewed, time spent at our Web site, and the Web sites visited just before and just after our Web site. This information is collected on an aggregate basis. None of this information is associated with you as an individual.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cookies</p>
<p>What Are Cookies? Cookies are a feature of Web browser software that allows Web servers to recognize the computer used to access a Web site. Cookies are small pieces of data that are stored by a user’s Web browser on the user’s hard drive. Cookies can remember what information a user accesses on one Web page to simplify subsequent interactions with that Web site by the same user or to use the information to streamline the user’s transactions on related Web pages. This makes it easier for a user to move from Web page to Web page and to complete commercial transactions over the Internet. Cookies should make your online experience easier and more personalized. Certain parts of our sites e.g. the forum send a "cookie" to your computer. A cookie is a piece of data that identifies you as a unique user. These are used to remember your forum login or preferences, beyond enhancing the use of our sites we do not use the information for any personal data gathering exercise.<br>
	Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies. You can reset your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. Be aware, however, that some parts of our sites may not function properly if you refuse cookies.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How Do We Use Information We Collect from Cookies? We use Web site browser software tools such as cookies and Web server logs to gather information about our Web site users’ browsing activities, in order to constantly improve our Web site and better serve our customers. This information assists us to design and arrange our Web pages in the most user-friendly manner and to continually improve our Web site to better meet the needs of our customers and prospective customers.
