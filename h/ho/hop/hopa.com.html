								We collect two types of data and information from our users. 	
								<br><br>								
								The first type of information is un-identified and non-identifiable information pertaining to 
								a user(s), which may be made available or gathered via your use of the Services (“<b>Non-personal Information</b>”). 
								We are not aware of the identity of the user from which the Non-personal Information was collected. 
								Non-personal Information which is being collected may include your aggregated usage information and 
								technical information transmitted by your device, including certain software and hardware information 
								(e.g. the type of browser and operating system your device uses, language preference, access time and 
								the domain name of the website from which you linked to the Services; etc.), in order to enhance the 
								functionality of our Services.
								<br><br>
								The second type of information is individually identifiable information, namely information that identifies an 
								individual or may with reasonable effort identify an individual (“<b>Personal Information</b>”). When you use our Services 
								either via an In-House Brand or a White Label Brand, you will be asked to provide Personal Information to us. 
								The Personal information we collect through our Services includes information which is submitted directly by 
								the user, such as:  phone number; full name; e-mail address; home address; date of birth; payment means 
								(e.g. credit card number); and other financial information that we may need in order to provide our Services.
								<br><br>
								
								We may also collect Personal Information from your device (e.g. geolocation data, 
								IP address) and information on your activity on the Services (e.g. pages viewed, online browsing, 
								clicks, actions, etc.).
								<br><br>
								
								If we combine Personal Information with Non-personal Information, the combined information will be 
								treated as Personal 
								Information for as long as it remains combined.
								<br><br></ul></li>
							<li><a class="TextUnderLine" name="Section2"><b>How we collect information  </b>
							</a>
								<br><br>
								There are three main methods we may use to collect information: 
								<br><br>
								
								a.	We collect information through your use of the Services. In other words, when you are using our 
								Services, we are aware of it and may gather the information relating to such usage, either independently 
								or through the help of third-party services as detailed below. 
								<br><br>
								b.	We collect information which you provide us voluntarily. For example, we collect Personal Information 
								which you provide when you: (i) respond to communications from us; (ii) open an account and use the Services ; 
								and (iii) communicate with us via the chat widget or via email.
								<br><br>
								c.	We collect information through our white label partners and our trusted third-party services, 
								such as information about your credit history agencies and other financial information which 
								is relevant to our Services, as well as information which is gathered in order to verify your 
								identity and prevent fraudulent or illegal activity. 
								
							</li>
							<br><br><li><a class="TextUnderLine" name="Section3"><b>Cookies</b> </a>
								<br><br>
								We and our trusted partners (e.g. white label partners) use cookies and other technologies 
								in our related services, including when you visit our site or access our Services. 
								<br><br>
								A "cookie" is a small piece of information that a website assign to your device while you are viewing a 
								website. Cookies are very helpful and can be used for various different purposes. 
								These purposes include allowing you to navigate between pages efficiently, enable 
								automatic activation of certain features, remembering your preferences and making the 
								interaction between you and our Services quicker and easier. Cookies are also used to 
								help ensure that the advertisements you see are relevant to you and your interests and to 
								compile statistical data on your use of our Services. 
								<br><br>
								Our website uses four types of cookies: (i) 'session cookies' which are stored only temporarily 
								during a browsing session in order to allow normal use of the system and are deleted from your 
								device when the browser is closed; (ii) 'persistent cookies' which are read only by our website, 
								saved on your computer for a fixed period and are not deleted when the browser is closed. 
								Such cookies are used where we need to know who you are for repeat visits, for example to allow 
								us to store your preferences for the next sign-in; (iii) 'third party cookies' which are set by 
								other websites who run content on the page you are viewing, for example by third party analytics 
								companies who monitor and analyze our web access; and (iv) 'flash cookies' which are saved during 
								game play to allow quicker and better gaming experience.
								<br><br>
								You may remove the cookies by following the instructions of your device preferences; however, 
								if you choose to disable cookies, some features of our Service may not operate properly and your 
								online experience may be limited.
								
								</li>
								<br><br><li><a class="TextUnderLine" name="Section4"><b>How we use the information we collect</b> </a>
								<br><br>
								
								We use and share Personal Information in the manners described in this Privacy Policy. The Personal 
								Information will be disclosed to a third party only to the extent required for the specific purpose, 
								as stipulated in this Privacy Policy, and in such case we require the relevant third party to agree 
								to process such information in compliance with our Privacy Policy.
								
								<br><br>
								In addition to the purposes listed above, the information we collect, which may include your Personal 
								Information, is used for the following purposes:
								
								<br><br><ul><li>
								To set up your account and to provide our Services (e.g. send out cash-out checks, process your payments; etc.)

								To communicate with you and to keep you informed of our latest updates;

								</li><li>
								To perform a research or to conduct anonymous analytics in order to improve and customize our 
								Services to your needs and interests;
								</li><li>
								To support and troubleshoot our Services and to respond to your queries; and
								</li><li>
								To investigate violations and enforce our policies, and as required by law, regulation or other 
								governmental authority, or to comply with a subpoena or similar legal process or respond to a 
								government request.
								</li></ul><a class="ThemeColorContentLink" name="Section5"><b>With whom we share the information we collect (“Recipients”)</b></a> 
								<br><br>
								We do not rent, sell, or share your Personal Information with third parties except as described in this Privacy Policy.
								<br><br>
