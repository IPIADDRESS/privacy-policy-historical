  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <div class="indent">
    <p>Hopster, Inc. operates promotions through agreements with manufacturers. When you create your Hopster.com account ("Account") and utilize Hopster promotions, only Hopster, Inc.  will have access to the personal information – such as your name, mailing address, and e-mail address ("Personal Information") – that you provide.</p>
    <p>The privacy of your Personal Information is very important to us. The full Hopster.com Privacy Policy is reproduced below.</p>
  </div>

  <h2>A Special Note About Electronic Communications</h2>
  <div class="indent">
    <p>Hopster, Inc. may from time-to-time contact you via email to let you know about special coupons and promotions, updates on new features, and other similar information. You can remove yourself from these e-mail communications by clicking on the "unsubscribe" link contained in any marketing e-mail that you receive. Your Hopster.com account profile also has an e-mail setting from which you can change your e-mail delivery preferences at any time.</p>
    <p>Please note that removal from Hopster  promotional e-mail list(s) does not include e-mail communication connected directly to the service.</p>
  </div>

  <h2>Hopster.com Privacy Policy</h2>
  <div class="indent">
    <p>This Privacy Policy forms part of the Hopster.com Account Agreement and is incorporated by reference therein. Your privacy is very important to us. This Policy describes the information we collect about you and how we use this information. By using the Hopster.com service and website, you agree that you have read and understand this Privacy Policy and you consent to the collection and use of information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</p>

    <h3>Information Hopster Collects</h3>
    <p>Our primary goal in collecting information from you is to provide you with a positive experience while you use Hopster.com, to allow you to set up an Account, interact with brands and utilize promotions from Hopster.com and the manufacturer website promotions that we operate, and to provide you with access to product offers, promotions, coupons and other offers through the Hopster service. Hopster may collect both personally identifiable information ("Personal Information") and information about your use of Hopster.com services and website that is not connected to your Personal Information ("Non-personal Information").</p>

    <h3>Non-personal Information</h3>
    <p>Non-personal Information may include both: 1) technical information, such as the type of Internet browser you use, the date and time you access the website, and your Internet protocol address; and, 2) service usage information, such as your site visits and page views, search and purchase history, and the demographic, geographic and psychographic information, product reviews and other feedback you supply to Hopster. Hopster may share Non-personal Information with select third parties on an anonymous basis (i.e., in a way that does not connect your Non-personal Information to your Personal Information or disclose your Personal Information in any fashion).</p>

    <h3>Personal Information</h3>
    <p>Personal Information may include your name, street address, email address, telephone number and payment information.</p>

    <h3>Hopster Disclosure of Your Personal Information</h3>
    <p>Except as explicitly set forth herein, we will not disclose your Personal Information to third parties without your express permission.</p>
    <ul class="indent">
      <li>
        <p><em>Agents</em>: We employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf. These functions may include providing customer service tools, hosting our website, or analyzing data. Our agents may have access to Personal Information needed to perform their functions, but may not use it for other purposes.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><em>Compelled Disclosures</em>: We may disclose your Personal Information as required by law and as necessary to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, and/or legal process served on us; and/or to protect our rights and the rights of our customers.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><em>Business Transfers</em>: In the event that Hopster, Inc., or substantially all of our assets are sold, customer information, including Personal Information, will likely be one of the transferred assets.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><em>Manufacturer Website Promotions</em>: We power a number of manufacturer branded promotions that allow consumers to access these offers directly from a manufacturer's own web site (e.g., laundrysoap.com) without visiting the main Hopster.com website. If you first accessed and created your Hopster.com account from one of these branded manufacturer websites, both Hopster, Inc. and the individual manufacturer that controls the website will have access to your Personal Information. If you signed up for a Hopster.com account from the main Hopster.com website, this subparagraph does not apply to you.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Hopster.com Account and Communications</h3>
    <p>In order to place to utilize promotions on the Hopster.com website or from a branded manufacturer website, you need to set up an Account, which may include your name, e-mail address, password, and mailing address. You can review, update and change some of your Personal Information-including your email address, mailing address and password-in your Account at anytime. In addition to using your email to contact you regarding Account activities, we may also update you on new product offerings and communications relevant to your use of Hopster.com (Hopster updates). If you do not wish to receive Hopster updates, you have the ability to stop receiving these email communications by signing into your Account and changing your communication preferences at anytime. You can remove yourself from Hopster updates by clicking on an "unsubscribe" hyperlink contained in any update e-mail that we send to you.</p>

    <h3>Customer Supplied Information</h3>
    <p>The Hopster.com website has a number of social features that allow you to interact with other Hopster customers and to post and share information about yourself, your use of the Hopster service, and the products you buy (Customer Supplied Information). This Customer Supplied Information may contain Personal Information you submit, such as your name. By submitting such content on our website and/or utilizing our social features, you consent to our sharing of that information with others. You will always have the option to not include your Personal Information through the Hopster website social features (for example, by not submitting your name in association with a product review, or requesting that your customer profile on Hopster or portions of that profile be kept confidential).</p>

    <h3>Security of Information</h3>
    <p>Hopster uses security measures to protect the privacy of your Personal Information. We limit the employees and contractors that can access your Personal Information and require these employees and contractors to adhere to a confidentiality policy. Hopster also uses technological security measures to protect your Personal Information. However, transmissions over the Internet are not completely secure, and any information you send to or through Hopster.com may be accessible by others. Hopster cannot guarantee our security measures. We also strongly encourage you to keep your password and account information secure and confidential.</p>

We will collect and store the information you provide us through Facebook Connect (including personally identifiable information) with any other registration information you provide us. Disabling your Facebook Connect may not terminate your account with us.</p>

    <h3>Notification of Changes</h3>
    <p>Hopster may make periodic changes to this privacy policy and changes will be posted on the Hopster.com web site.
