<h3 style="margin-bottom: 30px;">What information we collect about you</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our primary goals in collecting personally identifiable information are to provide you with the product and services made available through the Site, including, but not limited, to the Service, to communicate with you, and to manage your registered user account, if you have one.</span></p>
<h5><a id="whatinfo"></a><b>Site visitors:</b></h5>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When someone visits www.hopperhq.com we use third party services, Google Analytics &amp; Mixpanel, to collect standard internet log information and details of visitor behaviour patterns. We do this to find out things such as the number of visitors to the various parts of the site and how those visitors arrived at the site. This information is only processed in a way which does not identify anyone. We do not make, and do not allow Google to make, any attempt to find out the identities of those visiting our website. If we do want to collect personally identifiable information through our website, we will be up front about this. We will make it clear when we collect personal information and will explain what we intend to do with it.</span></p>
<h5><b>Information Collected Upon Registration:</b></h5>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you desire to use the Hopper HQ web and mobile tools ( e.g. app.hopperhq.com) and want access to certain restricted sections of the Site, you will be required to become a registered user, and to submit certain personally identifiable information to Hopper HQ.

<h5><b>Use of Contact Information:</b></h5>

For most users accessing the Internet from an Internet service provider the IP address will be different every time you log on. We use Log Data to monitor the use of the Site and of our Service, and for the Site’s technical administration. We do not associate your IP address with any other personally identifiable information to identify you personally, except in case of violation of the Terms of Service.</span></p>

Hopper HQ may use both session cookies and persistent cookies to better understand how you interact with the Site and our Service, to monitor aggregate usage by our users and web traffic routing on the Site, and to improve the Site and our services.

You can instruct your browser, by editing its options, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the websites you visit</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hopper HQ is very concerned about safeguarding the confidentiality of your personally identifiable information. We employ administrative, physical and electronic measures designed to protect your information from unauthorised access. We will make any legally-required disclosures of any breach of the security, confidentiality, or integrity of your unencrypted electronically stored personal data to you via email or conspicuous posting on this Site in the most expedient time possible and without unreasonable delay, consistent with (i) the legitimate needs of law enforcement or (ii) any measures necessary to determine the scope of the breach and restore the reasonable integrity of the data system.</span></p>
<h5>How long we keep information:</h5>
<p>How long we keep information we collect about you depends on the type of information, as described in further detail below. &nbsp;After such time, we will either delete or anonymise your information or, if this is not possible (for example, because the information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your information and isolate it from any further use until deletion is possible.</p>

<p>In some cases, you may ask us to stop accessing, storing, using and otherwise processing your information where you believe we don’t have the appropriate rights to do so. &nbsp;For example, if you believe a Services account was created for you without your permission or you are no longer an active user, you can request that we delete your account as provided in this policy. &nbsp;Where you gave us consent to use your information for a limited purpose, you can contact us to withdraw that consent, but this will not affect any processing that has already taken place at the time.

In this scenario you can opt out of the communications by deactivating your account.</p>

Depending on the context, this applies to some of your information, but not to all of your information. Should you request it, we will provide you with an electronic file of your account information.</p>
