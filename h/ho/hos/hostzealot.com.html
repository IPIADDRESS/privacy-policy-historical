By using HostZealot.com or by agreeing to the Terms and Conditions in HostZealot Terms of Service, you consent and agree, without limitation or qualification, to the collection, usage and disclosure of personal information and to the privacy practices set out in the Privacy Policy and to any other privacy or data collection policy which is displayed or is included as a link in any individual HostZealot web site. The following is a list of our current Privacy Policy items. We suggest you check back from time-to-time, to see what has been updated. Questions or concerns regarding our use of your information and this statement should be directed to HostZealot Privacy Coordinator.</p> <h6>Transmission of Personal Data</h6> <p>When you order from us, all your personal information is protected. We use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), the industry standard, for encrypting all personal information, including name, address and credit card numbers.</p> <h6>About Cookies and Web Beacons</h6> <p>Nowadays, cookies are used on majority of websites. Most browsers are initially set to accept cookies. If you prefer, you can set your browser either to notify you when you have received a cookie, or to refuse to accept cookies. You should understand that while using our website does not require you to use cookies, certain pages may not function properly if you set your browser to not accept cookies.</p> <p>A cookie is a small text file containing a unique identification number that is uploaded from a website to the hard drive of your computer so that the website may identify you. This unique number identifies your browser, but not you, to HostZealot servers whenever you visit HostZealot website. A cookie will not let a website know any personal information about you, such as your real name and address. The coding in the cookies lets us know that you are using a particular computer but nothing more. Since cookies are only text files, they cannot run on your computer, search your computer for other information or transmit any information to anyone.</p> <p>To help serve you better, HostZealot uses cookies to:</p> <p>• Help us remember who you are through your browser settings so that we can offer and provide personalized services. Our system uses cookies to store and sometimes track information about what is done and seen across HostZealot website. Cookies also allow us to save passwords and preferences for you so that you will not have to re-enter them the next time you visit.</p> <p>• Measure traffic patterns. Without cookies, it would be difficult for us to know that certain website sections are more popular than other sections. This information helps us better understand when to offer new services or improve our website.</p> <p>• Estimate audience size. Cookies help us know whether users have seen particular displays or not, including advertisements.</p> <p>• Display advertisements. HostZealot and third party advertising networks used by HostZealot may use cookies when serving advertisements.</p> <p>HostZealot website may contain electronic images known as Web beacons, which are sometimes called single-pixel gifs that allow us to count users who have visited those pages and to deliver co-branded services. Web beacons are not used to access your personal information with us. They are a technique used to compile statistics about HostZealot website usage. Web beacons collect only a limited set of information including a cookie number, time and date of a page view, and a description of the page on which the web beacon resides. HostZealot website pages may also contain web beacons placed there by our advertising partners to help us determine the effectiveness of our Internet advertising campaigns.</p> <h6>Usage of Personal Information</h6> <p>Any personal information you provide to us is maintained and accessible only by our employees, unless specifically stated otherwise. HostZealot requests information from its users so that users can enjoy customized experiences across our system. We may use the information collected as follows:</p> <p>• To offer users the ability to customize or personalize content.</p> <p>• To deliver products and services requested.</p> <p>We use the anonymous, aggregate data collected to inform our sponsors and advertisers as to numbers of people who have certain demographic characteristics and the number of those people who have seen and "clicked" on their advertisement(s). Our company will also disclose to those third-party sponsors and advertisers the overall demographics available regarding who saw and "clicked" on their advertisements. No personal information will be disclosed to these sponsors and advertisers as part of this process; only information in an anonymous, aggregate form will be disclosed.</p> <p>Our system also uses the anonymous, aggregate data to perform statistical analyses of the collective characteristics and behavior of our registered users and visitors, to measure user demographics and interests regarding specific areas of HostZealot website, to describe our services to third parties such as prospective business partners and advertisers and to analyze how and where best to use our resources. Without such data, we would not know what the most popular areas of HostZealot website are, and we would not be able to change and update the content and services appropriately. We also use such data to monitor and improve the operation of our website and to maintain the quality of the Products and Services made available through our system. No personal information will be disclosed during these activities.</p> <p>Our company may use your personal information from time to time to contact you about changes or enhancements to Products and Services on HostZealot website.

This is done either at the point of initial collection of information or during the editing or updating process. The process to opt out of most HostZealot email materials is the same as the process for editing user information profiles described above. In addition, all such email materials have easy-to-follow unsubscribe directions posted at the bottom of the email. If you have any questions or concerns, please contact us.</p> <h6>Security Procedures</h6> <p>Our company has security measures in place to attempt to protect against the loss, misuse and alteration of your user data under our control.
