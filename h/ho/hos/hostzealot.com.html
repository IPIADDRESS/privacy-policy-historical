The following is a list of our current Privacy Policy items. We suggest you check back from time-to-time, to see what has been updated. Questions or concerns regarding our use of your information and this statement should be directed to HostZealot's Privacy Coordinator.</p>
<p><strong>Transmission of Personal Data:</strong><br>
When you order from HostZealot, all your personal information is protected. We use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), the industry standard, for encrypting all personal information, including name, address and credit card numbers.</p>
<p><strong>About Cookies and Web Beacons:</strong><br>
Nowadays, cookies are used on most major web sites. Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies. If you prefer, you can reset your browser either to notify you when you have received a cookie, or to refuse to accept cookies. You should understand that while HostZealot does not require you to use cookies, certain pages may not function properly if you set your browser to not accept cookies.</p>
<p>A cookie is a small text file containing a unique identification number that is transferred from a web site to the hard drive of your computer so that the web site may identify you. This unique number identifies your browser, but not you, to HostZealot's servers whenever you visit HostZealot. A cookie will not let a web site know any personal information about you, such as your real name and address. The coding in the cookies lets us know that you are using a particular computer but nothing more. Since cookies are only text files, they cannot run on your computer, search your computer for other information or transmit any information to anyone.</p>
<p><strong>To help serve you better, HostZealot uses cookies to:</strong><br>
Help us remember who you are through your browser settings so that we can offer and provide personalized services. HostZealot uses cookies to store and sometimes track information about what is done and seen across HostZealot. Cookies also allow us to save passwords and preferences for you so that you will not have to re-enter them the next time you visit.</p>
<p>Measure traffic patterns. Without cookies, it could be difficult for us to know that certain services are more popular than others are. This information helps us to better understand when to offer new services.<br>
Estimate audience size. Cookies help us know whether or not users have seen particular displays, including advertisements.</p>
<p>Displaying advertisements. HostZealot and third party advertising networks used by HostZealot may use cookies when serving advertisements.</p>
<p>HostZealot may contain electronic images known as Web beacons, which are sometimes called single-pixel gifs, that allow HostZealot to count users who have visited those pages and to deliver co-branded services. Web beacons are not used to access your personal information on HostZealot. They are a technique used to compile statistics about HostZealot usage. Web beacons collect only a limited set of information including a cookie number, time and date of a page view, and a description of the page on which the Web beacon resides. HostZealot web pages may also contain Web beacons placed there by our advertising partners to help HostZealot determine the effectiveness of our Internet advertising campaigns.</p>
<p><strong>How does HostZealot Use the Information?</strong><br>
Any personal information you provide to HostZealot is maintained and accessible only by HostZealot, unless specifically stated otherwise. HostZealot requests information from its users so that users can enjoy customized experiences across HostZealot. We may use the information collected as follows:<br>
To offer users the ability to customize or personalize content.<br>
To deliver products and services requested.<br>
HostZealot uses the anonymous, aggregate data collected to inform our sponsors and advertisers as to numbers of people who have certain demographic characteristics and the number of those people who have seen and "clicked" on their advertisement(s). HostZealot will also disclose to those third-party sponsors and advertisers the overall demographics available regarding who saw and "clicked" on their advertisement. No personal information will be disclosed to these sponsors and advertisers as part of this process; only information in an anonymous, aggregate form will be disclosed.</p>
<p>HostZealot also uses the anonymous, aggregate data to perform statistical analyses of the collective characteristics and behavior of our registered users and visitors, to measure user demographics and interests regarding specific areas of HostZealot, to describe our services to third parties such as prospective business partners and advertisers and to analyze how and where best to use our resources. Without such data, we would not know what the most popular areas of HostZealot are, and we would not be able to change and update the content and services appropriately. HostZealot also uses such data to monitor and improve the operation of HostZealot and to maintain the quality of the Products and Services made available through HostZealot. No personal information will be disclosed during these activities.</p>
<p>HostZealot may, from time to time, use your personal information to contact you about changes or enhancements to Products and Services on HostZealot. If you indicated that you were interested in receiving offers or information from selected HostZealot sponsors and advertisers, HostZealot will send you email publications and mailings about products and services that we feel may be of interest to you.
