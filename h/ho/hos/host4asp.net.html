            <p>Host4ASP.NET regards customers' privacy as the most important matter. We work out this Privacy Policy to show how we collect and use customers' information as well as make a commit for the security and privacy of customers' information. We guarantee that we will never violate this policy.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="sub-title">
            <h3>Information Collected</h3>
        </div>
        <div class="des-text">
            <p>Customers are required to provide some personal information when signing up the hosting service. The information includes name, address, email, and phone number, and this type of collected information is used to finish the registration and manage each member's account. Besides, there is also some other information necessary for signing up the service, like credit card and PayPal account. When submitting the order, customers need to offer the credit card number or PayPal account information. </p>
            <p>We use the collected information for multiple purposes, including the service transaction, sales inquiries, support inquiries, and the notification of service. In this case, we have to disclose the information to the banking institutions, affiliates, and contractors. We strictly protect your information from sharing by the third parties, unless under some special conditions. For instance, if customers cooperate with the company to promote a certain service, the company needs to provide a part of customer's personal information, such as the username, name, and address. The information is used for the purpose of enabling customers and the company access to the results of the promotion.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="des-text">
            <p>Frankly, customer's domain registration information legally has to be published to the public. The information is stored in a database named as WHOIS. Everyone can access to the WHOIS database and view the registration information of each registrant. However, some people may intentionally steal the domain registration information and make use of it to do something illegal. To address this problem, the company uses the alternative information to replace the true information so that customer's domain registration information is not able to be seen by others.</p>
