<h3>INFORMATION COLLECTED DURING ORDER PROCESS</h3>
<p>
We request information from the user on our order form(s).
In order for us to service Customer account, here a user must provide contact information (email, name,
address, phone) and depending on payment method, financial information (credit
card number, expiration date, bank information). Additionally the IP is recorded in the billing system. This information is used for
billing purposes and to fill customer's orders. If we have
trouble processing an order, this contact information is
used to get in touch with the user. We use a high encryption
SSL certificate for securely gathering the requested information. We also encrypt the credit card information
for your security and the CVV code of the card is NOT stored.

<h3>LOG FILES</h3>
<p>
Log files automatically collect certain types of information related to your browser, including your IP address.  We use IP addresses to analyze trends and
help provide an insight into how visitors transition from one page to another so we can optimize the visitor experience, and gather broad demographic
information like the type of browser, for aggregate use. IP addresses are not linked
to personally identifiable information.

<br>
<section id="sharing">
<h3>SHARING OF INFORMATION</h3>
<p>
<strong>Hostek does NOT share any personal information with any outside
company</strong> except as outlined here:
<br><br>
Credit/Payment Card Processors - Hostek uses a credit/payment card
processing company (just like every business that accepts
credit cards has to) to bill users for goods and services. Hostek only passes the required information to the credit card company which includes the name, card number, expiration date and billing zip code. Hostek does NOT forward any personally identifiable information to these card processing companies.
<br><br>
Domain Registration/Transfer - Domain Registrars require domain ownership information. Hostek is required to provide the domain owner information to the Domain Registrars. NOTE: Hostek STRONGLY suggests adding Domains Whois Privacy so that your information is not made public.
<br><br>
SSL Certificates - Certain information must be provided to the certificate issuing authority. This information varies based on the certificate type and at a minimum requires an email address for approval of the certificate. For EV (Extended Validation - green bar) certicates, the certificate issuing authority requires email, company name, address, phone and contact information.
<br><br>
CloudFlare - CloudFlare is used by some customers as a CDN (content distribution network) to help filter bad request and to spread the site assets around the globe for faster load times. CloudFlare requires a customer email address for the CloudFlare account.
<br><br>
SmarterMail Bundle - SmarterMail provides an introductory bundle for customers that are new to SmarterMail. To receive the bundle, SmarterTools, the makers of SmarterMail, require Customer email adddress.
<br><br>
SpamExperts - SpamExperts is a premium Anti-Spam solution that many customers love. SpamExperts requires a customer email for the account, which also allows Customer to login and review quarantined messages and manage settings.
<br><br>
Advanced Online Solutions, Inc, the corporate name of Hostek.com, is the sole owner of Hostek Limited, a Registered Private Company within England and Wales. Hostek.com has staff in the United States and Hostek Limited has staff in the United Kingdom. The staff of both companies work together to take care of our customers around the globe. While these are sister companies which is not applicable to this section, we believe full transparency is best in knowing that as an international company, Hostek has staff in both locations that are available to help our customers, 24/7.
</p>
<p>
Hostek will comply with State and Federal law and therefore comply with lawful request (ie, court orders, subpoenas, etc.). When allowed, Hostek will notify customer of such request.

<h3>SECURITY</h3>
<p>
This website takes every precaution to protect our visitors'
information. When visitors submit sensitive information via the
website, the information is protected both online and
off-line.
</p>
<p>
When our order form(s) asks visitors to enter sensitive
information (such as credit card number), that information
is encrypted and is protected with the best encryption
software in the industry - SSL. While on a secure page, such
as our order form(s), the lock icon in the Web
browser becomes locked. Hostek has taken additional steps to ensure SSL encryption is used at all times when browing our site.
</p>
<p>
While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information
online, we also do everything in our power to protect
user-information off-line. All of our users' information,
not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is
restricted in our offices. Only employees who need the
information to perform a specific job (for example, our
billing clerk or a customer service representative) are
granted access to personally identifiable information. ALL
employees are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy
practices. Any time new policies are added, our employees
are notified and/or reminded about the importance we place
on privacy, and what they can do to ensure our customers'
information is protected. Finally, the servers that we store
personally identifiable information on are kept in a secure
environment.
</p>
<p>
Hostek's website and services are not intended for, nor
designed to attract, individuals under the age of 18.
Hostek does not knowingly collect personally
identifiable information from any person under the age of
18.
</p>
<p>
When paying by Credit Card, upon initial payment, you will be required to enter the CVV code for the card. We do NOT store this code. It is only asked for this once. The card itself is encrypted and stored for your security.

<br>
<section id="special-offers">
<h3>SPECIAL OFFERS</h3>
<p>
We send all new accounts an email providing new account
information. Established customers will occasionally receive
information on new services and/or special promotions. Out
of respect for the privacy of our users we present the
option to not receive these types of communications.

<section id="correction">
<h3>CORRECTING/UPDATING/DELETING PERSONAL INFORMATION</h3>
<p>
If a user's personally identifiable information changes
(such as your phone number or email address), or if a user no longer desires our
service, we will endeavor to provide a way to correct,
update or remove that user's personal data provided to us.

<h3>CUSTOMER INFORMATION AND CUSTOMER PRIVACY</h3>
<p>
New European Union (EU) Data Protection laws (GDPR) are effective May 25, 2018.
While GDPR only holds us accountable for how we process EU customers’ personal data, we have taken this opportunity to review our practices and ensure that our high standards for data privacy encompass every one of our customers. Therefore you may see references to GDPR within the Privacy Policy.
</p>
<p>
Company shall act in accordance with industry practice in protecting Customer Information submitted by Customer to Company ("Customer Information"), and shall not sell or otherwise transfer Customer Information to third parties for marketing activitites in any circumstance. Company shall be entitled to use the Personal Information of Customer in the due performance of the Services, this Agreement and (unless opted out in writing) for communcation to Customer of Company's own marketing information.

<p>
As to Personal Information, also referred hereinto as Personal Data, supplied by or through Customer in the course of its business with Company, the following shall apply:
</p>
<p>
(1) Both parties will comply with their respective obligations under the applicable requirements of the Data Protection Laws.
</p>
<p>
(2) The parties acknowledge that for the purposes of the Data Protection Laws, Customer can be both the data subject and the data controller as described herein. As a Customer of Company, personal data submitted to Company by Customer means Customer is a data subject. When Customer utilizes Company servers for handling Customer's own customers, Customer is a Data Controller as defined in the Data Protection Laws.<br><br>
The parties also acknowledge that for the purposes of the Data Protection Laws, Company can be both a data processor and data controller as described herein. Regarding Customer data submitted to Company, Company is a Data Controller.

Company's processing does not include the manipulation, selection, ordering, searching or monitoring of such Personal Data other than in a generic sense of storage in the scope of the Services. Customer is responsible for the cleansing, updating, timely deletion and maintenance of Personal Data.
