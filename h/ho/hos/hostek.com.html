HosTek.com PRIVACY STATEMENT
</font></b>
<font face="Helvetica, Arial" color="#000066" size="2">
<br><br>

<b>Information Collection and Use</b><br>
HosTek.com is the sole owner of the information collected on this site.  We will not sell, share, or rent this information to others in ways different from what is disclosed in this statement.  HosTek.com may collect information from our users at several different points on our website.
<br><br>

<b>Order</b><br>
We request information from the user on our order form(s).  Here a user must provide contact information (like name, adddress, telephone) and financial information (like credit card number, expiration date).  This information is used for billing purposes and to fill customer’s orders.  If we have trouble processing an order, this contact information is used to get in touch with the user.
<br><br>

<b>Cookies</b><br>
HosTek.com in general does not implement the use of cookies.  In our user Control Panel, you have the option to set a cookie so you don't have to continue to log in.
A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user’s hard drive containing information about the user.  Usage of a cookie is in no way linked to any personally identifiable information while on our site.
<br><br>

<b>Log Files</b><br>
We use IP addresses to analyze trends, administer the site, track user’s movement, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use.  IP addresses are not linked to personally identifiable information.
<br><br>

<b>Sharing</b><br>
HosTek.com does NOT share any information with any other company except as noted here.
We use a credit card processing company (just like every business that accepts credit cards has to) to bill users for goods and services. These companies do not retain, share, store or use personally identifiable information for any secondary purposes.
<br><br>

<b>Links</b><br>
This web site contains links to other sites. Please be aware that we [HosTek.com] are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites.  We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every web site that collects personally identifiable information.  This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by this Web site.
<br><br>

<b>Newsletter</b><br>
If a user wishes to subscribe to our newsletter, we ask for contact information such as name and email address.
<br><br>

<b>Surveys &amp; Contests</b><br>
From time-to-time our site requests information from users via surveys or contests.  Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and the user therefore has a choice whether or not to disclose this information.  Information requested may include contact information (such as name and address), and demographic information (such as zip code, age level).  Contact information will be used to notify the winners and award prizes.  Survey information will be used for purposes of monitoring or improving the use and satisfaction of this site.
<br><br>

<!--Tell-A-Friend
If a user elects to use our referral service for informing a friend about our site, we ask them for the friend’s name and email address.  [COMPANY X] will automatically send the friend a one-time email inviting them to visit the site.  [COMPANY X] stores this information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email.  The friend may contact [COMPANY X] at [INSERT URL] to request the removal of this information from their database. -->


<b>Security</b><br>
This website takes every precaution to protect our users’ information.  When users submit sensitive information via the website, your information is protected both online and off-line.
<br><br>
When our order form(s) asks users to enter sensitive information (such as credit card number), that information is encrypted and is protected with the best encryption software in the industry - SSL.  While on a secure page, such as our order form(s), the lock icon on the bottom of Web browsers such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to un-locked, or open, when you are just ‘surfing’.
<br><br>

While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also do everything in our power to protect user-information off-line.  All of our users’ information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted in our offices.  Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, our billing clerk or a customer service representative) are granted access to personally identifiable information.  ALL employees are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy practices.  Any time new policies are added, our employees are notified and/or reminded about the importance we place on privacy, and what they can do to ensure our customers’ information is protected.  Finally, the servers that we store personally identifiable information on are kept in a secure environment.
<br><br>

If you have any questions about the security at our website, you can send an email to <a href="mailto:security@hostek.com">security@hostek.com</a>.
<br><br>

<b>Special Offers</b><br>
We send all new accounts an email providing new account information.  Established customers will occasionally receive information on new services and/or special promotions.  Out of respect for the privacy of our users we present the option to not receive these types of communications.
<br><br>

<b>Correcting/Updating Personal Information:</b><br>
If a user’s personally identifiable information changes (such as your zip code), or if a user no longer desires our service, we will endeavor to provide a way to correct, update or remove that user’s personal data provided to us.  This can usually be done at the user's Control Panel  page or by emailing our <a href="mailto:support@hostek.com">Customer Support</a>.
<br><br>

<b>Notification of Changes</b><br>
If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes on this page so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under circumstances, if any, we disclose it.  If at any point we decide to use personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time it was collected, we will notify users by way of an email.  Users will have a choice as to whether or not we use their information in this different manner. We will use information in accordance with the privacy policy under which the information was collected.
