The information which is collected on the Visitor´s registration and / or usage of the Website and / or Services, is classified into anonymous and personal.<br> 1. Anonymous information. The Company may collect the anonymous information related to facts, which cannot be applied to an individual visitor. E.g., the Company may collect certain information every time the Visitor visits the Website in order to provide higher quality services to the clients. The Company may also collect the Visitors’ IP addresses, related data (e.g., the internet address of the last website, which the person has visited before his / her visit to the Website), as well as browser and operating system types. The Company may also collect common search yields from various search programs, oriented towards internal advertising, and the list of the 50 most popular search words. The Company may collect this information with the aim of direct marketing as well as the supervision and improvement of the Services. The Company may collect information regarding the Visitor´s answers to the questions that are brought forward in the Websites with the objective to establish the Visitor´s opinion about the Services and the advertisements published on the Websites. The Company may collect and conserve the said information about alll and any visitors, regardless if they are registered or not.<br> 2. Personal information is the information regarding the data that exactly define who is the Visitor, such as name, address, etc. Such infotmation can be collected in addition to the anonymous information. The Company may collect the personal information from different parts of the Website in a number of ways which are listed below:<br> 1. Registration: when the Visitor registers in the Website, he / she may be required to provide his / her personal information e-mail address only.<br> 2.

The said information also includes the data that the Visitor sends within the net of the Company.</p><p><strong>Persons receiving the information</strong><br> 1. The Company reserves the right to pass the information regarding the Visitor, which is selected at its discretion, to any third parties as long as it does not breach the applicable laws.<br> 2. The Company draws the Visitor’s attention to the fact that links to other internet sites can be published on the Website. Some of these internet sites can retain Visitor’s personal information and commercial internet sites can be using „cookies” and „web beacons“ (so-called „web spies”) in their advertisements in order to gather information about the Visitor. Please read Chapter 4 of the Privacy policy, where you will learn more about advertising in the Website. The Privacy policy of the Company and its provisions do not comprise the privacy policies and provisions regarding the information collection that are applied by the third parties. The Company is not and shall not be held responsible for the actions of any third parties that collect information about the Visitor.</p><p><strong>„Cookies“, „Web beacons“ and their use</strong><br> 1. The Company may collect the anonymous information about the Visitor by means of „cookies” and „web beacons“ technologies.<br> 2. „Cookie“ is a small text document with a unique identification number, which is transferred from the Website to the hard disc of the Visitor’s computer in order for the internet site administrator to be able to distinguish the Visitor’s computer and see the Visitor’s activity in the internet. The unique number identifies the Visitor’s browser every time the Visitor enters the Websites. „Cookie“ does not allow internet sites to remember any&nbsp; of the Visitor’s personal information (such as the Visitor’s name and address), which the Visitor could forget to protect.<br> 3. „Cookie“ allows the Company to remember the Visitor’s internet browser type automatically. In order to offer higher service quality to the Visitor, the Company may use „cookies“ for below listed reasons:<br> 1. to be able to provide the most efficient and the highest quality services as possible. Retaining certain information in the „cookie“ documents or associating „cookie“ with the registration, favourite websites or a short Visitor’s description in the Company’s computer system. The Company can provide services for a greater number of visitors in a much quicker and more efficient&nbsp; manner. This information is usually conserved in an encoded manner, which can only be deciphered by the Company;<br> 2. to protect the Visitor from illegal use of his login data;<br> 3. to be able to keep statistics, such as the number and flow of visitors. Such information is usually not associated with the Visitor’s personal information.<br> 4. The use of „cookie“ is an industrial standard and therefore they are used in many internet sites. There is a possibility to prevent the „cookie“ infiltration in the Visitor’s computer or prohibit any forms of „cookie“. In such case some Services may partly or completely stop functioning.<br> 5. „Web beacons“, also known as GIFs or one-pixel GIFs, are small graphic documents, which the Company may place in the Website or e-mails that the Company sends to the Visitor. Together „cookies” and „web beacons“ allow the Company to calculate the number of unique visitors in certain internet sites and the number of displays of certain internet sites. By the means of using „web beacons“ the Company can learn how often a certain internet site, the advertisement of which was sent to the Visitor by e-mail, was visited. Such information is not associated with the Visitor’s personal information.<br> 6. Any of the picture in the Website can be a „web beacon”. Third parties that advertise on the Website or by any other means may use „web beacons“ .</p><p><strong>The use of Visitor’s information</strong><br> 1.

The Company uses common data for the statistical analysis of the Visitors’ behaviour, seeking to establish the Visitors’ needs and analyse how and where the available resources could be used in the most efficient manner.

Such information is accumulated anonymously and is used for the development, supervision and improvement of the Services, in order to improve directional advertising and with other aims;<br> 6.
