				    <br>
			      When your web browser requests a  web page from another computer on the Internet, such as hostican.com,  it automatically gives that computer the address where it should send the  information. This is called your computer's "IP address." (IP stands  for "Internet protocol.") For many users accessing the Internet, the  IP address will be different every time you log on.&nbsp; We record the IP Addresses that access  HostICan.com along with related information such as your browser type and  operating system. This information helps us, in part, learn about the  geographical distribution of our website visitors and the technology they use  to access our site so that we can improve our Site.			      </p>
