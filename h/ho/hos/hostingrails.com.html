1.4. B. Hosting space is intended for normal use only, and is limited to Web files, active e-mail and content of the hosted Web sites, not for offsite storage of electronic files, electronic mail or FTP hosts. You are responsible for removing any files, e-mails or other data which do not meet these requirements, and for adhering to any usage requirements or limits allocated to your account(s). Failure to do so may result in removal and deletion of such materials (including without limitation files and e-mails), and/or in discontinuation of your services or account, which actions we may take in our sole discretion.<br>
    
    <br>

1.4. C. Materials in the public domain (e.g., images, text, and programs) may be downloaded or uploaded using the Services. You may also re-distribute materials in the public domain. You assume all risks regarding the determination of whether the material is in the public domain. You are prohibited from storing, distributing or transmitting any unlawful material through the Services. Where there are allegations that your on-line activity has violated the legal rights of a third party, HOSTINGRAILS will not substitute itself for a court of law in deciding tort claims raised by the third party.<br>
    
    <br>

1.4. D. Unacceptable affronts to netiquette and unacceptable activities include, but are not limited to, the following: spamming (sending unsolicited advertising to those with which you have no existing business relationship and posting off-topic advertising in newsgroups); spoofing (using a return email address that is not the valid reply address of the sender or sending an email message that does not contain enough information to enable the recipient to identify you); passive spamming (promoting a website hosted by HOSTINGRAILS by spamming from some other source); trolling (posting controversial messages in newsgroups to generate responses); mailbombing (inundating a user with email without any serious intent to correspond or sending large or multiple files to a user); generating a higher volume of outgoing mail than a normal user; propagating chain letters; and subscribing someone else to an electronic mailing list without that person's permission. A message is considered unsolicited if it is posted in violation of a newsgroup charter or sent to a recipient who has not requested the message. Making an email address available to the public does not constitute a request to receive messages. Distribution of mass emailing programs is also prohibited. All recipients on a mailing list must have personally subscribed. Mailing lists may not be used to distribute unsolicited email. You may send a maximum of 1000 solicited emails per day, to send more than this you must have express written permission from HOSTINGRAILS. You may not alter the headers of email messages to disguise their identity or to prevent users from responding to the messages. HOSTINGRAILS may disclose the usernames of accounts responsible for forged email messages to system administrators or users requesting the information.  Any violations of the aforementioned terms will result in account suspension or termination.<br>
    
    <br>

1.4. E. You are prohibited from utilizing the Services to compromise the security of system resources or accounts on servers at HOSTINGRAILS or at any other site. Use or distribution of tools designed for compromising security or containing viruses or trojans are prohibited. Examples of these tools include, but are not limited to, password guessing programs, cracking tools or network probing tools. If you are involved in violations of system security, HOSTINGRAILS reserves the right to release all usernames of users involved in such violations to system administrators at other sites in order to assist them in resolving security incidents. HOSTINGRAILS will also fully cooperate with law enforcement authorities in investigating suspected lawbreakers.<br>
    
    <br>

1.4. F. System abuse includes any use of HOSTINGRAILS resources that disrupts the normal use of its servers or services for others. Examples of system abuse include running excessive numbers of processes or consuming excessive amounts of CPU time, memory or disk space. Further, running programs in the background on a HOSTINGRAILS server without HOSTINGRAILS's prior written authorization, or running chat rooms, Internet Relay Chat, IRC bots, and the like are not acceptable uses of HOSTINGRAILS's servers. The use of more than 50,000 inodes on any shared hosting account may result in a warning, and if no corrective action is taken, HOSTINGRAILS reserves the right to suspend or terminate services.<br>
    
    <br>

<strong>1.5. Accountholder Data Backup Responsibility</strong><br>
    
    <br>

1.5. A. HOSTINGRAILS will attempt to retain nightly backups. However, as with any data storage systems, backups can fail. We encourage you to perform your own backups on a periodic basis. Because of this your use of this service is at your sole risk. HOSTINGRAILS is not responsible for files and/or data residing within your services. You agree to take full responsibility for files and data transferred and to maintain all appropriate backup of files and data stored on HOSTINGRAILS.<br>

TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE STATE LAW DOES NOT ALLOW THE LIMITATION OF LIABILITY FOR CONSEQUENTIAL OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, HOSTINGRAILS'S LIABILITY IS LIMITED TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW.<br>
    
    <br>

2.2. You agree to indemnify, defend and hold HOSTINGRAILS and its affiliates, directors, officers, employees and agents harmless from and against any liabilities, losses, damages or costs, including reasonable attorneys' fees, resulting from any third-party claim, action, dispute or demand related to your use of the Services, your violation of any of the provisions of this Agreement or from your placement or transmission of any materials or content onto HOSTINGRAILS's servers.

Each party shall select an arbitrator with expertise in computer law and the Internet, and these two arbitrators shall select the third arbitrator with such expertise.

4.1. A. You may not assign your rights and obligations under this Agreement without the prior written consent of HOSTINGRAILS, which may be withheld at HOSTINGRAILS's discretion. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall be construed as creating any agency, partnership, or other form of joint enterprise between the parties. The failure of HOSTINGRAILS to require your performance of any provision hereof shall not affect the right to require such performance thereafter; nor shall the waiver by HOSTINGRAILS of a breach of any provision hereof be taken or held to be a waiver of the provision itself. Any action for any claim arising under, or in connection with, this Agreement must be commenced by you within one year after the alleged cause of action has accrued or after the date of termination of this Agreement, whichever is earlier. In the event that any provision of this Agreement is deemed unenforceable or invalid, such unenforceability or invalidity shall not affect the remainder of this Agreement. Such provision may be amended or replaced with one that is valid and enforceable and which achieves, to the extent possible, the original objectives and intent of the parties as reflected in the original provision. No provision of this Agreement may be amended or modified by you except by means of a written document signed or expressly assented to by HOSTINGRAILS.
