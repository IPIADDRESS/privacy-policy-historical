		<br>
		<strong>Updated July 7, 2011</strong><br>
		<br>
		<strong>Our Privacy Policy governs information that is collected through the HWTM.com Website and the Hostessblog.com Website ("Site"), through our company, HWTM, LLC ("Company," "Hostess With The Mostess," "HWTM, "we" or "us"), through the use of the Site, software, and other services offered on or through the Site (collectively, the "Services"). This Privacy Policy is incorporated by reference into the <a href="index.cfm?page=about/termsandconditions">Terms and Conditions of Use</a>.</strong><br> 
		<br>
		Please read the Privacy Policy carefully. This explains what Personal Information we will gather from you, and when and how this information is used. <strong>Our Terms of Use explains the legal obligations of HWTM, LLC and you, the user, and also outlines what you can and cannot do while accessing the Site and Services.</strong><br>
		<br>
		"Personal Information" is information about a person that is personally identifiable to such person like the person's name, address, email address, or phone number, as well as other non-public information.<br> 
		<br>
		"Anonymous Information" or "Aggregated Information" means information that is not associated with or linked to Personally Identifiable Information. Anonymous or Aggregated Information does not permit the identification of individual persons.<br> 
		<br>
		Please check back periodically for changes in our Privacy Policy. 
		<br>
		<strong>Your Privacy.</strong> We understand that your privacy is very important to you. At HWTM we believe that our online visitors have a right to know our practices regarding the information we may collect when you access or use our Services.

		<br>
		<strong>Acceptance of Privacy Policy.</strong>  BY ACCESSING OUR SITE AND USING THE SERVICES, AND ANY OF THE UPDATES THEREOF, AND BY PROVIDING OR SUBMITTING INFORMATION THROUGH OUR SITE AND SERVICES, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU HAVE READ AND UNDERSTAND THIS PRIVACY POLICY, AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY ITS TERMS AND CONDITIONS.

If someone is under the age of 18, they should only use this Site with the supervision of a parent or legal guardian. We do not knowingly collect or maintain Personal Information from individuals who are under 13 years of age, and no part of our Site or Services are designed to attract people under the age of 13. Protecting the privacy of children is very important to us. If we obtain knowledge that a user is under the age of 13, we will take steps to remove that user's Personal Information from our databases.<br> 
		<br>
		<strong>The Information that We Collect.</strong>  From time to time, we may ask for certain Personal Information from you so that you may register with our site, and enjoy various Services. Generally, we collect information in the following ways: when you submit information through your Registration, and Profile; and when we receive information through our Services and third party providers or advertisers.<br>
		<br>
		We will collect your name, birth date, your email address, address, and Paypal information in the event you register as a Pro ("Personal Information"). This information and other information you provide to us, for example information submitted through your orders, will be collected, used, and disclosed as outlined herein. Unless otherwise indicated, information provided will not be associated with your Personal Information and if disclosed or used by us, such information shall be in anonymous or aggregate form.<br>
		<br> 
		<strong>Why We Collect this Information.</strong>  We collect information for a variety of reasons, including administration of our Site and Services, our effort to inform you of changes in our Service, special offers, newsletters, and other products and services in which you may be interested. When you submit Personal Information to us, you understand and agree that the HWTM may access, store, and use your Profile/Account and Personal Information. You consent to the transfer of your information to and within the United States or other countries for processing and storage.<br> 
		<br>
		<strong>Our Use and Disclosure of Your Information.</strong> HWTM will use your Personal Information only for that specific purpose for which you submitted such Personal Information. We DO NOT sell or rent any Personal Information about you to any third party without your permission. Unless otherwise indicated, Personal Information provided by you to HWTM is for the internal use by HWTM only and for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy. We may disclose your Personal Information we collect to companies that perform services on our behalf to fulfill order requirements, payment processing, or administrative requirements.<br> 
		<br>
		<strong>Our Security Procedures and Your Privacy.</strong>  Hostess With The Mostess takes great care in maintaining the security of your Personal Information, and preventing unauthorized access to it, through the use of commercially reasonable technology and internal procedures. For example, credit card transactions are processed through our secure payment gateway, Paypal, using SSL and a state of the art firewall. Stored credit cards and passwords are encrypted. Although we take great care in maintaining the security of your Personal Information, we do not guarantee that unauthorized access will never occur.<br> 
		<br>
		<strong>What You Can Do For Your Security and Privacy.</strong> While we have taken the measures outlined above, you can assist us by creating longer, stronger passwords longer. Don't post anything that you may want to remove at sometime in the future.<br> 
		<br>
		<strong>Notice of Sharing.</strong> We may share your Personal Information or other information under the following circumstances: (a) within HWTM, including our employees, and agents; (b) with third parties with your consent including third party product vendors and distributors; (c) if we believe in good faith that it is required by law, legal process or court order; (d) as may be required to respond to an inquiry, request or complaint that you have made; (e) to persons or companies that we engage to carry out or provide support for the operations of its business (which may include customer support services or email service providers); or (f) if we believe in good faith that it is necessary to protect the personal safety, property, or interests of you, our users, the public, our licensors, the Services, or ourselves.

		<strong>Use of Cookies, and Other Technology.</strong><br> 
		<br>
		<strong>Cookies.</strong> Cookies are pieces of information that some websites transfer to the computer that is browsing that website ("Cookies"), and are used for record-keeping purposes at many websites. The use of Cookies makes web surfing easier by performing certain functions such as saving your passwords, background information, and your personal preferences regarding your use of the particular website.

Your browser is probably set to accept Cookies; however, it may be set to block acceptance of cookies, erase Cookies from your computer hard drive, or receive a warning before a Cookie is stored. If you would prefer not to receive Cookies, you can alter the configuration of your browser to refuse, erase, or to warn you of the use of Cookies.<br> 
		<br>
		If you choose to have your browser refuse Cookies, it is possible that some areas of our Site and Services that uses Cookies will not function properly when you view it and your online experience will be limited. HWTM uses Cookies to administer the Site and Services and to track user sessions. No Personal Information is stored. Our Services collect Personal Information under the following situations: (1) to the extent that you provide Information to us in an email message, order, or in your Profile; (2) to the extent that your web browser provides Information to our web server, like the site you linked from, the identity of your internet service provider, or the type of browser you are using; and (3) to the extent that you provide Personal Information to us in a CGI form.<br>

		<strong>Third Party Cookies, GIF Files and Beacons.</strong> Hostess With The Mostess and our third party advertisers and affiliates may use pixels, or transparent GIF files, to help manage online advertising.

The Cookie was placed by us, or by another advertiser who works with our ad management partner. With both Cookies and spotlight technology, the information that we collect and share is Anonymous Information, which may be shared in aggregate form, and it is not Personal Information and therefore does not contain such information as your name and email address.<br>
