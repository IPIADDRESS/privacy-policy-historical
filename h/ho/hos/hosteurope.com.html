  <h3><strong>Welcome to Host Europe GmbH!</strong></h3>
  <p>We are delighted you are visiting our website and thank you for your interest in our company and our first-class products, services, web pages and mobile apps (in summary: our “services”). Data protection and data security are very important to us with regard to the use of our website. We would therefore like to take this opportunity to inform you about the personal data we collect during your visit to our website and what we use this data for.</p>
  <p>We kindly ask you to routinely read this privacy policy as changes to legislation or our internal corporate processes can necessitate an adaptation of its content. You can call up, save and print out this privacy policy at any time under "Privacy Policy".</p>
  <br>

    <h4><strong>§ 1 Controller and scope</strong></h4>
    <p>
        The controller in the meaning of the EU General Data Protection Regulation (hereinafter: GDPR), other national data protection laws of member states and additional data protection regulations is: <br><br>
      Host Europe GmbH <br>
      Hansestrasse 111 <br>
      51149 Cologne <br>
      Germany<br>
      Tel.: +49 2233 99341040 <br>
      E-Mail: <a class="grey-click" href="mailto:info@hosteurope.de">info@hosteurope.de</a> <br>
      Website: <a class="grey-click" href="https://www.hosteurope.de">www.hosteurope.de</a>
    </p>
    <p>This privacy policy applies to the website(s) of Host Europe GmbH that is accessible via the domain <a class="grey-click" href="https://www.hosteurope.de">www.hosteurope.de</a> and various subdomains (hereinafter: “our website”).</p>
    <br>

    <h4><strong>§ 2 Data protection officer</strong></h4>
    <p>
        The controller’s external data protection officer is:<br><br>
        Dr. Karsten Kinast, LL.M. (Attorney) <br>

        D-50672 Cologne
    </p>
    <br>
    <h4><strong>§ 3 Principles of data processing</strong></h4>
    <p>The term personal data refers to all information that relates to an identified or identifiable natural person. It includes, for instance, information such as your name, age, address, telephone number, date of birth, email address, IP address and user behavior. Information that does not allow us to establish a connection to you as a person (or would only allow such a connection with an unreasonable amount of effort), for instance anonymized information, is not classed as personal data. Processing personal data (for instance collecting, querying, using, storing and transferring personal data) always requires a legal basis or your consent. Processed personal data is deleted as soon as the purpose for which it was collected is fulfilled and statutory retention periods no longer apply.</p>
    <p>Insofar as we process your personal data in order to provide specific services to you, the following serves to inform you of the concrete processes, the scope and the purpose of data processing, the legislation on which it is based and the duration of storage in each case.</p>
    <br>
    <h4><strong>§ 4 Individual processing activities</strong></h4>
      <p>
        <strong class="green">1. Website provision and use</strong> <br>
        <strong>a. Type and scope of data processing</strong>
      </p>
      <p>When you call up and visit our website, we collect personal data that your browser automatically sends to our server. This information is stored temporarily in a so-called log file. When you use our website, we collect the following data needed for technical reasons to display the website and guarantee its security and stability:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>IP address of the requesting computer</li>
        <li>Date and time of access</li>
        <li>Name of the URL and the requested file </li>
        <li>The website from which access was made (referrer URL)</li>
        <li>Your browser and possibly also your computer’s operating system as well as the name of your access provider</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>b. Legal basis</strong></p>
      <p>Art. 6 Para. 1 (f) GDPR serves as the legal basis for data processing activities detailed in the preceding. Processing the specified data is an essential part of making the website accessible and therefore serves a legitimate interest of our company.</p>
      <p><strong>c. Duration of storage</strong></p>
      <p>The specified data will be deleted as soon as it is no longer needed to display the website. Collecting the data is essential to making the website available; storing the data in log files is essential to operating the website. The user therefore has no option to object to collection and storage. In some cases data may be stored for other purposes if required by law.</p>
      <p>
        <strong class="green">2. Registration / User account</strong> <br>
        <strong>a. Type and scope of data processing</strong>

      <p>Our website offers you an option to register as a user by submitting your personal data. Your registration is required for the purpose of concluding a contract with us or for pre-contractual activities with regard to providing you with permanent access to the subscribed services.</p>
      <p>We use your processed data to create a personalized user account for you that you can use to access specific content and services such as webhosting, server, domains, SSL &amp; security, email &amp; office and homepage &amp; shop on our website.</p>
      <p>We process your email address so we can send you new login details should you happen to forget them.</p>
      <p>You can see in detail which personal data we process during registration from the following overview:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Name</li>

        <li>Payment information</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>b. Legal basis</strong></p>
      <p>Processing the preceding personal data serves the fulfillment of a contract between you and Host Europe GmbH or the implementation of pre-contractual activities in accordance with Art. 6 Para. 1 (b) GDPR.</p>
      <p>You can withdraw your consent to the use of your personal data at any time with future effect by sending an email to the email address detailed in clause 1 above or to the data protection officer (cf. clause 2 above).</p>
      <p><strong>c. Duration of storage</strong></p>
      <p>Processed data will be deleted as soon as it is no longer required for contract performance purposes. It may also be necessary to keep your personal data on record after the fulfillment of a contract to meet contractual or legal requirements. In some cases data may be stored for other purposes if required by law.</p>
      <p><strong>d. Cancelling registration</strong></p>
      <p>You can cancel your registration as a user at any time. You can also request changes to be made to your personal data on record. To do so, please use the link in your customer menu or contact us at <a class="grey-click" href="mailto:privacy@hosteurope.de">privacy@hosteurope.de</a>.</p>

The code deletes the last 8 bits of IP addresses so that your IP address is anonymized when it is collected (so-called IP masking). Google truncates and therefore anonymizes IP addresses in Member States of the European Union as well as in other countries that are party to the Agreement on the European Economic Area before they are sent to the USA. Only in exceptional cases is the full IP address sent to and truncated by a Google server in the USA.</p>
      <p><strong class="green">2. Google AdWords</strong></p>
      <p>We use “Google AdWords” technology in general and, in particular, conversion tracking. Google Conversion Tracking is an analysis service provided by Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA. Clicking on an advertisement placed by Google will install a conversion tracking cookie on your computer. These cookies are valid for 30 days and are not used for personal identification purposes. If you visit certain pages of our website while the cookie is still active, both Google and we can recognize that you clicked on a specific advertisement and were subsequently transferred to this website. Every Google AdWords customer is given a different cookie. It is therefore impossible to track cookies via the websites of AdWords customers.</p>
      <p>The data collected by conversion cookies serves to create conversion statistics for AdWords customers who use conversion tracking. Customers receive information on the number of users who clicked on their advertisement and were subsequently transferred to a website with a conversion tracking tag. However, they do not receive any information that would allow users to be personally identified.</p>
      <p>If you do not want to participate in conversion tracking, you can prevent this by adjusting your browser’s settings accordingly so that, for instance, setting cookies is generally prohibited. You can also deactivate conversion tracking cookies by adjusting your browser so that only cookies from “googleadservices.com” are blocked.</p>
      <p><strong class="green">3. Google Remarketing</strong></p>
      <p>We use “Google Remarketing” technology provided by Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA. Google Remarketing is used to show adverts to users who have already visited our web pages and online services and displayed an interest in a specific offering. This enables targeted, interest-based advertisements within Google’s advertisement network to be displayed on our website. Google Remarketing uses cookies for analysis purposes. They enable the recognition of our visitors as soon as they visit websites participating in Google’s advertising network. These cookies make it possible to display targeted, interest-based advertisements on the basis of websites in Google’s advertisement network that were previously visited by the user (and that also use Google Remarketing).</p>
      <p>If you do not wish to see any targeted, interest-based advertisements, you can deactivate Google’s use of cookies via this link: <a class="grey-click" href="https://www.google.de/settings/ads">https://www.google.de/settings/ads</a>.</p>
      <p><strong class="green">4. ZANOX</strong></p>

      <p>
        Bing Conversion Tracking from Microsoft Corporation, One Microsoft Way, Redmond, WA 98052- 6399, USA – can store a temporary cookie on your computer if you click on one of our adverts at Bing or on select websites of the Bing-network. Should you reach our website via such a conversion page, your clicking of the advert will be stored with us and Microsoft Bing. This enables us to create conversion-statistics, which means tracking how many users conduct and order after being referred to us via a conversion site.<br>
        More information and a possibility to prevent capturing of information of your website usage through Bing Ads and this being transferred to Microsoft can be found, in addition the the previously mentioned possibility of deactivating your tracking cookies, at the following link: <a class="grey-click" href="http://choice.microsoft.com/de">http://choice.microsoft.com/de</a>.

      <p>
        For increased security of some of our sites we use the service reCAPTCHA from Google Inc.

    <h4><strong>§ 8 Hyperlinks</strong></h4>
    <p>Our website contains so-called hyperlinks to websites operated by other providers. Activating a hyperlink will transfer you directly to the website of the corresponding provider. You can recognize the transfer by the change of URL, for example. We cannot accept any liability for the confidential use of your data on these websites as we have no influence on the compliance of these companies with data protection regulations. Please refer directly to the website concerned to obtain information on how your personal data is handled.</p>
    <h4><strong>§ 9 Right of access</strong></h4>
    <p>The GDPR stipulates that you as a data subject whose data is processed have the following rights:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Pursuant to Art. 15 GDPR, you can request information with regard to your personal data processed by us. In particular, you can request information in relation to the purposes of the processing; the categories of personal data concerned; the categories of recipients to whom the personal data has been or will be disclosed, including recipients in third countries or international organizations; the envisaged period for which the personal data will be stored; the existence of the right to request from us the rectification or erasure of your personal data or restriction of processing of your personal data or to object to such processing; the existence of the right to lodge a complaint; the source of your personal data to the extent that it was not collected by us; and the existence of automated decision-making, including profiling and any meaningful information about the particulars thereof.</li>
      <li>Pursuant to Art. 16 GDPR, you can demand the immediate correction of incorrect or incomplete personal data stored by us.</li>
      <li>Pursuant to Art. 17 GDPR, you have a right to request the erasure of your personal data stored by us insofar as processing is not required for the purpose of exercising the right of freedom of expression and information; for compliance with a legal obligation; for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in us; or for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims.</li>
      <li>Pursuant to Art. 18 GDPR, you have a right to restrict our use of your personal data if you contest the accuracy of the data; the processing is unlawful; we no longer need the personal data, but it is required by you for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims. Your right pursuant to Art. 18 GDPR remains unaffected if you have lodged an objection to data processing in accordance with Art. 21 GDPR.</li>
      <li>Pursuant to Art. 20 GDPR, you have the right to receive the personal data concerning you, which you have provided to us, in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format; you also have the right to have your data transmitted to another controller.</li>
      <li>Pursuant to Art. 7 Para. 3 GDPR, you have the right to withdraw previously granted consent at any time. Consequentially, we will not be permitted to continue processing your data on the basis of your consent in the future.</li>
      <li>Pursuant to Art. 77 GDPR, you have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority. You can contact the supervisory authority of the Member State of your habitual residence, place of work or place of the alleged infringement.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4><strong>§ 10 Right to Object</strong></h4>
    <p>In relation to the processing of your personal data on the basis of legitimate interests in accordance with Art. 6 Para. 1 p. 1 (f) GDPR, you have the right pursuant to Art. 21 GDPR to object to your data being processed on grounds relating to your particular situation or if your objection concerns direct marketing. With regard to direct marketing, you have a general right to object without providing a specific reason and we are required to take appropriate action.</p>
    <h4><strong>§ 11 Data safety and security measures</strong></h4>
    <p>We undertake to protect your privacy and to treat your personal data confidentially. We have implemented extensive technological and organizational measures to prevent the manipulation, loss or misuse of your personal data stored on our servers. These measures are routinely reviewed and adapted to reflect technological developments. They include the use of acknowledged encryption methods (SSL or TLS).</p>  
    <p>Please note, however, that the structure of the internet makes it possible for persons and institutions outside of our sphere of control to disregard data protection regulations and the security measures detailed in the preceding. In particular, data that is transmitted without prior encryption – for instance by email – can be read by third parties. We have no technological influence in this regard. It is the user’s responsibility to protect the data provided by them from misuse by way of encryption or other suitable means.</p>
