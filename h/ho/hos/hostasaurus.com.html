									<dd><p>When you visit our web site, our web server collects basic user information about you that includes your computer's current address, the time you accessed our web site, and the files on our site that you retrieved.
									</p><p>
									On some of our web pages, we may use cookies to add features not otherwise possible.  Cookies are small pieces of information that a web site can store in a designated file on your computer. Cookies allow our web site, and pages on it, to respond to you as an individual.

									The Hostasaurus.Com web server does not collect your e-mail address or any other personal information such as what other pages on the Internet you have accessed or visited.
									</p><p></p></dd>
									<dt>How do we use this information?</dt>
									<dd><p>The basic information we do collect is used to help us analyze where our visitors come from and which pages on our site are accessed the most.  Cookies may be used to facilitate your customer interaction with us.  For example, if you log in to a password protected page on our site, a cookie may be set on your computer so you will not have to enter your password the next time you visit.  When this does happen, you will always have a way of erasing that cookie if you do not want it set.
