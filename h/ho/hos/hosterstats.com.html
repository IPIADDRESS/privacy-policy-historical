<h3>Log Files</h3>
<p>
As with most other websites, we collect and use the data contained in
log files.  The information in the log files include  your IP (internet
protocol) address, your ISP (internet service provider, such as Eircom.net,
Imagine.ie, Digiweb.ie, NTL.ie etc), the browser you used to visit our site (such as Internet Explorer or
Firefox), the time you visited our site and which pages you visited
throughout our site. We use this data to estimate hardware and bandwith requirements
only. We do not sell this data.</p>

<h3>Cookies and Web Beacons</h3>
   
<p>We also use third party advertisements on HosterStats.com to support our site. 
Some of these advertisers may use technology such as cookies and web beacons
when they advertise on our site, which will also send these advertisers
(such as Google through the Google AdSense program) information including
your IP address, your ISP , the browser you used to visit our site, and in
some cases, whether you have Flash installed.  This is generally used for
geotargeting purposes (showing Dublin property ads to someone in Dublin, for example) 
or showing certain ads based on specific sites visited
(such as showing cooking ads to someone who frequents cooking sites).</p>

<p>You can chose to disable or selectively turn off cookies or third-party
cookies in your browser settings, or by managing preferences in programs
such as Norton Internet Security.  However, this can affect how you are able
to interact with other websites that use cookies.  This could include the
inability to login to services or programs, such as logging into forums or
accounts.</p>

<h3>DoubleClick DART cookies</h3>
<p>
We also may use DART cookies for ad serving through Google's DoubleClick,
which places a cookie on your computer when you are browsing the web and
visit a site using DoubleClick advertising (including some Google AdSense
advertisements).  This cookie is used to serve ads specific to you and your
interests ('interest based targeting').  The ads served will be targeted
based on your previous browsing history (For example, if you have been
viewing sites about visiting Dublin, you may see Dublin hotel
advertisements when viewing a non-related site, such as on a site about
hockey).  DART uses ?non personally identifiable information?.  It does NOT
track personal information about you, such as your name, email address,
physical address, telephone number, social security numbers, bank account
numbers or credit card numbers.  You can opt-out of this ad serving on all
sites using this advertising by visiting

</p>

<p>You can chose to disable or selectively turn off our cookies or third-party
cookies in your browser settings, or by managing preferences in programs
such as Norton Internet Security.  However, this can affect how you are able
to interact with our site as well as other websites.  This could include the
inability to login to services or programs, such as logging into forums or
accounts.</p>

<p>Deleting cookies does not mean you are permanently opted out of any
advertising program.  Unless you have settings that disallow cookies, the
next time you visit a site running the advertisements, a new cookie will be
added.</p>

<p>HosterStats.com uses Google Analytics to provide its website usage
statistics.</p>
