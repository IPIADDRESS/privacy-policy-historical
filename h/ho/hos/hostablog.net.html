<h1 class="post-title">Privacy Policy</h1>

<div class="post-content">
<p>Your privacy is critically important to us. At Palladium we have a few fundamental principles:</p>
<ul>
<li>We don�t ask you for personal information unless we truly need it.  (We can�t stand services that ask you for things like your gender or income level for no apparent reason.)</li>
<li>We don�t share your personal information with anyone except to  comply with the law, develop our products, or protect our rights.</li>
<li>We don�t store personal information on our servers unless required  for the on-going operation of one of our services.</li>
<li>In our blogging products, we aim to make it as simple as possible  for you to control what�s visible to the public, seen by search engines,  kept private, and permanently deleted.</li>
</ul>
<p>Below is our privacy policy which incorporates these goals:</p>
<p>Palladium Hosting (�<strong>Palladium</strong>�) operates several  websites including <a href="http://www.Palladiumhosting.net">palladiumhosting.net</a> and  <a href="http://www.hostablog.net">hostablog.net</a>. It is Palladium�s  policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect  while operating our websites.</p>
<h3>Website Visitors</h3>
<p>Like most website operators, Palladium collects  non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and  servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language  preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor  request. Palladium�s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying  information is to better understand how Palladium�s visitors use its  website. From time to time, Palladium may release  non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by  publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.</p>
<p>Palladium also collects potentially personally-identifying  information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. Palladium does not  use such information to identify its visitors, however, and does not  disclose such information, other than under the same circumstances that  it uses and discloses personally-identifying information, as described  below.</p>
<h3>Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</h3>
<p>Certain visitors to Palladium�s websites choose to interact with Palladium in ways that require Palladium to gather  personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information  that Palladium gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For  example, we ask visitors who sign up for a blog at <a href="http://www.hostablog.net">hostablog.net</a> to provide a username  and email address. Those who engage in transactions with Palladium �  by purchasing web hosting service, for  example � are asked to provide additional information, including as  necessary the personal and financial information required to process  those transactions. In each case, Palladium collects such information  only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of  the visitor�s interaction with Palladium. Palladium does not disclose  personally-identifying information other than as described below. And  visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information,  with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain  website-related activities.</p>
<h3>Aggregated Statistics</h3>
<p>Palladium may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to  its websites. For instance, Palladium may monitor the most popular  blogs on the Hostablog.net site or use spam screened by the Akismet  service to help identify spam. Palladium may display this information  publicly or provide it to others. However, Palladium does not disclose  personally-identifying information other than as described below.</p>
<h3>Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information</h3>
<p>Palladium discloses potentially personally-identifying and  personally-identifying information only to those of its employees,  contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that  information in order to process it on Palladium�s behalf or to provide  services available at Palladium�s websites, and (ii) that have agreed  not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and  affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by  using Palladium�s websites, you consent to the transfer of such  information to them. Palladium will not rent or sell potentially  personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone.  Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations,  as described above, Palladium discloses potentially  personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only when  required to do so by law, or when Palladium believes in good faith that  disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Palladium, third parties or the public at large. If you are a  registered user of an Palladium website and have supplied your email  address, Palladium may occasionally send you an email to tell you about  new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with  what�s going on with Palladium and our products. We primarily use our  various product blogs to communicate this type of information, so we  expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If you send us a request  (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback  mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us  clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. Palladium takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against  the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially  personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.</p>
<h3>Cookies</h3>
<p>A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a  visitor�s computer, and that the visitor�s browser provides to the  website each time the visitor returns. Palladium uses cookies to help Palladium identify and track visitors, their usage of Palladium  website, and their website access preferences. Palladium visitors who  do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their  browsers to refuse cookies before using Palladium�s websites, with the  drawback that certain features of Palladium�s websites may not function  properly without the aid of cookies.</p>
<h3>Ads</h3>
<p>Ads appearing on any of our websites may be delivered to users by  advertising partners, who may set cookies. These cookies allow the ad  server to recognize your computer each time they send you an online  advertisement to compile information about you or others who use your  computer. This information allows ad networks to, among other things,  deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most  interest to you. This Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies by Palladium and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.</p>
<h3>Comments</h3>
<p>Comments and other content submitted to our Akismet anti-spam service  are not saved on our servers unless they were marked as false  positives, in which case we store them long enough to use them to  improve the service to avoid future false positives.</p>
<h3>Privacy Policy Changes</h3>
<p>Although most changes are likely to be minor, Palladium may change  its Privacy Policy from time to time, and in Palladium�s sole  discretion. Palladium encourages visitors to frequently check this page  for any changes to its Privacy Policy. If you have a Hostablog.net  account, you should also check your blog�s dashboard for alerts to these  changes. Your continued use of this site after any change in this  Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such change.</p>
