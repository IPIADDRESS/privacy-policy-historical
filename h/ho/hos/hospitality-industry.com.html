Some cookies used by Hospitality-Industry.com.com may remain on the user's computer after they leave the Web site, but the majority is set to expire within 30 - 365 days. (As discussed in more detail below, you can set your browser to alert you to cookies being placed, in which case a prompt screen will describe information about the cookie, its duration, and the server to which it is being returned.) There may be some cookies on certain tools that are of longer duration. Cookies may also be of benefit to you by creating a more streamlined login process, keeping track of shopping cart additions and preserving order information between sessions. In the future, as we enable further customization of the site, cookies will help in assuring that information provided to you will be the most relevant to your needs.<br>
          <br>
              While we do not offer an opt-out on the site for cookies, browsers provide you with information and control over cookies. You can set your Web browser to alert you when a cookie is being used. You can also get information on the duration of the cookie and what server your data is being returned to. You then have the opportunity to accept or reject the cookie. Additionally, you can set your browser to refuse all cookies or accept only cookies returned to the originating servers. Users can generally disable the cookie feature on their browser without affecting their ability to use the site, except in some cases where cookies are used as an essential security feature necessary for transaction completion.<br> 
              <br>
              <strong>Embedded URLs:</strong> In order to provide maximum site utility, Hospitality-Industry.com also uses a tracking technique that uses embedded URLs to allow use of the site without cookies. Embedded URLs manifest themselves as plain text or encoded extensions to the URL that appears in the browser address or location toolbar. This technology allows limited information to follow you as you navigate the site, but is not identified to personal data and is not used beyond the session. While this increases your ability to surf the site, it does not replace the functionality or streamlining of cookies and may limit your use of many convenience features offered by the site. <br>
              <br>
              <strong>Embedded Pixels:</strong> In an effort to provide users with the most relevant Web site content and marketing materials, we may also use embedded pixel technologies to help track site usage and marketing campaign responsiveness. On the Web site, these technologies are used on selected pages for the purposes of identifying unique user visits as opposed to aggregate hits. The site usage information collected by these technologies is associated with cookies and may provide data about site use by registered users of www.Hospitality-Industry.com.com Web sites. This information is used to evaluate site content, navigability and composition as well as page response rates. When these technologies are used in emails, they provide information on when the email was opened.<br>

              <span class="heading1">3. The Data We Collect and How We Use It </span><br>
              Hospitality-Industry.com collects data from users for the following purposes:<br> 
              <br>
              <strong>As a result of your site navigation:</strong> Data may be collected to help personalize Web site content and enable navigation that is most relevant and user friendly. <br>
              <br>
              <strong>As a result of creating an Hospitality-Industry.com.com account and filling out forms.</strong> Data provided by you during these processes may be used to target future marketing communications that meet your needs and requirements, personalize Web site content and enable navigation that is most relevant and user friendly. <br>
              <br>
              <strong>As a result of your joining an Hospitality-Industry.com community, such as the Hospitality-Industry.com Forum. </strong>Information collected during this process may be used to provide relevant product alerts and updates. These updates are related to product releases, prices, terms, special offers and associated marketing campaigns. This data is sent out as part of the program member signing up for the relevant program or online account. <br>
              <br>
              <strong>As a result of your inquiry or request for information.</strong> Data collected as a result of your inquiry, registration for newsletters, response to marketing campaigns and other such activities may be used to respond to your inquiry, provide information requested and target future marketing communications. <br>
              <br>
              <strong>As a result of your engagement in transactions or communications. </strong>Information may be collected and stored as part of the transaction history. The majority of the data collected under this category is business contact information. Hospitality-Industry.com may need to share some of this data (address, payment) with delivery services, credit card clearing houses and other similarly situated third parties that are required to accomplish the transaction.<br> 
              <br>
              <strong>As a result of referral "tell a friend" functions.</strong> If a user elects to use our referral service for informing a friend about our site, we ask them for the friend's name and email address. Hospitality-Industry.com will automatically send the friend a one-time email inviting them to visit the site. Hospitality-Industry.com uses this data for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email and tracking the success of our referral program. The friend may contact Hospitality-Industry.com at <u>privacy (at) hospitality-industry.com</u> to be removed from the referral program. <br>
              <br>
              <strong>As a result of your participation in interactive discussions, public forums &amp; reviews systems.</strong> There are parts of the Web site that permit you to participate in interactive discussions. Some of these are moderated; all are subject to access for technical reasons. Hospitality-Industry.com does not control the content that users post and some may serve as public discussion forums. As in any interactive forum open to many users, you should carefully consider whether you wish to submit data and should tailor any other content submitted appropriately. <br>
              <br>
              <strong>As a result of legal requirements.</strong> Hospitality-Industry.com may be required to provide data to comply with legally mandated reporting, disclosure or other legal process requirements. <br>
              <br>
              <span class="heading1">4.Customization, Preferences and Opt-Out </span><br>
              Establishing an online registration profile at Hospitality-Industry.com.com allows visitors the ability to opt in (or out) of communities and provides them with control over their preferences for electronic information delivery. <br>
              <br>
              <strong>Communications Choices.</strong> Hospitality-Industry.com recognizes that users may not wish to be contacted about new or related products. Hospitality-Industry.com.com allows you to opt out of some, or all, email marketing that may result from use of the site. These choices are established and modified via your online registration profile. A link to this profile will be available in marketing emails. You can return to the registration profile at any time to change your elections or modify your profile at <a href="http://www.hospitality-industry.com/index.php/member/login/">http://www.hospitality-industry.com/index.php/member/login/</a> or you can send an email to our general unsubscribe automated link at <u>unsubscribe (at) hospitality-industry.com</u>. If you have any problems in using any of these opt-out mechanisms, please send an email to <u>privacy (at) hospitality-industry.com</u>, indicate opt-out in the subject line and specify what problem you have encountered in the body of the message. <br>
              <br>
              <strong>Third Party Permission-Based Lists.</strong> On occasion, Hospitality-Industry.com may use a third party permission-based list to send communications about Hospitality-Industry.com products and services. These are lists maintained by third parties whose users have consented to receive emails from other companies, such as Hospitality-Industry.com. We do not have access to the names and contact information on these lists; the third party that has the direct relationship with these users maintains the list and the opt-outs, removes, and unsubscribes. We require the list owners to identify themselves as the mailers of the email and to provide appropriate opt-out mechanisms. If you wish to be removed from a third-party list, you should direct your opt-out request to the list owner, not to Hospitality-Industry.com. Nevertheless, if you have trouble opting out, or if you wish to make us aware of any issues related to a third-party mailing, you may contact us directly at <u>privacy (at) hospitality-industry.com</u>. When third-party mailings are sent with an Hospitality-Industry.com reply address, Hospitality-Industry.com also will provide a notice with information about how to opt-out of future Hospitality-Industry.com marketing communications. <br>
              <br>
              Please contact us at <u>privacy (at) hospitality-industry.com</u> if you believe you have mistakenly received information after opting out or if you would like to opt out of receiving information and have been unable to use the opt-out mechanisms provided. <br>
              <br>
              <span class="heading1">5. Access </span><br>
              Hospitality-Industry.com has provided you the ability to create an account or profile of information. We maintain the data and allow you to update it at any time. To change this information, please login as usual and follow the prompts to "update my profile." We continue to work to increase the scope of information that you may access and update. Please contact us at <u>privacy (at) hospitality-industry.com</u> should you require further assistance concerning your information or if you have trouble accessing your profile; please indicate access in the subject line and let us know what the access problem is in the body of the message. <br>
              <br>
              <span class="heading1">6. Security </span><br>
              Hospitality-Industry.com is concerned with the security of the data we have collected and has in place reasonable measures to prevent unauthorized access to that information. These measures include policies, procedures, and technical elements relating to data access controls. In addition, Hospitality-Industry.com uses standard security protocols and mechanisms to exchange the transmission of sensitive data such as credit card details. <br>
              <br>
              <span class="heading1">7. Policy Updates </span><br>
              If we are going to use your data in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection, we will notify you via email. You will have a choice as to whether or not we use your data in this different manner. In addition, if we make any material changes in our privacy practices that do not affect user data already stored in our database, we will notify you by email or post a prominent notice on this Web site notifying users of the change. In some cases where we post the notice we will also email users who have opted to receive communications from us, notifying them of the changes in our privacy practices. <br>
              <br>
              We may update this policy from time to time to describe how new site features affect our use of your data and to let you know of new control and preference features that we provide you.
