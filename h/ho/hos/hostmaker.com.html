You'll need a passion for growth, attention to detail and be great at getting things done in tight timeframes.\n\nOpening these markets requires a high level of experience (ideally local!) and pragmatism - no job too big and no job too small. If you've launched businesses or new markets before, especially in the Hospitality sector or across Sales/Account Management or Operations, we'd love to hear from you.\n\nThe results? You'll see a business open and grow in a matter of weeks - with us bringing the best of Hostmaker's global skills in guest and home services, plus our technology to support you.

It all depends on your preferences, your property and what your financial goals are. <br /><br />But which is right for you? Let's look at each Hostmaker pricing plan together and why clients choose\nEssential, Handsfree or Plus:<br />\n<ul type=\"square\">\n<li>The Hostmaker Essential plan is great for landlords who enjoy the hosting experience but need a more experienced hand at making the most out of their property. Typically, we see clients who are available to manage logistics themselves or have help on the ground. Our listing, pricing and reservations expertise ensures that we bring a confirmed guest into their property’s calendar at the best price. Our talented sales experts can help to understand if this is the right one for you. </li>\n<li>The <strong>Hostmaker Handsfree</strong> plan is our most popular, and is widely preferred by the majority of our clients, from homeowners to overseas property owners. It's also our original solution, so we've been doing it for years! Plus, since our management fee is based on how much revenue we earn for you, you know that we will do our best to maximise your earnings.</li>\n<li>The <strong>Hostmaker Plus</strong> plan is our solution for homeowners or overseas property owners who want just a little bit extra in terms of services to make the most of their home. Typically, as part of this package, we do in-person check-ins for every single guest whereas in Handsfree we do check-ins via smart locks or lockboxes since.

In a nutshell: our clients achieve an average of 30% more rental income, while respecting the 90-day regulation, thanks to flexible lettings.Our unique solution mixing short, medium and long term lets allows us to find the perfect guests or tenants for your property. For instance, during the high touristic season over the summer or New Year's Eve, we will make the most of short lets, while in between, we will switch to medium and long lets. This way, we maximise your rental income all year round, earning you up to 30% more than traditional lettings solutions, wile respecting the 90-day regulation in London. <br /><br />\nFrom a safety perspective, we have put measures in place to ensure that only the right kind of guests are welcomed into your home, helping to minimise any risk of property damage. Our in-house teams have guest vetting procedures and technology built in and we require guests to provide government-verified ID upon arrival.

Typically, we see clients who are available to manage logistics themselves or have help on the ground. Our listing, pricing and reservations expertise ensures that we bring a confirmed guest into their property’s calendar at the best price. Our talented sales experts can help to understand if this is the right one for you.</li><li>The <strong>Hostmaker Handsfree</strong> plan is our most popular, and is widely preferred by the majority of our clients, from homeowners to overseas property owners. It's also our original solution, so we've been doing it for years! Plus, since our management fee is based on how much revenue we earn for you, you know that we will do our best to maximise your earnings.</li><li>The <strong>Hostmaker Plus</strong> plan is our solution for homeowners or overseas property owners who want just a little bit extra in terms of services to make the most of their home.

This way, we maximise your rental income all year round, earning you up to 30% more than traditional lettings solutions, while respecting the 90-day regulation in London.<br><br>From a safety perspective, we have put measures in place to ensure that only the right kind of guests are welcomed into your home, helping to minimise any risk of property damage.

Let's look at each Hostmaker pricing plan together and why clients choose\nEssential, Handsfree or Plus:<br />\n<ul type=\"square\">\n<li>The Hostmaker Essential plan is great for landlords who enjoy the hosting experience but need a more experienced hand at making the most out of their property. Typically, we see clients who are available to manage logistics themselves or have help on the ground. Our listing, pricing and reservations expertise ensures that we bring a confirmed guest into their property’s calendar at the best price. Our talented sales experts can help to understand if this is the right one for you. </li>\n<li>The <strong>Hostmaker Handsfree</strong> plan is our most popular, and is widely preferred by the majority of our clients, from homeowners to overseas property owners. It's also our original solution, so we've been doing it for years! Plus, since our management fee is based on how much revenue we earn for you, you know that we will do our best to maximise your earnings.</li>\n<li>The <strong>Hostmaker Plus</strong> plan is our solution for homeowners or overseas property owners who want just a little bit extra in terms of services to make the most of their home. Typically, as part of this package, we do in-person check-ins for every single guest whereas in Handsfree we do check-ins via smart locks or lockboxes since.

For instance, during the high touristic season over the summer or New Year's Eve, we will make the most of short lets, while in between, we will switch to medium and long lets. This way, we maximise your rental income all year round, earning you up to 30% more than traditional lettings solutions, wile respecting the 90-day regulation in London. <br /><br />\nFrom a safety perspective, we have put measures in place to ensure that only the right kind of guests are welcomed into your home, helping to minimise any risk of property damage. Our in-house teams have guest vetting procedures and technology built in and we require guests to provide government-verified ID upon arrival.

Let's look at each Hostmaker pricing plan together and why clients choose Essential, Handsfree or Plus: <br><ul type=\"square\"><li>The Hostmaker Essential plan is great for landlords who enjoy the hosting experience but need a more experienced hand at making the most out of their property. Typically, we see clients who are available to manage logistics themselves or have help on the ground. Our listing, pricing and reservations expertise ensures that we bring a confirmed guest into their property’s calendar at the best price. Our talented sales experts can help to understand if this is the right one for you.</li><li>The <strong>Hostmaker Handsfree</strong> plan is our most popular, and is widely preferred by the majority of our clients, from homeowners to overseas property owners. It's also our original solution, so we've been doing it for years! Plus, since our management fee is based on how much revenue we earn for you, you know that we will do our best to maximise your earnings.</li><li>The <strong>Hostmaker Plus</strong> plan is our solution for homeowners or overseas property owners who want just a little bit extra in terms of services to make the most of their home. Typically, as part of this package, we do in-person check-ins for every single guest whereas in Handsfree we do check-ins via smart locks or lockboxes since .

In a nutshell: our clients achieve an average of 30% more rental income, while respecting the 90-day regulation, thanks to flexible lettings.

For instance, during the high tourist seasons over Easter, summer, school holidays or New Year's Eve, we will make the most of short lets, while in between, we will switch to medium or long lets. This way, we maximise your rental income all year round, earning you up to 30% more than traditional lettings solutions, while respecting the 90-day regulation in London.<br><br>From a safety perspective, we have put measures in place to ensure that only the right kind of guests are welcomed into your home, helping to minimise any risk of property damage. Our in-house teams have guest vetting procedures and technology built in and we require guests to provide government-verified ID upon arrival.
