However, you always have the opportunity to remove your consent to such use by sending an email to [ <a href="mailto:info@holymoly.com">info@holymoly.com</a> ] with your request;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>- We may on occasion combine information we receive online with other records to enhance our ability to notify you of our products and services that we think will be of interest to you. If you do not want to receive these notifications please send an e-mail to [ <a href="mailto:info@holymoly.com">info@holymoly.com</a> ] letting us know.</p>

We may occasionally contact you about products and services we feel may be of interest to you. This will only come from us (or our agents) and only if you have indicated that you do not object to these offers.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p><strong>With whom is the information shared?</strong></p>
            <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>At times, Holy Moly may enter into co-branding arrangements with other reputable organisations, with whom your personal information may be shared. You can, however, tell us not to do so at any time, by sending an e-mail message to [ <a href="mailto:info@holymoly.com">info@holymoly.com</a> ] letting us know.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Holy Moly may disclose your personal information to business partners or sponsors, but this is specifically described to you prior to collecting the data or prior to transferring it.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Holy Moly may disclose aggregate statistics about our site visitors, clients and sales in order to describe our services to prospective partners, advertisers and other reputable third parties and for other lawful purposes, but these statistics will include no personally identifying information.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Holy Moly may disclose personal information if required to do so by law or if it believes that such action is necessary to protect and defend the rights, property or personal safety of Holy Moly, the site or its visitors.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>The Site contains links to other sites. Holy Moly is not responsible for the privacy policies or the content of such sites.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p><strong>Security</strong></p>
            <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Holy Moly places a great importance on the security of all personally identifiable information associated with visitors to the Site. We have security measures in place to attempt to protect against the loss, misuse and alteration of visitor data under our control. For example, our security and privacy policies are periodically reviewed and enhanced as necessary and only authorised personnel have access to user information. While we cannot ensure or guarantee that loss, misuse or alteration of data will not occur, we use our best efforts to prevent this.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p><strong>Use of cookies</strong></p>
            <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Cookies are pieces of information that a website transfers to your hard drive to store and sometimes track information about you. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but if you prefer, you can change your browser to prevent that. However, you may not be able to take full advantage of a website if you do so. Cookies are specific to the server that created them and cannot be accessed by other servers, which means they cannot be used to track your movements around the web. Although they do identify a user's computer, cookies do not personally identify users and passwords and credit card information are not stored in cookies.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>We may use cookies to:</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>-&nbsp;identify who you are and to access your account information;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>-&nbsp;estimate our audience size and patterns;</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>-&nbsp;control how often visitors see similar ads; and</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>-&nbsp;track preferences and to improve and update our Site.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>For more information on cookies and how to disable them you can consult the information provided by the Interactive Advertising Bureau UK at <a href="http://www.allaboutcookies.org/" target="_blank">http://www.allaboutcookies.org/</a></p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p><strong>Limitation of Liability</strong></p>
            <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>The Site may contain links to other sites where information practices may be different to ours. For example, if you "click" on a link, the "click" may take you off the Site. Visitors should consult the other sites' privacy notices as we are not responsible for and have no control over information that is submitted to, or collected by, these third parties.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>We sometimes may offer content (e.g., competitions, sweepstakes, or promotions) sponsored by or co branded with identified third parties. By virtue of these relationships, the third parties may obtain personally identifiable information that you voluntarily submit to participate in the site activity. We are not responsible for and have no control over these third parties' use of this information. However, we will notify you at the time of requesting personally identifiable information if these third parties will obtain such information.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>We may use a reputable third party to present or serve the advertisements that you may see at the Site. This Privacy Policy does not cover any use of information that a third-party ad server may have collected from you.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p><strong>Where is the information stored?</strong></p>
            <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Information which you submit via the Site is sent to a computer located in the United Kingdom. Information submitted by you may be transferred by us to our other offices and to other reputable third party organisations, which may be situated outside the European Economic Area.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>In addition if you use our services while you are outside the EEA, your information may be transferred outside the EEA in order to provide you with those services.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p><strong>Keeping our records accurate</strong></p>
            <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>We are not responsible nor will be liable to you in any way for events beyond our direct control. Because of the complex and constantly changing nature of our technology and business, we cannot guarantee nor do we represent that Holy Moly will be error free, and to the maximum extent permitted by law we will not be liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, consequential or punitive damages or other loss suffered by you and relating to the use or release of your personal information.</p>

            <p>The Site is not intended for or directed to persons under the age of 18. Any person who provides their personal information to us through any part of the Site must be 18 years of age or older.
