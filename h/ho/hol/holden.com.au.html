					    <br>
			                    Holden respects the rights of individuals to determine to whom they give their personal information and how this information is used. Holden collects and uses your information in order to provide better customer service by striving to meet your needs and expectations about our cars and other products. We will not sell your information to any other organisation.
			                    <br><br>
			                   We will be fair and open about the way we collect information about you and what we intend to do with the information. We share information about you with our affiliated companies and related companies, like General Motors, Daewoo and contracted service providers, as well as dealers to assist them to improve the quality and standard of service they provide to you. We also provide information to industry bodies and others for the purposes of audits of our records. Our Dealers, affiliated companies and related companies share information with us about you so that we can learn more about your expectations of us and how we can meet them. Where practicable, we will collect personal information directly from you. If we receive information about you from someone else or provide information to someone else about you, like our Dealers or contractors providing services to us, wherever possible we will make sure they comply with the Privacy Act.
					    <br>
			                    <br>
			                    We will be open with you about the kinds of personal information we hold and what we do with it. We will strive to ensure that information about you is accurate when we collect or use it. Wherever possible and appropriate we will let you see the information we hold about you and correct it if it is wrong. If we do not grant you access to your personal information we will tell you why.
								<br>
			                    <br>
			                    We will keep your information secure. Only properly authorised people are permitted to see or use it. We will take steps to protect your privacy if we send personal information about you outside Australia.
								<br>
			                    <br>
			                    When we no longer use your information we will take care to properly de-identify it or destroy it.

			                    <br>
			                    If you are unhappy with the way we have collected, used or shared your information we will investigate and respond to your complaint.

								<br><br>
								<i>(a)Holden's use and disclosure of personal information</i>
								<br>
			                    <br>
								<b>Warranty</b>
								<br>
			                    <br>
								As part of the purchase of your new Holden vehicle, you usually obtain Holden's new vehicle warranty. Holden collects personal information from your Holden dealer when you purchase your new vehicle so that Holden can ensure that any warranty claim is properly administered.
								<br>
			                    <br>
								If you withdraw your consent to Holden collecting your personal information from your dealer for this purpose, this will affect Holden's ability to process your warranty claims.
			                    <br>
			                    <br>
			                    <b>Product Recalls</b>
								<br>
			                    <br>
								Holden collects personal information from your Holden Dealer when you purchase your new vehicle so that Holden can ensure that you are contacted as soon as possible in the event of a safety related product recall.
			                    <br>
			                    <br>
								<b>Holden Assist/Roadside Assistance/Extended Warranty</b>
			                    <br>
			                    <br>
								Holden engages contractors to provide Holden Assist, Holden Roadside Assistance and Holden's Extended Vehicle Warranty. Holden's agreements with these contractors require them to deal with your personal information in accordance with the Privacy Act. Holden Assist, Holden Roadside Assistance and Holden Extended Vehicle Warranty brochures provide you with more information about these services.
			                    <br>
			                    <br>
								If you withdraw your consent to Holden disclosing your personal information to these contractors, this will affect Holden's ability to deliver these services to you.
			                    <br>
			                    <br>
								<b>GM Holden MasterCard</b>
			                    <br>
			                    <br>
								The GM Holden MasterCard is offered and administered by Westpac Banking Corporation. Westpac collects personal information from applicants and card holders and participating organisations, and discloses some of this information to Holden for the purposes of ensuring that card holders are able to claim their GM Holden MasterCard rebate when purchasing an eligible Holden vehicle.  Please also see <i>"(c) How is my personal information used?"</i> below for further details.
			                    <br>
			                    <br>
								If you withdraw your consent to Holden obtaining this information from Westpac, you will
								not be able to claim your GM Holden MasterCard rebate because Holden will be unable to collect
								or verify your entitlement to a rebate.
			                    <br>
			                    <br>
								<b>Customer and Product Surveys</b>
			                    <br>
			                    <br>
								From time to time Holden surveys its customers regarding their satisfaction with 						Holden's products and services and the products and services provided by its Dealers 						and contracted services providers, such as Roadside Assistance.
			                    <br>
			                    <br>
								If you do not wish to participate in any survey received from Holden, please contact Holden's
								Customer Assistance on 1800 033 349 or email us at
								<a href="mailto:customerassistance.holden@gm.com">customerassistance.holden@gm.com</a>.
								Holden will note your request and respect
								your wish not to receive any future surveys.
			                    <br>
			                    <br>
								If you choose not to participate in surveys conducted by Holden, Holden is less able 					to improve its products and services and the products and services provided by its 					Dealers and contracted service providers.

			  					<b>Event Data Recorders</b>
			  					<br>
			  					<br>
			  					Holden vehicles, like other modern motor vehicles, have a number of sophisticated computer systems that
			  					monitor and control several aspects of the vehicle's performance. Holden vehicles use on-board vehicle
			  					computers to monitor emission control components to optimize fuel economy, to monitor conditions for air
			  					bag deployment and, if so equipped, to provide anti-lock braking and to help the driver control the
			  					vehicle in difficult driving situations. Some information may be stored during regular operations to facilitate
			  					repair of detected malfunctions; other information is stored only in certain collision events by computer systems,
			  					such as those commonly called event data recorders (EDR). The information from EDR's, if available, is used to
			  					improve customer and driver safety, better understand what happens to our vehicles in the event of a collision
			  					and shall be provided to the police on request.
			                    <br>

								<b>Recruitment</b>
			                    <br>

								If you send Holden an application for a job or resume, Holden will use this information to assess your
								application and may disclose this information to its related companies (both in Australia and
								overseas) and contracted service providers for purposes such as aptitude, psychological and
								medical testing and human resources management activities. As part of the application process

								<br>
			                    <br>
								<i>(a) What kind of information does Holden collect?</i>
								<br>
								When you look at any of Holden's Websites, our internet service provider logs the following information for statistical purposes:
								<font color="ff0000">
								<br>- your server address
								<br>- your top level domain name (eg. .com, .org, .net, .au, etc.)
								<br>- the date and time of your visit
								<br>- the type of browser you are using

								<br>
								PLEASE NOTE: Holden does not provide facilities for the safe transmission of information across the Internet. You should be aware that there are inherent risks in transmitting information across the Internet.
								<br>
			                    <br>
								<i>(b) Do I have to provide personal information?</i>
								<br>
								No. You can visit Holden's Websites as a guest while remaining anonymous by not providing any personal
								information to us. Although, without this information, you will not be able to fully access all of the
								features and functionality of the site. However, our servers automatically collect some limited
								information about your visit that is not personally identifiable to you (see question (a)).
								<br>
			                    <br>
								Holden sometimes uses "cookies" to track and record your preferences and activity on our Website.
								Cookies are small bits of data that are sent to your browser and stored on your computer's hard drive.
								Your cookie may be set at various times during your interaction with our Website. It is updated from
								time to time as you access the many different portions of our Website. Each time you access our site,
								our server may deliver certain customised information to you based on the data stored in your cookie.
								Wherever Holden collects personal information, we make an effort to include a link to this Privacy
								Policy on that page.
								<br>
			                    <br>
								<i>(c) How is my personal information used?</i>
								<br>
								Holden's goal in collecting personal information is to provide you, the user, with a customised
								experience on our Website. Our site uses various forms for gathering information when applicable.
								Registration, survey and competition forms all, to some extent, require input of personal information.
								These forms require users to give us contact information (like name and email address), demographic
								information (like post code, age, or income level), and other applicable information. This information
								is used to send out prizes to contest winners, to contact the visitor when necessary, to send out
								information about Holden or its products or Websites that may be of interest to you, and to respond to
								your queries.
								<br>
			                    <br>
								We may also use the information to estimate the size of our audience and measure certain traffic
								patterns, to track the progress and number of entries in our promotions and contests, to track visits
								to linked sites, to notify our visitors about updates to our Website, and to contact you for marketing
								purposes and provide you with information regarding special events sponsored by Holden.
								<br>
			                    <br>

								If you ever receive a type of communication that you would not like to receive, you will have the
								option to unsubscribe from such communication (usually at the bottom of the page).
								<br>Holden does not sell, rent, or trade your personal information with others.
								<br>
			                    <br>

								about yourself.
								<br>
			                    <br>

								note to the address listed in the rules for the contest that says it was OK for you to enter,
								and tells us they will accept the prize for you.
								<br>
			                    <br>
