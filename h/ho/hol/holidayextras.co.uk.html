The secure server software SSL (Secure Socket Layers) encrypts all information you enter before it is sent to us. The information is only de-encrypted when it reaches our server. You can tell our site is secure as a small locked padlock will appear in the bottom left of your browser to show that you can safely send credit card details through our site. Another indicator is that our secure pages will not display a 'security alert' message. <br><br> We also have a Firewall (security software) in place to protect our internal information from the Internet.<br><br> <b>Does the Holiday Extras site use cookies?</b><br><br> Yes, Holiday Extras uses 'temporary cookies', which are only used during the booking process. (A cookie is a small piece of information sent by a web server to store on a web browser so it can later be read back from that browser. This is useful for having the browser remember some specific information (ref. Cookie Central). <br><br> <b>Will Holiday Extras disclose any of this personal information to third parties?</b><br><br> Holiday Extras will only disclose your name and booking details to our suppliers (see above) for operational purposes. We will only pass on your details to other companies for marketing purposes if you have given us your permission to do so on the page where you enter your name and address.<br><br> We won't disclose credit/debit card numbers unless we believe in good faith that the law requires it. <br><br> <b>Will Holiday Extras use the information I give for direct marketing? </b><br><br> Yes, but we ask you for your permission and we'll only send you details of the products we offer.
