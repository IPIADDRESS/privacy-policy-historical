<h1 class="textblack">Privacy Statement &amp; Cookie Policy - Our Commitment to Privacy.</h1>
<hr class="hrstyle">
<p>
Our Privacy Policy was developed as an extension 
        of our commitment to combine the highest-quality products and services 
        with the highest level of integrity in dealing with our clients and partners. 
        The Policy is designed to assist you in understanding how we collect, 
        use and safeguard the personal information you provide to us and to assist 
        you in making informed decisions when using our site and our products 
        and services. This statement will be continuously assessed against new 
        technologies, business practices and our customers' needs.</p>
<p>
What Information Do We Collect?</p>
<p>
When you visit our Web site you may provide 
        us with two types of information: personal information you knowingly choose 
        to disclose that is collected on an individual basis and Web site use 
        information collected on an aggregate basis as you and others browse our 
        Web site.</p>
<p>
Personal Information You Choose to Provide</p>
<p>
If you choose to purchase products or services 
        from us, you will need to give personal information such as:<br>
<br>
Name <br>
        Billing address <br>
        Email address <br>
        Home and/or business phone numbers <br>
        Email Information<br>
        Property location<br>
        Owner's details<br>
</p>
<p>
In addition to providing the foregoing information 
        to us, if you choose to correspond further with us through email, we may 
        retain the content of your email messages together with your email address 
        and our responses. We provide the same protections for these electronic 
        communications that we employ in the maintenance of information received 
        by mail and telephone.</p>
		<p>How Do We Use the Information That 
        You Provide to Us?</p>
<p>
Broadly speaking, <strong>we use personal 
        information for purposes of administering our business activities</strong>. 
        Occasionally, we may also use the information we collect to notify you 
        about important changes related to products or services you have already 
        purchased.</p>
		<p>
What About Legally Compelled Disclosure 
        of Information?</p>
<p>
We may disclose information when legally 
        compelled to do so, in other words, when we, in good faith, believe that 
        the law requires it or for the protection of our legal rights.</p>
<hr class="hrstyle">
<b>Web Site Use Information - Cookies</b><br>
<p>
Similar to other commercial Web sites, our 
        Web site utilizes a standard technology called "cookies" (see 
        explanation below, "What Are Cookies?") and Web server logs 
        to collect information about how our Web site is used. Information gathered 
        through cookies and Web server logs may include the date and time of visits, 
        the pages viewed, time spent at our Web site, and the Web sites visited 
        just before and just after our Web site. This information is collected 
        on an aggregate basis. None of this information is associated with you 
        as an individual.</p>
<p>
What Are Cookies?</p>
<p>
Cookies are a feature of Web browser software 
        that allows Web servers to recognize the computer used to access a Web 
        site. Cookies are small pieces of data that are stored by a user's Web 
        browser on the user's hard drive. Cookies can remember what information 
        a user accesses on one Web page to simplify subsequent interactions with 
        that Web site by the same user or to use the information to streamline 
        the user's transactions on related Web pages. This makes it easier for 
        a user to move from Web page to Web page and to complete commercial transactions 
        over the Internet. Cookies should make your online experience easier and 
        more personalized.</p>
<p>
How Do We Use Information We Collect 
        from Cookies?</p>
<p>
We use Web site browser software tools such 
        as cookies and Web server logs to gather information about our Web site 
        users' browsing activities, in order to constantly improve our Web site 
        and better serve our customers. This information assists us to design 
        and arrange our Web pages in the most user-friendly manner and to continually 
        improve our Web site to better meet the needs of our customers and prospective 
        customers.</p>
<p>
Cookies help us collect important 
        business and technical statistics. The information in the cookies lets 
        us trace the paths followed by users to our Web site as they move from 
        one page to another. Web server logs allow us to count how many people 
        visit our Web site and evaluate our Web site's visitor capacity. We do 
        not use these technologies to capture your individual email address or 
        any personally identifying information about you although they do permit 
        us to send focused online banner advertisements or other such responses 
        to you.</p>
