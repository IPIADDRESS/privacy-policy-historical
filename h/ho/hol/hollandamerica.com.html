    <div id="collect"><strong>Information We Collect</strong></div>

<p>
    You can visit our website without divulging any personally identifiable information including your email address.
    Our website does not collect personally identifiable information about individuals except when such individuals
    specifically provide such information on a voluntary basis, such as when registering at our website, requesting a
    brochure or video, emailing an itinerary, deck plan or ebrochure or accessing our cruise booking application.
    Holland America Line uses such information collected primarily to provide better customer service to you, to improve
    and customize the content you see, to provide the products, services or membership benefits you request, and to
    contact you about special promotions and new products.</p>


    <div id="siteuse"><strong>Site Use Information</strong></div>

<p>
    Our web servers may collect the domain names of visitors to our site. This information may be aggregated to measure
    the number of visits, average time spent on the site, pages viewed, and so forth. Holland America Line may use this
    information to measure the use of our site and to improve the content we offer. We may share with third parties this
    experiential information or other data which does not personally identify visitors to our site. This might include
    tour or ship preferences of all visitors to our site,<br>for example.</p>


    <div id="cookies"><strong>Use of Cookies</strong></div>

<p>
    Our website uses "cookies" to help personalize your online experience, such as recognizing your name when you
    revisit, as well as to assist us in marketing and advertising. A cookie is a text file that is anonymously placed on
    your hard disk by a web page server. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer.
    Cookies placed when you visit our site do not personally identify you, but they do allow us to monitor certain
    statistics which help us improve our services, such as how many site visitors view certain pages on our website or
    receive our advertisements when visiting other websites. </p>

<p>
    You also have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can
    usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. If you choose to decline cookies, you will not
    be able to fully utilize the website.
</p>


    <div id="provide"><strong>Information You Provide to Us</strong></div>

<p>
    You are not required to register in order to access our site. If you send us an email or register on our site we may
    collect information about you. Certain portions of our site are restricted to registered users or passengers with
    confirmed bookings. Any information you provide is purely voluntary.</p>

<p>
    There are several areas on the site where you may provide personal information or will be required to register to
    obtain access to certain online services not available to anonymous visitors. These include My Account, Mariners,
    Book Online, Online Check-in, Book Shore Excursions, Order Gifts, Contact Us, or any of the places where you may
    email something from the website and Travel Agent Locator. Travel agents may register with Holland America Line
    through the Travel Agent Headquarters part of<br>our site.</p>

<p>
    When you register on our site, you may be required to provide your email address and to select a password to be used
    to access your information. To access My Account you may be required to use your name, email address and/or Mariner
    number obtained from Holland America Line. If you want to book travel or other services through our site, you may be
    required to register in advance and provide a booking number in order to obtain access. </p>

<p>
    When you register we collect information which may include your name, address, gender, birth date and email address,

    information (the name, address and telephone number of someone not traveling with you who we can contact in case of
    an emergency ("Web Profile Information").</p>

<p>
    Passengers are not required to use Online Check-in to submit information before they begin their cruise; the same
    information, which is required before boarding can be provided at the point of embarkation on forms available from
    Holland America Line. Using Online Check-in will speed up your boarding process because information is submitted in
    advance. This information may be shared with governmental agencies including Customs or the Department of Homeland
    Security, with medical staff and with Holland America Line personnel. We may keep your credit card and passport
    information on file and on our servers to enable you to make purchases on board more easily and to facilitate your
    boarding procedure.</p>

    an email or request information we will retain your email address and use it to respond to your inquiry. We may also
    use your email address to provide you with information about upcoming events, cruises, special offers, packages and
    other information about Holland America Line.</p>

<p>
    By providing personal information through this site you explicitly agree to our collection and use of that
    information as described in this Privacy Policy. You agree that we may use the personal information you provide to
    respond to your inquiries, process orders, contact you regarding customer service, let you know about products or
    services which may be of interest to you or to personalize our service to meet your needs or preferences. This may
    involve sharing certain information with our medical staff, affiliated companies or third parties, for instance, if
    you require a wheelchair or have dietary preferences. You also agree that we may share your personal information
    with our affiliated companies and third parties as described in this Privacy Policy.</p>

    promotion.</p>


    <div id="child"><strong>Child Privacy</strong></div>

    companies or with third parties. We will reveal personal information to unaffiliated third parties only if: (1) you
    request or authorize it; (2) the information is provided to help complete a transaction for you; (3) the information
    is provided to comply with the law, applicable regulations, governmental and quasi-governmental requests, court

    Westmark Hotels of Canada Ltd., Worldwide Shore Services Inc., HAL Properties Limited and any other corporate
    affiliate of HAL that provides or is expected to provide you with goods or services as part of or incident to your
    Cruise, Cruisetour, HAL Air Package or HAL Land Trip. "Initial Departure" means the time at which you first begin
    transit by any means of transport booked by us (including air transportation) for the purpose of taking the Cruise
    or Cruisetour. "HAL Air Package" refers to air transportation booked for you by us to enable you to travel to and
    from your Cruise or Cruisetour. "HAL Land Trip" refers to a pre- or post-Cruise or Cruisetour package or transfer
    you have purchased (excluding any HAL Air Package), or to a shore excursion you purchase during your Cruise or
    Cruisetour, on which you are traveling on one or more motorcoaches, dayboats and/or railcars owned or operated by
    us. "HAL Land Trip" also refers to any visit by you to Half Moon Cay (on the island of Little San Salvador) in the
    Bahamas ("Half Moon Cay"). </p>

<p>(b) "Refund Amount" refers to that portion of the Cruise, Cruisetour, HAL Land Trip or HAL Air Package fare which has
    actually been received by us. A portion of your fare was retained by or paid to your travel agent to compensate the
    agent for their services. The Refund Amount does not include the portion of the fare retained by or paid to your
    agent. You are solely responsible for obtaining the refund of these retained or paid amounts. Any refund to you will
    be effected only in the currency received by us and in the country in which the fare has been paid and subject to
    any foreign exchange regulations in force in that country. </p>

<p>(c) Certain third parties derive rights and exemptions from liability as a result of this contract. Specifically, all
    of our rights, exemptions from liability, defenses and immunities under this contract (including, but not limited
    to, those arising under Clauses A.3, A.4, A.5, A.6, A.7, A.9 and C.4), the provisions of the forum selection clause,
    or applicable law will also inure to the benefit of our employees and agents, together with the Alaska Railroad
    Corporation, the Ship and the Ship's tenders, operators, managers, charterers, officers, staff, crewmembers,
    shipbuilders and manufacturers of all component parts and all suppliers, shore excursion operators, concessionaires
    and other independent contractors. These third parties will have no liability to you, either in contract or in tort,
    which is greater than or different from ours. </p>

<p>2. Providing Cruise, Cruisetour, HAL Land Trips and HAL Air Package: In consideration of the receipt in full of the
    fare and subject to the terms and conditions of this contract: (a) Owner agrees to transport you on the Ship in
    order to enable you to take the Ship portion of the Cruise or Cruisetour; (b) as to Cruisetours, HAL agrees to
    provide you with the portion of the Cruisetour that occurs either before your initial embarkation onto, or after
    your final disembarkation off of, the Ship; (c) as to HAL Land Trips, each HAL Company furnishing a portion of the
    HAL Land Trip agrees to provide you with that portion; and (d) as to HAL Air Packages, HAL agrees to book the air
    transportation required at the commencement and conclusion of your Cruise or Cruisetour. This contract is valid only
    for the Cruise or Cruisetour and for the cabin specified in this Cruise Contract booklet (or any other cabin
    assigned by us). Although this contract refers to Owner, HAL and the HAL Companies as "we" and "us," no Owner or HAL
    Company shall be liable for the acts or omissions of any other Owner or HAL Company or with respect to the services
    provided or to be provided by any other Owner or HAL Company. </p>

<p>3. Time Limits for Noticing Claims and Filing and Service of Lawsuits: In any case governed by 46 United States Code
    Section 30508, which is a United States statute that permits any shipowner to limit the time during which a
    passenger may file a claim or commence suit against a shipowner, you may not maintain a lawsuit against us or the
    Ship for loss of life or personal injury, including emotional distress, unless written notice of the claim is
    delivered to us not later than six (6) months after the day of death or injury, the lawsuit is commenced not later
    than one (l) year after the day of death or injury, and valid service of the lawsuit on Owner, the HAL Company or
    the Ship, as applicable, is made within thirty (30) days following the expiration of that one-year period. For all
    other claims, including but not limited to claims for loss or damage to baggage, breach of contract,
    misrepresentation, illness or death or injury, not governed by 46 United States Code Section 30508, whether based on
    contract, tort, statutory, constitutional or other legal rights, including but not limited to alleged violation of
    civil rights, discrimination, consumer or privacy laws, or for any losses, damages or expenses, relating to or in
    any way arising out of or connected with this contract or your cruise, no matter how described, pleaded or styled,
    you may not maintain a lawsuit against us or the Ship, nor will we or the Ship be liable therefore, unless we are
    provided with written notice of claim within thirty (30) days after conclusion of the Cruise or Cruisetour, the
    lawsuit for such claim is commenced not later than six months after conclusion of the Cruise or Cruisetour, and
    valid service of the lawsuit on Owner, the Ship or the HAL Company, as applicable, is made within thirty (30) days
    following the expiration of that six-month period. </p>

<p>In the case of a claim by or on behalf of a minor or legally incompetent person, or in the case of a wrongful death
    claim, the time periods described above shall begin to run on the earlier of: (a) date of appointment of a legal
    representative for the minor or legally incompetent person, or their estate (as the case may be); or (b) three (3)
    years after the day of death, injury or damage, as applicable. </p>

<p>4. Limitation on Liability; Governing Law; Non-HAL Services: (a) In the event you are injured, become ill, or die, or
    your property is lost or damaged, or you and/or your property is delayed, or you sustain any other loss or damage
    whatsoever, we will not be liable to you unless the occurrence was due to our negligence or willful fault. We
    disclaim liability to you under any circumstances for infliction of emotional distress, mental suffering or
    psychological injury which was not: (i) the result of physical injury to you caused by the negligence or fault of a
    crewmember or the manager, agent, master, owner or operator of the Ship; (ii) the result of you having been at
    actual risk of physical injury caused by the negligence or fault of a crewmember or the manager, agent, master,
    owner or operator of the Ship; or (iii) intentionally inflicted by a crewmember or the manager, agent, master, owner
    or operator of the Ship. In no event will we be liable to you for consequential, incidental, exemplary or punitive
    damages. </p>

<p>(b) This contract is issued at Seattle, Washington. As to any cruise that does not begin, end or call at a port in
    the United States of America, we shall be entitled to any and all damages limitations, immunities and rights
    applicable to us under the "Convention Relating to the Carriage of Passengers and Their Luggage by Sea" of 1974 as
    well as the "Protocol to the Convention Relating to the Carriage of Passengers and Their Luggage by Sea" of 1976
    ("Athens Convention"). The Athens Convention limits our liability for death or personal injury of a passenger to no
    more than 46,666 Special Drawing Rights as defined therein (approximately U.S. $70,000, which fluctuates depending
    on the daily exchange rate as published in the Wall Street Journal). In addition, and on all other cruises, all the
    exemptions from and limitations of liability provided in or authorized by the laws of the United States shall apply,
    including Title 46 of the United States Code, sections 30501 through 30509 and 30511. Except as otherwise set forth,
    this contract shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the general maritime law of the United States;
    to the extent such maritime law is not applicable, it shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws
    of the State of Washington (U.S.A.). </p>

<p>(c) We do not undertake to supervise, nor assume any liability in respect of, the acts or omissions of the Ship's
    barbers, beauticians, masseurs, masseuses or photographers, all of whom are either independent contractors or are
    employed by independent contractors, and work directly for the passenger when performing their services. As to your
    Cruisetour and HAL Land Trips, certain transportation will be provided using equipment owned or operated by us. All
    other transportation, shore excursions, accommodations and services in the air and on shore (referred to as "Non-HAL
    Services") are performed by third parties who are independent contractors, and not by us. By way of example only,
    Non-HAL Services include goods and services provided by shoreside physicians, air ambulance, hotels, restaurants,
    airlines (including the airline(s) used in any HAL Air Package), railroads, tour operators (other than us),
    helicopter operators, amusement park operators, dayboat operators and motorcoach operators. As a result, you are
    assuming the entire risk of utilizing Non-HAL Services subject only to whatever terms or arrangements are made by
    you or on your behalf with the third party furnishing the Non-HAL Service. Money received in respect of Non-HAL
    Services by us is received only as an independent contractor, to be paid to the third party (less retained
    commission, if any). We will not be liable for the refund of this money to you except to the extent retained and not
    owed by us to a third party providing Non-HAL Services. Similarly, any medical examination or treatment you receive
    from personnel aboard ship during the Cruise, Cruisetour or HAL Land Trip, is provided solely for your convenience
    by independent contractors rather than our agent or employee. We do not undertake to supervise the medical expertise
    of any such personnel and will not be liable for the consequences of any examination, advice, diagnosis, medication,
    treatment, prognosis or other professional services which a doctor or nurse may furnish or fail to furnish to you.
    Furthermore, you may be charged for such professional services. </p>

<p>(d) You assume all risks for injury, death or loss as a consequence of your use of the Ship's athletic or
    recreational equipment or as a consequence of criminal conduct by any third party. Except as otherwise specified in
    Clause A.4(b) with regard to cruises that do not begin, end or call at a port in the United States of America, in
    addition to the limitations of, and exemptions from, liability granted under this contract, we also retain any and
    all limitations of, and exemptions from, liability accorded to shipowners and tour operators by statute or rule of
    law including, without limitation, those provided for in 46 United States Code Sections 30501 through 30509 and
    30511, which are United States statutes limiting the liability of vessel owners. </p>

<p>(e) During your Cruise and the Ship portion of your Cruisetour, we are transporting you and your property only
    between ports of call. At ports where the Ship is unable to dock, we will arrange for appropriate transportation
    from the place where the Ship is at anchor to the dock. Persons with mobility impairments should refer to the What
    You Need to Know Before You Go booklet regarding limitations on our ability to help you go ashore. </p>

<p>5. Change in Itinerary/Cancellation: (a) Although we will use our best efforts to provide you with the Cruise,
    Cruisetour and/or HAL Land Trips, situations may occur which require that changes be made. By way of example only,
    we may adjust itineraries and schedules, delay departures or arrivals, or cancel a Cruise, Cruisetour or HAL Land
    Trip, due to casualty, weather, labor problems, the need to render assistance to others, governmental or insurer
    directives, passenger or employee injury or illness, schedule delays or changes by third parties, repair and
    maintenance requirements, fuel or other shortages, or damage to the Ship, other means of transportation, roads,
    tracks, bridges, docks, equipment or machinery. Furthermore, the Master of the Ship or of any other vessel as well
    as the operator of any other means of transportation may, in his/her sole discretion, elect not to proceed in the
    ordinary course. Consequently, we cannot guarantee the itinerary of the Cruise, Cruisetour or any HAL Land Trip
    (including time of sailing from or arrival at any port or that all ports will, in fact, be called at, or that all
    places on your Cruisetour or HAL Land Trip will be visited). We reserve the right to provide you with alternative
    transportation whenever the Cruise, Cruisetour or HAL Land Trip is unable to proceed or be completed in the ordinary
    course or, in the case of hotels, to substitute facilities of similar category in cases where the planned hotel is
    unavailable due to overbooking or otherwise. </p>

<p>(b) Your safety is very important to us. For safety or other reasons that we believe qualify as good cause, we may,
    without notice, substitute any suitable ship, ships or other means of transportation, change any date of sailing or
    travel or cancel any sailing, Cruisetour segment, port of call, Cruisetour or HAL Land Trip destination or stopover,
    or the entire HAL Land Trip, Cruise or Cruisetour. </p>

<p>(c) If the Cruise or Cruisetour or a HAL Land Trip is cancelled, we may disembark you at any port or terminate your
    travel at any location, and transship and forward (at our expense, but at your risk) you and your property to or
    toward a port or location from which you may return home or to the Ship, as appropriate. The means of conveyance may
    or may not belong to us and may or may not proceed directly to the desired destination. If a Cruise, Cruisetour or
    HAL Land Trip is cancelled before commencement, you will be entitled, as your exclusive remedy, to receive the
    applicable Refund Amount. If a Cruise, Cruisetour or HAL Land Trip is cancelled after commencement, you will be
    entitled, as your exclusive remedy, to receive the applicable Refund Amount less a reasonable allowance for
    transportation and services already provided to you. The reasonable allowance will be determined on a pro rata basis
    by taking into account the time missed relative to the scheduled duration of the Cruise, Cruisetour or HAL Land
    Trip. Notwithstanding the foregoing, we are not obligated to issue any refund to you in the event of a cancelled HAL
    Land Trip to Half Moon Cay. </p>

<p>(d) You acknowledge that for round trip cruises commencing in the United States that stop in other ports of the
    United States, you may visit but may not permanently disembark in any U.S. port other than the port of embarkation.
    If you do disembark in a different U.S. port, a fine or penalty may be imposed by the United States government. In
    consideration of the fare paid, you hereby agree to pay any such fine or penalty imposed because of your failure to
    complete the entire cruise. </p>

<p>6. Authority to Remove Passengers: We may reasonably determine that for your safety, the safety of the Ship or other
    means of transportation or the safety or comfort of other passengers or our employees, you be denied transportation
    either before or during the Cruise, Cruisetour or HAL Land Trip. By way of example, these would include situations
    where: (a) you are or become in such condition as to be unfit to travel or dangerous or obnoxious to other
    passengers or employees; (b) you are inadmissible under the immigration or other laws of any country included in the
    Cruise, Cruisetour or HAL Land Trip itinerary or fail at any time to possess required travel documents; or (c) you
    fail to abide by the rules or orders of the Master or other ship's officers. If transportation is denied after
    departure, you and your baggage may be landed or transported to any port or location that we select, without any
    resulting liability on our part. </p>

<p>7. Baggage: (a) We will carry as baggage only your personal effects consisting of wearing apparel, toilet articles
    and similar items for your wearing, comfort or convenience during the Cruise, Cruisetour and HAL Land Trips and not
    belonging to or intended for use by any other person or for sale. Radioactive materials, controlled substances
    (other than lawfully obtained prescription drugs), firearms and illicit materials are strictly prohibited. For
    loading and unloading the Ship and other means of transportation, all baggage must be tendered for carriage in
    securely constructed and locked suitcases or trunks. All baggage must be able to be both safely stowed in your cabin
    on the Ship and, for Cruisetours and HAL Land Trips, fit in the baggage compartment of any means of transportation.
    The only animals permitted to accompany you are qualified service animals for passengers with disabilities; you are
    responsible for complying with governmental health and other requirements as to service animals. </p>

<p> (b) We are not liable for: (1) any loss, damage or delay before baggage comes into our actual custody at the
    commencement of your Cruise, Cruisetour or HAL Land Trip or after baggage leaves our actual custody at the
    conclusion of your Cruise, Cruisetour or HAL Land Trip; (2) any loss, damage or delay while baggage is not in our
    custody which includes any period during which baggage is in the custody of airlines (including airlines booked as
    part of a HAL Air Package); or (3) damage due to wear, tear or normal usage. For security and legal reasons, baggage
    is subject to search, and illegal or potentially unsafe property is subject to seizure, both before and during the
    Cruise, Cruisetour and/or HAL Land Trip. </p>

<p>(c) We do not assume any liability for any loss of or damage to or delay of perishable items, medicine, liquor, cash,
    credit or debit cards, jewelry, gold, silver or similar valuables, including but not limited to those specified in
    Title 46 of the United States Code section 30503, securities, financial instruments, records or other valuable or
    business documents, computers, cellular telephones, cameras, hearing aids, electric wheelchairs, scooters, or other
    video or electronic equipment, binoculars, film, videotape, computer disks, audio disks, tapes or CDs. These items
    should not be left lying about the Ship or your cabin, nor should they be left unattended on other vessels, railcars
    or other vehicles or in hotels, or placed in luggage other than a bag that you carry with you. In addition, we do
    not assume any liability for any loss of or damage to carry-on baggage left unattended on the Ship or on other means
    of transportation or in hotels. The Ship and certain hotels may be equipped with cabin or room safes or safe-deposit
    boxes in the Ship's or hotel's Front Office; using these facilities will not, however, increase our liability as
    provided in this contract. </p>

<p>(d) The fare has been established on the basis of our assumption that the total value of your property that you are
    taking with you on the Cruise, Cruisetour and HAL Land Trip (exclusive of the items mentioned in Clause 7(c) above)
    will not exceed $100 (U.S.), or $600 (U.S.) if you purchased from us the Cancellation Protection Plan and Additional
    Baggage Protection. Accordingly, if we, due to any cause whatsoever, are liable for loss or damage to, or delay of,
    your property, the amount of our aggregate liability will not exceed $100/$600 (as is applicable) unless you have
    specified to us the true value of your property and paid before commencement of the Cruise, Cruisetour or HAL Land
    Trip, at the Ship's Front Office or directly to us, 1% of the value in excess of $100/$600. In that event, our
    aggregate liability will be limited to the amount so specified. Whether or not a value in excess of $100/$600 has
    been specified, the limit on liability will be proportionately reduced in any case where less than all of your
    property is lost, damaged or delayed. Without increasing the above limits: (1) our aggregate liability will never
    exceed, and all settlements will be made on the basis of, original cost less depreciation; (2) damaged items will be
    settled on the basis of repair costs; and (3) lost, damaged or delayed baggage must be reported to a HAL
    representative within 48 hours after discovery and written claim to us must be made within 30 days after conclusion
    of the Cruise or Cruisetour as provided in Clause A.3 above. </p>

<p> 8. Passenger Liability in Certain Cases: You will be required to reimburse us for all expenses we incur as a result
    of any misrepresentation made by you, as a result of the need to provide you with medical services, as a result of
    your detention by immigration, health or port authorities, or as a result of any personal injury or damage caused by
    your acts or omissions or the acts or omissions of any minor (under age 21) traveling with you. We will have a lien
    for such expenses on your property that you have taken with you on your Cruise, Cruisetour or HAL Land Trip. If, due
    to weather or other unforeseen reasons, flights are adversely impacted or you are otherwise required to spend an
    additional night in a location, hotel and meal costs are your responsibility.</p>

<p> 9. Travel Agents: Any travel agent you use in connection with your Cruise, Cruisetour or HAL Land Trip acts solely
    for you and is deemed your agent. We are not responsible for the financial condition or integrity of any such travel
    agent. In the event that an agent fails to remit to us any monies paid by you to the agent, you remain liable for
    the fare due us, regardless of whether we demand payment before or after Initial Departure. Any refund made by us to
    an agent on your behalf is considered, for purposes of this contract, as being the same as payment to you whether or
    not the monies are delivered by the agent to you. Receipt of any documents or information by your travel agent,
    including but not limited to this contract, shall be deemed to constitute receipt by you. </p>

<p>10. Passenger Condition: There are risks inherent to being aboard the Ship and other means of transportation. These
    include, by way of example, having to evacuate the Ship or other means of transportation in case of emergency,
    having to move about on the Ship or other vessels during rough seas and lack of access to full medical services. For
    people who are ill or who are mentally or physically disabled or impaired, these risks are more significant. For
    example: access to all parts of the Ship, other means of transportation or to facilities on shore may be difficult
    or impossible for some passengers. In addition, medical evacuations during the cruise, whether at sea, by tender, or
    by deviating from the scheduled itinerary, may create an increased risk of harm and may not be feasible for a
    variety of reasons. We reserve the right to determine, in our sole discretion exercised in good faith, whether and
    when a medical evacuation from the ship will occur. For these reasons, we require that if you have any special
    medical, physical or other requirements, these be brought to our attention immediately upon receipt of this
    contract. In limited situations where you would be unable to satisfy certain specified safety and other criteria,
    even when provided with appropriate auxiliary aids and services, we reserve the right to refuse permission to
    participate in all or part of the Cruise, Cruisetour and/or HAL Land Trips. </p>

<p>11. Compliance with Laws/Minors: Immigration, health and other laws, both in the United States and other countries,
    may require that you obtain a certain visa, hold a passport, be inoculated, obtain parental consent or otherwise
    obtain documentation prior to entering or returning to a country. It is your responsibility to take all steps as may
    be required to enable you to comply with these laws. All persons under 18 years of age must be accompanied and
    supervised by a parent or guardian. Persons under 21 years of age are not permitted to consume alcoholic beverages;
    parents and guardians are obligated to insure compliance with this requirement. </p> <p>12. Personal Information;
Authority to Use and Sell Pictures, Video Images and Audio Recordings: Personal information we collect from you may be
used by us or our affiliates for marketing purposes; it will not, however, be sold to unaffiliated third parties. In
addition, some governmental and quasi-governmental agencies require or request that we provide them with your personal
information. You authorize us to use and/or provide to others your personal information as described above and
acknowledge that we do not assume any liability to you for our doing so. We periodically photograph or otherwise film
people participating in Cruises, Cruisetours and/or HAL Land Trips for retail, marketing, promotional, publicity and
training purposes. Without any requirement that we compensate you or obtain any additional approvals from you, we are
authorized to include photographic, video recordings and other visual portrayals of you, as well as voice recordings
included with any videos, in photographs, videos, DVDs or other mediums that we sell at retail or utilize for marketing,
promotional, publicity and/or training activities.</p>

<p>13. Transferability; Separability: This contract cannot be transferred by you. Any additions, deletions or other
    alterations to, or waivers of any term of, this contract which are purported to have been made by us and which have
    not been agreed to in writing by the President of HAL will not be legally binding upon us. Any provision of this
    contract which is prohibited or unenforceable in any jurisdiction will, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective to
    the extent of such prohibition or unenforceability and the validity and enforceability of the remaining terms and
    conditions of this contract will not otherwise be affected, nor will the validity and enforceability of such
    provision be affected in any other jurisdiction. </p>

<p> B. THE CRUISE OR CRUISETOUR </p>

<p></p>

<p>1. Additions to Fare/Non-Discountable Amount, Taxes and Surcharges: (a) The fare that you paid was determined far in
    advance of Initial Departure on the basis of then-existing projections of fuel and other costs. In the event of an
    increase in fuel or other costs above amounts projected, we have the right to increase the fare at any time up to
    Initial Departure and to require payment of the additional fare prior to Initial Departure. We have the right to
    refuse to transport you unless the additional fare is paid. Within seven (7) days after you are notified of the
    additional fare (but no later than Initial Departure), you may elect to surrender this contract to us for
    cancellation, whereupon you will receive the Refund Amount. Cancellation fees do not apply to this type of
    refund. </p>

<p> (b) Your cruise fare includes a "Non-Discountable Amount." That portion of the fare is both non-commissionable to
    travel agents and not subject to reduction in the event of a percentage discount promotion, 2 for 1 promotion or
    otherwise. In addition to your cruise fare, you will also be charged an amount for Taxes. That term, as used by us,
    refers to certain taxes, fees and charges imposed by governmental or quasi-governmental authorities, including port
    authorities, relating to any aspect of your cruise or tour. If governmental action results in any element of Taxes
    exceeding the estimates used by us for purposes of computing the quoted amount, we reserve the right to pass through
    the extra amount. Similarly, we reserve the right to impose or pass through fuel surcharges, security surcharges or
    similar incidental surcharges. No right of cancellation exists under either of these circumstances. </p>

<p> 2. Hostilities: Although unlikely, the Ship may be confronted by actual or threatened war, warlike operations or
    hostilities. In addition to our right to deal with this situation under our general right to respond to safety
    concerns, we may also decide that it would be prudent for the Ship to sail with or without lights, omit observance
    of practices, rules and regulations as to navigation, cargo or others applicable in time of peace, or sail armed or
    unarmed and with or without convoy. </p>

<p> 3. Holland America Brochure/Cancellations Policy: If not already received, you can obtain the Holland America Line
    brochure for the Cruise or Cruisetour from your travel agent or us. You should familiarize yourself with the
    brochure as well as with the What You Need to Know Before You Go booklet that we provided you with. Please be
    advised, however, that if the brochure or booklet is inconsistent with this contract, this contract will be
    controlling. Note in particular our cancellations policy which specifies cancellation fees that you will be subject
    to if this contract is surrendered for cancellation within certain time periods prior to Initial Departure. Since a
    cancellation likely means a lost opportunity to sell space on other Cruises or Cruisetours, these fees apply
    regardless of whether your space is resold. You hereby agree that losses sustained by us in the event of your
    cancellation would be very difficult or impossible to quantify, and that the fees set forth in our cancellations
    policy represent a fair and reasonable assessment as liquidated damages. </p>

<p></p>

<p>C. HAL AIR PACKAGE</p>

<p>1. Arrangements by HAL: If you are participating in our Fly Cruise Plan or Fly Cruise and Tour Plan, we will arrange
    for air transportation from the home cities listed in our brochure to the departure point of your Cruise or
    Cruisetour and return air transportation from the termination point of your Cruise or Cruisetour to the home city
    from which you departed. Due to the special fares and capacity controls we have with airlines, we retain the right
    to select carriers and determine routings. Some routings may involve travel to an airport other than in the city
    where the Ship embarks or disembarks. In those cases, motorcoach transportation to and/or from the Ship will be
    provided. Flight schedules and/or availability may require overnight hotel accommodations either to join and/or to
    return from your Cruise or Cruisetour. Please refer to the applicable Holland America Line brochure regarding our
    policies on booking hotels and responsibility for the costs of hotels and associated services. </p>

<p> 2. Schedule Changes/Air Delays: We reserve the right to change or alter air flights as required by airline schedule
    changes. If tickets have already been issued, we will adjust your itinerary or air carrier, accordingly. In that
    event, we may ask you to return your tickets to your travel agent. Should you choose to alter your airline schedule
    in any way once your tickets have been issued, airline charges which result will be your responsibility. If our
    assistance is requested in changing airline arrangements within 60 days of departure, an additional administrative
    charge will be levied in addition to any charges imposed by airlines. If your flights are delayed, refer to our What
    You Need to Know Before You Go booklet for instructions. </p>

<p>3. Refunds/Seat Assignments/Special Services/Fares/Lost Tickets/Baggage Charges: The maximum refund to you for unused
    flight coupons will not exceed the air add-on or cruise only credit amount paid to us. We cannot make or confirm
    seat assignments, special meals or other special services. Your travel agent may assist with these arrangements.
    Please note that because of changing airline tariffs, your actual air ticket may reflect fares higher or lower than
    the air add-on or cruise only credit amounts shown in the Holland America Line brochure. If so, the difference is
    neither chargeable nor refundable to you. If, however, airline fuel or other surcharges or additional governmental
    taxes or levies are imposed, we reserve the right to pass these through to you. Please keep your airline tickets in
    a safe place. Should they be lost, you will be responsible for their replacement. Each airline has its own baggage
    allowance policy. You are responsible for any excess baggage charges imposed by airlines. </p>

<p>4. Liability and Relationship With Airlines: We will use our best efforts to arrange for your air transportation. If,
    however, due to any cause beyond our control, we are unable to arrange for air transportation (including, for
    example, because of capacity controls placed upon us by airlines due to the types of fares under which we book) or
    the air transportation we arrange is unavailable or otherwise fails to materialize, our sole liability will be
    limited to refunding the air add-on paid or cruise only credit. Our relationship with airlines is that of an
    independent travel agent. We assume no liability for any acts or omissions of any airline including, without
    limitation, those involving cancellation of flights, schedule changes, re-routings, damage to or delay or loss of
    baggage, flight delays, equipment failures, accidents, pilot or other staff shortages, overbooking or computer
    errors. Accordingly, you will not have any right to claim or recover against us as a consequence of any act or
    omission of any airline. The liabilities and obligations of an airline to you, and your rights against an airline,
    are subject to any and all terms and conditions of the airline's ticket and tariffs and any and all governmental
    laws and regulations bearing upon or otherwise relating to such rights, liabilities and obligations. </p>
