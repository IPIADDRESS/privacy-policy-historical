          An IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you are surfing the Web.

This means that a user's session will be logged, but the user remains anonymous to us.  We can and will use IP addresses to identify a user when we feel it is necessary to enforce compliance with our terms and conditions or to protect our service, site, customers or others.<br><br>

          Holland America may use "cookies" to make our service more effective.  A "cookie" is a small text file placed on your hard drive by our server.  It allows our server to recognize whether you have visited our site before thereby saving you the need to provide information that we have already received from you.  If you would prefer not receiving cookies, most Web browsers offer menu options allowing you to disable them.<br><br>

          The importance of security for all personally identifiable information that you provide us is of great concern to us.  Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.  As a result, while we strive to protect your personal information, Holland America cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us; in other words, you do so at your own risk.  Once we receive your transmission, we use our reasonable best efforts to ensure its security on our systems.  Most information you provide to our site is transmitted using SSL (Secure Socket Layer) encryption.  SSL is a coding system that lets your browser automatically encrypt, or scramble, data before you send it to us.<br><br>

For example, if you told us that you were interested in a certain cruise product, we may tell your travel agency so they can discuss this directly with you.  Travel agencies are not owned or controlled by Holland America.  Consequently, we cannot tell you what travel agencies may do with information that we provide to them.<br><br>

          If you use our site to purchase a travel product that is offered by another travel provider (for example, air transportation, hotels or shore excursions), we will give the other travel provider the information they require in order to process and confirm your booking.

We encourage you to review the privacy policies of other travel providers if you have questions about their use of personal information.<br><br>
