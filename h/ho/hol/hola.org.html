	<h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
	Last updated February 13, 2014<br><br>
	
	Hola Networks Limited ("Hola", "we" or "us") is the owner of the website www.hola.org (the "Site"), the Hola software ("the Software") and any accompanying services, 
        features, content and applications offered by us (collectively referred herein as the "Services"). We are concerned about your privacy and have designed this Privacy 
	Policy in order to help you decide whether to use the Services.<br><br>
	This Policy is a legally binding agreement between you ("you" or "user") and us. By accessing and using the Services, or providing information to us in other formats, 
	you agree and accept the terms of this Privacy Policy as amended from time to time and consent to the collection and use of information in the manner set out in this 
	Privacy Policy. We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy carefully and to periodically refer to it so that you understand it and its subsequent changes if any. 
	IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THE TERMS OF THIS PRIVACY POLICY, PLEASE STOP USING THE SERVICES IMMEDIATELY AND WHERE RELEVANT UNINSTALL.<br><br>
	The definitions in the Hola <a href="/legal_sla">End User License Agreement</a> apply to this Policy unless stated otherwise. IN ADDITION TO THIS POLICY, 
	PLEASE REVIEW OUR END USER LICENSE AGREEMENT, WHICH IS INCORPORATED HEREIN BY REFERENCE, TOGETHER WITH SUCH OTHER POLICIES OF WHICH YOU MAY BE NOTIFIED OF BY US FROM 
	TIME TO TIME.  <br><br>

	<h3>The Information We Collect</h3>
	When you use the Services we collect the following types of data from you:
	<ul class="basic_list">
	  <li><b>Anonymous Information;</b> We collect Anonymous Information about your use of the Services to allow us to provide the Services and constantly improve them, 
		for security reasons and so that we can audit and track usage statistically, audit our affiliates and calculate payments to 3rd parties. Such Anonymous Information 
		does not enable identification of individual persons, and it includes your approximate geo-location, hardware specifications, browser type and version, the date of 
		the Software installation, the date of your last use of the Services, your operating system type, version and language, registry entries, and your URL requests 
		(this type of information is collected randomly from minor percentage of Hola's users for statistics only. We do not make any efforts to reveal your identity through 
		this collection). We may also collect information that will help us understand whether your device is used at a given moment so we will not send it any requests.</li>
	  <li><b>Personal Information;</b> is information that may be of a private or sensitive nature, identifies or may identify you. The Personal Information we collect and retain 
		include your IP address, your name and email address in case you provide us with this information (for instance when you open an account or if you approach us through the 
		"contact us" option), screen name, payment and billing information (if you purchase premium services) or other information we may ask from time to time as will be required 
		for the Services provisioning. When you create an account on the Services you are able to do so by using your credentials with a designated third party website or service 
		("Third Party Account"), such as Facebook®. Doing so will enable you to link your account and your Third Party Account. If you choose this option, then a Third Party Account 
		pop-up box will appear which you will need to approve in order to proceed, and which will describe the types of information that we will obtain from. Such information includes 
		your Personal Information stored on this Third Party Account, such as user name, email address, profile picture, birthday, gender and preferences.  We also treat any 
		Anonymous Information which is specifically connected or linked to any Personal Information, as long as such connection or linkage exists, as Personal Information.</li>
	  <li><b>Other Information</b>As part of the Services' nature and to enable browsing acceleration, information which is publicly accessible by other users that you have accessed 
		may be accessed by those users from cached copy of this data from your device; Please note that when you interact with other websites and use Hola, such websites may collect 
		information about you. Hola has nothing to do with such website's data collection practices and such practices will be governed by their own privacy policies.</li>
	</ul>

	and offers. <br><br>
