<p>
  Hola VPN Ltd. ("Hola", "we," or "us") is the owner of the website Hola.org
  ("the Site"), the Hola software ("the Software") and any accompanying
  services, features, content, and applications offered by us (collectively
  referred herein as "the Services"). We are concerned about your privacy and
  have designed this Privacy Policy in order to help you decide whether to use
  the Services. By accessing and using the Services, or providing information
  to us in other formats, you agree and accept the terms of this Privacy Policy
  as amended from time to time and consent to the collection and use of
  information in the manner set out in this Privacy Policy. We encourage you to
  review this Privacy Policy carefully and to periodically refer to it so that
  you understand it and any subsequent changes made to it.<br>
  IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THE TERMS OF THIS PRIVACY POLICY, PLEASE STOP
  USING THE SERVICES IMMEDIATELY AND UNINSTALL WHERE RELEVANT.
</p>
<h3>What types of information do we collect?</h3>
<p>
  We collect the following types of data from you when you use the Services:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Log Data: Log data may include the following information- browser type,
    web pages you visit, time spent on those pages, access times and dates.
  </li>
  <li>
    Personal Information: Personal information is information that may be
    of a private or sensitive nature, and which identifies or may identify you.
    The Personal Information we may collect and retain includes your IP
    address, your name and email address, screen name, payment and billing
    information or other information we may ask from time to time as will be
    required for the on-boarding process and services provisioning. When you
    create an account on the Services you are able to do so by using your
    credentials with a designated third party website or service ("Third Party
    Account") such as Gmail®. Doing so will enable you to link your account
    and your Third Party Account. If you choose this option, a Third Party
    Account pop-up box will appear that you will need to approve in order to
    proceed, and which will describe the types of information that we will
    obtain. This information includes your Personal Information stored on your
    Third Party Account, such as user-name, email address, profile picture,
    birth date, gender and preferences. Any Anonymous Information that is
    specifically connected or linked to any Personal Information, is treated by
    us as Personal Information, as long as such connection or linkage exists.
  </li>
  <li>
    Registering through social network account: When you register or
    sign-in to the Services via your social network account (e.g., Facebook,
    Google+), we will have access to basic information from your social network
    account, such as your full name, home address, email address, birth date,
    profile picture, friends list, personal description, as well as any other
    information you made publicly available on such account or agreed to share
    with us. At all times, we will abide by the terms, conditions and
    restrictions of the social network platform.
  </li>
</ul>
<h3>How do we use your information?</h3>
<p>
  We use your information in order to provide you with the Service. This means
  that we will use the information to set up your account, provide you with
  support regarding the Service, communicate with you for updates, marketing
  offers or concerns you may have and conduct statistical and analytical
  research to improve the Service.
</p>
<h3>Information we share</h3>
<p>
  We do not rent or sell any Personal Information. We may disclose Personal
  Information to other trusted third party service providers or partners for
  the purposes of providing you with the Services, storage and analytics. We
  may also transfer or disclose Personal Information to our subsidiaries,
  affiliated companies.
</p>
<p>
  We may also share your Personal Information and other information in special
  cases if we have good reason to believe that it is necessary to: (1) comply
  with law, regulation, subpoena or court order; (2) detect, prevent or
  otherwise address fraud, security, violation of our policies or technical
  issues; (3) enforce the provisions of this Privacy Policy or any other
  agreements between you and us, including investigation of potential
  violations thereof; (4) protect against harm to the rights, property or
  safety of us, its partners, its affiliates, users, or the public.
</p>
<h3>Processing of data outside the EEA</h3>
<p>
  Please note that some data recipients may be located outside the EEA. In such
  cases we will share your data only with recipients located in such countries
  as approved by the European Commission as providing adequate level of data
  protection, or enter into legal agreements ensuring an adequate level of data
  protection.
</p>
<h3>Security and Confidentiality</h3>
<p>
  We use industry-standard information, security tools, and measures, as well
  as internal procedures and strict guidelines to prevent information misuse
  and data leakage. Our employees are subject to confidentiality obligations.
  We use measures and procedures that substantially reduce the risks of data
  misuse, but we cannot guarantee that our systems will be absolutely safe. If
  you become aware of any potential data breach or security vulnerability, you
  are requested to contact us immediately. We will use all measures to
  investigate the incident, including preventive measures, as required.
</p>
<h3>Your Choices and Rights</h3>
<p>
  We strive to give you ways to update your information quickly or to delete it
  – unless we have to keep that information for legitimate business or legal
  purposes. When updating your personal information, we may ask you to verify
  your identity before we can act on your request. If you are a resident of
  California, United States, you have the right to send us a written request
  regarding a list of Personal Information categories that we may have
  disclosed to third parties or to which we may have given to third parties,
  and the details of such third parties.
</p>
<p>
  If you are a resident of the European Union, please note that the following
  rights specifically apply regarding your personal information: (1) Receive
  confirmation as to whether or not personal information concerning you is
  being processed, and access your stored personal information, together with
  supplementary information; (2) Receive a copy of personal information you
  directly volunteer to us in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable
  format; (3)  Request rectification of your personal information that is in
  our control; (4) Request erasure of your personal information; (5) Object to
  the processing of personal information by us; (6) Request to restrict
  processing of your personal information by us; (7) Lodge a complaint with a
  supervisory authority.
</p>
<p>
  However, please note that these rights are not absolute, and may be subject
  to our own legitimate interests and regulatory requirements.
</p>
<p>
  To exercise such right, you may contact us at:
  <a href="mailto:privacy@hola.org">privacy@hola.org</a>
</p>
<h3>Retention</h3>
<p>
  We will retain your personal information for as long as necessary to provide
  the Service, and as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve
  disputes, and enforce our policies. Under applicable regulations, we will
  keep records containing client personal data, account opening documents,
  communications and anything else as required by applicable laws and
  regulations.
</p>
<p>
  We may rectify, replenish or remove incomplete or inaccurate information, at
  any time and at our own discretion.
</p>
<h3>Cookies</h3>
<p>
  When you use our Site, we may store cookies on your computer (as well as
  other tracking technologies like web beacons and pixels) in order to
  facilitate and customize your use of our Site. A cookie is a small data text
  file, which a website stores on your computer's hard drive (if your web
  browser permits) that can later be retrieved to identify you to us. Our
  cookies may store information regarding your account information. You are
  always free to decline our cookies if your browser permits, but such
  disabling may cause some of the features of our Site to not operate properly
  and your online experience may be limited.
</p>
<p>
  We also use a tool called “Google Analytics” to collect information about
  your use of the Site. Google’s ability to use and share information collected
  by Google Analytics about your visits to this Site is restricted by the
  Google Analytics Terms of Use and the Google Privacy Policy.
</p>
<h3>Information Warranty Disclaimer</h3>
<p>
  Notwithstanding anything else in this Policy, we are not responsible for the
  accuracy, correctness, and security of any of the information we gather,
  store, and disclose to you or to anyone else.
</p>
<p>
  Our policy only addresses the use and disclosure of information we collect
  from you. To the extent you disclose your information to other parties or
  sites throughout the internet, different rules may apply to their use or
  disclosure of the information you disclose to them. Accordingly, we encourage
  you to read the terms and conditions and privacy policy of each third party
  that you choose to disclose information to.
</p>
<h3>Change of Ownership</h3>
<p>
  In the event of a change of ownership or control of all or a part of
  Hola, including without limitation through acquisition, merger, or sale,
  we reserve the right to transfer all or part of the Personal Information and
  Anonymous Information we store in our systems. You acknowledge that in the
  event of bankruptcy, insolvency, or receivership, we may have no control over
  the use and transfer of your personal information.
</p>
<h3>Changes to this Privacy Policy</h3>
<p>
  This Policy may be revised from time to time at our sole discretion, so please
  check it regularly. The last revision will be reflected in the "Last Updated"
  heading. Any change of this policy will be posted on the Site. Your continued
  use of the Services following any such changes will be considered as you
  consent to the amended Privacy Policy.
</p>

  Policy, or if you believe that your privacy has been compromised by any
  person in the course of using the Services, please contact Hola at:
