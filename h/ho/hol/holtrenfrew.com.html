						<b>HOLT RENFREW PRIVACY POLICY</b><br>
						<br>
						Holt, Renfrew &amp; Co., Limited, (called in this statement "HOLT RENFREW"), is committed to protecting your privacy and maintaining the integrity of any identifiable information we collect about you ("Personal Information"). Keeping our customers’ Personal Information and affairs in strict confidence is a cornerstone of HOLT RENFREW'S business practices.<br>
						<br>
						The purpose of this Privacy Policy is to outline the steps we take to keep your Personal Information confidential, to inform you about how and why we collect Personal Information and to provide you with Holt Renfrew contact information should you have questions or concerns about our online Personal Information protection practices.<br>
						<br>
						Our policies and procedures, which we practise in order to protect your privacy, are in place across HOLT RENFREW. In the following pages we describe these policies and procedures and how we put them into practice so that you have control over how we collect, use and disclose your information.<br>
						<br>
						<b>Protecting your Privacy Means:</b><br>
						<ul>
							<li> We keep your information and the business you do with us in strict confidence</li>

							<li> you have access to the information we have about you</li>
							<li> we respect your privacy when we market our products and services.</li>
						</ul>
						<b>A. The Collection of Personal Information</b><br>
						<br>
						<b>1. Why does Holt Renfrew collect your Personal Information?</b><br>
						<br>
						Holt Renfrew collects Personal Information and uses it in order to:<br>
						<ul>

							<li> Protect you and us from error and fraud;</li>
							<li> Where required, co-operate with law enforcement authorities, to comply with a court order or to prevent a breach of any applicable law.</li>
						</ul>
						Certain information, such as a driver's licence, although convenient for identification, is voluntary. It is up to you whether you want to provide this or other suitable identification, subject to any legal requirements.<br>
						<br>
						We collect, use and disclose personal information only for purposes that a reasonable person would consider appropriate in the circumstances.<br>
						<br>
						We may review and analyze your use of products and services, to help us serve you better, and to bring other products and services to your attention, which we feel, will be of benefit to you. We also collect and analyze information from other sources for the same purposes.<br>
						<br>
						Please note that aggregated information, where the identity of a specific individual cannot be determined, is not Personal Information. Holt Renfrew reserves the right to use aggregated information in any manner it thinks appropriate. For example, Holt Renfrew may also prepare aggregated user statistics or information summaries to describe our services and their popularity to our suppliers and prospective advertisers and for other lawful purposes. Any aggregated user statistics and information will not contain any Personal Information.<br>
						<br>
						<b>2. What type of Personal Information does Holt Renfrew collect?</b><br>
						<br>
						Holt Renfrew collects various types of Personal Information. For example, during the registration process with us, you will be asked to provide certain contact information (such as your name and e-mail address) and may be asked, depending upon which services you subscribe for or features you make use of, to provide additional contact information and general information about yourself (such as address, postal code, telephone numbers, age group, personal interests, personal preferences, product preferences and, with respect to the online job application feature specifically, work experience, formal education, training, certifications, skill set, abilities and other work related information).<br>
						<br>
						<b>3. How Does Holt Renfrew Collect Personal Information?</b><br>
						<br>
						Holt Renfrew will only collect Personal Information that you have voluntarily provided to us. Holt Renfrew will not collect any Personal Information about you without telling you ahead of time (either through this Privacy Policy or at the time we are requesting Personal Information from you) why and how Personal Information is being collected and how such Personal Information will be used or disclosed (if applicable).<br>
						<br>
						Holt Renfrew may obtain and collect your Personal Information through a variety of means (e.g. you provide it verbally or in writing (including via electronic media)).  The following are examples of how we may do so:<br>
						<ul>
							<li> The completion of manual or electronic forms. Forms you may be asked to complete include:</li>
							<ul>
								<li> Credit Card Applications: As a service to eligible customers, Holt Renfrew's partner American Express may extend a credit card to eligible applicants. Holt Renfrew may be involved in such application process.</li>
								<li> Online Job Applications: Users of our website may search online for available positions at Holt Renfrew and submit job applications online with respect to such openings. Users who use such service will be asked to provide a cover letter, a resume and provide particulars as to their work experience, proficiencies and work preferences.</li>
							</ul>
							<li> Contests and Promotional Events: From time-to-time Holt Renfrew offers various promotions and contests. When participating in these promotions and contests, you may be asked to provide us with certain Personal Information. You are free at any time to have your Personal Information removed from our database or to have your name removed from our marketing distribution list on a go-forward basis.</li>
							<li> Clickstreaming: Clickstreaming is a technology that allows a website operator to track the paths that surfers take as they access a website and look at the site's pages, and as they use links to other sites. Holt Renfrew collects such information from visitors to www.holtrenfrew.com.</li>
							<li> Web Beacons: Web beacons are small, graphic images that allows a website operator to collect certain information and monitor user activity on its website. A web beacon is a very small pixel which is invisible to the user. Holt Renfrew uses web beacons in its e-newsletter to collect non-personal information.</li>
							<li> Web site traffic information, which is monitored and analyzed in order to determine which features and services are popular and useful to visitors, so that we can improve our services.</li>
						</ul>
						Holt Renfrew may also prepare aggregated user statistics or information summaries to describe our services and their popularity to our suppliers and prospective advertisers and for other lawful purposes. Any aggregated user statistics and information will not contain any Personal Information.<br>
						<br>
						<b>4. How Holt Renfrew May Disclose Personal Information</b><br>
						<br>
						Holt Renfrew does not sell to third parties any Personal Information we collect. Holt Renfrew may transfer some information we collect to selected service providers, leased partners and suppliers who help us provide personalized services and advertising to you.<br>
						<br>
						<b>B. Your Consent</b><br>
						<br>
						<b>1. Your Information is Obtained or Used Only With Your Consent</b><br>
						<br>
						We obtain your consent before we:<br>
						<br>
						<ul>
							<li> offer you other products and services</li>
							<li> send you information about products and services by means of direct marketing</li>
							<li> provided it is legally permitted, share your information in confidence within HOLT RENFREW and with leased partners</li>
							<li> obtain, use or disclose to other persons, information about you unless we are obliged to do so by law or to protect our interests</li>
							<li> use your information in any way we did not tell you about previously.</li>
						</ul>
						<b>2. Your Consent Can Be Express Or Implied</b><br>
						<br>
						Express consent can be verbal or written.<br>
						<br>
						Your implied consent when we can reasonably conclude that you've given consent by some action you have taken, or when you decide not to take action. By choosing to provide us with your Personal Information you are consenting to its use in accordance with the principles outlined in this Privacy Policy and as may be further outlined at the time of collection. For example, if we give you an opportunity to tell us you don't want direct marketing material and you don't tell us that you don't want us to send it, we can conclude that you have no objection. We will rely on your implied consent to use and disclose identifying information about you, such as your name and address.<br>
						<br>
						<b>3. You May Withdraw Your Consent After You Have Given It</b><br>
						<br>
						The protection of your Personal Information is of the utmost importance to us. If you don't want Holt Renfrew to use Personal Information collected about you for marketing or publicity purposes, please tell us at the time the information is collected.<br>
						<br>
						You can withdraw your consent any time after you have given it to us, provided there are no legal requirements to prevent this, by calling (416) 960-2860 or by sending an e-mail at <a href="mailto:Privacy.Office@HoltRenfrew.com">Privacy.Office@HoltRenfrew.com</a>.<br>
						<br>
						Please note, if you don't consent to certain uses of information, or if you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide you with a particular product or service. If so, we will explain the situation to you to help you with your decision.<br>
						<br>
						<b>4. We Ask for Your Consent Before Sharing Information With Other People</b><br>
						<br>
						We may share information about you within HOLT RENFREW and with our leased partners, however we do not release it to anyone outside of HOLT RENFREW without your consent.<br>
						<br>
						There are some exceptions to the above rule. For example, we may collect, use or disclose information without your consent if we:<br>
						<br>
						<b>a) use an outside company to process information</b><br>
						<br>
						At times we may use the expertise of an outside company to do work for us involving some of your information. When we do, we select the company carefully and confirm that it uses security and privacy standards comparable to those of HOLT RENFREW.<br>
						<br>
						<b>b) must disclose information for legal reasons</b><br>
						<br>
						We may be compelled to release information by a court of law, or other legal or regulatory authority. If so, our policy is to release information only to the extent that we have to.<br>
						<br>
						<b>c) have to protect the interests of HOLT RENFREW</b><br>
						<br>
						In certain circumstances, HOLT RENFREW may have to collect, use or release information for its protection. For example, we may do so to detect or prevent fraud.<br>
						<br>
						<b>d) use an outside company to provide you with a specific service</b><br>
						<br>
						For example, to deliver a purchase to your home.<br>
						<br>
						<b>e) Sale or Transfer all or Part of Holt Renfrew</b><br>
						<br>
						In some scenarios, Personal Information may be subject to transfer to another organization. This might occur, for example, in contemplation of a merger or a change of ownership of all or part of Holt Renfrew. We will do this only if the parties have entered into an agreement under which the disclosure of the information (including any Personal Information) is restricted to those purposes that relate to the business transaction and is to be used by the parties to carry out and complete the business transaction.<br>
						<br>
						<b>C. Verifying and Amending your Personal Information</b><br>
						<br>
						<b>1. You Can See and Verify the Accuracy of Your Information</b><br>
						<br>
						You can check your information to verify, update and correct it, and to have any obsolete information removed. We will ask you to put your request in writing.<br>
						<br>
						Personal Information collected by our credit card supplier should be updated by calling an American Express representative at 1-888-834-2583.<br>
						<br>
						There is no charge for verifying or correcting your information. Depending on the circumstances, there may be a charge if you want a copy of records, which we have already given you.<br>
						<br>
						 We will let you know in advance if there is a charge.<br>
						<br>
						If you have a sensory disability, we will do our best to give you access to your personal information in any alternative format you request if we already have it in that format or if its conversion into that format is reasonable and necessary in order for you to be able to exercise your rights under applicable legislation.<br>
						<br>
						It may not be appropriate for us to release certain information to you. Where information will not or cannot be disclosed, we will provide you with the reasons for non-disclosure.<br>
						<br>
						If we have obtained information about you from other people, upon your request, we will let you know the person we got it from.<br>
						<br>
						<b>2. You Can Find Out to Whom We Have Given Information About You</b><br>
						<br>
						If you ask, we will let you know the names of outside companies or organizations we have given information to. This may include information given to outside companies we have used to do work for us, such as mailing houses.<br>
						<br>
						<b>3. We Respond to Your Request Promptly</b><br>
						<br>
						We will deal quickly with your request to see your information, and always respond to you within 30 days. If we need to extend the time, or we have to refuse your request, we'll tell you why, subject to any legal restrictions and we will notify you of the new deadline, the reasons for the extension, and your rights under applicable legislation respecting the extension.<br>
						<br>
						<b>4. We Update Your Information From Other Sources</b><br>
						<br>
						Whenever possible, we will update any information obtained from any source.<br>
						If a third party has given us information which you tell us is wrong, we will give you the name and address of that party so that you can correct the information.<br>
						<br>
						<b>5. We Protect Other People's Privacy When We Make Information Available to You</b><br>
						<br>
						There may be files that include information about you and other customers, or that have information confidential to HOLT RENFREW or are the property of HOLT RENFREW. Because we must protect everyone's confidentiality and legal rights, we cannot make these files available to persons outside of HOLT RENFREW. However, we will make available to you any factual information about you contained in such files.<br>
						<br>
						<b>D. Security</b><br>
						<br>
						Holt Renfrew endeavours to maintain appropriate physical, procedural and technical security with respect to its offices and information storage facilities so as to prevent any loss, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure, or modification of Personal Information.
