Certain information, such as a driver's licence, although convenient for identification, is voluntary. It is up to you whether you want to provide this or other suitable identification, subject to any legal requirements. 
</p>
<p>
We collect, use and disclose personal information only for purposes that a reasonable person would consider appropriate in the circumstances. 
</p>
<p>
We may review and analyze your use of products and services, to help us serve you better, and to bring other products and services to your attention, which we feel, will be of benefit to you. We also collect and analyze information from other sources for the same purposes. 
</p>
<p>
Please note that aggregated information, where the identity of a specific individual cannot be determined, is not Personal Information. Holt Renfrew reserves the right to use aggregated information in any manner it thinks appropriate. For example, Holt Renfrew may also prepare aggregated user statistics or information summaries to describe our services and their popularity to our suppliers and prospective advertisers and for other lawful purposes. Any aggregated user statistics and information will not contain any Personal Information. 
</p>

</p>
<p>
Holt Renfrew may obtain and collect your Personal Information through a variety of means (e.g. you provide it verbally or in writing (including via electronic media)). The following are examples of how we may do so:</p>
<ul>

<ul>
<li> Credit Card Applications: As a service to eligible customers, Holt Renfrew's partner American Express may extend a credit card to eligible applicants. Holt Renfrew may be involved in such application process.</li>

When participating in these promotions and contests, you may be asked to provide us with certain Personal Information. You are free at any time to have your Personal Information removed from our database or to have your name removed from our marketing distribution list on a go-forward basis. </li>
<li> Clickstreaming: Clickstreaming is a technology that allows a website operator to track the paths that surfers take as they access a website and look at the site's pages, and as they use links to other sites. Holt Renfrew collects such information from visitors to www.holtrenfrew.com.</li>
<li>Web Beacons: Web beacons are small, graphic images that allows a website operator to collect certain information and monitor user activity on its website. A web beacon is a very small pixel which is invisible to the user. Holt Renfrew uses web beacons in its e-newsletter to collect non-personal information. </li>
<li>Web site traffic information, which is monitored and analyzed in order to determine which features and services are popular and useful to visitors, so that we can improve our services.</li>
</ul>
<p> Holt Renfrew may also prepare aggregated user statistics or information summaries to describe our services and their popularity to our suppliers and prospective advertisers and for other lawful purposes. Any aggregated user statistics and information will not contain any Personal Information. 
</p>
</li>


<li>How Holt Renfrew May Disclose Personal Information 

<p>Holt Renfrew does not sell to third parties any Personal Information we collect. Holt Renfrew may transfer some information we collect to selected service providers, leased partners and suppliers who help us provide personalized services and advertising to you. 
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>
<b>B. Your Consent</b> 
</p><ol>
<li><b>Your Information is Obtained or Used Only With Your Consent</b> 
<p>
We obtain your consent before we: </p>
<ul>
<li> offer you other products and services</li>
<li> send you information about products and services by means of direct marketing </li>
<li> provided it is legally permitted, share your information in confidence within HOLT RENFREW and with leased partners </li>
<li> obtain, use or disclose to other persons, information about you unless we are obliged to do so by law or to protect our interests </li>
<li> use your information in any way we did not tell you about previously. </li>
</ul>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<b> Your Consent Can Be Express Or Implied</b>
<p> Express consent can be verbal or written.</p>
<p> Your implied consent when we can reasonably conclude that you've given consent by some action you have taken, or when you decide not to take action. By choosing to provide us with your Personal Information you are consenting to its use in accordance with the principles outlined in this Privacy Policy and as may be further outlined at the time of collection. For example, if we give you an opportunity to tell us you don't want direct marketing material and you don't tell us that you don't want us to send it, we can conclude that you have no objection. We will rely on your implied consent to use and disclose identifying information about you, such as your name and address. 
</p>
</li>
<li>
<b>You May Withdraw Your Consent After You Have Given It </b>
<p>The protection of your Personal Information is of the utmost importance to us. If you don't want Holt Renfrew to use Personal Information collected about you for marketing or publicity purposes, please tell us at the time the information is collected. 
</p>
<p>
You can withdraw your consent any time after you have given it to us, provided there are no legal requirements to prevent this, by calling 416-960-2860 or by sending an e-mail to privacy.office@holtrenfrew.com. 
</p>
<p>
Please note, if you don't consent to certain uses of information, or if you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide you with a particular product or service. If so, we will explain the situation to you to help you with your decision. 
</p>
</li>
<li><b> We Ask for Your Consent Before Sharing Information With Other People</b>
<p> We may share information about you within HOLT RENFREW and with our leased partners, however we do not release it to anyone outside of HOLT RENFREW without your consent. 
</p>
<p>
There are some exceptions to the above rule. For example, we may collect, use or disclose information without your consent if we: 
</p>
<p>
<b>a) use an outside company to process information</b><br>
<br>
At times we may use the expertise of an outside company to do work for us involving some of your information. When we do, we select the company carefully and confirm that it uses security and privacy standards comparable to those of HOLT RENFREW. 
</p>
<p>
<b>b) must disclose information for legal reasons </b>
</p><p>We may be compelled to release information by a court of law, or other legal or regulatory authority. If so, our policy is to release information only to the extent that we have to. 
</p>
<p>
