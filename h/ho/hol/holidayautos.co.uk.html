<h3>Cookies</h3>
     <p> Each web site owned and operated by Holiday Autos group uses cookies. A cookie is a small text file of which there are three types:<br>
    Session cookies: These are used to maintain something called session state. If you consider your journey through the site to be a conversation with us and this cookie just reminds the site where we were in that conversation. These are required for the site to function but are not used in any way to identify you personally.
    </p>
	<p>
    <strong>Permanent cookies:</strong> These store a few numbers on your hard drive. You can view them by looking in the cookies directory of your browser installation if you are interested. They last for a long time and each time you come to our site you send us a copy of them. We use them to identify you between visits. For instance if you were looking at cars in Glasgow last time you were on the site and we have a deal we may use this cookie to recognise you and show you our great deal. They are not required for the site to work but may enhance your experience. We do not store any personal data in these cookies, just a unique number that identifies you to us.
    </p>
	<p>
    <strong>Third Party Cookies:</strong> You may have noticed that we carry advertising from third parties on our site. Occasionally they may send you a cookie. We have no control over these. 
    Although you cannot block "session" cookies as they are required for our site to function correctly you can configure your internet browser so that it can reject both "permanent" and "third party" cookies. How you do this will depend upon the internet browser you use (for example, Internet Explorer 5, Netscape 4 or Opera etc) and it is therefore impractical for us to detail here how you can reject those cookies. Please refer to the relevant internet browser manufacturer's website where you should be able to receive all the information you need."
