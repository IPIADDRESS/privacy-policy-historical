<b>Privacy Statement for HouseValues.com</b>
<br><br>
<b>(last updated: July 2002)</b>

<p>We, HouseValues.com, have created this privacy statement in
order to demonstrate our firm commitment to privacy. The privacy statement
discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices for this Web
site (the "Site"). By accessing our Site, you consent to the
collection and use of information described herein. If we decide to change our
privacy statement, we will post a new statement on our Site and update the
statement date. Therefore, we encourage you to check the date of our privacy
statement whenever you visit this Site to see if it has been updated since your
last visit. </p>

<b>Information We Collect</b>
<br><br>
<b>Personally Identifying Information </b>

<p class="MsoNormal">Our Site provides homeowners with various services related
to home selling such as estimates of current market value of homes, moving
costs, and mortgage or finance costs. In order to provide these services, we
collect information from homeowners and forward it to a local service provider
(such as licensed real estate agents or brokers) who uses the homeowner
information to prepare an estimate for the service requested. <o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">If you are a homeowner, we collect personally identifying
information, including your name, address, phone number, e-mail address, and
information about your home and moving plans. If you are a licensed real estate
agent or broker who is interested in preparing market evaluations and estimated
selling price ranges for HouseValues.com, we collect your contact and
professional information, including your name, company, address, phone number
and e-mail address. We also collect e-mail addresses from users who register to
receive our newsletter, Home Seller Tips, which contains a variety of useful
information. Regardless of whether you are a homeowner or a real estate agent
or broker, information that identifies you personally is collected from our
Site only if you supply it voluntarily by entering it on our Site. <o:p></o:p></p>

<b>E-mail Addresses </b>

<p class="MsoNormal">We collect e-mail addresses as part of providing our
services. Except for customer service purposes, we will not send any e-mails to
you unless you request information from us. We only send our Home Seller Tips
e-mail newsletter to homeowners who request the newsletter. If you have
registered to receive our newsletter, you may opt out of receiving future
newsletters at any time. Please see the opting-out section below. Except as is
described in this policy, we will not disclose your email address to any third
party without your consent. <o:p></o:p></p>

<b>Aggregate Information </b>

<p class="MsoNormal">We collect aggregate information about you and your use of
our services. Such aggregate information includes, without limitation, site
traffic, page views, and impressions. This aggregate information may be
correlated to you for our internal use only. However, we may collect, compile,
store, publish, promote, sell, or otherwise disclose or use any and all
aggregate information, provided that, such information does not personally
identify you. <o:p></o:p></p>

<b>Cookies </b>

<p class="MsoNormal">We currently use cookies to identify users and customize
their experience on our site based on information they give us. Cookies are
small pieces of information or files that are stored on a user's computer by
the Web server through a user's browser for record keeping purposes. A cookie
itself is not designed or intended to read any information from your computer
(other than the contents of the cookie); rather, it is an identifier used by
the Web site that originally placed it your hard drive. The actual contents of
the cookie information can be retrieved by the same site's Web server in order
to personalize, monitor, or regulate the use of the site. <o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="normalblock"><a name="webbeacons"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal">Web
Beacons</b></a> <o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">A Web beacon, also known as a "Web bug," is a
small, graphic image on a Web page, Web-based document or in an e-mail message
that is designed to allow the site owner or a third party to monitor who is
visiting a site.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Web beacons are often
invisible to the user because they are typically very small (only 1-by-1 pixel)
and the same color as the background of the Web page, document or e-mail
message.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Web beacons are represented as
HTML IMG tags in the Web page; users can click on "view profiles" of
the web page to see whether the page is using a web beacon. <o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Web beacons collect the IP address of the computer that the
Web beacon is sent to, the URL of the page the Web beacon comes from and the
time it was viewed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Web beacons can
also be linked to personal information.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>For example, advertising networks use Web beacons to add information to
a personal profile of what sites a person is visiting and to determine what
banner ads to display based on the profile. Another use of Web beacons is to
provide an independent accounting of how many people have visited a particular
Web site. Web beacons are also used to gather statistics about Web browser
usage at different places on the Internet.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">We may use Web beacons on our site or other sites and may
permit third parties to place them on our site to monitor the effectiveness of
advertising or for other legitimate purposes. <o:p></o:p></p>

<b>Use and Disclosure of Data <o:p></o:p></b>
