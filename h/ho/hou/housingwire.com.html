		<strong>WHAT INFORMATION DO WE GATHER ABOUT YOU?</strong></p>
	<p>
		The information gathered when you interact with the HW Services falls into two categories: 1) Personal information, which includes personal information you supply when you subscribe, order, complete a survey, register for one of our sites, enter a contest or provide your email address and 2) Non-personal information collected through technology, which includes tracking information collected by us as well as third parties.</p>
	<p>
		<strong><em>Personal Information That You Give Us</em></strong></p>
	<p>
		<strong>Registration Information</strong></p>
	<p>
		Registration for the HW Services may require that you supply certain personal information, including a unique email address and demographic information (company name, job title, phone number and job function) to register.</p>
	<p>
		<strong>Billing and Credit Card Information</strong></p>
	<p>
		To enable payment and donations via the HW Services, we collect and store name, address, telephone number, email address, credit card information and other billing information. This information will only be shared with third parties who help to complete the purchase transaction. Examples of this include fulfilling orders and processing credit card payments.</p>
	<p>
		<strong>User Generated Content and Public Activities</strong></p>
	<p>
		We offer you opportunities to engage in public activities on HousingWire.com. "Public activities" are any actions you take on HousingWire.com that are designed to be visible to other users, including comments, recommendations, reader reviews, ratings or any other items that you submit. Any information you disclose in your public activities, along with your screen name or ID, or any image or photo, becomes public and may be used by HousingWire for online and offline promotional or commercial uses in any and all media. If you choose to engage in public activities, you should be aware that any personal information you submit can be read, collected and used by other users of these areas. We are not responsible for the personally identifiable information you choose to submit in the course of your public activities and we have no responsibility to publish, take down, remove or edit any of your public activities or submissions. For more information, read the Forums, Discussions and User Generated Content section of the&nbsp;Terms of Service.</p>
	<p>
		If you have registered for a HousingWire.com account, we will track and aggregate your public activities on HousingWire.com. By choosing to participate in public activities, you are electing to share and display such public activities via HousingWire.com. Also, public activities may be included in RSS feeds, APIs and made available to other websites via other formats. As a result, your public activities may appear on other websites, blogs, or feeds. Keep in mind that we are not responsible for any personal information you choose to make public via your public activities, and you agree that such sharing will be deemed to have been done by you, not HousingWire. When you share or recommend links to content on a third-party platform (such as Facebook, Google+ and Twitter), that action and any information you share will be covered by their privacy policy.</p>
	<p>
		<strong>Contests, Sweepstakes and Special Offers</strong></p>
	<p>
		HousingWire collects personal information from you when you participate in sweepstakes, contests or special offers.
