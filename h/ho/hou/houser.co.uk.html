            <p>
                This Privacy Policy describes the policies and procedures of Houser.co.uk (“Houser”, “we”, “our” or “us”) on the collection, use and disclosure of your information on www.houser.co.uk (referred to as our "Site") and the services, features, content or applications we offer (collectively referred to as "Services"). When you use our Services, you are consenting to the collection, transfer, manipulation, storage, disclosure and other uses of your information as described in this Privacy Policy.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our Privacy Policy is incorporated as part of the Houser Terms of Use. Please read this Policy and our Terms carefully before using our Services. If you do not want to be bound by our Privacy Policy, please do not use our Services.
            </p>
            <li><b>What is covered by our Privacy Policy?</b></li>
            <p>Our Privacy Policy covers the treatment of personally identifiable information (referred to as “Personal Information”) gathered when you use or access our Services. This Privacy Policy also covers our treatment of any Personal Information which landlords, tenants or our business partners share with us, or that we share with our business partners. </p>
            <p>This Privacy Policy does not apply to the practices of third parties that we do not own or control, including but not limited to any landlords, renters, third party websites, services and applications (referred to as “Third Party Services”) that you elect to access through the Services or to individuals that we do not manage or employ. While we attempt to facilitate access only to those Third Party Services that share our respect for your privacy or that you request through your use of the Services, we cannot take responsibility for the content or privacy policies of those Third Party Services. We encourage you to carefully review the privacy policies of any Third Party Services you access.</p>

            <li><b>Why do we collect information from you?</b></li>
            <p>Houser is a real estate information service. To provide our Services, we use information we collect in order to: </p>

            <ul>
                <li>Help you find the most relevant information for your situation by customizing our Services to optimise your experience; </li>
                <li>Keep you connected with Houser across the Internet and update you with residential real estate-related news and information, if you allow us to do so;</li>
                <li>Put you in touch with the right people to sell, buy, rent, or research residential real estate, obtain a mortgage, and to optimise the information we share with those parties to initiate a productive and efficient relationship.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Our goal in this policy is to be completely transparent about the data we collect, why we collect it, and how we use it, in order to make finding your new home a pleasant and memorable experience.</p>

            <li><b>What about International users?</b></li>
            <p>Your information may be maintained on and transferred to computers located outside your state, province, country or any jurisdiction. If you are located outside the United Kingdom and choose to use our Services, the information we gather will be transferred to the United Kingdom before processing. Your use of our Services and submission of any information represents your consent to such transfer.</p>

            <li><b>What Information do we collect?</b></li>
            <p>When you choose to use our Services we collect a variety of information including:</p>
            <p><b>Information you provide.</b>When using our Services, you may provide information about yourself, such as name, address, phone number, e-mail and details around a potential transaction. This may occur, for example, when you register on Houser, claim a home, correspond with a real estate agent via the Services, or complete other forms, such as a loan request. You may also provide information about a third party through the Services, for example, if you share a real estate listing with a recipient via email. We may combine this information with other information we collect from your interaction with and use of our Services or from other companies.</p>
            <p>In addition, when you order products or services through our Services, Houser may collect your credit/debit card information. This information is secured using industry-standard encryption technology. <b>Houser</b> will use this information solely to complete your order and will not share this information with outside parties, except to the extent necessary to complete the order or comply with applicable law.</p>

            <p>We also automatically receive and record information in our server logs from your browser, including your IP address, search queries, cookie information, and the listings and pages you request. We also record the details of your activity on the Services.</p>

            <p><b>Information collected using cookies.</b> Cookies are pieces of text that may be provided to your computer through your web browser when you access a website. Your browser stores cookies in a manner associated with each website you visit. We use cookies to enable our servers to recognise your web browser and tell us how and when you visit the Site and otherwise use the Services through the Internet. Our cookies do not, by themselves, contain Personal Information, and we do not combine the general information collected through cookies with other Personal Information to tell us who you are. As noted, however, we do use cookies to identify that your web browser has accessed aspects of the Services. Most browsers have an option for turning off the cookie feature, which will prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, as well as (depending on the sophistication of your browser software) allowing you to decide on acceptance of each new cookie in a variety of ways.</p>

            <p>However, if you choose to disable cookies, many of the free features and Services on <b>Houser</b> may not operate properly. Also, the pages on the Services may include Web beacons, which are electronic files to count users who have visited that page, to identify certain cookies on the computer or other electronic device accessing that page, or to collect other related information. </p>

            <p>This Privacy Policy covers our use of cookies only and does not cover the use of cookies by third parties, including our partners. We do not control when or how third parties place cookies on your computer. For example, third party websites to which a link points may set cookies on your computer. Ads appearing on the Services may be delivered to users by our advertising partners, who may set cookies. These cookies allow the ad server to recognise your computer each time they send you an online advertisement to compile information about you or others who use your computer. This information allows ad networks to, among other things, deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you. This Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies by <b>Houser</b> and does not cover the use of cookies by any third parties, including advertisers or partners.</p>
            <p><b>Information collected from Mobile Browsers.</b>  You can easily adjust the settings on your mobile device and mobile browser regarding cookies and sharing of certain information, such as your mobile device model or the language your mobile device uses, by adjusting the privacy and security settings on your mobile device.  Please refer to the instructions provided by your mobile service provider or mobile device manufacturer in order to do so.</p>
            <p><b>Information collected from Social Networks.</b> If you use the social networking connection functions offered through our Services, we may access all of your social network profile information that you have made available to be shared and to use it in accordance with this privacy policy.  Please refer to the instructions governing your social network account to manage the information that is shared through your account.</p>

            <p><b>Information collected from phone calls.</b> Calls to Houser or to third parties through Houser may be recorded or monitored for quality assurance and customer service purposes. If a call is recorded between you and a third party, it will be deemed private information in regards to both you and the third party, and may be released to either of you.</p>
            <p><b>Information collected from your interaction with our Services.</b> We collect statistical information about how users collectively interact with our Services. Some of this information is derived from Personal Information. This statistical information is not Personal Information and cannot be tied back to you or your web browser. This type of aggregate data enables us to figure out how often users use parts of the Services so that we can make the Services appealing to as many users as possible, and improve them. As part of this use of information, we may provide aggregate information to our partners about how our users, collectively, use our site. We share this type of statistical data so that our partners also understand how often people use their services and our Services, so that they, too, may provide you with an optimal online experience. Again, we never disclose aggregate information to a partner in a manner that would identify you personally. </p>
