In         short, by posting personal information online that is publicly accessible,         you may receive unsolicited messages from other parties in return.</p>      <p><strong>At Housing.com’s discretion:</strong> As and when we, in         our sole discretion, believe such disclosure to be necessary or appropriate         to investigate or resolve possible problems or inquiries, to protect our         business and assets, to defend our interests and/or to comply with our         legal and regulatory obligations; or </p>      <p>It is also possible that third parties may unlawfully intercept or access         transmissions or private communications.</p>      <p>&nbsp;</p>      <p><span class="subhead_L2">Choice/Opt-out</span><br>        Our users are given the opportunity to 'opt-out' of having their information         used for purposes not directly related to our site at the point where         we ask for information. For example, our order form has an 'opt-out' mechanism         so users who buy a product from us, but don't want any marketing material,         can keep their email address off of our lists.

When users submit sensitive information via the Web site, their information         is protected both online and off-line.</p>      <p>When our registration/order form asks users to enter sensitive information         (such as credit card number and/or social security number), that information         is encrypted and is protected with the best encryption software in the         industry — SSL. While on a secure page, such as our order form,         the lock icon on the bottom of Web browsers such as Netscape Navigator         and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to un-locked,         or open, when users are just "surfing".</p>      <p>While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online,         we also do everything in our power to protect user-information off-line.         All of our users' information, not just the sensitive information mentioned         above, is restricted in our offices. Only employees who need the information         to perform a specific job (for example, our billing clerk or a customer         service representative) are granted access to personally identifiable         information. Our employees must use password-protected screen-savers when         they leave their desk. When they return, they must re-enter their password         to re-gain access to user information. Furthermore, ALL employees are         kept up-to-date on our security and privacy practices. Every quarter,         as well as any time new policies are added, our employees are notified         and/or reminded about the importance we place on privacy, and what they         can do to ensure our users' information is protected. Finally, the servers         that store personally identifiable information are in a secure environment,         in a locked facility.</p>      <p>If users have any questions about the security at our Web site, users         can send an email to info@Housing.com.</p>      <p>&nbsp;</p>      <p><span class="subhead_L2">Supplementation of Information</span><br>        In order for this Web site to properly fulfill its obligation to users         it is necessary for us to supplement the information we receive with information         from 3rd party sources.</p>      <p>&nbsp;</p>      <p><span class="subhead_L2">Correcting/Updating/Deleting/Deactivating Personal         Information</span><br>        If a user's personally identifiable information changes (such as zip code,         phone, email or postal address), or if a user no longer desires our service,         we provide a way to correct, update or delete/deactivate users' personally         identifiable information. This can usually be done at the member information         page or by emailing our Customer Support at info@Housing.com.</p>      <p>&nbsp;</p>      <p><span class="subhead_L2">Notification of Changes</span><br>        If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes         to this privacy statement, the homepage, and other places we deem appropriate         so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use         it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it.</p>      <p>If, however, we are going to use users' personally identifiable information         in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection we will         notify users via email.</p>      <p>&nbsp;</p>      <p><span class="subhead_L2">Contact Information</span><br>        If users have any questions or suggestions regarding our privacy policy,         please email us at: info@Housing.com.<strong><br>        </strong></p>      <p><strong><span class="required">^</span></strong> <a href="#top">Back         to top</a></p> </td></tr></tbody></table>
