<p><strong>2.&nbsp; Web Site Usage Information</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>(i) Cookies</strong> <br>
We may use “cookies” to keep, and sometimes track, information about you.&nbsp; Cookies are small data files that are sent to your browser or related software from a Web server when you visit it and are stored on your computer's hard drive for record keeping purposes.&nbsp; Cookies track where you travel on our Web Site and what you look at and purchase.<strong> </strong>&nbsp;They may store the information in your shopping cart, and/or your username and password.&nbsp; A cookie may enable us to relate your use of our Web Site to other information about you, including your Personal Information.&nbsp; These purposes serve to improve and personalize your experience on our Web Site.&nbsp;</p>

<p>You may occasionally get cookies from our advertisers, which is standard in the internet industry.&nbsp; We do not control these cookies, and these cookies are not subject to our privacy policies.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Most Web browsers can be set to inform you when a cookie has been sent to you and provide you with the opportunity to refuse that cookie.&nbsp; Additionally, if you have a Flash player installed on your computer, your Flash player can be set to reject or delete Flash cookies.<strong>&nbsp; </strong>However, refusing a cookie may, in some cases, preclude you from using, or negatively impact the display or function of, the Web Site or certain areas or features of the Web Site.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>(ii) Clear GIFs&nbsp; </strong><br>
We may use “clear GIFs” (aka “Web beacons” or “pixel tags”) or similar technologies, in the Web Site and in our communications with you to enable us to know whether you have visited a web page or received a message.&nbsp; A clear GIF is typically a one-pixel, transparent image (although it can be a visible image as well), located on a web page or in an e-mail or other type of message, which is retrieved from a remote site on the internet enabling the verification of an individual’s viewing or receipt of a web page or message.&nbsp; A clear GIF may enable us to relate your viewing or receipt of a web page or message to other information about you, including your Personal Information.</p>

<p><strong>(iii) IP Address and Clickstream Data</strong><br>
Aggregated information, such as which pages users access or visit and information volunteered by users, such as survey information and/or Web Site registrations, is collected through various methods.&nbsp; For example, our server may automatically collect data about your server’s internet address when you visit us.&nbsp; This information, known as an Internet Protocol address, or IP Address, is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer by your internet service provider whenever you’re on the internet.&nbsp; When you request pages from our Web Site, our servers may log your IP Address and sometimes your domain name.&nbsp; Our server may also record the referring page that linked you to us (e.g., another web site or a search engine); the pages you visit on this Web Site; the web site you visit after this Web Site; the ads you see; the ads you click on; other information about the type of web browser, computer, platform, related software and settings you are using; any search terms you have entered on this Web Site or a referral site; and other web usage activity and data logged by our web servers.&nbsp; We use this information for internal system administration, to help diagnose problems with our server, and to administer our Web Site.&nbsp; Such information may also be used to gather broad demographic information, such as country of origin and internet service provider.&nbsp; We may also link this information with your Personal Information when we feel that it is necessary to enforce compliance with our rules and policies or Terms of Use or to protect our Web Site, customers or others.</p>

<p>Any or all of these activities with regard to Web Site usage information may be performed on our behalf by our services providers.</p>

<p><strong>(v)&nbsp; Aggregate Statistics</strong><br>

We may disclose aggregate statistics regarding user behavior as a measure of interest in, and use of, our Web Site and e-mails to third parties in the form of aggregate data, such as overall patterns or demographic reports that do not describe or identify any individual user.</p>
<p><strong>(vi)&nbsp; Legally Compelled Disclosures</strong><br>
We may disclose Personal Information to government authorities, and to other third parties when compelled to do so by government authorities, at our discretion, or otherwise as required or permitted by law, including but not limited to in response to court orders and subpoenas.&nbsp; We also may disclose Personal Information when we have reason to believe that someone has committed, or will commit, unlawful acts or acts that endanger the health or safety of another; is causing injury to, or interference with, our rights or property, other users of the Web Site, or anyone else that could be harmed by such activities.&nbsp; In some situations, we may share your Personal Information, on a confidential basis, with third parties who perform a particular service on our behalf, such as sending e-mails.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>1. &nbsp;General </strong><br>
No transmission of data over the internet is guaranteed to be completely secure.&nbsp; It may be possible for third parties not under the control of the&nbsp;Newspaper to intercept or access transmissions or private communications unlawfully, including in the case of your contacting us by e-mail or a “contact us” or similar feature on our Web Site.&nbsp; Accordingly, though the&nbsp;Newspaper may take reasonable steps to protect the security and integrity of all Personal Information provided to this Web Site, due to the inherent nature of the internet as an open global communications vehicle, we cannot guarantee that information, during transmission through the internet or while stored on our system or otherwise in our care, will be absolutely safe from intrusion by others, such as hackers.&nbsp; Any such transmission is done at your own risk.</p>

<p>You may be able to create an account on our Web Site with a username and password.&nbsp; If so, you are responsible for maintaining the strict confidentiality of your account password, and you shall be responsible for any access to or use of the Web Site by you or any person or entity using your password, whether or not such access or use has been authorized by or on behalf of you, and whether or not such person or entity is your employee or agent.&nbsp; You agree to (a) immediately notify the&nbsp;Newspaper of any unauthorized use of your password or account or any other breach of security, and (b) ensure that you exit from your account at the end of each session.&nbsp; It is your sole responsibility to control the dissemination and use of your password, control access to and use of your account, and notify the&nbsp;Newspaper when you desire to cancel your account on this Web Site.&nbsp; We will not be responsible or liable for any loss or damage arising from your failure to comply with this provision.</p>
<p>We will have no liability for disclosure of your information due to errors or unauthorized acts of third parties during or after transmission.</p>
<p>In the unlikely event that we believe that the security of your Personal Information in our possession or control may have been compromised, we may seek to notify you of that development.&nbsp; If a notification is appropriate, we would endeavor to do so as promptly as possible under the circumstances, and, to the extent we have your e-mail address, we may notify you by e-mail or by other means as required by law.&nbsp; <strong>You consent to our use of e-mail as a means of such notification.</strong>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.&nbsp; Phishing<br>
</strong>With identity theft a continuing problem, it has become increasingly common for unauthorized individuals to send e-mail messages to consumers, purporting to represent a legitimate company such as a bank or on-line merchant, requesting that the consumer provide personal, often sensitive information.&nbsp; Sometimes, the domain name of the e-mail address from which the e-mail appears to have been sent, and the domain name of the web site requesting such information, appears to be the domain name of a legitimate, trusted company.&nbsp; In reality, such sensitive information may be collected by an unauthorized individual to be used for purposes of identity theft. This illegal activity has come to be known as "phishing."</p>
<p>If you receive an e-mail or other correspondence requesting that you provide any sensitive information (including your Web Site password or credit card information) via e-mail or to a web site that does not seem to be affiliated with our Web Site, or that otherwise seems suspicious to you, please do not provide such information, and report such request to us at&nbsp;<strong><a href="mailto:help@chron.com">help@chron.com</a>.</strong></p>

<p>You acknowledge and agree that the SMS Service is provided via wireless systems which use radios (and other means) to transmit communications over complex networks.&nbsp; We do not guarantee that your use of the SMS Service will be private or secure, and we are not liable to you for any lack of privacy or security you may experience.&nbsp; You are fully responsible for taking precautions and providing security measures best suited for your situation and intended use of the SMS Service.&nbsp; We may also access the content of your account and wireless account with your carrier for the purpose of identifying and resolving technical problems and service-related complaints.</p>
<p>By signing up for the SMS Service, you consent to receive, from time to time, further messages which may include news, promotions and offers from us, our affiliates and partners, and, unless and until you have opted-out of these activities by following the instructions in the <strong>Right to Opt-out</strong> section above.&nbsp; Please follow the instructions provided to you by third parties to unsubscribe from their messages.</p>
