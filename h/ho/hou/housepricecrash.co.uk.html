</p>

<p>
	<br><strong>8.&nbsp; Do We Share Your Data?</strong>
</p>

<p>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 8.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;We may sometimes contract with third parties to supply services to you on Our behalf. These may include service delivery, search engine facilities, advertising, and marketing. In some cases, the third parties may require access to some or all of your data. Where any of your data is required for such a purpose, We will take all reasonable steps to ensure that your data will be handled safely, securely, and in accordance with your rights, Our obligations, and the obligations of the third party under the law.
</p>

<p>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 8.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;We may compile statistics about the use of Our Site including data on traffic, usage patterns, user numbers, sales, and other information. All such data will be anonymised and will not include any personally identifying data, or any anonymised data that can be combined with other data and used to identify you. We may from time to time share such data with third parties such as prospective investors, affiliates, partners, and advertisers. Data will only be shared and used within the bounds of the law.
</p>

<p>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 8.3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;We may sometimes use third party data processors that are located outside of the European Economic Area (“the EEA”) (The EEA consists of all EU member states, plus Norway, Iceland, and Liechtenstein). Where We transfer any personal data outside the EEA, We will take all reasonable steps to ensure that your data is treated as safely and securely as it would be within the UK and under the GDPR including:
</p>

<p>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;8.3.1&nbsp; Putting EU Model Contracts in place.
</p>

<p>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 8.4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;In certain circumstances, We may be legally required to share certain data held by Us, which may include your personal data, for example, where We are involved in legal proceedings, where We are complying with legal requirements, a court order, or a governmental authority.
</p>

<p>
	<br><strong>9.&nbsp; What Happens If Our Business Changes Hands?</strong>
</p>

<p>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 9.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;We may, from time to time, expand or reduce Our business and this may involve the sale and/or the transfer of control of all or part of Our business. Any personal data that you have provided will, where it is relevant to any part of Our business that is being transferred, be transferred along with that part and the new owner or newly controlling party will, under the terms of this Privacy Policy, be permitted to use that data only for the same purposes for&nbsp; which it was originally collected by Us.
</p>

<p>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 9.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;In the event that any of your data is to be transferred in such a manner, you will be contacted in advance and informed of the changes. When contacted you will not, however, be given the choice to have your data deleted or withheld from the new owner or controller.
</p>
