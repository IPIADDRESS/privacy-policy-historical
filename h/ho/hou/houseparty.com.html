<div id="faq">

	<div id="column_left">
		 <p>Welcome to <em><a href="http://www.houseparty.com" target="_blank">www.houseparty.com</a></em> (the “<u>Website</u>”) operated by House Party, Inc., a Delaware   corporation with offices at One Bridge Street, Suite 105, Irvington,   NY 10533 (“<u>House Party</u>”, “<u>we</u>”, “<u>our</u>”,   or “<u>us</u>”). This Privacy Policy describes how we use and share   the personally identifiable information (“PII”) we collect through   this Website.</p> <p><strong>Your Consent to This Privacy   Policy </strong></p> <p>The Website offers visitors   to the Website (“<u>you</u>” or “<u>your</u>”) the opportunity   to browse and interact with certain features on the Website. By browsing   or using this Website, you are consenting to the collection, use and   disclosure of your information by House Party as described herein.</p> <p><strong>Changes to this Privacy   Policy</strong></p> <p>House Party reserves the right   to change how we handle the information we collect through the Website   at any time. We will update this Privacy Policy to reflect any changes   in our privacy collection and handling practices, and will indicate   that changes to this Privacy Policy have been made by listing a new   date under “Last Modified” at the end of this Agreement. Such changes   will take effect immediately once posted to the Website.</p> <p><strong>Privacy Notices</strong></p> <p>This Privacy Policy may be   supplemented or amended from time to time by “privacy notices” posted   on this Website. These privacy notices provide a level of detail that   we cannot provide in this more general description of our privacy practices.   For example, certain pages of this Website may contain privacy notices   providing details about the PII we collect on those pages, why we need   that information, and choices you may have about the ways we use that   information.</p> <p><strong>What type of PII does House   Party collect?</strong></p> <p>House Party does not require   you to provide us with any PII in order to browse the Website. However,   if you choose to register on the Website, you will be required to provide   certain PII to us. You may wish to register on our Website in order   to receive information from House Party, to apply to become a party   host, to register as a party guest, or to use certain interactive features   of our Website.</p> <p><strong>How do we use and share   the PII we collect<em>?</em></strong></p> <p>We may use your PII to provide   you with information you may request regarding our company, parties,   or other information you may request through our Website; to process   your application to host a party; to process your application to join   certain groups or programs through our Website; to process an application   for employment you may submit through our Website; to maintain your   online profile; to communicate with you regarding your profile or any   parties you have requested to host or attend as a guest; to process   your entry if you have entered any contests or sweepstakes on our Website;   and to learn more about your needs and wishes to improve this Website   and other aspects of our services. In addition, if you register on our   Website as a potential host, party guest, or otherwise, we will add   you to our general e-mail list. </p> <p>House Party may provide your   PII to entities who work on our behalf or with us. These entities may   use your PII to provide you with materials or gifts related to a party   you may host, to help fulfill your requests in connection with the Website   and to help us communicate with you about different resources offered   as part of the Website. For instance, we may transfer information submitted   by you, including PII, to service providers and other third parties   who assist us in running the Website.</p> <p>We may share your PII with   the companies for which we create (and for which you may host) parties   (our “Clients”). Our Clients are thrilled that many of you will   be hosting parties involving their brands, products or services, and   they may wish to stay in contact with you following the completion of   these parties. If you do not wish to be contacted by any of our Clients   following completion of a party, feel free to opt out in any e-mail   sent to you by a Client, and the Client will honor your request. Please   keep in mind that opting out of further communication with a Client   who send you an e-mail will not be deemed an opt out request for communications   from House Party, and opting out from communications from House Party   will not preclude you from receiving further communications from any   of our Clients with whom you have established a separate opt in relationship.   If you wish to opt out of communications from House Party, please see   the section on Opting Out, below.</p> <p>House Party may also share   your PII with other third parties for direct marketing purposes, and   you acknowledge that the use and handling of your PII by such third   parties will not be governed by the terms of this Privacy Policy. You   may opt-out of such sharing of your PII, as described below.</p> <p>We may also release your PII   to third parties if we believe such release is necessary to comply with   the law (e.g., a legal process or a statutory authorization, including   in connection with take down requests pursuant to the Digital Millennium   Copyright Act as described in our <u>Terms of Service</u>), to apply   or enforce our customer agreements, to protect our rights or property,   if we reasonably believe that a danger to any person requires disclosure   of such PII, or as part of a corporate reorganization, consolidation,   merger, or sale of substantially all of the assets of House Party.</p> <p>Please keep in mind that some   of the content you post to the Website is publicly viewable to all visitors   to the Website or to certain third party recipients designated by you.   Do not post any content to the Website or send any content to a third   party that you don’t want others to see. In addition, please respect   the privacy rights of others when posting information to the Website,   and do not post any photos or video of individuals if such individuals   would object to you doing so (in addition, all such postings must comply   with the requirements for Registrant Content as set forth in our <u> Terms of Service</u>).</p> <p><strong>Opting Out of E-mail Communications</strong></p> <p>If you would rather us not   share your PII with any third party for direct marketing purposes, please   either (1) do not submit PII to House Party through the Website or (2)   indicate your desire for us not to share your PII with Clients or other   third parties for direct marketing purposes by submitting such a request   in writing (an “<u>Opt-Out Request</u>”) to us at: House Party,   Inc., One Bridge Street, Suite 105, Irvington, NY 10533 or by email   at <a href="mailto:legal@houseparty.com" target="_blank">legal@houseparty.com</a>.</p> <p>Please note that we may not   be able to comply with your Opt-Out Request immediately, and until we   are able to comply with such request we may continue to use your PII   as described in this Privacy Policy. Please note that after receiving   your Opt-Out Request, we may continue to maintain your name and other   PII to help us ensure that we can honor such request, to communicate   to you about your account, and for other purposes not related to direct   marketing.</p> <p>If we receive your Opt-Out   Request after having shared your PII with a third party for direct marketing   purposes, House Party may not have the ability to control the use of   such PII by such third party (or any other party to whom such third   party may have transferred your PII), and in such an event you agree   that House Party shall not be responsible or liable, directly or indirectly,   for any damages or loss caused or alleged to be caused by or in connection   with the use of such PII by any such third party or resulting from any   such transfer or disposition. If you are concerned about House Party   sharing your PII with third parties or otherwise transferring or disposing   your PII, you should not provide your PII to House Party.</p> <p><strong>What if I refer a friend   to House Party?</strong></p> <p>You may decide to provide us   with a friend's e-mail address or other information through our Website,   by using our “refer a friend” function, our party invitation tool,   or otherwise.&nbsp; If you use our "refer a friend" function, House   Party will send only the specified e-mail message to your friend, as   indicated on the page on which you type your friend’s e-mail address,   and we will use the information you provide only to personalize and   send the message to your friend.&nbsp; If you use our Website to invite a   friend to a party you are hosting, we may send a separate e-mail to   your friend explaining what the invitation and House Party are all about,   and we or our Clients may send follow-up e-mails regarding the party   you are hosting . Whether you use the "refer a friend" function   or invite your friend to a party you are hosting, we will not add your   friend our general mailing list unless your friend decides to register   on our Website. </p> <p><strong>What other information does   House Party collect? </strong></p> <p>We also may collect anonymous   and aggregate information from you about your preferences in navigating   the Website by using cookies, action tags and other methods. Cookies   are small text files that identify your computer. We may use cookies   to, among other things, monitor Website usage, customize Website features,   identify your computer’s operating system and browser, and complete   transactions. An action tag is a small, graphic image on a webpage that   is designed to allow the website owner or a third party to monitor who   is visiting a website by collecting the IP address of the computer to   which the tag is sent, the URL of the webpage that the tag comes from   and the time that such webpage was viewed. Tags may be associated with   cookie information. We may also use such anonymous and aggregate information   for promotional purposes.</p> <p>If you do not want us to track   such information about you, you can set your browser to warn you before   accepting cookies and refuse cookies when your browser alerts you to   their presence. You can also adjust the settings in your browser to   refuse all cookies. However, if your browser does not accept cookies,   you may not be able to use or access certain features of our Website. </p> <p><strong>How can you access and update   your information?</strong></p> <p>You always have the opportunity   to review and change the information you provide to us by logging into   the Website and entering in the new information yourself. You can edit   your name, contact information and preferences by logging into your   account on the Website. </p> <p>You may ask to have your account   information removed from our active databases; however, as a security   measure we "back up" the data stored on our systems, and such   prior information may not be completely removed from archives of our   databases. Therefore, you should not expect that all of your personal   information will be completely removed from our databases in response   to your requests. </p> <p><strong>How do we ensure security   of your information? </strong></p> <p>We take reasonable precautions   to protect the confidentiality and security of the personal information   we collect through this Website. Additionally, we use physical and electronic   security measures to protect your PII. However, it is important that   you understand, that no website or database is completely secure or   “hacker proof,” and we therefore cannot guarantee that your information   will not be lost, disclosed or accessed by accidental circumstances   or by the unauthorized acts of others.</p> <p><strong>How is information handled   for users outside of the United States?</strong></p> <p>If you are visiting this Website   from a country other than the countries in which our servers are located   (currently the United States), the various communications will necessarily   result in the transfer of information across international boundaries.   By visiting this Website and communicating electronically with us, you   consent to the processing and transfer of your data as set out in this   Privacy Policy. In addition, if you are located outside of the United   States, you expressly consent to the transfer of your PII to House Party   and (unless you have opted out of sharing your PII with third parties)   its Clients or third party partners in the United States or in other   countries in which our Clients or third party partners may be located.</p> <p><strong>Does House Party provide   links to other websites? </strong></p> <p>House Party may provide links   to other websites or resources of possible interest to you. Because   we have no control over unaffiliated websites to which we provide links,   the collection and use of your PII and other information by such websites   shall be subject to the policies and procedures of such websites and   not this Privacy Policy.</p> <p><strong>What are our policies regarding   children?</strong></p> <p>You must be fourteen (14) years   of age or older in order to register on the Website. House Party requires   the consent of a parent or guardian before an individual under the age   of eighteen (18) may be considered as a potential host for a party featured   on our Website. </p> <p>House Party does not knowingly   collect PII from anyone under thirteen (13) years of age. If any children   under thirteen (13) years of age wish to attend parties offered through   House Party, we request that the parents of these children register   on our Website rather than the children themselves, as we will not allow   children under age thirteen (13) to register on our Website.</p> <p><strong>Do we have a mechanism to   address complaints about the handling of information that we collect?</strong></p> <p>If you have questions or concerns   about any of our information collection or handling practices, please   contact us at <a href="mailto:help@houseparty.com" target="_blank">help@houseparty.com</a>.</p> <p>Last Updated: November 7, 2008</p>	</div><!-- end column_left -->
