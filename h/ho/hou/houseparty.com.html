<!-- end of post-message --> <h1>Privacy Policy </h1>
   <p> We  at House Three (the company that owns and operates houseparty.com) are  dedicated to protecting your privacy and handling any personal  information we obtain from you with care and respect. This notice  explains our online information collection and use practices. Please  take the time to read and understand this policy so that you can  understand how we use your personal information. </p>

   <p><strong>• What Information Do We Collect? </strong></p>
   <p> There are two types of information that may be collected on  houseparty.com: anonymous and personally identifiable. Anonymous  information is not associated with specific individuals. For instance,  we may know how many people read this Privacy Policy today, but we  won't necessarily know their names or addresses. Personally  identifiable information reveals who you are and/or how you can be  contacted. It generally includes your name, address, phone number and  email address.</p>
   <p>Information You Provide to Us: We  encourage guests to surf houseparty.com, view content and learn more  about our company and service offerings without any personal  information being collected. Much of the personally identifiable  information we receive comes directly from guests who are interested in  obtaining more information about houseparty.com, our offerings or wish  to participate in one of our promotions or services. Typically, this  information could include the guest's name, postal address, email  address, and telephone number. We may also collect other types of  information such as gender, age, number of children, and personal  interests, which we may associate with personally identifiable  information. </p>
   <p>Information Collected Through Technology: We  collect information through technology to make our site more  interesting and useful to you. For instance, when you come to one of  our sites, we collect your IP address. An IP address is often  associated with the portal through which you enter the Internet, like  your ISP (Internet service provider), your company, or your school.  Standing alone, your IP address is not personally identifiable. At  times, we also use IP addresses to collect information regarding the  frequency with which our guests visit various parts of our sites. We  may combine this information with personally identifiable information. <br>
       <br>
     Our site also uses cookies. Cookies are pieces of information that a  Web site sends to your computer while you are viewing the Web site. We  and other companies use cookies for a variety of purposes. For  instance, when you return to one of our sites after logging in, cookies  provide information to the site so that the site will remember who you  are. You can choose to have your computer warn you each time a cookie  is being sent, or you can choose to turn off all cookies. You do this  through your browser (like Netscape Navigator or Internet Explorer)  settings. Each browser is a little different, so look at your browser  Help menu to learn the correct way to modify your cookies. <br>

     <br>
     There may be instances when advertisements are managed and placed on  our site by third parties. These companies are called "network  advertisers." Network advertisers who place advertisements on our site  may also use cookies to collect non-personally identifiable information  when you click on or move your cursor over one of their banner  advertisements. You may not realize this information is being  collected. In some cases, we may have access to information from  cookies used by network advertisers on our site and this information  may permit us to identify other sites that you have visited that are  also associated with the network advertiser. Finally, once you've  clicked on an advertisement and have left our site, our Privacy Policy  no longer applies and you must read the privacy policy of the  advertiser to see how your personal information will be handled on  their site. </p>
   <p> <strong>• How Do We Use Your Information?</strong> </p>
   <p> We may analyze information provided directly by you, or obtained  through cookies or third parties to carry out the promotions or  services that you have signed up for or otherwise expressed an interest  in. For example, we may use your information for sending electronic  postcards and email messages on your behalf. <br>

       <br>
     We may take your personally identifiable information and make it  non-personally identifiable, either by combining it with information  about other individuals (aggregating your information with information  about other individuals), or by removing characteristics (such as your  name) that make the information personally identifiable to you  (de-personalizing your information). Given the nature of this  information, there are no restrictions under this Privacy Policy upon  our right to aggregate or de-personalize your personal information, and  we may use and/or share with third parties the resulting non-personally  identifiable information in any way. </p>
   <p> <strong>• How Do We Secure Collected Information?</strong> </p>
   <p> The security and confidentiality of your information is extremely  important to us. We have implemented technical, administrative, and  physical security measures to protect guest information from  unauthorized access and improper use. From time to time, we review our  security procedures in order to consider appropriate new technology and  methods. Please be aware though that, despite our best efforts, no  security measures are perfect or impenetrable. </p>
   <p> <strong>• How Can You Edit Your Contact Information?</strong> </p>

   <p> You can access and update any contact information you may have given us  (such as, your postal address, email address, or any other information  that would directly enable us to contact you) by contacting us via  email at <a href="mailto:help@houseparty.com">help@houseparty.com</a>.  Please include information in the email that will help us identify you  so we can assist you with your request. We may also provide you an  opportunity to update your contact information by sending you an email  or other communication that invites your response. </p>
   <p> <strong>• Children's Privacy</strong> </p>
   <p>We  recognize the need to provide additional privacy protections when  children visit our site or wish to participate in promotions or  services offered through our site. This Section is designed to answer  your questions regarding our privacy policies and principles with  respect to children under the age of 13. </p>
   <p>The  Children's Online Privacy Protection Act ("COPPA") requires that we  inform parents and legal guardians about how we collect, use, and  disclose personal information from children under 13 years of age; and  that we obtain the consent of parents and guardians in order for  children under 13 years of age to use certain features of our Web  sites. </p>

   <p>We require children under the age of  13 to obtain verifiable parental consent before they can participate in  any promotion or service offered on our site. We will only obtain an  email address from a child under the age of 13 without such prior  parental consent to a) respond directly to the child's request on a  one-time basis; or b) request the name or online contact information of  a parent for the purpose of obtaining verifiable parental consent or  providing parental notification. </p>
   <p>We will use our&nbsp;best effort to provide parental notification, which will include the nature <br>
     and intended use of any of the child's personal information. We will  provide the parent a description of the specific types of personal  information collected from their child upon request. We will allow the  parent to refuse further use or future online collection of personal  information collected from their child. </p>
   <p>We  will provide parents notice by email of any material changes in the way  we intend to collect, use, and/or share a child's personal information.  Please note that, at all times, parents should update their personal  information to provide us current email addresses. We will apply  material changes in our Privacy Policy as it relates to children's  privacy only in conformance with applicable law, including any  applicable provisions of COPPA that require parental consent. </p>
   <p> <strong>• How Can You Ask Questions or Send Comments About This Privacy Policy?</strong> </p>

   <p>If  you have questions or wish to send us comments about this Privacy  Policy, please send an email with your questions or comments to <a href="mailto:help@houseparty.com">help@houseparty.com</a> or write us: </p>

   <p> Our security and privacy policy are periodically reviewed and enhanced as necessary. <br>
     We reserve the right to edit this policy at any time. We will contact  you via email and post notification if there are any material changes  in our privacy practices. We also encourage you to check the privacy  policy out periodically. </p>
