		<p><strong>Personalized experience.</strong> In order to deliver information specifc to your needs, or to make your experience more convenient, we may use your identifiable information in a variety of ways on our webpages and in our emails. These methods may include: sending to you emails based on the information you provided or presenting you with particular offerings on our website based on your geographic location. When you enter a contest or take some action on our website that requires you to enter personal information, we may also use your personal information to automatically enter data into the required data fields for that contest or action.</p>
		<p><strong>Contests and sweepstakes.</strong> We regularly run co-sponsored contests and giveaways. Participation in these contests is completely voluntary; you have the choice whether or not to disclose information required for contest registration. Information requested may include: contact information (such as name and shipping address), and demographic information (such as zip code, age level). Contact information is used to notify winners and award prizes. Additionally, we sometimes share registration information with our co-sponsors. We are not responsible for the use of such information by these or other parties. By participating in our contests, you agree we may use your information for marketing or promotional purposes.</p>

		<h2 id="secure">How does HOB protect my information and my orders? </h2>
		<p><strong>Data security with online orders.</strong> We use advanced security methods (Secure Socket Layer (SSL) 128-bit encryption) on all pages transmitting private financial information, such as credit card numbers. The SSL protocol ensures that your information is sent directly to HOB and that only HOB can decode it.</p>
		<p><strong>Physical security of equipment storing personally identifiable information.</strong> Access to our computer equipment (servers) storing personally identifiable information is restricted to authorized personnel.

		<p>As a general audience site, we do not knowingly collect or use personal information from children under 13 without first obtaining verifiable consent from their parents.

		<p><strong>Cookies.</strong>  We use cookies; a small amount of data, often containing an anonymous unique identifier, sent from our computers and stored on your computer system. We set cookies on your computer for a number of purposes, including to: ensure you do not see the same ad repeatedly, deliver content specific to your interests, and save your password so you do not have to re-enter it each time you visit our site.</p>
		<p><strong>Web beacons.</strong> Our webpages and email messages may contain electronic images known as web beacons (sometimes called single-pixel gifs) that allow us to count how many users access featured content.
