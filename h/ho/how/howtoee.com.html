<br>
As a fellow Internet user, we totally respect your online privacy. So it goes 
without saying that we are fully committed to safeguarding your online privacy 
while you're here at the <a href="http://www.HowToee.com">www.HowToee.com</a></font></font><font size="2" face="Arial"> website.<br>
<br>
And that's precisely why we've decided to include the following, which discloses 
the information gathering and dissemination practices for this website.<br>
<br>
<b>Log Files</b><br>
<br>
Like most standard websites, this website uses log files. These include: 
Internet Protocol addresses (IP addresses), browser type, Internet Service 
Provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, and the 
number of clicks to analyze trends, administer the site, track user movement in 
the aggregate, and to gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP 
addresses, etc., are not linked to personally identifiable information.<br>
<br>
<b>Web Cookies and Beacons</b><br>
<br>
Web cookies (also known as HTTP cookies, or just cookies) are parcels of text 
that are sent by a server to a Web browser, and then sent back unchanged by the 
browser each time it accesses that server. In other words, a cookie is a piece 
of data stored on a userâ€™s computer that is tied to information about the user.<br>
<br>
Web beacons are objects that are embedded in a webpage or email that are 
invisible to the user, but allow checking that a user has viewed the page or 
email. Other names are web bug, tracking bug, tag or page tag.<br>
<br>
This website does use cookies. Additionally, some of my business partners (for 
example, advertisers) may use cookies and web beacons as well. This site has no 
access to, or control of advertisers' web cookies or web beacons.<br>
<br>
If you wish to disable cookies, you may do so through your individual browser 
options. Please check your browser's help section for instructions on how to do 
this.<br>
<br>
<b>Links</b><br>

This website contains links to other websites. Please be aware that we are not 
responsible for the privacy practices of other websites. We encourage you, when 
you leave this website, to read the privacy policy (or privacy statement) of 
each and every website you visit, as this particular privacy policy applies 
solely to this particular website.<br>
<br>
<b>Advertisers</b><br>
<br>
We use outside advertising networks and companies in order to display ads on this 
site. These ads may contain cookies and/or web beacons in order to collect data 
in the ad serving process. These such cookies and/or web beacons are collected 
by the companies and/or advertising networks, themselves. We do not have any 
access to this information.<br>
