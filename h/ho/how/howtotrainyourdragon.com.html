        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p></p>
<p>
	<strong>LAST UPDATED: July 2, 2015</strong>
</p>
<p>
	DreamWorks Animation SKG, Inc. (“<strong>DreamWorks</strong>“) and
	its subsidiaries are concerned about privacy issues and want you to
	be familiar with how we collect, use and disclose information. This
	Privacy Policy describes our practices in connection with the
	DreamWorks mobile application (“<strong>App</strong>“) or website
	through which you are accessing this Privacy Policy, as well as in
	connection with HTML-formatted email messages that we send to you and
	that link to this Privacy Policy (collectively, the “<strong>Services</strong>“).
	By using the Services or by providing your consent to your child’s
	use of the Services, you agree to this Privacy Policy. If you provide
	your consent to your child’s use of the Services, your child is an
	“eligible user.” Users who are not children are also “eligible
	users.”
</p>
<p></p>
<h2>Collection of Information</h2>
<p></p>
<p>We and our service providers may collect the following
	information from users of the Services:</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Parent’s Email Address.</strong> A child user may
		submit the email address of his or her parent or guardian. We use
		the email address to seek the consent of the parent or guardian to
		the child’s use of the Services. We may also use the email address
		to invite the parent or guardian to create a family account or
		otherwise interact with us.</li>
	<li><strong>Device and Activity Information.</strong> We collect
		persistent identifiers, including IP addresses, cookies and device
		identifiers, that provide us with information about how the Services
		are accessed and used (including browser and device type, time spent
		on the Services, pages visited and other data about website, game or
		App usage). We use this information solely to support our internal
		operations. For example, we may use the information to ensure that
		the Services function properly, to facilitate navigation, to
		calculate play or use levels, to diagnose problems and to administer
		a game, App or the Services. We may also use pixel tags (also known
		as web beacons or clear GIFs) in our emails to determine the
		effectiveness of our marketing campaigns. We do not track a user of
		our Services when he or she is on a third-party site or service.</li>
	<li><strong>Analytics Information. </strong>
		<ul>
			<li>We use Google Analytics, which uses cookies and other,
				similar technologies to collect information about use of the
				Services anonymously and reports website trends, without
				identifying individual visitors. You can learn about Google's
				practices by going to <a href="http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/"><strong>www.google.com/policies/privacy/</strong><strong>?</strong><strong>partners/</strong></a>,
				and opt out of them by downloading the opt-out browser add-on
				available at <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout"><strong>https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout</strong></a>.
			</li>
			<li>We also use Adobe's analytics service, which uses cookies
				and web beacons to help us understand more about how our websites
				are used, so that we can continue to improve them. To learn more,
				go to <a href="http://www.adobe.com/content/dotcom/en/privacy/analytics.html"><strong>http://www.adobe.com/content/dotcom/en/privacy/analytics.html</strong></a>.
				To learn how to opt out, go to <a href="http://www.adobe.com/privacy/opt-out.html#4"><strong>http://www.adobe.com/privacy/opt-out.html#4</strong></a>.
			</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li><strong>Information Collected through Adobe Flash
			Technology</strong>: We may use Adobe Flash technology (including Flash
		Local Shared Objects ("Flash LSOs") and other similar technologies
		to, among other things, collect and store information about use of
		the Services. If you do not want Flash LSOs stored on your device,
		you can adjust the settings of your Flash player to block Flash LSO
		storage using the tools contained using the <a href="http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager07.html"><strong>Website
				Storage Settings Panel</strong></a>. You can also control Flash LSOs by going
		to the <a href="http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager03.html"><strong>Global
				Storage Settings Panel</strong></a> and following the instructions. Please note
		that setting the Flash Player to restrict or limit acceptance of
		Flash LSOs may reduce or impede the functionality of some Flash
		applications.</li>
</ul>
<p>We and our service providers may also collect the following
	information from eligible users of the Services:</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Profile Information.</strong> An eligible user may
		submit the following information to create a profile: name, email
		address, address, phone number, gender, preferred language and
		display name. We also collect a user name and password to permit an
		eligible user to access and interact with the Services. In addition,
		we may collect an adult’s payment card and related information in
		order to permit him or her to make purchases.</li>
	<li><strong>Photos, Videos and Audio files.</strong></li>
	<li><strong>Location Information.</strong> If a user plays
		through an App or mobile site, we may collect the physical location
		of the user’s mobile device by, for example, using satellite, cell
		phone tower or WiFi signals, in order to provide location-based
		services and content, such as to permit interactive game play with
		real world environments.</li>
	<li><strong>Unique Identifier for Push Notifications.</strong>
		We may collect a unique identifier assigned to the device used to
		play an App in order to deliver push notifications to an eligible
		user.</li>
</ul>
<p>We may combine the information we collect from eligible users
	with information that we receive from other DreamWorks and third
	party online and offline sources, as permitted by law.</p>
<p>We use a third-party payment service to process payments made
	through the Services. If you wish to make a payment, your personal
	information will be collected by such third party and not by us, and
	it will be subject to the third party's own privacy policy, rather
	than this Privacy Policy. We are not responsible for this third
	party's collection, use and disclosure of your personal information.</p>
<p></p>
<h2>Use and Disclosure</h2>
<p></p>
<p>
	We use the information we collect from and about a user to provide
	the Services to him or her, including to measure and improve the
	Services and its features; to improve the user’s experience by
	delivering relevant content, including advertising and, if the user
	has agreed, marketing messages; to allow the user to participate in
	contests or other promotions; to provide the user with customer
	support; to respond to requests and inquiries; to evaluate an
	individual for job opportunities if he or she submits a résumé
	through our "careers" section; and to evaluate a reel or portfolio
	submitted by a user, which submission is governed by Section 7 of our
	<a href="/dsppublic/info/terms">Terms of Use</a>. When the
	information collected from or about a user does not identify him or
	her, or allow contact with him or her or his or her device, we may
	use that information for any purpose or share it with third parties,
	to the extent permitted by applicable law.
</p>
<p>We use and disclose the information we collect from and about
	users for these additional purposes:</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>For our internal business purposes.</strong> We use
		users’ information for our internal business purposes, such as data
		analysis; audits; fraud prevention; improving or modifying our
		services; identifying usage trends; determining the effectiveness of
		our promotional campaigns; and operating our business.</li>
	<li><strong>To our service providers.</strong> We may disclose
		users’ information to our service providers who assist us in
		providing and managing our services, such as by providing data
		analysis, payment processing, information technology, customer
		service, email delivery, auditing and other services.</li>
	<li><strong>To contact the user.</strong> We may periodically
		send notifications or reminders related to the Services to an
		eligible user or parent. We may also send promotional materials to
		an eligible user by email and/or direct mail, if he or she has
		agreed to receive them.</li>
	<li><strong>To protect our rights and those others. </strong>We
		may use or disclose a user’s information, consistent with applicable
		law, when we believe such disclosure is necessary or appropriate:
		(a) under applicable law; (b) to comply with legal process; (c) to
		respond to requests from public and government authorities; (d) to
		enforce our terms and conditions; (e) to protect our operations or
		those of any of our affiliates; (f) to protect our rights, privacy,
		safety or property and/or that of our affiliates, a user of the
		Services or others; and (g) to allow us to pursue available remedies
		or limit the damages that we may sustain.</li>
	<li><strong>In connection with a disposition of our
			assets. </strong>We may disclose a user’s information, consistent with
		applicable law, in the event of any reorganization, merger, sale,
		joint venture, assignment, transfer or other disposition of all or
		any portion of our business, assets or stock (including in
		connection with any bankruptcy or similar proceedings).</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<h2>Third Party Services</h2>
<p></p>
<p>This Privacy Policy does not address, and we are not
	responsible for, the privacy, information or other practices of any
	third parties, including any third party operating any site or
	service to which the Services link. The inclusion of a link in the
	Services does not imply endorsement of the linked site or service by
	us or by our affiliates.</p>
<p></p>
<h2>Security</h2>
<p></p>
<p>
	We seek to use reasonable organizational, technical and
	administrative measures to protect personal information within our
	organization. Unfortunately, no data transmission or storage system
	can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. If you have reason to believe
	that your or your child’s interaction with us is no longer secure
	(for example, if you feel that the security of any account you might
	have with us has been compromised), please immediately notify us in
	accordance with the “<em>Contacting Us</em>” section below.
