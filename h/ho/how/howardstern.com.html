            <p>Date of Last Revision: June 11, 2013<br><br><strong>Purpose</strong><br><br>The Howard Stern Production Company, Inc. respects and protects the privacy of our users.<br><br>The purpose of this Privacy Policy is to disclose to you what information The Howard Stern Production Company, Inc. may collect from visitors to our website, HowardStern.com, its affiliate sites, subdomains, mobile versions, and any associated applications that are owned and/or operated by The Howard Stern Production Company, Inc. (collectively, the "Site"), and how we collect, use and share this information. In this Privacy Policy , The Howard Stern Production Company, Inc. is referred to as "HSP" "us," "we," or "our," as the context requires.<br><br>Please read this Privacy Policy carefully. This Privacy Policy applies to all users ("you") of the Site. By using our services and the Site, including any content posted on the Site, you signify your acceptance of our <a href="https://www.howardstern.com/terms">Terms of Service</a>, including this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to the Terms of Service, you must stop accessing or using our Site. Please contact us with any questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy at <a href="mailto:Webmaster@HowardStern.com">Webmaster@HowardStern.com</a> .<br><br>Minors Prohibited: The Site is not directed to individuals under the age of eighteen (18), if you are under the age of eighteen (18) you are not authorized to access or use the Site.</p><p>NOTICE: Visit www.OnGuardOnline.gov for tips from the Federal Trade Commission on protecting children's privacy online.<br><br><strong>Changes to Privacy Policy</strong><br><br>We may, in our sole discretion, modify or revise this Privacy Policy at any time. Such changes or updates are effective immediately after we give notice of the change or update, which we may do so by revising the "Date of Last Revision" date of this Privacy Policy or by otherwise posting on the Site, or by email, conventional mail and/or by any other means that provides reasonable notice. If registered with our Site, you must provide us with your correct email address and make sure that email from us is not filtered from your inbox by your ISP or email software. You agree that your use of the Site, after the date such notice is posted, means that you accept and agree to be bound by such modifications or revisions to the Privacy Policy. You agree that we shall not be liable to you for any damages that might result form any changes to the Privacy Policy, if any.<br><br><strong>Information You Provide</strong><br><br><em><strong>Personally Identifiable Information</strong></em><br><br>Personally Identifiable Information is information that identifies a specific user, such as your first and last name, home address (including zip code), email address, telephone number, date of birth, and gender. Personally Identifiable Information also includes credit card billing information that you may provide to purchase merchandise. When you register for a user account or engage in certain activities on the Site, we may ask you to provide certain Personally Identifiable Information about yourself. Depending on the activity, some of the information we ask you to provide is mandatory and some is voluntary. If you do not provide the mandatory information for a particular activity requiring disclosure of such information, you will not be permitted to engage in that activity. Examples of activities in which we collect Personally Identifiable Information on the Site include but are not limited to (1) registering for a user account, (2) requesting newsletters or other communications, (3) purchasing merchandise, (4) submitting Your Content, as that term is defined in our Terms of Service, and (5) contests, sweepstakes and promotions. You may also post certain public content, such as testimonials, forum posts, and comments, to our Site. Any such content you post may be viewable by the general public and is governed by our <a href="http://www.howardstern.com/terms-of-service">Terms of Service</a>.<br><br><em><strong>Non-Personally Identifiable Information</strong></em><br><br>Non-Personally Identifiable Information is information that does not identify a specific user. This type of information may include the Uniform Resource Locator ("URL") of the website you visited before coming to our Site, the URL of the website you visit after leaving our Site, the type of browser you are using and your Internet Protocol ("IP") address. We may automatically collect this information when you visit our Site through the use of electronic tools like cookies and web beacons or pixel tags.<br><br>We may save "cookies" to your computer--small data files that are transferred when you allow your browser to accept cookies. Cookies automatically identify your browser to our Site whenever you visit, and save your passwords, preferences, and other information. By tracking how and when you use various features of our Site, cookies help us improve our Site. Accepting cookies allows you, among other things, to personalize your experience on our Site. Cookies may also allow our Site to present personalized advertising to you. Third-party advertising companies may place separate cookies on your computer, and we have no access to or control over these cookies. This Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies by our Site only, and does not cover the use of cookies by any third-party advertising company. The use of advertising cookies sent by third-party servers is standard in the industry. You can generally opt out of providing this information by turning cookies off in your browser. Some portions of our Site, however, may not function correctly if you have turned cookies off. We may use other industry standard technologies like pixel tags and web beacons to track your use of our Site pages and promotions, or we may allow our third-party service providers to use these devices on our behalf. Pixel tags and web beacons are tiny graphic images placed on certain pages on our Site, or in our emails that allow us to determine whether you have performed a specific action. When you access these pages or open or click an email, pixel tags and web beacons generate a Non-Personally Identifiable notice of that action. Pixel tags allow us to measure and improve our understanding of visitor traffic and behavior on our Site, as well as give us a way to measure our promotions and performance. We may also utilize pixel tags and web beacons provided by our Affiliates and/or Partners for the same purposes.<br><br>We may collect IP addresses or click-stream data for purposes of system administration, to improve our Site, and to report aggregate information internally or to sponsors. An IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you access the Internet. Our computers identify your computer by its IP address. When you request pages from our Site, our computers log your IP address.<br><br>Click-stream data is information collected by our computers when you request pages from our Site. Click-stream data may include such information as the page served, the time, the source of the request, the type of browser making the request, the preceding page view and other such non-personal information. When analyzed, this data helps us determine, among other things, how visitors arrive at our Site, what type of content is most popular, and what type of visitors in the aggregate are interested in particular kinds of content and advertising.<br><br><strong>Information Provided Through Social Network Platforms</strong><br><br>If you access our services on a "social network platform" (including, but not limited to, Facebook and Twitter), we will access and store the information explicitly allowed by the social network platform by their Terms of Service, once you give us permission to do so, through an interface provided by the social network platform. HSP activities that may be accessible via a social network platform include sweepstakes, contests, promotions, games, forums, and other activities that may be available on the Site. If you have registered for a HSP account, the information provided to us by social network platforms may be associated and stored with your HSP account information. As we do not have control over the user interface provided by social network platforms, we do not take any responsibility for any changes or problems with the interface or exchange of information provided by any of these social network platforms.<br><br><strong>How We Use Your Information</strong><br><br>We use Personally Identifiable Information to enhance your user experience of the Site, improve the operation of the Site, deliver services to you and improve our service offerings, improve our marketing and promotional efforts, analyze Site use, process purchases of products, and facilitate your experience with third-parties. If you use our Site to request that we send information to another person, we may store your Personally Identifiable Information, and the Personally Identifiable information of the recipient you specify, and we may use that recipient's contact information to allow him or her to access the information specified in your request. We may also use Personally Identifiable Information to troubleshoot, resolve disputes, accomplish administrative tasks, contact you, enforce our agreements with you (including our Site Terms of Service and this Privacy Policy), comply with applicable laws, and cooperate with law enforcement activities.<br><br>When you purchase a product or service on our Site, you grant us permission to access your billing information. This Personally Identifiable Information for billing is stored on a secure server. We will use your Personally Identifiable Information to send you information concerning your product purchase, including a confirmation email and any notices about problems with your payment method. Personally Identifiable Information provided as part of a purchase you make from us is only used as necessary to complete the transaction and to provide you with tools to manage and monitor your transactions.<br><br>We use Non-Personally Identifiable Information to troubleshoot technical issues, administer the Site, analyze trends, gather demographic information, comply with applicable laws, and cooperate with law enforcement activities. We may also share this information with our authorized third-party service providers and advertisers in order to measure the overall effectiveness of our online advertising, content, and programming.<br><br><strong>Disclosure of Personally Identifiable Information</strong><br><br>We will not share your Personally Identifiable Information with third-parties without your permission except in the following situations:<br><br>â¢ to enforce our Terms of Service;<br><br>â¢ if we believe in good faith that it is required by law enforcement or judicial authorities, or if it is necessary to comply with other legal requirements;<br><br>â¢ if it is necessary to respond to an emergency that we believe involves potential threats to the safety of persons or property;<br><br>â¢ to prevent or investigate suspected fraud, illegal activity, violations of our Terms of Service, or activity that we believe in good faith may expose us to legal liability;<br><br>â¢ to provide information to trusted third-party service providers for the sole purpose of processing Personally Identifiable Information in connection with the completion of a purchase from us;<br><br>â¢ to enable trusted third-parties that provide services on our behalf or with whom we have collaborated to offer a particular service; or<br><br>â¢ during any merger, acquisition, or transfer of substantially all our assets, or during negotiations for such an event.<br><br>We encourage our trusted third-party service providers to adopt and post privacy policies that offer the same level of protection of your Personally Identifiable Information. However, the use of your Personally Identifiable Information by such parties is controlled by those parties and thus, not subject to our control.<br><br><strong>Disclosure of Non-Personally Identifiable Information</strong><br><br>We may disclose or share Non-Personally Identifiable Information with our partners, affiliates and advertisers. For example, we may share aggregated demographic information (which does not include any Personally Identifiable Information) with "third-party advertisers" and other parties as provided herein.<br><br>We may use trusted third-party service providers to track and analyze Non-Personally Identifiable usage and volume statistical information from our users to administer our Site and constantly improve its quality. We may also publish this information for promotional purposes or as a representative audience for advertisers. Please note that this is not Personally Identifiable Information, only general summaries of the activities of our users. Such data is collected on our behalf, and is owned and used by us.<br><br><strong>Our Security Procedures</strong><br><br>We have implemented security measures to protect your Personally Identifiable Information from loss, misuse, and alteration. We use industry-standard practices to safeguard the confidentiality of your Personally Identifiable Information. You can access your Personally Identifiable Information on our Site through your HSP account login and password. We recommend that you do not share your password with anyone. In addition, your Personally Identifiable Information resides on a secure server that only selected personnel and contractors have access to. We encrypt certain sensitive information (such as credit card information) using Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology to ensure that your Personally Identifiable Information is safe as it is transmitted to us.<br><br>Perfect security, however, does not exist on the Internet. As a result, while we employ commercially reasonable security measures to protect data and seek to partner with companies which do the same, we cannot guarantee the security of any information transmitted to or from the Site. We are also not responsible for any information you share with other users of our Site or with third-parties, including advertisers, sponsors, or partners who are linked on our Site.<br><br><strong>Your Control of Personally Identifiable Information</strong><br><br>You may limit the collection and use of different elements of your Personally Identifiable Information by not participating in those activities for which we collect Personally Identifiable Information, as described above. You may choose to discontinue the collection, use, and disclosure of your Personally Identifiable Information by limiting or discontinuing your use of our Site.<br><br>We believe that you should have the ability to edit the Personally Identifiable Information you provide to us. You can access and update your Personally Identifiable Information by logging into our Site and modifying your HSP profile. You may delete your account and opt out of any further communications from us by either:<br><br>â¢ clicking on the links provided in our email communications for that purpose; or<br><br>â¢ sending an email request to [email address].<br><br>You agree to maintain accurate contact information and to promptly update your Personally Identifiable Information if it changes. You may ask to have the information in your HSP account deleted or removed; however, because we keep track of past transactions, you cannot delete information associated with past transactions (i.e., purchases) on the Site. In addition, it may be impossible for us to completely delete all of your information because we periodically backup the Site information stored on our servers.<br><br><strong>Minors</strong><br><br>The Site is only intended for individuals at least 18 years old who have the legal capacity to validly enter into a contract. If you are under the age of 18, you are not authorized to access or use our Site. In compliance with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act, we will not knowingly permit persons under the age of 13 to provide Personally Identifiable Information to us. If we later learn that you are under the age of 13, we will take appropriate steps to remove your Personally Identifiable Information from our database and restrict you from accessing our Site. We do not knowingly collect personal information from anyone under the age of 13, and no part of the Site is designed or intended to attract anyone under the age of 13. We do not sell products for purchase by children. We do not knowingly provide any Personally Identifiable Information about minors under the age of 13, regardless of its source, to third parties, nor is such information knowingly used by us for any marketing or promotional purposes.<br><br>Any parent of a minor child who has improperly registered to use our Site or otherwise provided Personally Identifiable Information to the Site may contact us at any time to request removal of his/her child's Personally Identifiable Information. To make such a request, please send us an email at <a href="mailto:Webmaster@HowardStern.com">Webmaster@HowardStern.com</a> with "Parental Review Request" in the subject line of the message and include the following:<br><br>â¢ your child's first name and last initial, username and password;<br><br>â¢ your first and last name;<br><br>â¢ your email address;<br><br>â¢ a statement detailing your exact request (i.e., whether you would like your child's Personally Identifiable Information deleted from our servers, and/or whether you would like us to prohibit your child from re-registering with the Services and/or providing us with any further Personally Identifiable Information at a later date); and<br><br>â¢ a statement by you, certifying that you are the parent or legal guardian of the child whose information you are requesting.<br><br>We will respond to all such requests and inform the parent of our compliance with his/her request as soon as is commercially practicable, but typically within 3 business days.<br><br><strong>Third-Party Sites</strong><br><br>This Privacy Policy addresses only the use and disclosure of information that we collect. Other Sites, including advertisers, sponsors, Affiliates and Partners linked to from our Site, may have their own policies that are not addressed or controlled by this Privacy Policy. Please note that if you provide any information directly to parties other than us, including Sites linked to our Site, different rules may apply to the use or disclosure of the personally identifiable information you disclose to those parties. We encourage you to investigate and ask questions before disclosing personally identifiable information to third-parties.<br><br><strong>International Users</strong><br><br>If you are accessing our Site from outside of the United States, your Personally Identifiable Information will be transferred to the United States. Regardless of where that information is collected or transferred, it will be treated in accordance with this Privacy Policy.<br><br><strong>Communications to or from our Site</strong><br><br>WE MAKE NO GUARANTEE OF CONFIDENTIALITY OR PRIVACY OF ANY COMMUNICATION OR INFORMATION TRANSMITTED TO OR FROM THE WEBSITE. You acknowledge that any content you post on the Site is a public and not a private communication. Others may read and view your communication without your knowledge.<br><br>We do not control or endorse the content, messages or information posted by third-party users.
