If you use our Site to request that we send information to another person, we may store your Personally Identifiable Information, and the Personally Identifiable information of the recipient you specify, and we may use that recipient’s contact information to allow him or her to access the information specified in your request.

We may also share this information with our authorized third-party service providers and advertisers in order to measure the overall effectiveness of our online advertising, content, and programming.<br><br><strong>Disclosure of Personally Identifiable Information</strong><br><br>We will not share your Personally Identifiable Information with third-parties without your permission except in the following situations: &nbsp;<br><br>• to enforce our Terms of Service;<br><br>• if we believe in good faith that it is required by law enforcement or judicial authorities, or if it is necessary to comply with other legal requirements;<br><br>• if it is necessary to respond to an emergency that we believe involves potential threats to the safety of persons or property;<br><br>• to prevent or investigate suspected fraud, illegal activity, violations of our Terms of Service, or activity that we believe in good faith may expose us to legal liability;<br><br>• to provide information to trusted third-party service providers for the sole purpose of processing Personally Identifiable Information in connection with the completion of a purchase from us;&nbsp;<br><br>• to enable trusted third-parties that provide services on our behalf or with whom we have collaborated to offer a particular service; or<br><br>• during any merger, acquisition, or transfer of substantially all our assets, or during negotiations for such an event.<br><br>We encourage our trusted third-party service providers to adopt and post privacy policies that offer the same level of protection of your Personally Identifiable Information. &nbsp; However, the use of your Personally Identifiable Information by such parties is controlled by those parties and thus, not subject to our control.<br><br><strong>Disclosure of Non-Personally Identifiable Information</strong><br><br>We may disclose or share Non-Personally Identifiable Information with our partners, affiliates and advertisers. &nbsp;For example, we may share aggregated demographic information (which does not include any Personally Identifiable Information) with “third-party advertisers” and other parties as provided herein.<br><br>We may use trusted third-party service providers to track and analyze Non-Personally Identifiable usage and volume statistical information from our users to administer our Site and constantly improve its quality. We may also publish this information for promotional purposes or as a representative audience for advertisers. Please note that this is not Personally Identifiable Information, only general summaries of the activities of our users. &nbsp;Such data is collected on our behalf, and is owned and used by us.<br><br><strong>Our Security Procedures</strong><br><br>We have implemented security measures to protect your Personally Identifiable Information from loss, misuse, and alteration. We use industry-standard practices to safeguard the confidentiality of your Personally Identifiable Information. You can access your Personally Identifiable Information on our Site through your HSP account login and password. &nbsp;We recommend that you do not share your password with anyone. &nbsp;In addition, your Personally Identifiable Information resides on a secure server that only selected personnel and contractors have access to. &nbsp;We encrypt certain sensitive information (such as credit card information) using Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology to ensure that your Personally Identifiable Information is safe as it is transmitted to us.&nbsp;<br><br>Perfect security, however, does not exist on the Internet. As a result, while we employ commercially reasonable security measures to protect data and seek to partner with companies which do the same, we cannot guarantee the security of any information transmitted to or from the Site. &nbsp;We are also not responsible for any information you share with other users of our Site or with third-parties, including advertisers, sponsors, or partners who are linked on our Site.<br><br><strong>Your Control of Personally Identifiable Information</strong><br><br>You may limit the collection and use of different elements of your Personally Identifiable Information by not participating in those activities for which we collect Personally Identifiable Information, as described above.

You may ask to have the information in your HSP account deleted or removed; however, because we keep track of past transactions, you cannot delete information associated with past transactions (i.e., purchases) on the Site. In addition, it may be impossible for us to completely delete all of your information because we periodically backup the Site information stored on our servers.<br><br><strong>Minors</strong><br><br>The Site is only intended for individuals at least 18 years old who have the legal capacity to validly enter into a contract.
