Session cookies are deleted automatically when you close your browser and persistent cookies remain on your device after the browser is closed (e.g. remembering your user preferences when you return to the Site).</p><p>We may also use pixels or "web beacons" that monitor your use of our Site. Web beacons are small electronic files integrated into the Site or our communications (e.g. emails) that permit us, for example, to count users who have visited those pages or opened an email or for other related statistics.

Cookies are then sent back to the originating web domain on your subsequent visits to that domain. Most web pages contain elements from multiple web domains so when you visit a website, your browser may receive cookies from several sources. Cookies are useful because they allow a website to recognize a user's device. Cookies allow you to navigate websites efficiently, remember preferences and generally improve the user experience. They can also be used to tailor advertising to your interests through tracking your browsing across websites.

Web beacons are small electronic files integrated into the Site or our communications (e.g. emails) that permit us, for example, to count users who have visited those pages or opened an email or for other related statistics. We may also integrate "Software Development Kits" ("SDKs") into our applications to perform similar functions as cookies and web beacons. For example, SDKs may collect technical and usage information such as mobile device identifiers and your interactions with the Site and other mobile apps.</p><p>We may also use cookies and other technologies (i) to provide, develop, maintain, personalize, protect, and improve our Site, products, programs, and services and to operate our business, (ii) to perform analytics, including to analyze and report on usage and performance of our Site and marketing materials, (iii) to protect against, identify, and prevent fraud and other unlawful activity, (iv) to create aggregate data about groups or categories of our users, and (v) to synchronize users across devices, affiliates, business partners, and select third parties.</p><p>We currently do not respond to Do Not Track signals because a uniform technological standard has not yet been developed.
