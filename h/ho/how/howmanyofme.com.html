<p class="question">Q: What kind of information is collected?</p>

<p>A: The web site asks that users enter first and last names to discover
how common or uncommon they are. The user may enter their own name, or anyone
else's name. For statistical purposes we track the number of searches and what
names were searched for by an individual user. A typical user will search
a number of different names (themselves, friends, family, celebrities) and determining
which search was their name would be difficult. However, it is conceivable that
a first and last name of a user could be discovered.</p>

<p>The web site also allows users to enter their e-mail address for the purpose
of notifying users of new features of this web site, or new web sites created
by the operator of this site.</p>

<p>Further, our advertisers collect certain information when they send their ads
to your computer. This information is subject to the privacy policies of the  
individual advertiser. We have no ability to control what our advertisers do with any
data collected. We do not share search data, or e-mails with any of our advertisers.</p>

<p class="question">Q: With whom do you share your data?</p>

<p>A: We do not share search data of individual users or e-mail addresses with anyone,
nor do we intend to start.</p>

<p>We do allow users to look at statistics based on the aggregate of all searches. Information
such as the most popular name searched for by all users is available. There is no way to single
out the information of one particular user from this data.</p>

<p class="question">Q: How long do you retain data?</p>
<p>A: Raw log files, including such data as IP address, operating system, browser type, as well as 
some information are kept for a 3 day period, at the end of which they are aggregated into a format
that makes discovering any personally identifiable information difficult.</p>

<p>The search log including individual searches is processed approximately weekly. During processing
data connecting individual users to a particular search is removed.</p>

<p class="question">Q: Is this the final version of your privacy policy?</p>
<p>A: Probably not. Like most things on this site, our privacy policy is a work in progress. We will
very likely revise the privacy policy at some point. Any changes to the privacy policy will be posted
here. We do not, however, expect any changes in the core values of this privacy policy.
