<p><strong><span style="font-size: large;">Disclaimer</span></strong></p>
<p>This website is a collaborative website written by a group of individuals. This  website does not accept any form of cash advertising, sponsorship, or paid topic  insertions. However, we will and do accept and keep free products, services,  travel, event tickets, and other forms of compensation from companies and  organizations.</p>
<p>The compensation received will never influence the  content, topics or posts made on this website. All advertising is in the form of  advertisements generated by a third party ad network. Those advertisements will  be identified as paid advertisements.</p>
<p>The owner(s) of this site is not  compensated to provide opinion on products, services, websites and various other  topics. The views and opinions expressed on this website are purely the website  owners. If we claim or appear to be experts on a certain topic or product or  service area, we will only endorse products or services that we believe, based  on our expertise, are worthy of such endorsement. Any product claim, statistic,  quote or other representation about a product or service should be verified with  the manufacturer or provider.</p>
<p><strong>Products Linked  Disclaimer</strong></p>
<p>If a product or service linked to on this site has an  affiliate program, you can safely bet that the link we’re using is an affiliate  link. Sometimes we may get paid a commission if you purchase the product or  service.</p>
<p><strong>Product Reviews Disclaimer</strong></p>
<p>The views  and opinions expressed by our contributors of the product reviews are their own  and not necessarily those of this website. These reviews should not be taken as  recommendations but rather customer opinions of the products that they may or  may not have used.</p>
<p>Sometimes we are sent a product to review which we do  on an unbiased case by case basis. When we are sent something to review we are  usually given the product, we use the product, and it is not returned. Never in  any case are our opinions biased because we received the product for free to  use. If we don’t like the product we will share that also. Once again the site  is for the benefit of our readers and the site can only get better by building a  trusting audience.</p>
<p>We make no warranty or representation, expressed or  implied, as to the accuracy or sufficiency of the information contributed by  outside sources, and assume no responsibility or liability regarding the use of  such information. We do not warrant the performance, effectiveness or  applicability of any materials listed or linked to our website. The information  provided in the reviews is intended for educational purposes only. Use your own  good judgment before you buy the product.</p>
<p><strong>Contest  Disclaimer</strong></p>
<p>If we are running a contest odds are the sponsor has  donated the prize and we are not compensated at all. The prize is usually  donated by a sponsor and we give it away. Its that simple. We built our site  based around helping our readers, if we can give them a gift from time to time  you can bet we will do it.</p>
