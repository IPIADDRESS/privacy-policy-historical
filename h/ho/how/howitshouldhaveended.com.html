</h2>
<p><strong>Welcome! Below you will find the privacy policy for the Internet sites
of Starz Media, LLC (“STM”). "STM Sites" include starzmedia.com,
anchorbayentertainment.com, filmroman.com and other Internet sites on which this
privacy policy is posted. STM and any and all entities that control, are controlled
by, or are affiliated or under common control with, STM are collectively referred
to herein as "we," "us" or "our".</strong></p>
<p class="copy">IMPORTANT!
PLEASE READ THIS CAREFULLY. BY USING THE STM SITES YOU ARE UNCONDITIONALLY AGREEING
TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY, TOGETHER WITH THE TERMS OF SERVICE FOR THE STM SITES
(WHICH, TOGETHER SHALL BE REFERRED TO AS THE “SITE AGREEMENT”).
IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THE TERMS OF THE SITE AGREEMENT, PLEASE DO NOT USE THE
STM SITES.</p>
<p class="copy">STM is committed to helping users of the STM Sites understand the information
STM collects, how it uses that information, the choices users have about the
way their information is used, and the precautions STM takes to protect information
concerning its users. This Privacy Policy applies specifically to the STM Sites
only, and covers information collected on or through the STM Sites. When using
other STM sites, we encourage you to review the Privacy Policy controlling that
particular site.</p>
<span class="header">A. Information We Collect.</span>
<p class="copy">STM collects personally identifiable information that you voluntarily
submit in various contexts including, but not limited to: (1) the registration
or account creation process for the STM Sites; (2) the registration process for
sweepstakes, contests, and other online promotions offered on the STM Sites;
(3) your participation in online research surveys offered on the STM Sites; (4)
the process to report a problem with STM Sites and resolving customer service
activities (including via email and chat), and (5) in connection with content
submissions, voting and polling activities. Such personally identifiable information
may include, without limitation, name, e-mail address, mailing address and telephone
number.</p>
<p class="copy">When you visit the STM Sites, our servers automatically collect
information that describes how you use the STM Sites (which pages you visit and
how long you stay, plus the anonymous information automatically sent to us by
your web browser, such as browser type, data that identifies the page you visited
prior to and after your visit to an STM Site, and your IP address). We also may
determine what technology is available through your browser so we can serve you
the most appropriate version of a page.</p>
<p class="copy">Cookies are small information files that STM Sites
may place on your computer to provide extended functionality. We may use cookies
for a number of purposes, such as tracking how visitors use the STM Sites, limiting
multiple responses to polls or surveys, and recording your member registration
information. Cookies (including beacons), by themselves, do not provide STM with
personally identifiable information unless you choose to voluntarily provide
this information to us by, for example, registering on an STM Site. However,
once you choose to furnish us with personally identifiable information, this
information may be linked to the data stored in the cookie. You can turn off
cookies in your web browser (see your browser’s manual or help file for
instructions), but if you do turn off cookies you may not be able to access parts
of the STM Sites where cookies are used.</p>
<p class="copy">You should be aware that advertisers or other third parties serving
content on the STM Sites may set and access their own cookies on your computer.
We don’t
have control over cookies placed by third parties. Such third parties’ use
of cookies is subject to their own privacy policies, which may differ from this
Privacy Policy. Such third parties do not have access to our cookies.</p>
<p class="copy">An IP address
is a number assigned to your computer or network when you’re
on the Internet. It’s usually associated with the place you enter the Internet,
like your Internet Service Provider (ISP) or your school. When you visit pages
on an STM Site, our servers log your IP address. We collect IP addresses for
a variety of internal purposes, such as system administration and to keep track
of the number of visits to different pages on the STM Sites.</p>
<p class="copy">While using the STM
Sites, you may encounter links to other web sites or online materials. Those
other web sites and any online advertising servers delivering ads to STM Sites
may set their own cookies, collect data, and/or have their own privacy policies
that differ from this Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy only covers information
collected by STM, and we encourage you to review the privacy policy of any other
web site you visit.</p>
<p class="copy">This Privacy Policy does not apply to any personally identifiable
information you may disclose publicly in user forums (such as chat rooms or discussion
boards). When you voluntarily post information on message boards or in chat areas,
that information can be collected and used by other people to send unsolicited
messages (or “spam”) and marketing materials. STM assumes no responsibility
for any action or policies of any third parties who collect information that
users disclose on discussion boards or in other public areas of the STM Sites.</p>
<h3 class="header">B. How
We Use the Personally Identifiable Information We Collect.</h3>
<p>We use the personal information you give us about yourself to deliver information
or content you request, to contact you about our programs, products, features,
or services, or for other purposes explained at the time we collect the information.
Personally identifiable information is used by STM to, among other things: (1)
verify access rights to premium content or other access-restricted services,
including for purpose of supporting digital rights management software; (2) improve
our services by providing personalized content, language and location customization,
and/or personalized help and instructions; (3) provide information concerning
compatibility and interoperability to you; (4) ask you to participate in surveys
about products, services, news and events; (5) provide you with news, newsletters,
updates, targeted advertising, promotions, sweepstakes and special offers; (6)
better understand how the STM Sites are used, including web traffic patterns
and what types of content are most popular with users; and (7) in connection
with content submissions, community postings (e.g., chat and bulletin boards),
and voting and polling activities. STM does not sell, rent, lease or license
your personally identifiable information to third parties for their commercial
purposes.</p>
<p>STM may disclose personally identifiable information to third party
agents and affiliates we engage to provide services for STM. Examples include
fulfilling orders, delivering packages, sending postal mail and e-mail, analyzing
data, providing marketing assistance and providing customer service. Such entities
and individuals are required to protect your personally identifiable information
in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Policy and to not use such personal
information for any purpose other than to carry out the services they are performing
for STM.</p>
<p>STM may disclose your personally identifiable information to any successor
or to any person or entity that acquires ownership or control of an STM Site,
whether as part of a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or substantially all
of a web site's assets and/or services or otherwise. You hereby consent to the
disclosure to, and use by, any such successor or subsequent owner or operator,
and your continued use of the STM Sites signifies your agreement to be bound
by such successor's or subsequent owner or operator's own terms of service and
privacy policy. STM is not responsible for any changes or modifications to this
Privacy Policy by any successor or subsequent owner or operator.</p>
<p>We may share your personally identifiable
information with companies that offer products and/or services under the “Starz” brand
name. STM may also share your information with companies that offer products
and/or services that are co-branded using STM brand names. These companies are
called “co-branding
participants.”</p>
<p>STM may also disclose personally identifiable information
to third parties in the following instances: 1) we have been given your consent
to disclose; 2) we have previously informed you of the disclosure, including
by means of our Privacy Policy; 3) we are required by law or court order to disclose,
or we believe in good faith that the law requires it; 4) disclosure is necessary
to identify, contact, or bring legal action against, someone who may cause or
be causing harm to, or interference with, our rights or property, other STM Site
users, or anyone else; or 5) to respond to an inquiry, request or complaint that
you have made. We may also use IP addresses in cooperation with Internet service
providers to identify users if we deem it necessary to comply with laws, to enforce
compliance with the Site Agreement, including the Privacy Policy, or to protect
the STM Sites, our sites, customers, or others.</p>
<h3 class="header">C. How
We Use the Non-Personally Identifiable Information We Collect.</h3>
<p>We currently contract with online partners to help manage and optimize our
Internet business and communications. We use the services of a marketing company
to help us measure the effectiveness of our advertising and how visitors use
the STM Sites. To do this, we use web beacons and cookies provided by our marketing
company on the STM Sites. For example, we use cookies to: (1) personalize your
experience when visiting the STM Sites and using the STM Sites; (2) improve the
design and content of the STM Sites and/or the Content; (3) analyze STM Site
usage; (4) understand traffic patterns on the STM Sites and to authorize access
to certain premium or trial content and product features and (5) track your usage
of the STM Sites and/or the Content and to track your interactions with the STM
Sites through&nbsp; third-party services. The type of information we collect
includes pages visited, content reviewed, usage levels for content, traffic patterns
and other similar usage information. By supplementing our records, this information
helps us learn things like what pages are most attractive to our visitors, which
of our products most interest our customers, and what kinds of offers our customers
like to see. Although our marketing company logs the information coming from
our STM Sites on our behalf, we control how that data may and may not be used.
STM reserves the right to disclose or otherwise utilize this non-personally identifiable
information in aggregate form, for any purpose, in its sole judgment.</p>
<p>Finally,
you may request that your information be changed, corrected or deleted from our
databases by writing STM at: Starz Media, LLC, Customer Relations, 2950 Hollywood
Way, 3rd Floor Burbank, California 91505. Please Note: even if you opt out of
receiving commercial communications from STM, we reserve the right to send transactional
or relationship communications to you (e.g., if we need to contact you regarding
your account status, technical support, product information, changes to the subscriber
agreement, and any other matter that might affect our service to you and/or our
records on you and/or any products you purchased from us). </p>
<h3 class="header">E. Policies
for Individuals Under the Age of 13.</h3>
<p>STM does not knowingly collect or use any personally identifiable information
submitted to the STM Sites from individuals under the age of 13, except in order
to respond on a one-time basis to a specific request for information. If you
are a parent or guardian who has discovered that your child under the age of
13 has submitted his or her personally identifiable information without your
permission or consent, upon notice from you, STM will make reasonable efforts
to remove the information. You may request that your child’s information
be deleted from our databases by writing STM at: Starz Media, LLC Customer Relations,
2950 Hollywood Way, 3rd Floor Burbank, California 91505, and be sure to include
in your message the same User Name and/or e-mail address and password that your
child submitted. </p>
<h3 class="header">F. Links
to Other Sites.</h3>
<p>STM may from time to time offer links to other sites from sites within the
STM domain. Other sites may also reference, advertise, or link to our sites.
We do not endorse or sponsor other web sites, are not responsible for the privacy
practices or the content of such sites. STM expressly disclaims any and all statements
or assertions made on such web sites, and deny all liability associated with
your use of, and the content on, such other sites. You may arrive at one of these
sites through clicking on a banner advertisement, as part of a co-branding arrangement,
or simply by selecting a link on an STM Site. These sites might issue their own
cookies or collect data or personally identifiable information.</p>
<p>Use caution when
visiting an external site. You use of such sites may be subject to the terms
of service and privacy policies posted on such sites. We recommend that you review
such site’s terms of service and privacy policy prior to
use.</p>
<h3 class="header">G. STM
Security Policy.</h3>
<p>STM is aware of your privacy concerns and strives to collect only as much
data as is required to make your Internet and/or product use experience as efficient
and satisfying as possible, in the most unobtrusive manner as possible. We will
make reasonable efforts to ensure that whatever information you provide will
be maintained in a secure environment.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, no data transmission over
the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive
to protect your personally identifiable information, we cannot guarantee the
security of any information you transmit to us or from our products or services,
and you provide such information at your own risk. Once we receive your transmission,
we make our best effort to ensure its security on our systems.</p>
<h3 class="header">H. Consent
to Processing in the United States.</h3>
<p>By providing any personally identifiable information to STM, all users, including,
without limitation, users in the member states of the European Union, fully understand
and unambiguously consent to this Privacy Policy and to the collection and processing
of such information in the United States of America.</p>
<h3 class="header">I. Notification
of Changes.</h3>
<p>STM reserves the right, at its sole discretion, to change, modify, discontinue,
enhance, add or remove any portion of the STM Sites, or any provision of the
Site Agreement, in whole or in part, at any time. Changes to the Site Agreement
will be effective when posted. Without obligation to do so, STM may also notify
you of such changes through messaging on the STM Sites. You nevertheless agree
to periodically review the copies of the Site Agreement posted on the STM Sites
so that you are aware of any changes. Your continued use of the STM Sites in
any way after any changes to the Site Agreement or the STM Sites are made or
posted will be considered acceptance of those changes and will constitute your
agreement to be bound thereby.</p>
<h3 class="header">J. Your
California Privacy Rights.</h3>
<p>California residents are entitled once a year to request and obtain certain
information regarding our disclosure, if any, of personal information to third
parties for their direct marketing purposes during the immediately prior calendar

activities). To make such a disclosure request, please send an e-mail to privacy@
Starzmedia.com, or write us at Starz Media, LLC, Customer Relations, 2950 Hollywood

to respond to one request per user each year, and we are not required to respond
to requests made by means other than through as set forth herein. Please be aware
that not all information sharing is covered by the "Shine the Light" disclosure
requirements and only the required information will be included in our response.</p>
