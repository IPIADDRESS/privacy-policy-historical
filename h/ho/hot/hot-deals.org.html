correct, update or remove that user's personal data provided to us.
This can be done by emailing the Hot Deals Maniac.
<br><br>

information.
For example, our mailing list has an "opt-out" mechanism so members can cancel their subscriptions at any time.
<br><img src="http://www.websitenet.com/spacer.gif" width="1" height="4"><br>
Users of our site are always notified when their information is being collected by any outside parties.  We do this so our users can make an informed choice as to
whether they should proceed with services that require an outside party, or not. 
<br><br>

it, and under circumstances, if any, we disclose it.
If at any point we decide to use personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time it was collected, we will notify users by way of an email.
Users will have a choice as to whether or not we use their information in this different manner. We
will use information in accordance with the privacy policy under which the information was collected.
