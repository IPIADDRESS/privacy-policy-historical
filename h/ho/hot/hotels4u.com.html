                        <br>
                        (1) To keep you informed of our services, including hotels, insurance &amp; transfers,
                        etc., we may disclose your details to our service providers (who could be located
                        outside the UK/EEA). In order for you to travel overseas, it may be necessary to
                        disclose your details for immigration, security and anti-terrorism purposes, or
                        any other purposes which is deemed appropriate. Even when this information is not
                        mandatory, we may exercise our discretion to assist where appropriate.
                        <br>
                        (2) We may collect and use your details for the purposes set out in our registration
                        with the Office of the Information Commissioner, and disclose the same to our “group
                        companies” (some of whom are outside the UK/EEA) for business purposes. We may also
                        disclose your details to companies who act as “data processors” on our behalf, or
                        to our service providers, operating systems or business functions on our behalf,
                        some of whom are outside the UK/EEA. These purposes include administration, providing
                        services (and contacting you where necessary), customer care, improving our service,
                        business management and operation, re-organisation/structuring/sale of our business
                        (or our group companies), risk assessment, security and crime prevention/detection,
                        research and analysis, marketing, monitoring, measuring and assessing customer purchasing
                        preferences and trends, dispute resolution, credit checking and debt collection.
                        <br>
                        (3) Some of your details (such as health or religion) may be considered “sensitive
                        personal data” under the Data Protection Act 1998. We collect it to cater to your
                        needs or act in your interest, and we are only prepared to accept sensitive personal
                        data from you on the condition that we have your positive consent. By booking with
                        us you also agree for your insurers, their agents and medical staff to disclose
                        relevant information (which may contain sensitive personal data) to us in circumstances
                        where we need to act in the interest of everyone in the group you are travelling
                        with. For example, if your illness at resort is infectious we may need to make special
                        arrangements for you and also ensure that you do not return with the group immediately.
                        <br>
                        If you do not agree to Our Use of Your Details above, we cannot do business with
                        you or accept your booking.</p>
