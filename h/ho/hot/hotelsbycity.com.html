                        <p class="rs_paragraph">PPN does not share your Personal Data, except as disclosed in this Privacy Policy or as otherwise authorized by you. PPN may share your Personal Data with its subsidiaries and with third parties as described in the categories below:</p>

                        <p class="rs_paragraph"><u>External Service Providers:</u> When you use the PPN service to purchase an airline ticket, reserve a hotel room or a rental car or to take advantage of any of our other products and services (including travel insurance and destination attractions), we may provide Personal Data to the airline, hotel, car rental agency or other involved third-party, including other Priceline Group companies, such as priceline.com LLC, its parent company or its sister companies including Booking.com BV ('Booking.com'), Agoda Company Pte. Ltd. ('Agoda'), Traveljigsaw Limited ('rentalcars.com'), KAYAK Software Corporation and OpenTable, Inc. Please refer to the websites of third party suppliers for their Privacy Policies and other information on the suppliers.</p>

                        <p class="rs_paragraph"><u>Third Party Partners:</u> In order to provide you with certain services, we may share your Personal Data with third party partners, or require that you transact directly with a third party partner. Third party partners consist of companies with which we have contracted in order to provide you with services or products featured on our Site. Please refer to the websites of third party suppliers for their Privacy Policies and other information on the suppliers.</p>

                        <p class="rs_paragraph"><u>PPN Agents:</u> Many of the operations we perform require us to hire other companies to help us with these tasks. For example, we hire companies to help us handle mail and e-mail (including sending and delivering packages, postal mail and e-mail), analyze the data we collect, market our products and services, handle credit card transactions and provide customer service. The companies we employ to help us with these tasks have access to Personal Data to perform their functions, but may not use it for other purposes. PPN requires all agents to whom Personal Data is disclosed to enter into confidentiality agreements and to agree to act in a manner consistent with the relevant principles articulated in this Policy.</p>

                        <p class="rs_paragraph"><u>Advertisements, Marketing Material and Other Offers:</u> Unless you tell us that you do not want to receive these offers and subject to applicable law, PPN, priceline.com LLC and/or those companies that we have a commercial relationship with, may occasionally send advertisements, marketing material or other offers that we think might be of interest to you. If you do not want to receive these advertisements, marketing material or other offers, you may simply opt-out by using the hyperlink provided in these notices. Where required by law, we will seek your consent prior to sending you any marketing materials.</p>

                        <p class="rs_paragraph"><u>Future Business Transfers:</u> Our business is constantly changing. As part of that process, PPN and/or priceline.com LLC may sell or buy other companies, and Personal Data may be transferred as part of these transactions. It is also possible that PPN, priceline.com LLC, or substantially all of their assets, may be acquired by another company, whether by merger, sale of assets or otherwise, and Personal Data may be transferred as part of such a transaction. In such cases, the acquiring company would be required to honor the privacy promises in this Privacy Policy or obtain your consent to any material changes to how your Personal Data will be handled.</p>

                        <p class="rs_paragraph"><u>Compliance with Law and Other Disclosures:</u> We reserve the right to release Personal Data in order to comply with applicable law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on us. We may also release Personal Data to enforce or apply the terms and conditions applicable to our products and services, protect us or others against fraudulent or inappropriate activities, or otherwise protect the rights, property or safety of PPN, our affiliated companies, our customers, or others.</p>

                        <p class="rs_paragraph">As described in more detail below, our Site uses cookies to store your preferences, display content based upon what you view on our Site to personalize your visit, analyze trends, administer the Site, track usersâ€™ movements around the Site, serve targeted advertising and gather demographic information about our user base as a whole.
