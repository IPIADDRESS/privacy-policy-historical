<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

At HotVsNot.Com, we are committed to protecting online user privacy. This "Privacy Policy" discloses the privacy practices governing our knowing collection, use, and disclosure of information.

We collect your IP address, referral data, and browser and platform type. You do not have to register with HotVsNot.Com before we can collect this anonymous information. We do not collect any unique information about you (such as your name, e-mail address, etc.) except when you specifically and knowingly provide such information. HotVsNot.Com does not require you to share information that identifies you personally, such as your name or email address, in order for you to use the HotVsNot.Com search. HotVsNot.Com assigns an anonymous ID number to your requests and links the following additional data to that number: the date and time you visited HotVsNot.Com, your search terms, and the links upon which you choose to click. Like most standard Web site servers, we use log files to collect and store this anonymous user information. We analyze this information to examine trends, administer the site, track user's movement in the aggregate, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. HotVsNot.Com may present links in a format that enables us to understand whether they have been followed. We use this information to understand and improve the quality of the HotVsNot.Com search. 
<br><br>
