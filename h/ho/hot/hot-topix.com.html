This Privacy Policy covers Hot-Topix.com'
treatment of personally identifiable
information that Hot-Topix.com™ collects
when you are on the Hot-Topix.com™
Website and when you use Hot-Topix.com'
services. It is important that visitors
are fully informed about the use of
their personal information. Hot-Topix.com™
believes in 100% permission-based
marketing. For each visitor to our
Website, our Web server automatically
recognizes only the consumer's domain
name, but not the e-mail address (unless
requested and supplied by the consumer
as a registration field entry). <br>
<br>
Registration with Hot-Topix.com™ is
required to play the Hot-Topix.com™ host
of promotional games. This Privacy
Policy also applies to consumers that
have agreed to receive e-mail marketing
from Hot-Topix.com™ and Hot-Topix.com'
joint marketing advertisers
("Advertisers") , whether at our
Website, via email, on third party
websites, via co-registration or
otherwise. Hot-Topix.com™ collects
information in certain portions of our
Website, where guests provide content
submissions and suggestions or
participate in interactive online

to questions and surveys, community
listings, ratings, searches and
comparison searches, bidding,
purchasing, chat, games, or bulletin
boards, etc.). The personal profile
information you submit to Hot-Topix.com™
and Advertisers remains your property,
but by submitting that information to
Hot-Topix.com™ you grant Hot-Topix.com™
the right to use that information for
marketing purposes including, but not
limited to, sharing such information via

by clicking on any Advertiser's banner
you agree to be co-registered at that
advertiser's website - at no cost to
you). Hot-Topix.com™ may also use such
information to fulfill prizes, track
compliance with our Rules, or for
content improvement and feedback
purposes. We may sell the personal
information that you supply to us and we
may join together with other businesses
to bring selected retail opportunities
to our members. These businesses may
include providers of direct marketing
services and applications, including
lookup and reference, data enhancement,

Hot-Topix.com™ reserves the right to
release current or past member

agreeing to these terms, you hereby
consent to disclosure of any record or
communication to any third party when
Hot-Topix.com™, in its sole discretion,
determines the disclosure to be
appropriate. To the extent that customer
credit card-specific information is
