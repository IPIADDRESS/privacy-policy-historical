				<p align="left">
					<span style="font-size:12px;">This website routinely collects information about its visitors, subscribers, members, and customers.&nbsp; This information is obtained in various ways, such as:</span></p>
				<p align="left">
					&nbsp;</p>
				<p align="left">
					<span style="font-size:12px;"><strong>VISITOR, SUBSCRIBER, MEMBER, OR CUSTOMER INFORMATION OBTAINED FROM 'REGISTRATION'</strong></span></p>
				<p align="left">
					<span style="font-size:12px;">Registration means that the Visitor, Subscriber, Member or Customer takes active, positive steps to communicate information to this website.&nbsp; This can include pages or 'pop ups' where you register for a newsletter or subscribe to a mailing list; it can include your participation in visitor surveys; it can include requesting information from the website via email, mail, or courier; it may be from joining an affiliate program or other membership organization, paid or unpaid; it may be from ordering a product.</span></p>
				<p align="left">
					&nbsp;</p>
				<p align="left">
					<span style="font-size:12px;">Occasionally complete credit card information may be provided to the website via fax or a fill-in form rather than regular secure merchant service processing.&nbsp; This information is kept at the highest level of security and is never divulged to anyone except the merchant service provider or for the purpose of communication with the customer.</span></p>
				<p align="left">
					&nbsp;</p>
				<p align="left">
					<span style="font-size:12px;"><strong>ONLINE ORDERING</strong></span></p>
				<p align="left">
					<span style="font-size:12px;">Online ordering via SSL encrypted communication provided by shopping cart services supporting merchant service companies like Visa and Master Card provides information to the website but does not provide complete credit card numbers.&nbsp; In the process of online ordering, the customer provides, name, address, city, state, email address, phone number, and, occasionally a member password.&nbsp; You should consider all this information available to the website.&nbsp; This information is used to deliver the product, but under the Purchase Agreement you also approve its use for general solicitation purposes.</span></p>
				<p align="left">
					&nbsp;</p>
				<p align="left">
					<span style="font-size:12px;"><strong>VISITOR EMAIL INQUIRIES</strong></span></p>
				<p align="left">
					<span style="font-size:12px;">Website visitors who wish to communicate with the website do so under two conditions:&nbsp; one, they give their permission for contact by the website; two, they are subject to any ‘submission’ provisions of the Terms of Use, Purchase Agreement, or this Privacy Policy.&nbsp; While your email address may or may not be used to solicit you, it is added to the website's general solicitation database.</span></p>
				<p align="left">
					&nbsp;</p>
				<p align="left">
					<span style="font-size:12px;"><strong>CUSTOMER EMAIL OR TESTIMONIALS</strong></span></p>
				<p align="left">
					<span style="font-size:12px;">If you are a customer and send an email to the website, or if you communicate with the site by phone or mail, the website collects information about your communication and by communicating with the site you give your permission to collect, archive, retrieve, and otherwise use any information collected as the site sees fit.</span></p>
				<p align="left">
					<span style="font-size:12px;">Any communication which, in its sole discretion, the site deems to be a testimonial, may be publicized for commercial purposes.</span></p>
				<p align="left">
					&nbsp;</p>
				<p align="left">
					<span style="font-size:12px;"><strong>INFORMATION OBTAINED FROM VISITOR INTERACTION WITH BANNERS, POPUPS, OR SITE ADVERTISERS</strong></span></p>
