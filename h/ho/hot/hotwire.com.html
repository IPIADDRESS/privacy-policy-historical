		<a name="hyiiu"><span class="customerCareHeader">What organization is collecting the information</span></a><br>
		<span class="standard">Hotwire, Inc., a Delaware corporation, operates and manages www.hotwire.com.  More information about Hotwire may be found at <a href="http://www.hotwire.com/about-hotwire/index.jsp">http://www.hotwire.com/about-hotwire/index.jsp</a>.</span><br><br>
        <a name="hyiiu"><span class="customerCareHeader">How your information is used</span></a><br>
        <span class="standard">The data we gather is used to process your purchase, notify you of your booked travel itineraries, and contact you if problems arise (e.g., your flight is changed or cancelled by the airline). All data is saved in a secure environment. The information we collect helps us better serve you. For example: </span><br><br>
        <table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0" bgcolor="#FFFFFF">
            <tbody><tr>
                <td class="standard" valign="top">&nbsp;•&nbsp;</td>
                <td class="standard">We save all of your Hotwire searches, purchases and booked itineraries -- extremely helpful when you can't remember what time your flight leaves!</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td class="standard" valign="top">&nbsp;•&nbsp;</td>
                <td class="standard">We process your purchases more quickly and efficiently using the data you provide. For example, if you opt to save your credit card number within your account, you won't have to enter it every single time you purchase on Hotwire.</td>
            </tr>
        </tbody></table><br>
		<span class="standard">Hotwire also uses the information that we gather to target content on our site to more closely match your interests and, if you have selected to receive email communication from us, to target email marketing messages that are more appropriate to your needs.</span><br><br>
        <a name="hyiip"><span class="customerCareHeader">How your information is protected</span></a><br>
        <span class="standard">Hotwire maintains data handling and storage practices and procedures that are designed to ensure the integrity and confidentiality of customer information. When you make a purchase on Hotwire, you are doing so in a safe and secure environment. Credit card information is transmitted online using industry standard security measures called secure socket layer encryption (SSL). Current Internet security methods and technologies are used to prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy and ensure correct use of information. This means that information such as your credit card number is encrypted, sent through the Internet as a jumbled code, then decoded and passed on to Hotwire's secure systems. These safeguards are expressly implemented for the purpose of protecting your information. Hotwire also employs additional security measures for credit card usage. For example, when you make a purchase on our site, we may require that you provide the credit card identification number -- a security code that helps validate purchases.</span><br><br>
        <a name="wwyimbs"><span class="customerCareHeader">With whom your information may be shared</span></a><br>
        <span class="standard">When you book on Hotwire, the personal information you provide will be shared with the third parties necessary to ensure the completion of your purchase. This includes the airline, hotel, car rental, or cruise partner with whom your itinerary is booked, as well as any third parties responsible for facilitating the transaction (e.g., credit card authorization company, etc.). The personal information provided to the third parties will not be used for any purpose other than the purchase of your travel arrangements.  Hotwire will also share your information with business firms contracted to provide specific services to us, in a manner consistent with this Privacy Policy.  For instance, if Hotwire were to hold a sweepstakes offer on our site, we may choose to hire a Sweepstakes Administration firm to handle the legal requirements surrounding entrant and winner selection and validation.  In situations such as this where your data is shared with a third-party firm, these firms are contractually obligated to only use your personal data for the purpose for which the relationship exists and these firms do not have the right to share your data with other organizations or contact you outside the bounds of their contract with us.<br><br>
            From time to time, we may share general statistical information about our Web site and visitors -- such as number of visitors, aggregate and non-personally identifiable demographic data, number and type of goods and services purchased, etc. -- with our advertisers and partners. However, we do not reveal your name, address or other personal data for anything other than the use it was originally intended without giving you the opportunity to opt-out.<br><br>
            Hotwire may disclose information about you to others if we have a good faith belief that we are required to do so by law or legal process, to respond to claims, or to protect the rights, property or safety of Hotwire or others.  This includes, but is not limited to, customer fraud, technical malfunctions or abuse of our network or systems.  We also may provide customer information to third parties, such as credit card companies, for the purpose of resolving disputes that arise in the normal course of business.<br><br>
            Hotwire is not responsible for information collection and privacy practices of third party Web sites that are accessed via links from the Hotwire Web site.</span><br><br>

        <span class="standard">A cookie is a unique identifier sent to your computer by a Web server and stored on your computer's hard drive. A cookie lets a computer server identify your computer. A cookie is what allows many sites to greet you upon every return with a message such as, "Hi, Bob! Welcome back," even before you actively login.  At Hotwire, we use cookies to improve your shopping experience and reduce the time it takes for you to complete a purchase. Our cookies do not include any sensitive information, but they do help us track which of our Web pages are visited and what services are most often used.

        <span class="standard">From time to time, Hotwire may use a third-party advertising company to serve advertising on our behalf. Through the use of technology devices -- commonly referred to as cookies and action tags -- this third-party ad-serving company can measure the effectiveness of our ads. Hotwire does not have access to the third-party company's cookies, which are similar to our own cookies. The company employs an action tag -- also known as a Web Beacon or a one-pixel .gif file -- to set or read cookies. Hotwire's third-party ad server will also receive specific information about your order, such as the order number and product category. Rest assured that this shared information is anonymous and does not contain any sensitive information.
