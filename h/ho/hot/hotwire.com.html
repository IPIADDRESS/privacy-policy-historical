<p><strong class="fnt40">What information we collect from you</strong></p>

<div class="ml30">
    <p><strong>In General</strong><br>
    We receive and store any information you enter on our website or give us in any other way. This includes information that can identify you ("personal information"),
    including your first and last name, telephone number, postal and email addresses, fax number, and billing information (such as credit card number, cardholder name,
    and expiration date). We may also request information about your hotel room preferences, and frequent flyer and car rental program information.
    You can choose not to provide information to us, but in general some information about you is required in order for you to register as a member;
    book travel; complete a traveler profile; participate in a survey, contest, or sweepstakes; ask us a question; or initiate other transactions on our site.</p>

    <p><strong>Travel Companion Information</strong><br>
    When you make a reservation for someone else through this website, we will request personal information and travel preferences about that individual.
    You should obtain the consent of other individuals prior to providing us with their personal information and travel preferences, as any access to
    view or change their information will be available only through your account.</p>

    <p><strong>Information from Other Sources</strong><br>
    We also may periodically obtain both personal and non-personal information about you from affiliated entities, business partners and other independent third-party
    sources and add it to our account information. Examples of information we may receive include: updated delivery and address information, purchase history,
    and demographic information.</p>

    <p><strong>Automatic Information</strong><br>
    We automatically collect some information about your computer when you visit this website. For example, we will collect your IP address, Web browser software
    (such as Firefox, Safari, or Internet Explorer), and referring website. We also may collect information about your online activity, such as trips viewed and
    bookings made. Our goals in collecting this automatic information include helping customize your user experience and inhibiting fraud. For more information,
    please see <a href="#caot">Cookies and other technologies.</a></p>
</div>

<a name="hwuyi"></a>
<p><strong class="fnt40">How we use your information</strong></p>

<p>We use sensitive billing information (such as cardholder name, credit card number, and expiration date) for the purpose of completing the travel bookings you
    conduct on our site. We use other information about you for the following general purposes: to provide you with the products and services you request; to
    provide you with travel confirmation and updates; to manage your account, including processing bills and providing travel notifications; to communicate
    with you in general; to respond to your questions and comments; to measure interest in and improve our products, services, and website; to notify you
    about special offers and products or services that may be of interest to you; to otherwise customize your experience with this website; to reward you
    as part of any reward and recognition program you choose to join; to solicit information from you, including through surveys; to resolve disputes,
    collect fees, or troubleshoot problems; to prevent potentially prohibited or illegal activities; to enforce our Terms of Use; and as otherwise described
    to you at the point of collection.</p>

<p>We often receive testimonials and comments from customers who have had positive booking and/or travel experiences on our website. We occasionally
    publish such content, using first name plus last initial, only, for attribution.</p>

<div class="ml30">
    <p><strong>E-mail Communications</strong><br>
    We want to make it easy for you to take advantage of travel-related opportunities on our website. One way we do this is by sending you email messages
    that contain information about your apparent travel-related interests. For example, if you search for a flight to New York on our website and have
    saved your itinerary or otherwise not yet booked your travel, we may send you an email message reminding you about your saved travel itinerary or
    about a special airfare to New York. Similarly, if you receive an email from us about New York travel and demonstrate an interest in New York
    hotels by affirmatively clicking on a link about New York hotels in the email, you may receive an email about New York hotel offers. We believe
    these email messages will provide you with useful information about travel-related special offers available through our site. Please note that you
    will have the opportunity to choose not to receive these email messages in any such email we send.</p>
</div>

<p>Please review <a href="#ycwrttcauoyi">Your choices with respect to the collection and use of your information</a> below.</p>

<a name="wwwsyi"></a>
<p><strong class="fnt40">With whom we share your information</strong></p>

<p>This website may share your information with the following entities:</p>

<div class="ml30">
    <p><strong>Suppliers</strong> such as hotel, airline, car rental, and activity providers, who fulfill your travel reservations. Throughout this site,
        all services provided by a third-party supplier are described as such. We do not place limitations on our suppliers' use or disclosure of your
        personal information. Therefore, we encourage you to review the privacy policies of any travel supplier whose products you purchase through this site.
        Please note that these suppliers also may contact you as necessary to obtain additional information about you, facilitate your travel reservation, or
        respond to a review you may submit.</p>

    <p><strong>Third-party vendors</strong> who provide services or functions on our behalf, including credit card processing, business analytics, customer service,
        marketing, distribution of surveys or sweepstakes programs, and fraud prevention. We may also authorize third-party vendors to collect information on our
        behalf, including as necessary to operate features of our website or to facilitate the delivery of online advertising tailored to your interests.
        Third-party vendors have access to and may collect information only as needed to perform their functions and are not permitted to share or use the
        information for any other purpose.</p>

    <p><strong>Business partners</strong> with whom we may jointly offer products or services, or whose products or services may be offered on our website.
        You can tell when a third party is involved in a product or service you have requested because their name will appear, either alone or with ours.
        If you choose to access these optional services, we may share information about you, including your personal information, with those partners.
        Please note that we do not control the privacy practices of these third-party business partners.</p>

    <p><strong>Referring websites.</strong> If you were referred to this website from another site (for example, through a link you clicked on another site
        that directed you to this one), we may share some information about you with that referring website. We have not placed limitations on the referring
        websites' use of your personal information and we encourage you to review the privacy policies of any website that referred you here.</p>

    <p><strong>Companies within our corporate family.</strong> We may share your personal information with our parent company and corporate affiliates,
        such as Expedia.com, TripAdvisor, CarRentals.com and Hotels.com, as well as international corporate affiliates such as Hotels.uk.com. This sharing
        enables us to provide you with information about products and services, both travel-related and other, which might interest you. To the extent
        that our parent company and corporate affiliates have access to your information, they will follow practices that are at least as restrictive
        as the practices described in this Privacy Policy. They also will comply with applicable laws governing the transmission of promotional communications
        and, at a minimum, give you an opportunity in any commercial email they send to choose not to receive such email messages in the future.</p>
</div>

<p>Cookies are small data text files and can be stored on your computer's hard drive (if your Web browser permits). This website use cookies for the following

        on the Internet and to present you with information and advertising based on your apparent interests.
        See <a href="#dotayc">Display of advertising/Your choices</a> for more information about our online advertising practices and your choices.</li>

<p>In addition to the above cookies, we use Local Shared Objects, also referred to as "flash cookies," on our website. These are used to enhance your user
    experience, for example, by storing your user preferences and settings, such as your volume/mute settings, and in connection with animated content on

    to deliver or communicate with cookies, to understand whether you have come to this site from an online advertisement displayed on a third-party website,
    and to improve site performance. We also may allow our service providers to use Web beacons to help us understand which emails have been opened by recipients

    <p><strong>Data collected by this website to serve you with relevant advertising</strong><br>
        Hotwire is committed to providing you with relevant content and information. To do this, we may collect, through <a href="#caot">cookies and other technologies</a>
        information about your travel-related searches, such as whether you are looking for airline flights or hotels, and use this information to serve you with ads,
        on our website or elsewhere online, that match your apparent interests. So, for example, if you search for a flight to Florida on our site, you may see an ad
        for a Florida travel package on our site or on another website you visit.</p>

    <p>Please note that we do not combine the information we collect about your travel-related searches on this website with personal information (such as email address)
        to serve you with ads across other websites. We also do not share your personal information with third parties so they can serve you with advertisements.
        You can choose not to receive tailored online advertising on other websites, based on your travel-related searches on this website, by
        clicking <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org" class="popUp" target="_blank">here</a>. Note that if you choose not to receive tailored ads, you will see online
        advertisements, but they will be more general and less relevant to you.</p>

    <p><strong>Data collected by business partners and ad networks to serve you with relevant advertising.</strong><br>
        The advertisements you see on this website are served by us or by our service providers. But we also allow third parties to collect information about your
        online activities through <a href="#caot">cookies and other technologies</a>. These third parties include (1) business partners, who collect
        information when you view or interact with one of their advertisements on our site, and (2) advertising networks, who collect information about your
        interests when you view or interact with one of the advertisements they place on many different websites on the Internet. The information gathered by
        these third parties is used to make predictions about your characteristics, interests or preferences and to display advertisements on our site and
        across the Internet tailored to your apparent interests. We do not permit these third parties to collect personal information about you on our site,
        nor do we share with them any personal information about you.</p>

    <p>Please note that we do not have access to or control over <a href="#caot">cookies and other technologies</a>. These third parties may use to collect
        information about your interests, and the information practices of these third parties are not covered by this Privacy Policy. These companies may
        offer you a way to opt out of ad targeting based on their cookies. You may find more information by clicking on the company names above and following
        the links to the websites of each company. Some of these companies are members of the Network Advertising Initiative, which offers a single location
        to opt out of ad targeting from member companies. To learn more, please click <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org" class="popUp" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

    <p><strong>Data collected by companies that operate cookie-based exchanges to serve you with relevant advertising.</strong><br>
        Like other companies operating online, Expedia.com participates in cookie-based exchanges where anonymous information is collected about your browsing
        behavior through <a href="#caot">cookies and other technologies</a> and segmented into different topics of interest (such as travel).
        These topics of interest are then shared with third parties, including advertisers and ad networks, so they can tailor advertisements to your apparent
        interests. We do not share personal information (such as your email address) with these companies and we do not permit these companies to collect any
        such information about you on our site. Please click <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org" class="popUp" target="_blank">here</a> to learn more about cookie-based
        exchanges, including how to access information about the topics of interest associated with cookies on your computer and how to decline participation
