<p><strong>What information we collect from you</strong></p>


    <p><strong>In General</strong><br>
        We receive and store any information you enter on our website or give us in any other way. This includes
        information that can identify you ("personal information"),
        including your first and last name, telephone number, postal and email addresses, and billing
        information (such as credit card number, cardholder name,
        and expiration date). We may also request information about your hotel room preferences, and frequent flyer and
        car rental program information.
        You can choose not to provide information to us, but in general some information about you is required in order
        for you to register as a member;
        book travel; complete a traveler profile; participate in a survey, contest, or sweepstakes; ask us a question;
        or initiate other transactions on our site.</p>

    <p><strong>Travel Companion Information</strong><br>
        When you make a reservation for someone else through this website, we will request personal information and
        travel preferences about that individual.
        You should obtain the consent of other individuals prior to providing us with their personal information and
        travel preferences, as any access to
        view or change their information will be available only through your account.</p>

    <p><strong>Information from Other Sources</strong><br>
        We also may periodically obtain both personal and non-personal information about you from affiliated entities,
        business partners and other independent third-party
        sources and add it to our account information. Examples of information we may receive include: updated delivery
        and address information, purchase history,
        and demographic information.</p>

    <p><strong>Automatic Information</strong><br>
        We automatically collect some information about your computer when you visit this website. For example, we will
        collect your IP address, Web browser software
        (such as Firefox, Safari, or Internet Explorer), and referring website. We also may collect information about
        your online activity, such as trips viewed and
        bookings made. Our goals in collecting this automatic information include helping customize your user experience
        and inhibiting fraud. For more information,
        please see the "Cookies and other technologies" section below.</p>


<a name="hwuyi"></a>

<p><strong>How we use your information</strong></p>

<p>We use sensitive billing information (such as cardholder name, credit card number, and expiration date) for the
    purpose of completing the travel bookings you conduct on our site. We use other information about you for the
    following general purposes: to provide you with the products and services you request; to provide you with travel
    confirmation and updates; to manage your account, including processing bills and providing travel notifications; to
    communicate with you in general; to respond to your questions and comments; to measure interest in and improve our
    products, services, website, and our Apps; to notify you about special offers and products or services that may be
    of interest to you; to otherwise customize your experience with this website and our Apps; to reward you as part of
    any reward and recognition program you choose to join; to solicit information from you, including through surveys;
    to resolve disputes, collect fees, or troubleshoot problems; to prevent potentially prohibited or illegal
    activities; to enforce our Terms of Use; and as otherwise described to you at the point of collection.</p>

<p>We often receive testimonials and comments from customers who have had positive booking and/or travel experiences on
    our website. We occasionally
    publish such content, using first name plus last initial, only, for attribution.</p>


    <p><strong>E-mail Communications</strong><br>
        We want to make it easy for you to take advantage of travel-related opportunities on our website and through our
        Apps. One way we do this is by sending you email messages that contain information about your apparent
        travel-related interests. For example, if you search for a flight to New York on our website and have saved your
        itinerary or otherwise not yet booked your travel, we may send you an email message reminding you about your
        saved travel itinerary or about a special airfare to New York. Similarly, if you receive an email from us about
        New York travel and demonstrate an interest in New York hotels by affirmatively clicking on a link about New
        York hotels in the email, you may receive an email about New York hotel offers. We believe these email messages
        will provide you with useful information about travel-related special offers available through our site and our
        Apps. Please note that you will have the opportunity to choose not to receive these email messages in any such
        email we send.</p>


<p>Please review the section titled "Your choices with respect to the collection and use of your information" below.</p>

<a name="wwwsyi"></a>

<p><strong>With whom we share your information</strong></p>

<p>This website may share your information with the following entities:</p>


    <p><strong>Suppliers</strong> such as hotel, airline, car rental, and activity providers, who fulfill your travel
        reservations. Throughout this site,
        all services provided by a third-party supplier are described as such. We do not place limitations on our
        suppliers' use or disclosure of your
        personal information. Therefore, we encourage you to review the privacy policies of any travel supplier whose
        products you purchase through this site.
        Please note that these suppliers also may contact you as necessary to obtain additional information about you,
        facilitate your travel reservation, or
        respond to a review you may submit.</p>

    <p><strong>Third-party vendors</strong> who provide services or functions on our behalf, including credit card
        processing, business analytics, customer service, marketing, distribution of surveys or sweepstakes programs,
        and fraud prevention. We may also authorize third-party vendors to collect information on our behalf, including
        as necessary to operate features of our website or our Apps or to facilitate the delivery of online advertising
        tailored to your interests. Third-party vendors have access to and may collect information only as needed to
        perform their functions and are not permitted to share or use the information for any other purpose.</p>

    <p><strong>Business partners</strong> with whom we may jointly offer products or services, or whose products or
        services may be offered on our website or through our Apps. You can tell when a third party is involved in a
        product or service you have requested because their name will appear, either alone or with ours. If you choose
        to access these optional services, we may share information about you, including your personal information, with
        those partners. Please note that we do not control the privacy practices of these third-party business partners.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Referring websites.</strong> If you were referred to this website from another site (for example, through
        a link you clicked on another site
        that directed you to this one), we may share some information about you with that referring website. We have not
        placed limitations on the referring
        websites' use of your personal information and we encourage you to review the privacy policies of any website
        that referred you here.</p>

    <p><strong>Companies within our corporate family.</strong> We may share your personal information with our parent
        company and corporate affiliates,
        such as Expedia.com, CarRentals.com and Hotels.com, as well as international corporate affiliates such as
        Expedia.co.uk. This sharing
        enables us to provide you with information about products and services, both travel-related and other, which
        might interest you. To the extent
        that our parent company and corporate affiliates have access to your information, they will follow practices
        that are at least as restrictive
        as the practices described in this Privacy Policy. They also will comply with applicable laws governing the
        transmission of promotional communications
        and, at a minimum, give you an opportunity in any commercial email they send to choose not to receive such email
        messages in the future.</p>


<p>We also may share your information:</p>

<ul>
    <li>In response to subpoenas, court orders, or other legal process; to establish or exercise our legal rights; to
        defend against legal claims; or
        as otherwise required by law. In such cases we reserve the right to raise or waive any legal objection or right
        available to us.
    </li>
    <li>When we believe it is appropriate to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal or suspected illegal
        activities; to protect and defend the rights, property, or safety of our company or this website or our Apps,
        our customers, or others; and in connection with our Terms of Service and other agreements.
    </li>
    <li>In connection with a corporate transaction, such as a divestiture, merger, consolidation, or asset sale, or in
        the unlikely event of bankruptcy.
    </li>
</ul>

<p>Other than as set out above, you will be notified when personal information about you will be shared with third
    parties, and you will have an opportunity to
    choose not to have us share such information.</p>

<p>We also may share aggregate or anonymous information with third parties, including advertisers and investors. For
    example, we may tell our advertisers the
    number of visitors our website receives or the most popular hotels and vacation destinations. This information does
    not contain any personal information and
    is used to develop content and services we hope you will find of interest.</p>

<p><strong>Cookies and other technologies</strong></p>

<p>Cookies are small data text files and can be stored on your computer's hard drive (if your Web browser permits). This
    website use cookies for the following
    general purposes:</p>

<ul>
    <li>To help us recognize your browser as a previous visitor and save and remember any preferences that may have been
        set while your browser was visiting
        this site. For example, if you register on this site, we may use cookies to remember your registration
        information. Please note that member IDs,
        passwords, and any other account-related data included in such cookies are encrypted for security purposes.
        Unless you register with us, these cookies
        will not contain any personal information.
    </li>
    <li>To help us customize the content and advertisements provided to you on this website and on other sites across
        the Internet. For example, when you
        access a page on our website, a cookie is automatically set by us, our service providers, or our partners to
        recognize your browser as you navigate
        on the Internet and to present you with information and advertising based on your apparent interests.
        See the "Display of advertising/Your choices" section for more information about our online advertising
        practices and your choices.
    </li>
    <li>To help measure and research the effectiveness of website features and offerings, advertisements, and email
        communications (by determining which
        emails you open and act upon).
    </li>
</ul>

<p>The Help portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new
    cookies, how to have the browser notify you
    when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. Please note that if you refuse to accept
    cookies, you may not be able to access many
    of the travel tools offered on our site.</p>

<p>In addition to the above cookies, we use Local Shared Objects, also referred to as "flash cookies," on our website.
    These are used to enhance your user experience, for example, by storing your user preferences and settings, such as
    your volume/mute settings, and in connection with animated content on our website. Local Shared Objects are similar
    to browser cookies, but can store data more complex than simple text. By themselves, they cannot do anything to or
    with the data on your computer. Like other cookies, they can only access personally identifiable information that
    you have provided on this site, and cannot be accessed by other websites. To find out more about flash cookies or

<p>This site may also use Web beacons (also known as clear gifs, pixel tags or Web bugs), which are tiny graphics with a
    unique identifier, similar in function
    to cookies, that are placed in the code of a Web page. We use Web beacons to monitor the traffic patterns of users
    from one page within our site to another,
    to deliver or communicate with cookies, to understand whether you have come to this site from an online
    advertisement displayed on a third-party website,
    and to improve site performance. We also may allow our service providers to use Web beacons to help us understand
    which emails have been opened by recipients
    and to track the visitor traffic and actions on this site. This helps us measure the effectiveness of our content
    and other offerings.</p>

<p><strong>Display of tailored advertising/Your choices</strong></p>


    <p><strong>Data collected by this website to serve you with relevant advertising</strong><br>
        Hotwire is committed to providing you with relevant content and information. To do this, we may collect, through
        cookies and other technologies
        information about your travel-related searches, such as whether you are looking for airline flights or hotels,
        and use this information to serve you with ads,
        on our website or elsewhere online, that match your apparent interests. So, for example, if you search for a
        flight to Florida on our site, you may see an ad
        for a Florida travel package on our site or on another website you visit.</p>

    <p>Please note that we do not combine the information we collect about your travel-related searches on this website
        with personal information (such as email address)
        to serve you with ads across other websites. We also do not share your personal information with third parties
        so they can serve you with advertisements.
        You can choose not to receive tailored online advertising on other websites, based on your travel-related
        searches on this website, by
        clicking <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org" target="_blank">here</a> or <a href="http://www.aboutads.info" target="_blank">here</a>. Note that if you
        choose not to receive tailored ads, you will see online
        advertisements, but they will be more general and less relevant to you.</p>

    <p><strong>Data collected by business partners and ad networks to serve you with relevant advertising.</strong><br>
        The advertisements you see on this website are served by us or by our service providers. But we also allow third
        parties to collect information about your
        online activities through cookies and other technologies. These third parties include (1)
        business partners, who collect
        information when you view or interact with one of their advertisements on our site, and (2) advertising
        networks, who collect information about your
        interests when you view or interact with one of the advertisements they place on many different websites on the
        Internet. The information gathered by
        these third parties is used to make predictions about your characteristics, interests or preferences and to
        display advertisements on our site and
        across the Internet tailored to your apparent interests. We do not permit these third parties to collect
        personal information about you on our site,
        nor do we share with them any personal information about you.</p>

    <p>Please note that we do not have access to or control over cookies and other technologies.
        These third parties may use to collect
        information about your interests, and the information practices of these third parties are not covered by this
        Privacy Policy. These companies may
        offer you a way to opt out of ad targeting based on their cookies. You may find more information by clicking on

    <p><strong>Data collected by companies that operate cookie-based exchanges to serve you with relevant
        advertising.</strong><br>
        Like other companies operating online, Expedia.com participates in cookie-based exchanges where anonymous
        information is collected about your browsing
        behavior through cookies and other technologies and segmented into different topics of
        interest (such as travel).
        These topics of interest are then shared with third parties, including advertisers and ad networks, so they can
        tailor advertisements to your apparent
        interests. We do not share personal information (such as your email address) with these companies and we do not
        permit these companies to collect any
        such information about you on our site. Please click <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org" target="_blank">here</a> to learn more about cookie-based
        exchanges, including how to access information about the topics of interest associated with cookies on your
        computer and how to decline participation

<p><strong>Do-Not-Track Signals and Similar Mechanisms</strong><br>
Some web browsers may transmit “do-not-track” signals to websites with which the browser communicates. Because of differences in how web browsers incorporate and activate this feature, it is not always clear whether users intend for these signals to be transmitted, or whether they even are aware of them. Participants in the leading Internet standards-setting organization that is addressing this issue are in the process of determining what, if anything, websites should do when they receive such signals. Hotwire currently does not take action in response to these signals. If and when a final standard is established and accepted, we will reassess how to respond to these signals.</p>

<p><strong>Using the Hotwire.com mobile phone and tablet Apps (the “Mobile Apps”)</strong></p>

    <p>When you use a Hotwire.com Mobile App, we collect and use information about you in the same way and for the same
        purposes as we do when you use our website.</p>

    <p>In addition to this, we also use some other information that we collect automatically when you use our Mobile
        Apps. Specifically:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>We collect information about Mobile App functionality that you access and use. This allows us to identify
            those areas of the Mobile App that are of interest to our customers so that we can refine and continuously
            improve the Mobile App. The information we collect for this purpose does not enable us to directly identify
            you.
        </li>
        <li>Each Mobile App also creates a sequence of numbers or characters that are unique to your mobile device (a
            “Mobile Identifier”), which is used for identification purposes, including identifying your preferences. We
            use communicate with our advertising networks regarding the number of downloads resulting from clicks on
            their respective ad banners and other marketing tools using industry standard mobile identifiers.
        </li>
        <li>If you use a Mobile App's ’find hotels’ feature using your ‘current location,’ we use information about your
            current location – provided by your mobile device using GPS or similar technologies – to show nearby
            facilities. We do not collect location data unless you expressly click on the ’find hotels’ feature using
            ‘current location’ as your destination or you switch on location data collection through your phone settings
            menu.
        </li>
        <li>Each Mobile App will also send us error-reporting information in the event that it crashes or hangs. This
            enables us to investigate the error and to improve the stability of the Mobile App for future releases. As
            part of these error reports, the Mobile App sends us information about the mobile device type and version,
            the Mobile Identifier, the time the error occurred, the feature being used and the state of the application
            when the error occurred. We do not use this information for any purpose other than investigating and
            remedying the error.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>You always have the ability to control certain information a Mobile App sends to us. You can switch off location
        data collection at any time through your phone settings menu. Alternatively, you can remove the Mobile App from
        your mobile device entirely and access our services through our website.</p>
