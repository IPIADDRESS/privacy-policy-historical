<p><strong class="fnt40">What information we collect from you</strong></p>

<div class="ml30">
    <p><strong>In General</strong><br>
        We receive and store any information you enter on our website or give us in any other way. This includes
        information that can identify you ("personal information"),
        including your first and last name, telephone number, postal and email addresses, fax number, and billing
        information (such as credit card number, cardholder name,
        and expiration date). We may also request information about your hotel room preferences, and frequent flyer and
        car rental program information.
        You can choose not to provide information to us, but in general some information about you is required in order
        for you to register as a member;
        book travel; complete a traveler profile; participate in a survey, contest, or sweepstakes; ask us a question;
        or initiate other transactions on our site.</p>

    <p><strong>Travel Companion Information</strong><br>
        When you make a reservation for someone else through this website, we will request personal information and
        travel preferences about that individual.
        You should obtain the consent of other individuals prior to providing us with their personal information and
        travel preferences, as any access to
        view or change their information will be available only through your account.</p>

    <p><strong>Information from Other Sources</strong><br>
        We also may periodically obtain both personal and non-personal information about you from affiliated entities,
        business partners and other independent third-party
        sources and add it to our account information. Examples of information we may receive include: updated delivery
        and address information, purchase history,
        and demographic information.</p>

    <p><strong>Automatic Information</strong><br>
        We automatically collect some information about your computer when you visit this website. For example, we will
        collect your IP address, Web browser software
        (such as Firefox, Safari, or Internet Explorer), and referring website. We also may collect information about
        your online activity, such as trips viewed and
        bookings made. Our goals in collecting this automatic information include helping customize your user experience
        and inhibiting fraud. For more information,
        please see <a href="#caot">Cookies and other technologies.</a></p>
</div>

<a name="hwuyi"></a>

<p><strong class="fnt40">How we use your information</strong></p>

<p>We use sensitive billing information (such as cardholder name, credit card number, and expiration date) for the
    purpose of completing the travel bookings you conduct on our site. We use other information about you for the
    following general purposes: to provide you with the products and services you request; to provide you with travel
    confirmation and updates; to manage your account, including processing bills and providing travel notifications; to
    communicate with you in general; to respond to your questions and comments; to measure interest in and improve our
    products, services, website, and our Apps; to notify you about special offers and products or services that may be
    of interest to you; to otherwise customize your experience with this website and our Apps; to reward you as part of
    any reward and recognition program you choose to join; to solicit information from you, including through surveys;
    to resolve disputes, collect fees, or troubleshoot problems; to prevent potentially prohibited or illegal
    activities; to enforce our Terms of Use; and as otherwise described to you at the point of collection.</p>

<p>We often receive testimonials and comments from customers who have had positive booking and/or travel experiences on
    our website. We occasionally
    publish such content, using first name plus last initial, only, for attribution.</p>

<div class="ml30">
    <p><strong>E-mail Communications</strong><br>
        We want to make it easy for you to take advantage of travel-related opportunities on our website and through our
        Apps. One way we do this is by sending you email messages that contain information about your apparent
        travel-related interests. For example, if you search for a flight to New York on our website and have saved your
        itinerary or otherwise not yet booked your travel, we may send you an email message reminding you about your
        saved travel itinerary or about a special airfare to New York. Similarly, if you receive an email from us about
        New York travel and demonstrate an interest in New York hotels by affirmatively clicking on a link about New
        York hotels in the email, you may receive an email about New York hotel offers. We believe these email messages
        will provide you with useful information about travel-related special offers available through our site and our
        Apps. Please note that you will have the opportunity to choose not to receive these email messages in any such
        email we send.</p>
</div>

<p>Please review <a href="#ycwrttcauoyi">Your choices with respect to the collection and use of your information</a>
    below.</p>

<a name="wwwsyi"></a>

<p><strong class="fnt40">With whom we share your information</strong></p>

<p>This website may share your information with the following entities:</p>

<div class="ml30">
    <p><strong>Suppliers</strong> such as hotel, airline, car rental, and activity providers, who fulfill your travel
        reservations. Throughout this site,
        all services provided by a third-party supplier are described as such. We do not place limitations on our
        suppliers' use or disclosure of your
        personal information. Therefore, we encourage you to review the privacy policies of any travel supplier whose
        products you purchase through this site.
        Please note that these suppliers also may contact you as necessary to obtain additional information about you,
        facilitate your travel reservation, or
        respond to a review you may submit.</p>

    <p><strong>Third-party vendors</strong> who provide services or functions on our behalf, including credit card
        processing, business analytics, customer service, marketing, distribution of surveys or sweepstakes programs,
        and fraud prevention. We may also authorize third-party vendors to collect information on our behalf, including
        as necessary to operate features of our website or our Apps or to facilitate the delivery of online advertising
        tailored to your interests. Third-party vendors have access to and may collect information only as needed to
        perform their functions and are not permitted to share or use the information for any other purpose.</p>

    <p><strong>Business partners</strong> with whom we may jointly offer products or services, or whose products or
        services may be offered on our website or through our Apps. You can tell when a third party is involved in a
        product or service you have requested because their name will appear, either alone or with ours. If you choose
        to access these optional services, we may share information about you, including your personal information, with
        those partners. Please note that we do not control the privacy practices of these third-party business partners.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Referring websites.</strong> If you were referred to this website from another site (for example, through
        a link you clicked on another site
        that directed you to this one), we may share some information about you with that referring website. We have not
        placed limitations on the referring
        websites' use of your personal information and we encourage you to review the privacy policies of any website
        that referred you here.</p>

    <p><strong>Companies within our corporate family.</strong> We may share your personal information with our parent
        company and corporate affiliates,
        such as Expedia.com, CarRentals.com and Hotels.com, as well as international corporate affiliates such as
        Hotels.uk.com. This sharing
        enables us to provide you with information about products and services, both travel-related and other, which
        might interest you. To the extent
        that our parent company and corporate affiliates have access to your information, they will follow practices
        that are at least as restrictive
        as the practices described in this Privacy Policy. They also will comply with applicable laws governing the
        transmission of promotional communications
        and, at a minimum, give you an opportunity in any commercial email they send to choose not to receive such email
        messages in the future.</p>
</div>

<p>We also may share your information:</p>

<ul class="disc">
    <li>In response to subpoenas, court orders, or other legal process; to establish or exercise our legal rights; to
        defend against legal claims; or
        as otherwise required by law. In such cases we reserve the right to raise or waive any legal objection or right
        available to us.
    </li>
    <li>When we believe it is appropriate to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal or suspected illegal
        activities; to protect and defend the rights, property, or safety of our company or this website or our Apps,
        our customers, or others; and in connection with our Terms of Service and other agreements.
    </li>
    <li>In connection with a corporate transaction, such as a divestiture, merger, consolidation, or asset sale, or in
        the unlikely event of bankruptcy.
    </li>
</ul>

<p>Other than as set out above, you will be notified when personal information about you will be shared with third
    parties, and you will have an opportunity to
    choose not to have us share such information.</p>

<p>We also may share aggregate or anonymous information with third parties, including advertisers and investors. For
    example, we may tell our advertisers the
    number of visitors our website receives or the most popular hotels and vacation destinations. This information does
    not contain any personal information and
    is used to develop content and services we hope you will find of interest.</p>

<p><strong class="fnt40">Using the Hotwire.com mobile phone and tablet Apps (the “Mobile Apps”)</strong></p>

<div>
    <p>When you use a Hotwire.com Mobile App, we collect and use information about you in the same way and for the same
        purposes as we do when you use our website.</p>

    <p>In addition to this, we also use some other information that we collect automatically when you use our Mobile
        Apps. Specifically:</p>
    <ul class="disc">
        <li>We collect information about Mobile App functionality that you access and use. This allows us to identify
            those areas of the Mobile App that are of interest to our customers so that we can refine and continuously
            improve the Mobile App. The information we collect for this purpose does not enable us to directly identify
            you.
        </li>
        <li>Each Mobile App also creates a sequence of numbers or characters that are unique to your mobile device (a
            “Mobile Identifier”), which is used for identification purposes, including identifying your preferences. We
            use communicate with our advertising networks regarding the number of downloads resulting from clicks on
            their respective ad banners and other marketing tools using industry standard mobile identifiers.
        </li>
        <li>If you use a Mobile App's ’find hotels’ feature using your ‘current location,’ we use information about your
            current location – provided by your mobile device using GPS or similar technologies – to show nearby
            facilities. We do not collect location data unless you expressly click on the ’find hotels’ feature using
            ‘current location’ as your destination or you switch on location data collection through your phone settings
            menu.
        </li>
        <li>Each Mobile App will also send us error-reporting information in the event that it crashes or hangs. This
            enables us to investigate the error and to improve the stability of the Mobile App for future releases. As
            part of these error reports, the Mobile App sends us information about the mobile device type and version,
            the Mobile Identifier, the time the error occurred, the feature being used and the state of the application
            when the error occurred. We do not use this information for any purpose other than investigating and
            remedying the error.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>You always have the ability to control certain information a Mobile App sends to us. You can switch off location
        data collection at any time through your phone settings menu. Alternatively, you can remove the Mobile App from
        your mobile device entirely and access our services through our website.</p>

    <p><strong>Data collected by this website to serve you with relevant advertising</strong><br>
        Hotwire is committed to providing you with relevant content and information. To do this, we may collect, through
        <a href="#caot">cookies and other technologies</a>
        information about your travel-related searches, such as whether you are looking for airline flights or hotels,
        and use this information to serve you with ads,
        on our website or elsewhere online, that match your apparent interests. So, for example, if you search for a
        flight to Florida on our site, you may see an ad
        for a Florida travel package on our site or on another website you visit.</p>

    <p>Please note that we do not combine the information we collect about your travel-related searches on this website
        with personal information (such as email address)

        networks, who collect information about your

    <p><strong>Data collected by companies that operate cookie-based exchanges to serve you with relevant

        Like other companies operating online, Expedia.com participates in cookie-based exchanges where anonymous
        information is collected about your browsing
        behavior through <a href="#caot">cookies and other technologies</a> and segmented into different topics of
        interest (such as travel).
        These topics of interest are then shared with third parties, including advertisers and ad networks, so they can

        interests. We do not share personal information (such as your email address) with these companies and we do not
