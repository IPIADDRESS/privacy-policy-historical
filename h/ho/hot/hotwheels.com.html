A Special Note for Parents</a></b>
</center>
<p>It is Mattel's intention, with each of its websites, to adhere
to the Children's Advertising Review Unit (CARU) guidelines, including its
guidelines on Internet advertising. All Mattel marketing efforts, including
this website, are closely scrutinized to conform to these guidelines.
We encourage parents to monitor their children's online use,
and to help us protect their privacy by instructing them never to
provide personal information on this site or any
other without permission.

</p><center><p><b>Mattel Online Privacy Policy</b></p></center>
<p>Mattel is very concerned about the protection of online
privacy for all our website visitors. Although we track
the total number of visitors to each of our sites in an
aggregate form to allow us to update and improve our sites,
personally identifiable information is not extracted in this
process. Any "cookie" technology (where our servers deposit
special codes on a visitor's computer) will only be used to track
non-personal information such as type of browser,
operating system, and domain names to improve our visitors' online experience.

</p><p>Mattel only collects personally identifiable data,
such as names, addresses, e-mail addresses, and the
like, when voluntarily submitted by a visitor in one
of our guestbooks, registries, or survey sections. We
ask for age first so that we can provide our younger
audience (under 18) with an appropriate questionnaire
that does not ask any personal questions. In addition,
we advise minors to get parental permission before filling
out any online forms. Please see our Special Note for Parents (above).

</p><p>Mattel does not sell or release any information gathered on
our websites to any third parties. All information gathered
online will be used only by Mattel for internal marketing analysis
and to improve our products, services and websites.

</p><p>In some instances, when an e-mail address has been provided
by the visitor, and the visitor is 18 or older and has indicated
that he/she would like to receive communications from us, we will
send notices to visitors, usually in the form of an e-mail.
These notices, sent periodically, will announce website upgrades,
new product information and other similar updates. 

</p><p>We reserve the right to change this policy at any time by notifying
guests of the existence of a new privacy policy.
