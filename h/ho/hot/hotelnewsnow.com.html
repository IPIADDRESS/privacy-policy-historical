Of course, we are not responsible for the accuracy of any information provided to us by a third party. <br><br><strong>Do Not Track Policy<br></strong><br>“Do Not Track” is a proposed standard that is currently under development.

<p><span>•&nbsp;</span>To register you as a user on our websites and other client portals. This applies whether you signed up directly with us as a user, or were identified as a user by someone within your organization. <br>• For invoicing purposes and for credit card payment processing, using a third party vendor. <br>• To contact you (whether by phone or email), if necessary, about your order. <br>• If you are an employee or representative of one of our hotel clients, to contact you to inquire about your data or your competitive set selection, and to discuss your contract renewal. <br>• To notify you about other STR Group products and services, or any STR Group events, in which you may be interested.<br>• To notify you about any updates or maintenance to our websites.<br>• To notify you about any corrections or delays in our data reporting. <br>• For marketing and advertising purposes, if we have received your consent to send you these communications. However, we do not sell our client lists to any other third parties for use in their marketing campaigns. Also, at any time you may opt out of receiving such marketing materials and solicitations from us.<br>• In relation to our Hotel Data Conference (HDC), for the purpose of registering you as an attendee and sending you updates prior to and during the conference. In addition, we will provide HDC sponsors with the list of attendees free of charge and as a benefit to them. If you are an HDC attendee but wish to limit how your contact information is used you may opt out. <br>• STR Group webmasters use cookie information to analyze the number of visitors to different areas of the websites, to determine how long users are remaining on the sites, and to make sure that our websites are serving as a useful, effective information source for you. <br>• To contact you to inquire whether you wish to participate in a consumer survey on behalf of third party travel and tourism organizations. <br>• If you are a main point of contact for a hotel company, for inclusion in the STR Directory (formerly the AH&amp;LA Directory). <br>• To analyze and report on the results of surveys or other research methods. <br>• To comply with our legal and contractual obligations, to resolve disputes and to enforce agreements.</p>
<p>You may object to our use of your information for any of these purposes and you may ask that we case such use at any time by contacting us at&nbsp;<a href="mailto:email:privacy@str.com">privacy@str.com</a> or calling our U.S. headquarters at 1-615-824-8664 extension 3340. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Please note that if we fulfill a particular request we may no longer be able to communicate with you or provide you with news, information, data or other services you or your company has been receiving from us</strong><strong>.</strong></span><strong> </strong><br><br><strong>With Whom Do We Share Your Personal Information? How Long Do We Keep it?</strong><br><br>Your personal information may be shared between and among STR, Inc. in the United States and STR Global, Ltd in the UK, with offices in Germany, Beijing, Dubai, Australia, Brazil, Singapore, and Spain, for purposes of enabling HNN and the rest of the STR Group to provide you with current hotel industry news, as well as the optimal data and analytic services that our customers expect. <br><br>We also contract with third party data processors to help us store, catalog and process your contact and payment/credit card information for our sales, service and marketing activities. Among these third parties are SalesForce (cloud based Customer Relations Management), Cvent (Hotel Data Conference registration), MailChimp (marketing and promotional emails), Azure (online data storage), and Proofpoint (email firewall). We require all third party data processors to keep confidential the personal information that we disclose to them and to only use such personal information for the purpose for which it was disclosed. Please let us know if you would like more information about how we work with these companies. We recognize that, under certain data privacy laws and regulations, STR Group may be liable for the actions of those agents and processors we use to process your information.</p>
<p>As stated above, if you are an attendee at our Hotel Data Conference, we may share your contact information with certain corporate sponsors of the Conference. <br><br>We may provide information to regulatory authorities and law enforcement officials in accordance with applicable law or when we otherwise believe in good faith that the law requires it. There may be instances when we may access or disclose your information in order to protect or defend the legal rights or property of the STR Group or their employees and agents, to protect the safety and security of users, and to protect against fraud.<br><br>The STR Group may sell, transfer or otherwise share some or all of its assets in connection with a merger, reorganization or sale of assets, or in the event of bankruptcy, without your permission. In such an event, personal information may be one of the assets transferred.<br><br>We will not share your information with any other party, for any reason, unless otherwise disclosed at the point of collection. If that occurs, you will have the opportunity to refuse to give us consent or to withdraw your consent if previously given. <br><br>We retain your personal information for as long as needed to provide you or your company with our services. We also retain and use this information as necessary to comply with legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce agreements. If you are a participant in a survey, we retain your personal information until we have completed the project for the third party for whom the survey was conducted.<br><br><strong>You May Access Your Information, Correct It And Delete It.</strong><br><br>We are dedicated to providing reasonable access to visitors who wish to review the personal information we have retained so that they may correct any inaccuracies it may contain or opt to delete the information. <br><br>If you wish to see the information about you that we have in our possession, if you wish to correct this information or if you wish to have it deleted in its entirety from our systems, please email us at&nbsp;<a href="mailto:privacy@str.com">privacy@str.com</a> or call 615-824-8664 extension 3340. <br><br>While we will respond to your request as quickly as possible, please allow us no more than 30 days for any personal information about you to be accessed, extracted modified and/or deleted from our servers and those of our third-party vendors. <br><br>We will certainly respect and fulfill your request to have your information removed from our system. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>However, please note that in certain cases (such as where you are on a distribution list or identified as the contact person for a hotel that is participating with us) such removal may result in you no longer having access to HNN news and information or to STR Group reports and data, being able to take part in ongoing research in which you may have previously indicated you wanted to participate, or hearing about new or updated STR Group products, services and events. Also, if you are the main contact for your company, or are the person identified to receive invoices on behalf of your company, we will first need for you to identify the person who will be your replacement. We will assume that you have the authority to provide us with that person’s contact information.<br></strong></span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Also, please bear in mind that, even if we delete your information, it may still persist on back-up tapes and archival documents or electronic media on which other business critical information is stored and which STR must retain for legal, tax, or regulatory reasons, or for legitimate and lawful business purposes. Access to such archival information is limited to only authorized personnel who are under an obligation to maintain its confidentiality.</strong></span><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>

<div class="toggleText">
<p>Hotel News Now recognizes its responsibility to correct factual errors of all types promptly on its website as soon as the error is brought to an editor’s attention. Hotel News Now’s goal is to be transparent and honest in its reporting, and marking corrections serves all readers. The onus for errors in articles falls on Hotel News Now, and we take full responsibility and accountability when errors are found. Minor errors of spelling, punctuation, etc., will be corrected on our website without notice.</p>
<p>A complaint about an error from a source, a reader or a staff member should be reported, investigated and rectified quickly. A correction, if needed, will follow immediately.</p>
<p>In the event of a delay of more than a month, the correction should clarify how recently the error was discovered or why the checking took so long. The justification should also acknowledge a reporting or editing lapse, if that may be the case. Information or data is deemed correct on date of publication, unless otherwise notified. Once reviewed, we’ll determine if any action needs to be taken.</p>
<p>In the case that Hotel News Now has been misinformed by another company or reference work, the error can be attributed as such, “ … included in an erroneous profit figure from the company’s annual report.” After acknowledging the error, the correction will remind of the specific error with the correct statement.</p>
<p>It’s important for the Hotel News Now editorial staff to remain transparent and focus on accuracy. As our readers, we hope you won’t hesitate to bring the error to our attention. If so, please email <span>Managing Editor Robert McCune</span><span><span>&nbsp;</span>at<span>&nbsp;</span></span><a href="mailto:rmccune@hotelnewsnow.com" target="_blank">rmccune@hotelnewsnow.com</a>&nbsp;so the inaccuracy can be reviewed and fixed, if necessary.</p>
