                      <br>
                    This policy describes the types of information we may collect from visitors and  how that information is used. Please read this policy carefully before  providing us with any personal information. If you have questions about this  policy, <u><a href="/contact-us.html">contact us</a></u>.<br>
                    <br>
  <strong>Information we collect.</strong><br>
  <strong><br>
  Unregistered users </strong><br>
                    You can register at some of our sites to take advantage of personalization  features or to purchase travel services. <br>
  <br>
                    If you do not register, then the information we collect from you is limited. We  log your IP address in order to help diagnose problems with our server,  administer our Web site and track usage statistics. Your IP address may vary  each time you visit, or it may be the same. It would be extremely difficult for  us to identify you through your IP address, and we make no attempt to do so. If  you reached our site by clicking on a link or advertisement on another site, we  may log that information. All of this information is collected and used only in  the aggregate.<br>
  <br>
                    We may place a small “cookie” file on your computer's hard drive. A cookie may  contain information that allows us to track your path through our Web site and  to determine whether you have visited us before. Unless you register with us or  purchase from us, the cookie contains no personally identifiable information.  We may use cookies to help us understand how visitors use our site, and to help  us to improve our site. You may elect not to accept cookies by changing  settings in your browser.</p>
                  <p><strong>Registered users</strong><br>
                    If you purchase travel or other services or goods from us or you choose to  register with us independently for other benefits, we will collect personal  information from you in addition to the non-personal information described  above. The information we collect may vary, but we only collect the information  that you manually enter into our forms or otherwise authorize us to collect.  That personal information may include your name, email address, mailing  address, telephone number, payment information, travel and other &nbsp;preferences, user name and password, as well as  contact information for other people that you provide to us. &nbsp;To provide an enhance personalized service, we  may store all or some of that information in a cookie file on your hard drive,  so that our system will recognize you each time you visit our site. &nbsp;In that way, we can save your preferences from  visit to visit and present you with a customized Web site, without requiring  you to log into our site every time you visit.&nbsp;  Additionally, authorized personnel may update your registration  information to accurately reflect any new information included in  communications received from you.</p>
                  <p><strong>Partner Sites</strong><br>
                    We work with partners to make sure that we can provide you with the best  possible services.&nbsp; If you reach our site  through one of our partners rather than directly through us and you choose to  register or purchase travel or other services or goods with them while they are  acting as a service provider to us, they may provide certain of the information  to us so that we can still enhance your service and any such information will  be covered under the parameters of this privacy statement.&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition our partners may have their own  privacy statements which govern their use of information that they collect and  we encourage our users to read their statements as well before submitting any  personal information.</p>
                  <p>                    <strong>How we use the personal  information we collect.</strong> <br>
                    Your information allows us to personalize our Web site so that it is most  useful to you. It may allow you to log into our site automatically each time  you visit, rather than manually typing your user name and password every time.  We may use your personal information to periodically contact you with news or  important information, to provide you with other information or invitations  related to your membership, and to request your feedback on our site.&nbsp; For instance when you purchase travel or  other services or goods from us we will send you travel booking or other  relevant confirmations relating to your order.&nbsp;  In addition, we send our customers and registers users periodic  newsletters as well as valuable travel specials and other offers such as a  special on a dream vacation, low cost airfare rates or relevant deals that we  have secured for our users.&nbsp; We can use  the information that you give us to make our specials more relevant to  you.&nbsp; While many of our users look  forward to receiving such offers, if you decide for any reason to not receive  newsletter or special offers from us you can opt-out at any time by letting us  know (opt-out links are provided in all emails).&nbsp; If you change you mind then just opt back in  by letting us know.</p>
                  <p>                    <strong>Disclosure of your personal information. </strong><br>
                    We may share some of your personally identifiable information with our parent  company, our subsidiaries and sister companies. &nbsp;They are required to place restrictions on the  use of personal information that comply with the provisions of this privacy  policy.&nbsp; We also may share your personal  information with third-parties engaged to provide services to us (such as  market research firms, marketing services providers and advertising agencies).  We will ensure those parties agree to use any such personally-identifiable data  solely for the purpose of providing the specified services to us. We must  cooperate with legal authorities, and may in some circumstances be required to  disclose personally identifiable information in response to requests from law  enforcement authorities, or in response to a subpoena or other legal process.  We can turn over information about you if we believe we must in order to prevent  a violation of the law, and by accepting this policy, you consent to our doing  so, in our sole discretion. You also consent to our disclosing information  about you in the course of legal proceedings if we are legally required to do  so, if we reasonably believe that doing so may mitigate our liability, or if  doing so will assist us in enforcing our legal rights. We also may share your  information in connection with a corporate transaction, such as a divestiture,  merger, consolidation, or asset sale, and in the unlikely event of bankruptcy.</p>
                  <p>                    <strong>Changes to this Privacy Policy.</strong><br>
                    We reserve the right to change this policy should we deem it advisable to do so.&nbsp; Our Privacy Policy will be available online  for your review. If we make material changes that will affect personal  information we have already collected from you, we will make reasonable efforts  to notify you of the changes and give you the opportunity to amend or cancel  your registration.</p>
