	<h1>Hotkeys  Privacy Policy</h1>
	<h5>Introduction.</h5>
	<p>In general, HotMedia, Inc. (“Hotkeys” or “we”) does not collect, store, use or disclose personally identifying information except in very specific instances, such as, for example, when you enroll as an advertiser in the services (“Services”) available on the Hotkeys website (the “Site”). Whenever we collect such personally identifying information, you will have a choice regarding whether to provide it. The instances in which Hotkeys does collect and use personally identifying information are specifically described in this Privacy Policy. Hotkeys values its users and their concerns about privacy. To this end, Hotkeys engages in consistent information practices and uses its best efforts to make clear disclosures regarding those practices. This Privacy Policy is a part of that effort.</p>
	<h5>What does  this Privacy Policy cover?</h5>
	<p>This Privacy Policy applies to collection, use, storage and disclosure of information by Hotkeys. By using the Services and our Site, you consent to the collection and use of your information as we outline in this Privacy Policy. Hotkeys may decide to change this Privacy Policy from time to time. When we do, we will post any changes here so that you are always informed of the information we collect, how we use it, and the circumstances under which we disclose it. Please be aware that, as part of the Services, Hotkeys provides links to Web sites operated by third parties, and may also provide search results and similar services to third parties for display on their own Web sites or applications. Hotkeys is not responsible for the information collection or privacy practices or the content of those third party Web sites or applications. Also, please be aware that banner ads on Hotkeys are provided by a third party, which may collect cookies as part of the process of serving those ads. These cookies are typically used for the purpose of tracking performance of the banner ads. Hotkeys does not determine which information will be collected by that third party. Please see the paragraph below regarding Third Party Banner Ads.</p>
	
	<h5>Third Party Banner Ads.</h5>
	<p>We may use other third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our Site. These companies may use information (not including your name, address, e-mail address or telephone number) about your visits to this and other Web sites in order to provide advertisements on this site and other sites about goods and services that may be of interest to you.</p>
	
	<h5>What information does Hotkeys collect and how is it used? Does Hotkeys disclose information to third parties?</h5>
	<p>Hotkeys may collect any or all of the following four types of information: (a)  traffic or clickstream data, (b) cookies, or (c) contact information and other  personally identifying information. Hotkeys's collection and use of each type of data is described below, as well as the ways (if any) in which the data may  be shared with third parties.</p>
	<ol class="ol_1" style="list-style:lower-alpha">
		<li><strong>Traffic or Clickstream Data.</strong> Data about traffic and usage is not personally identifying or identifiable, and is not supplemented or combined with personally identifying or identifiable information. Hotkeys may share information it collects with certain selected third parties, but only in aggregated, anonymous form. For example, we may tell an advertiser that a certain number of people visited a certain area on our Site, or searched Web sites for the term “boat.” Hotkeys collects some information regarding use of the Services by observing browser functions and the files (pages) users access. For example, Hotkeys's servers collect information about the site from which you entered to enable Hotkeys to calculate and pay its affiliates, information about the most frequently searched terms to help its advertisers provide the most relevant search results, information about usage to check for fraudulent behavior or other abnormalities and to ensure that our Services are technically superior. In addition to the foregoing applications, Hotkeys uses the information (in aggregate form) to better design the Services.</li>
		<li><strong>Cookies.</strong> Like many sites, Hotkeys collects information about online behavior using cookies. These cookies contain identification information that enables us to see how our users are interacting with our site and how frequently they are returning, as well as to streamline their experiences using the Services. Our cookies do not contain any personally identifiable information. Cookies let us know about repeat visitors and if we are delivering quality products and services. Hotkeys may also use cookies to identify which sites our repeat visitors are coming from, so that we can place more of our online advertising on these sites, and can, where necessary, pay our affiliates and other business partners. To Hotkeys, using information within cookies is an anonymous way to survey how we are doing and to look for ways to improve our Services. You may set your browser software to reject cookies, but you may not be able to use all of the features of the Services. Hotkeys may share information about usage of the Services with third parties, but only in aggregated, anonymous form. In the course of serving advertisements to this site, our third-party advertiser may place or recognize a unique “cookie” on your browser.</li>
		<li><strong>Contact Information or Personally Identifying Information.</strong> Hotkeys can obtain access to your name, e-mail address and other contact information only (1) when you sign up for an account on the Site, become an advertiser with Hotkeys, provide comments, submit a problem, or request information from Hotkeys and provide your name or return contact information, or (2) in connection with special offers or contests.<br><br>
	    Contact information provided in connection with problems, comments or requests is used only to respond to those problems, comments or requests. This information is not stored or used in connection with traffic or clickstream data and is provided to a third party only as necessary to respond to the comment, problem or request. You may also choose to provide contact information, other personally identifying information, and demographic information in order to participate in optional surveys or contests, which are run for promotional purposes. Hotkeys uses such information to send you information about its products and to notify you if you win the contest. Finally, from time to time, but only with your permission, Hotkeys may provide certain of its users' registration information to selected third parties who wish to participate in special promotions offered in conjunction with Hotkeys. Users may opt-out of receiving such communications at any time by contacting Hotkeys.</li>
	</ol>
	<h5>Is data  stored by Hotkeys secure?</h5>
	<p>To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the appropriate use of information, Hotkeys has put in place physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information it collects online. However, data security is a constantly evolving art and science. You should consider any communication that you transmit to Hotkeys (such as data, questions or answers, comments, or suggestions) as non-confidential, and agree that Hotkeys will not be liable or responsible if information that belongs to you is intercepted and used by an unintended recipient.</p>
	<h5>Does Hotkeys  collect personally identifying information from or about children?</h5>
	<p>Hotkeys uses reasonable efforts not to collect, use or disclose individually identifiable information from children under the age of 13. The Services are not targeted at children, and children may not register for any portions of the Services that require registration. Please check with those sites to determine their privacy policy.</p>
	<h5>How can I access or correct any personally identifying information about me?</h5>
	<p>To request a copy of the personally identifiable information you have sent to Hotkeys, please send an e-mail containing your request to <a href="mailto:Service@hotkeys.com">Service@hotkeys.com</a>.  You must provide your full name and the e-mail from which the request is  received (and to which the response will be sent) must match the e-mail on file with Hotkeys. You may then correct or delete such information using the procedures specified in the e-mail.</p>
	<h5>How do I  find out more about Hotkeys's information practices?</h5>
	<p>If you have any questions about anything in this Privacy Policy, or about collection of personally identifiable information, or information generally, please contact Hotkeys as follows:</p>
