                    <div><em>In General.</em> We receive and store any information you enter on our Web site or give us in any other way. This includes information that can identify you ("personal information"), including your first and last name, telephone number, postal and e-mail addresses, and, in some cases, billing information (such as credit card number, cardholder name, and expiration date). We also may request information about your traveler preferences, including meal requests, seat selection, frequent flyer/hotel/car rental program information, and ticketing options. You can choose not to provide information to us, but in general some information about you is required in order for you to register as a member; purchase products or services; complete a traveler profile; participate in a survey, contest, or sweepstakes; ask us a question; or initiate other transactions on our site.</div>

                    <div><em>Passenger Information.</em> When you make travel or other arrangements for someone else through Hotel-Board.com, we will request personal information and travel preferences about that individual. You should obtain the consent of other individuals prior to providing Hotel-Board.com with their personal information and travel preferences, as any access to view or change their information will be available only through your account.</div>

                    <div><em>Information from Other Sources</em>. We also may periodically obtain information about you from our business partners and other independent third-party sources and add it to our account information. Examples of information we may receive include: updated delivery and address information, which we use to correct our records and to facilitate proper delivery of travel information; and demographic information, which we use to better understand your potential purchasing preferences.</div>

                    <div><em>Automatic Information</em>. We automatically collect some information about your computer when you visit Hotel-Board.com. For example, we will collect your IP address, Web browser software (such as Netscape Navigator or Internet Explorer), and referring Web site. We also may collect information about your online activity, such as trips viewed and purchases made. One of our goals in collecting this automatic information is to help customize your user experience.</div>

                    <div><em>Cookies and Other Web Technologies</em>. When you visit Hotel-Board.com, we may assign your computer a "cookie" (a small, unique identifier text file). For example, whenever you sign in as an Hotel-Board.com member, we record your member ID and the name on your member account in the cookie file on your computer. We also may record your password in this cookie file, if you checked the box entitled "Save this password for automatic sign-in." Note that member IDs, passwords, and any other account-related data included in such cookies are encrypted for security purposes. You can always choose not to receive a cookie file by enabling your Web browser to refuse cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie. Please note that if you refuse to accept cookies from Hotel-Board.com, you may not be able to access many of the travel tools offered by Hotel-Board.com.</div>

                    <div><em>Information Collected by Third-Party Advertising Companies</em>. Third-party advertisers, such as those we use to serve ads on our behalf across the Internet, may use cookies and other technologies (such as Web beacons or single-pixel GIFS) for several purposes, including: to measure the effectiveness of their ads; to analyze, modify, and personalize advertising content on Hotel-Board.com and other sites; and to provide ads about goods and services we hope will be of interest to you. We do not have access to or control over cookies or other features they may use, and the information practices of these advertisers are not covered by this Privacy Policy. You can find out more about third-party advertisers and explore the option of not having this information collected by clicking here.</div>

                    <div>Hotel-Board.com uses sensitive billing information (such as cardholder name, credit card number, and expiration date) for the purpose of completing the travel purchases you conduct on our site.
