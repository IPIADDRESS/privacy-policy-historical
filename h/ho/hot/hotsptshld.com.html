<h2>Privacy Policy</h2>

  <br>
We may update this   Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make any material changes in the way we   collect, use and/or share information, we will notify you by prominently posting   notice of the changes on the Sites. We encourage you to periodically review our   Privacy Policy to be sure you are familiar with the most current version. The   Privacy Policy will state the date it was last amended at the top of the   page.<br>

<h3>Who controls the information we collect from or about you?</h3>
<br>
Any   information collected by means of the Sites, Services or Software is controlled   by IAC Search &amp; Media Europe Limited, the data controller, whose contact   details are <a href="http://sp.uk.qbyrd.com/en/docs/about/index.shtml">here</a>.<br>

<a href="#top">Back to Top</a><br>
<br>
<p><a name="2" id="2"></a> </p>
<h3>What types of information do we collect?</h3>
<br>
We collect certain   information that cannot by itself be linked to a specific individual. For   example, we collect the search queries submitted by users of the Sites, Services   or Software but we do not know the names, email addresses or   identities of the users submitting those queries. <br>
<br>
We may also collect   certain information that is uniquely associated with you. For example, if you sign up to participate in a promotion or competition,   you might provide your name, e-mail address or telephone number to us in   connection with that promotion or competition. If you choose to provide such   personal information to us, it could allow you to be identified. However, we do not associate any such personal information with any   information relating to your search queries or use of the Sites or Services. <br>

<p><a name="3" id="3"></a> </p>
<h3>Exactly what information do we collect when you use the Sites, Services or   Software?</h3>
<br>
We receive any search query you submit through the Sites,   Services or Software.<br>
<br>
Whenever you visit the Sites, we also collect the   limited information that your browser makes available whenever you visit any   website. This information includes: (a) your Internet Protocol (IP) address; (b)   the address of the last URL you visited prior to clicking through to the Site;   (c) your browser and platform type (e.g., a Netscape browser on a Macintosh   platform); (d) your browser language; and (e) the data in any undeleted cookies   that your browser previously accepted from the Sites (see <a href="#8">"How do   we, or third parties acting on our behalf, use cookies on the Sites?"</a> and <a href="#9">"Do other third parties use cookies on the Sites?"</a> below). <br>
<br>
In addition, we collect information relating to your activities on and   as you leave the Sites (e.g. your click and search activity within the Sites,   whether you click on initial search results, the address of the first URL you   visit after you leave the Sites, etc).<br>

<br>
<p><a name="4" id="4"></a> </p>
<h3>Is there any other information we might collect in certain   circumstances?</h3>
<br>
Use of certain Services requires registration, which can   require you to provide certain personal information to us.<br>
<br>
Other   personal information you might choose to provide to us could include: your   contact information if you participate in a promotion or competition or   similar service or submit a help request or other customer services inquiry to   us via email or contact us about employment opportunities posted on the Sites.   The amount of information you disclose in these circumstances is completely up   to you, but access to or use of some Services may be affected if you do not   provide such information.

<br>
<p><a name="5" id="5"></a> </p>
<h3>Is there any information we don't collect?</h3>
<br>
The Sites, Services and   Software do not:<br>
<br>
- collect or report back to us any information about   other sites you visit on the Internet, except the address of the last URL you   visited prior to clicking through to the Sites and the first URL you visit after   you leave the Sites (see <a href="#3">"Exactly what information do we collect   when you use the Sites, Services or Software?"</a> above);<br>
<br>
- collect or   "screen-scrape" any search queries or information that you provide to any other   web sites; or<br>
<br>
- collect or report back to us any data unrelated to the   Sites, Services or Software.<br>
<br>
<a href="#top">Back to Top</a><br>
<br>
<p><a name="6" id="6"></a> </p>
<h3>How do we use the information we collect?</h3>
<br>
We use the information we   collect from or about you to provide the Services. This means that we process   each search query you submit, together with information such as your IP address,   to return a search results page to you. We may also share such information with   third party content and advertising providers so that certain content and   advertising can be included in the search results page we return to you (see <a href="#12">"What information do we disclose or make available to third   parties?"</a> below). A search results page may include targeted advertisements   in the form of sponsored links based on keywords contained within your search   query. <br>
<br>
We retain your Search Data for 18 months, or such   shorter period as we may specify elsewhere, for example in an End User Licence   Agreement. During this period we use your Search Data: (i) to improve the   quality of your experience of the Site and the quality of the Services we can   provide to you; (ii) for purposes of product monitoring, product development;   and (iii) to manage the use and placement of advertisements on the Sites. <br>
<br>
After expiry of the   relevant data retention period, we completely and irreversibly anonymise   your Search Data. We then continue to use your Search Data in   anonymised form: (i) to improve the quality of your experience of the Sites and   the quality of the Services we can provide to you; (ii) for purposes of product   monitoring, product development; and (iii) to manage the use and placement of   advertisements on the Sites. <br>
<br>
In addition, we aggregate query information   for purposes of internal reporting including counting the number of queries   submitted to the Sites, and we use information about our users' activities on the   Sites in aggregated form to analyse general traffic flows on the Sites (e.g. where   traffic comes from, how traffic flows within the Sites, whether users click on   initial search results, where users go when they leave the Sites, etc). <br>
<br>
We may also use:   your contact details to get in touch with you if you have chosen to   participate in a promotion or competition and we need to contact you in   connection with that promotion or competition or other similar service that you have signed   up to receive. Similarly, if you have submitted personal information to us in   connection with a customer services or other inquiry (including in relation to   an employment opportunity), we may need to use that information in order to   respond to you.<br>
<br>
Finally, we may if necessary use your information in   connection with any legal proceedings, violation or enforcement of our Terms of   Service (see <a href="#12">"What information do we disclose or make available to   third parties?"</a> below) or request by you pursuant to this Privacy Policy   (see <a href="#7">"Can you review, change or delete any information we hold   about you?"</a> below).<br>

<h3>Can you review, change or delete any information we hold about   you?</h3>
<br>
If you would like to review, change or delete any other   information we may hold about you, including any Search Data but excluding any information that has been anonymised (see <a href="#6">"How do we use the information we collect?"</a> above), please   contact IAC Search &amp; Media Europe Limited, whose contact details are <a href="http://sp.uk.qbyrd.com/en/docs/about/index.shtml">here</a>. Before we   can respond to any such request and accommodate your statutory rights with   respect to information relating to you, you will need to provide details and/or   documentation as we may reasonably require in order to satisfy ourselves as to   the identity of the person making the request and to locate the information   referred to in your request.<br>

<p><a name="8" id="8"></a> </p>
<h3>How do we, or third parties acting on our behalf, use cookies on the   Sites?</h3>
<p><br>
  A cookie is a text file that allows us to store user activity   information on a user's system and to retrieve information from that system. Our   web server automatically asks the browser of each new Site user whether it will   accept our cookie file. If the user's browser accepts our cookie, our web server   will record the cookie's unique ID, and every time the user returns to the Sites   we will be able to read that cookie's ID number.<br>
  <br>
  In this way, cookies   allow us to store information about your preferences, to recognise you when you   return to the Sites and to determine whether you reached the Sites by means of an   advertisement or search box on a third party site. This means we can customize   and improve the Services we provide to you based on your past preferences and   usage history. We can also display targeted advertisements to you in the form of   sponsored links based on the IP address information stored in your cookie (for   example, advertisements for local services in geographic locations based on your   IP address).<br>
  <br>
  In addition, we use, or appoint third parties to use,   cookies and other technologies such as pixel tags to track traffic flow and   patterns of travel on and within the Sites, as well as for internal reporting.   This allows us to monitor the popularity of certain features of our Site, the   performance of our advertisements on third party sites and the effectiveness of   the search terms used to trigger such advertisements.<br>
  <br>
Certain features of   the Sites depend on cookies.
  The   lifetime of our cookies or those used on our behalf is no more than two years.   After any such cookie has expired, all information stored by that cookie is   automatically deleted from our servers and those of anyone acting on our behalf. <br>
  <br>
  We do not use cookies to track your use of the Internet in any other way   and, except as otherwise described in this Privacy Policy (see <a href="#12">"What information do we disclose or make available to third   parties?"</a> below), we do not share the cookie information we collect with   third parties, unless required by court or government order, or as otherwise   required by law (see <a href="#law">"Law Enforcement/Legal Requirements"</a> below). <br>
  <br>
  For information on blocking or removing cookies, please see <a href="#10">"How can you block or remove cookies?"</a> below. <br>

</p>
<p><a name="9" id="9"></a> </p>
<h3>Do other third parties use cookies on the Sites?</h3>
<br>
Advertisements on   the Sites, including the sponsored links that may appear on search results pages,   can be served by third parties. The companies that serve these advertisements   may, in the course of doing so, place or recognise a unique cookie on your   computer or use other technologies such as pixel tags. This cookie or other   technology allows these companies to collect information about your use of the   Site and the Internet and to recognise you when you return to the Sites, so that   customised advertisements can be displayed to you on the Sites as well as on   other websites based on your past preferences and usage history. These companies   can also display advertisements to you based on IP address information stored in   the cookie they have placed (for example, advertisements for local services in   geographic locations based on your IP address).<br>
<br>
In addition, third   parties who survey consumer satisfaction with the Internet generally may place   cookies and/or pixel tags on the Sites for research purposes. <br>
<br>
Our Privacy   Policy does not cover any use of cookie data that such third parties (as   described in the two preceding paragraphs) may collect from you. These third   parties will treat your cookie data in accordance with their own policies as to   data collection, retention and usage, and we have no control over such policies. <br>
<br>
For information on blocking or   removing cookies, please see <a href="#10">"How can you block or remove   cookies?"</a> below.<br>
<br>
<a href="#top">Back to Top</a><br>
<br>
<p><a name="10" id="10"></a> </p>
<h3>How can you block or remove cookies?</h3>
<br>
If you would like to block or   remove cookies or pixel tags, you can do so using your browser. Please consult   your browser's "help" menu for details, but please note that if you choose to   block or remove cookies, you may not be able to use some of the features of the   Sites (see <a href="#8">"How do we, or third   parties acting on our behalf, use cookies on the Sites?"</a> above) and/or you   may find that the search results pages displayed to you on the Sites are less   relevant than they would have been otherwise (see <a href="#9">"Do other third   parties use cookies on the Sites?"</a> above). <br>
<br>
<a href="#top">Back to   Top</a><br>
<br>
<p><a name="11" id="11"></a> </p>
<h3>Do we use your information to deliver targeted online ads to you?</h3>
<br>
A   targeted online ad is one displayed to you based on the content of the web pages   you have visited (i.e., your browsing activity generally), information you have   provided or keywords you have used in search queries. As described above (see <a href="#5">"How do we use the information we collect?"</a>), we use your search   queries and the keywords they contain, together with your IP address and any   cookie ID associated with you, to provide you with a search results page that   may include targeted advertisements in the form of sponsored links. We do not   otherwise use your information to display targeted online advertising to you,   and we do not provide any of your information to any advertiser whose   advertisement you click on or view. However, you should be aware that any such   advertiser (or any company serving such advertisements) might be able to deduce   certain information about you based on the fact that you have viewed or clicked   on their advertisement (see <a href="#9">"Do other third parties use cookies on   the Sites?"</a> above). We have no control over the data collection, retention or   usage policies of such third party advertisers or ad serving   companies.<br>
<br>

<p><a name="12" id="12"></a> </p>
<h3>What information do we disclose or make available to third   parties?</h3>
<br>
Third Party Service   Providers.<br>
<br>
Some elements or parts of the Sites or Services, such as   news content, shopping services or the sponsored links on our search results   pages, may be supplied to us or hosted by third parties under contract. Other   elements, for instance relating to a promotion or competition, may be   administered by us with the assistance of a third party. In all such cases, we   may disclose or make available to the relevant third parties the following   information so that they can supply the relevant services: (a) your Internet   Protocol (IP) address; (b) the address of the last URL you visited prior to   clicking through to the Sites; (c) your browser and platform type (e.g., a   Netscape browser on a Macintosh platform); (d) your browser language; (e) the   data in any undeleted cookies that your browser previously accepted from us; (f)   the search queries you submit; and (g) information relating to your activities   on and as you leave the Sites (e.g. your click and search activity within the   Sites, whether you click on initial search results, the address of the first URL   you visit after you leave the Sites, etc). For example, when you submit a query   we transmit it (and some of the related information described above) to our   sponsored link provider so that relevant advertising can be displayed in   response to your query.<br>
<br>
We   may also merge information about you into group data, which may then be shared   on an aggregated basis with our advertisers and other third parties who provide   us with research and/or analysis services. If you provide us with answers to   voluntary survey questions, for example, we may present this information to our   advertisers and such other third parties in the form of grouped statistics   compiled from users' answers to such questions. <br>
<br>
In addition, we may   occasionally allow third party auditors and/or our professional advisors to   access your information as necessary to maintain the quality and security of the   Sites and/or Services and ensure its/their operation in compliance with   applicable law.<br>
<br>
Appropriate confidentiality and security obligations are imposed   on all third parties referred to above, including suppliers of services related   to the Sites, providers of research and/or analysis services and auditors and/or   professional advisors. <br>
<br>
By using the Sites, Services or Software, you give   your consent to us disclosing your information or making it available to third   parties as set forth above.<br>
<br>
<span id="law">Law   Enforcement/Legal Requirements.</span><br>
<br>
Subject to applicable law and   notwithstanding anything else in this Privacy Policy, we reserve the right: <br>
<br>
(a) to release information about any user of the Sites, Services or   Software who violates (or is reasonably suspected of violating) our Terms of   Service, or is involved in (or reasonably suspected of being involved in) any   illegal activity, and to release such information as required by court or   government order or as otherwise required by law;<br>
<br>
(b) to release   information about any user of the Sites, Services or Software when we believe in   good faith that such release is required to protect our rights, property,   business, safety or security, other users or the public, or to respond to an   emergency; and<br>
<br>
(c) to associate any personal information you might choose   to provide to us with any information relating to your search queries or use of   the Sites, Services or Software, if we are required by to do so by court or   government order, or as otherwise required by law.<br>
<br>
Corporate   Restructuring. <br>
<br>
We may transfer to a third party any information   we have collected from or about you if we are or any of our affiliates is   involved in a corporate restructuring or a sale, merger or other transfer of   assets. <br>
<br>
By using the Sites, Services or Software, you give your consent   to us transferring your information to a third party in such circumstances. <br>
<br>
<a href="#top">Back to Top</a><br>
<br>
<p><a name="13" id="13"></a> </p>
<h3>Do we transfer information to non-European jurisdictions?</h3>
<br>
We may   transfer your information to affiliated companies and to third party service   providers located in jurisdictions which do not necessarily have data protection   laws providing the same level of protection as the laws applicable within the   European Economic Area. For example, we may transfer information collected from   or about users of the Sites to our affiliated companies in the United States for   use by them as described above in <a href="#6">"How do we use the information we   collect?"</a>. <br>
<br>
We impose appropriate confidentiality and security   obligations on such companies and service providers, and by using the Sites,   Services or Software you give your consent to your information being transferred   to such affiliated companies and third party service providers.<br>

<br>
<p><a name="14" id="14"></a> </p>
<h3>What happens when you leave the Sites to go to other Internet   sites?</h3>
<br>
When you are on the Sites, you may be presented with links to   websites owned or operated by third parties unrelated to us. If you click on any   such link, for example by clicking on a sponsored link or other search result,   you may be taken to a website owned or operated by a third party advertiser or   another unrelated third party. Except to the limited extent described in this   Privacy Policy (see <a href="#12">"What information do we disclose or make   available to third parties?"</a> above), we do not control the data collection,   retention or usage policies of any unrelated third parties. Accordingly, you   should be aware that when you are on an Internet domain other than the Sites or   any Qbyrd.com and Search-results.com site, third parties may collect information from or about you and/or   send cookies to you and/or use your information in any number of ways. We are   not responsible for any collection, retention and/or use of any information   collected from or about you on any domains other than the Site and any Qbyrd.com   and Search-results.com sites. <br>

<br>
<p><a name="15" id="15"></a> </p>
<h3>What security measures do we take to protect your information?</h3>
<br>
We   have appropriate security measures in place to prevent unauthorised or unlawful   access to or processing of your information and to prevent any accidental loss   or destruction of, or damage to, such information. These measures include   limiting access to your information to those personnel who need access to your   information in connection with the performance of their job duties, and taking   reasonable steps to ensure the reliability of any individuals who are given   access to your information. Those individuals are legally bound to maintain the   security and confidentiality of such information and subject to disciplinary   action with sanctions up to and including dismissal for any breach of such   obligation. In addition, we have in place appropriate technical and physical   security measures as well as procedural safeguards. However, no security system   can be 100% effective, so please be aware that we cannot completely guarantee   the security of any information we may have collected from or about you. <br>
