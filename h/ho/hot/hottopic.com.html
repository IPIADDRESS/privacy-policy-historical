We may need or request certain types of personally identifiable information (i.e. information that can directly identify you or indicate where you might be contacted, such as name, address, age, date of birth, sex, grade level, e-mail address, telephone number, fax number, and credit card information) and collect it in connection with these various activities and offerings.  We do not consider indications of your interests, likes and dislikes, or general characteristics such as clothing size or hair color, to be personally identifiable information unless it is somehow grouped with other information so as to permit identification of you specifically; but from time to time we collect such information also, in order to provide you better service or to get to know our user base and its general traits.  <br>
                          <br>
Sometimes you can submit information about other people. For example, you might submit a person's name and e-mail address to send an electronic greeting card and, if you order a gift online and want it sent directly to a friend, you might submit the friend's name and address, should we be offering that service.  The types of personally identifiable information that may be collected about other people at these pages may include: recipient's name, address, age, date of birth, grade level, e-mail address, sex and telephone number.
					<br>
					<br>
The personal information you provide is considered a company asset and may be included among our transferred assets and the assets of any or all of our subsidiaries or affiliates if any of their assets is ever acquired by a third party.

As a registered user, you provide us with information that we maintain and reference as part of our attempts to provide better and more personalized service to you.  We might also use online registries or other databases to permit you to use and participate in certain portions in or features of our Site.  We also use information users provide to conduct sweepstakes and contests, notify you if you win, and fulfill prizes or awards.  In addition, unless you tell us not to, we like to provide you with certain information about our merchandise, sales or other offerings, and other marketing materials designed to help you use our Site and visit our stores with more information.  We also use such information to make our online marketing and other communications with you more efficient.  Similarly, we may use personally identifiable information in connection with certain of our activities with our partners, such as marketing efforts, co-sponsorships, and other initiatives.  We also collect this information as may be reasonably necessary for tracking/verifying compliance with federal, state and local laws or for editorial and feedback solicitation purposes. <br>
                            <br>
We may from time to time augment information you give us with information from other sources, such as information validating your address.

                            <br>
We sometimes share personal information given to us with third parties.  For instance, there may be third party service providers for our operations or business activities, with whom we have an agreement for services who transmit, store, analyze or otherwise use such information in connection with their services to us.  We also occasionally share information about our users with advertisers, business partners, sponsors and other third parties in aggregate, not as individuals. For example, we will say hottopic.com's visitors are x percent females, and x percent males. <br>
                            <br>
We may offer e-mail services, contests, sweepstakes, or promotions that are sponsored by or co-sponsored with non-affiliated companies. Based on our agreement with them, these third parties may obtain personally identifiable information that site visitors voluntarily submit to participate in the contest, sweepstakes, or promotion. We have no control over the use of this information by these companies.<br>
