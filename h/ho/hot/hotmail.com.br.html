</p><p><u>Privacy Principles </u>

</p><p>Because your privacy is important to us, Hotmail operates by the following principles: 

</p><p><b>Principle 1.</b>
<br>Hotmail collects information during the registration process to operate the site ("Registration Information").  Hotmail explicitly asks when it needs information that personally identifies you ("Personal Information").  The Personal Information Hotmail collects includes first and last name.  In addition to Personal Information collected, Hotmail also collects non-personally identifiable information (often referred to as demographic information) such as:  country, region or state, zip or postal code, time zone, gender, birthdate and occupation.  You may update your Registration Information at any time from within your Hotmail account by clicking the "Options" button on the navigation bar, and then clicking on the "Personal" icon. 

</p><p><b>Principle 2.</b>
<br>Your Registration Information is used only for demographic statistics and to display appropriate individualized advertisements. Hotmail keeps all of your Personal Information private and does not share it with any third parties, unless you choose, at the time of registration, to be listed in either the Hotmail Member Directory or the Internet White Pages directory. In the case of the Internet White Pages directory, we will share your registered name, location, and e-mail address with the Internet White Pages provider, InfoSpace, who may only use the Personal Information to provide their directory services.  For more information about how to change your directory preferences, see the FAQ below.  Hotmail will not disclose your Personal Information unless acting under a good faith belief that such action is necessary to: (1) conform to legal requirements or comply with legal process; (2) protect and defend the rights or property of Microsoft; (3) enforce the TERMS OF USE; or (4) act to protect the interests of its members or others. 

</p><p>Your non-personally identifiable information from your Hotmail registration (such as zip code and gender) may be shared with other Microsoft websites to provide a more personalized advertising experience online. For example, you may see ads from a Microsoft bCentral/LinkExchange Banner Network member as you surf the Web but none of your Personal Information is shared with the third party websites. 


</p><p><b>Principle 3.</b>
<br>Hotmail will not send you any unsolicited information, including e-mail, except as mentioned below. New users will receive a Hotmail welcome letter explaining the features provided by the service.  Hotmail may also send periodic member letters to announce important service changes, new features, technical issue updates and news about other Microsoft products and services. Hotmail may also contact you to conduct research about your opinion of current and prospective services via e-mail surveys.  Hotmail may from time to time contact you, on behalf of external business partners, about a particular offering that may be of interest to you. Hotmail will not share your e-mail address with these business partners. If you click on the link to the external partner's web site, be sure to review their privacy statement before sharing your personal information, as Microsoft is not responsible for their content.

</p><p><b>Principle 4.</b>
<br>If at any time you believe that Hotmail has not adhered to these principles, please notify us by e-mail at <a href="mailto:Hotmailprivacy@hotmail.com">Hotmailprivacy@hotmail.com</a> and we will use all commercially reasonable efforts to promptly determine and correct the problem. 

</p><p>If you have questions about this policy, please e-mail us at <a href="mailto:Hotmailprivacy@hotmail.com">Hotmailprivacy@hotmail.com</a>. 

</p><p>For more information about our privacy statement, see the following Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs). 

</p><p><b><u>Frequently Asked Questions</u></b> 

</p><p><u>Why is TRUSTe so important? </u>

</p><p>TRUSTe is an independent organization whose mission is to build users' trust and confidence on the Internet. Businesses that display the TRUSTe logo have agreed to privacy principles developed by TRUSTe and to periodic reviews to make sure that the businesses' privacy practices are in keeping with the policies. In the event TRUSTe learns of serious violations of a businesses' privacy practices, TRUSTe takes steps to insure compliance. Microsoft strongly believes in the TRUSTe mission and is a premier sponsor of the organization. 

</p><p><u>Does Microsoft belong to any other privacy organizations?</u>

</p><p>Microsoft has taken a leadership position on privacy, working closely with both policy and technology organizations to create standards and best practices for putting people in control of their personal information online. Amongst others, Microsoft is a member of TRUSTe, the Online Privacy Alliance and the P3P Working Group at the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). 

</p><p><u>What can I do to manage unsolicited e-mail in my Hotmail account?</u>

</p><p>Hotmail will not sell, lease or rent its member lists with any third parties. While Microsoft continues to actively review and implement new technology, such as newly expanded filtering features, there is no currently available technology that will totally prevent the sending and receiving of unsolicited e-mail. While using tools such as the inbox protector and being cautious about the sharing of your e-mail address while online, will help reduce the amount of unsolicited e-mail you receive. For information on how to best use Hotmail's tools, please contact <a href="mailto:abuse@hotmail.com">abuse@hotmail.com</a>.

</p><p><u>How can I change my preferences for the Hotmail Member Directory and Internet White Pages? </u>

</p><p>During the Hotmail registration process you are given the choice as to whether you want to be listed in the Hotmail Member Directory and the Internet White Pages. If you did not make a choice during the initial registration process, your registered name and location is listed in the Hotmail Member Directory and the Internet White Pages. At any time, you may remove your information from the Hotmail Directory by clicking on the "Options" button on the navigation bar, and then clicking on the "Personal" link. To remove your e-mail address from the Internet White Pages directory, go to <a href="http://www.msn.com/">www.msn.com</a>, click on "more…" and then "White Pages", click on "Email Search" where you may register or delete your e-mail address. 

</p><p><u>How can I unsubscribe from WebCourier or Special Offers subscriptions that I have signed up for?</u>

</p><p>There are 2 ways to unsubscribe to WebCourier and Special Offers subscriptions.  For WebCourier, simply click on "Free News" in the left hand navigation of the Inbox and uncheck the subscription or click on the "Unsubscribe" link within the WebCourier e-mail sent to you.  For Special Offers, simply click on "Special Offers" in the left hand navigation of the Inbox and uncheck the subscription or click on the "Unsubscribe" link within the Special Offers e-mail sent to you.

</p><p><u>What about Cookies?</u> 

</p><p>Cookies are pieces of information that a Web site transfers to your computer's hard disk for record-keeping purposes. Cookies can make the Web more useful by storing information about your preferences on a particular site. The use of cookies is an industry standard, and many major Web sites use them to provide useful features for their customers. Cookies in and of themselves do not personally identify users, although they do identify a user's computer. Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies. If you'd prefer, you can set yours to refuse cookies. However, you may not be able to take full advantage of a Web site if you do so. 

</p><p><u>What about the Privacy of children?</u> 
</p><p>When you sign-up for a Hotmail/Passport account, you will be requested to provide your accurate birthdate.  Safeguarding the personal information of children is extremely important.  To help further protect children's privacy online, children 12 years and under are required to obtain parental consent, through Kids Passport, before using Hotmail.  For additional information about Kids Passport, please <a href="http://kids.passport.com">click here</a>. 


</p><p><u>Does Hotmail collect other forms of information about its users?</u> 

</p><p>In addition to the use of Registration Information to operate the site, Hotmail also gathers demographic information, which may be used within Microsoft or shared with advertisers.  This is information which does not personally identify you, but which may be helpful for marketing purposes or for improving the services we offer. Generally, this information is collected through "traffic data" and may entail the use of "Cookies" "IP addresses" or other numeric codes used to identify a computer. 

</p><p><u>How do I correct or change Registration Information that I have given to Hotmail? </u>

</p><p>You may update this information at any time from within your Hotmail account by clicking the "Options" button on the navigation bar, and then clicking on the "Personal" icon. 

</p><p><u>Is my Registration Information secure from others using the Hotmail site?</u> 

</p><p>Registration Information collected by Hotmail is stored in secure operating environments that are not available to the public. 

</p><p><u>How else might someone learn of my Personal Information while visiting another site?</u> 

</p><p>In addition to directly providing information to Hotmail, you might also provide Personal Information through chat sessions, e-mail exchanges or bulletin board use made available to you on other sites, including other MSN sites. Chat sessions and bulletin board or newsgroup use is considered public and you are responsible for your actions in these areas. The Hotmail Privacy Statement does not cover this type of transfer of your Personal Information. You should always be careful when distributing your Personal Information in this manner.
