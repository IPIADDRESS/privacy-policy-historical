		<div class="hgt20"><!-- --></div>
		<div class="colorGrey">We understand that making purchases online involves a great deal of trust on your part; we take this trust very seriously.
		 This Privacy Statement describes the ways in which we will use the data you provide through this <a href='javascript:submitLink("/")'>hotels.com</a>.
		 website (“our website”), which is owned and operated by Hotels.com, L.P. ("we" or "us").
		 Please note that this Privacy Statement is an integral part of our website and the services offered to you and cannot, in any way, be 
		 separated from the Terms and Conditions of Use or from the membership, usage or transaction process. By providing information through this site, 
		 you indicate your acceptance of the practices described in this Privacy Statement.
		 <div class="hgt20"><!-- --></div>
		 <ul><ol>
		 <li>This Privacy Statement addresses:</li>
	     <li> What information we collect online from you.</li>
		 <li> How we use the information.</li>
		 <li> With whom we may share the information.</li>
		 <li> What choices are available regarding collection, use and distribution of the information.</li>
		 <li> What types of security procedures are in place to help protect the loss, misuse or alteration of the information under our control.</li>
		 <li> How users can correct any inaccuracies in their personally identifiable information.</li>
		 <li> How we notify you of material changes to this Privacy Statement.</li>
		 <li>When the Privacy Statement became effective.</li>
		 </ol></ul>
		 <div class="hgt20"><!-- --></div>
		 If users have questions or concerns regarding this statement, they should contact hotels.com customer service by email <a href='javascript:submitLink("/contactUs.do")'>here</a>.
		 <div class="hgt20"><!-- --></div>
		 <div class="font15bold">Information Collection and Use</div>
		 <div class="hgt5"><!-- --></div>
		 <div class="font11bold">Reservation Orders</div>
		 <div class="hgt5"><!-- --></div>
		 When you book a reservation through our website, we ask you to provide personally identifiable information by filling out and submitting
		  an online customer profile form (if you are not a hotels.com member already). This information includes: your name, home or work 
		  telephone number, fax number, email address, and your credit card number, expiration date, and billing address. We use this information 
		  to process and book your reservation and to notify you of your reservation status by email or fax. When you return to the site, 
		  we will ask for your email address and booking reference and may ask for other key pieces of personally identifiable information
		   to enable you to access your reservation information.
		   <div class="hgt5"><!-- --></div>
		   We also ask you for personally identifiable information about other people for whom you are booking reservations.
		    You should obtain permission from these individuals to provide us with their information. We use this information 
			to reserve the room with the hotel or other accommodation, and, if you so request, to send each person an email notification of the
			reservation 
		<div class="hgt20"><!-- --></div>
		<div class="font11bold">Member Registration</div>
		<div class="hgt5"><!-- --></div>
		Hotels.com may enable you to register with us to become a member. Where we do offer membership registration, we will make this clear.
		 When you choose to become a hotels.com member, we ask you to provide your name, address, telephone number, fax number, email address,
		  a unique login name, password, and password validation. This information is collected on the registration form for several reasons
		  including: (1) personal identification; (2) to complete hotel and car reservations and fulfil requests for other travel products and 
		  services; (3) to allow us to contact you for customer service, if necessary; (4) to customize the content of our website to meet your
		   specific needs; and (5) to conduct research and to make product improvements to the services we offer on our website. In addition,
		    your email address is collected to send you an email message confirming your new member registration and each reservation you transact
			 online. If you provide a fax number, you also may receive faxes confirming your new member registration and each reservation that you
			 transact online. To help us understand the effectiveness of our email communications, we may attach a Web beacon that provides 
			 confirmation when you open one of our e-mail messages. 
			 <div class="hgt5"><!-- --></div>
			 As a member, you also will occasionally receive updates from us about special offers, new hotels.com services,
			  and other noteworthy news items. You may decline to receive these email and fax messages. Please see the section entitled 
			  “Choice/Opt Out,” described below. 
			  <div class="hgt20"><!-- --></div>
			  <div class="font11bold">Member Profile</div>
			  <div class="hgt5"><!-- --></div>
			  In addition to the information noted above, members can choose to provide us with travel preferences, credit card billing information,
			   and other personally identifiable information. This information is primarily used to assist members in making reservations
			    quickly without having to type in the same information repeatedly. 
			<div class="hgt20"><!-- --></div>
			<div class="font11bold">Surveys &amp; Contests</div>
			<div class="hgt5"><!-- --></div>
			From time-to-time, we may request information from users through surveys or contests. Participation in these surveys or contests is
			 completely voluntary and you therefore have a choice as to whether or not to provide this information. The requested information 
			 typically includes contact information (such as name and mailing address), and demographic information (such as postcode). 
			 Contact information will be used to notify the winners and award prizes. Survey information will be used for purposes of monitoring 
			 or improving the use and satisfaction of our website. Although we may use a service provider to conduct these surveys or contests,
			  as we note in the section on “Information Sharing,” these service providers may not use your personally identifiable information 
			  for any secondary purpose. 
			  <div class="hgt20"><!-- --></div>
			  <div class="font11bold">Information From Other Sources</div>
			  <div class="hgt5"><!-- --></div>
			  We may receive information about you from third-party sources and add it to your account information. This information may 
			  include: updated delivery and address information from third parties, which we use to correct our records and facilitate proper 
			  delivery of our services and communications; information about travel purchases made on websites owned by our subsidiaries and sister 
			  companies (such as Expedia.com), which we use to better understand your travel needs; and credit history information from credit bureaus, 
			  which we use to help prevent and detect fraud.
			  <div class="hgt20"><!-- --></div>
			  <div class="font11bold">Cookies</div>
			  <div class="hgt5"><!-- --></div>
			  Cookies are small pieces of information stored on your computer tied to information about you.
			   We use both session ID (or temporary) cookies, which terminate when you close your browser,
			    and persistent cookies, which are stored on your hard drive. 
			<div class="hgt5"><!-- --></div>
			We use cookies for several reasons. For example, cookies allow you to login without having to type your login name each time, 
			allowing you to simply provide your password to access the system. Cookies also enable us to track and target the interests of our
			 users to enhance the experience on our website. Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but if you prefer, you can edit your 
			 browser options to block them in the future. If you choose to reject cookies, you may still use our website; however, your access 
			 to some areas of our website will be limited. 
			 <div class="hgt5"><!-- --></div>
			 A cookie file also may be placed on your hard drive by our third-party advertising companies. These companies may use
			  aggregated statistics about your visits to this and other websites in order to provide advertisements about travel-related
			  goods and services that you may be interested in. Hotels.com does not have access to or control over these cookies that may be 
			  placed by third-party advertisers. Those advertising networks that use persistent cookies may offer you a way to opt out of
			   advertisement targeting. If you would like to find out more information, <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/">click here.</a>
			   <div class="hgt5"><!-- --></div>
			   The third-party advertising companies may also employ technology that is used to measure the effectiveness of advertisements.
			    This is primarily accomplished through the use of a Web beacon (a single-pixel GIF), which is placed on our website to collect
				 anonymous information. They may use this anonymous information about your visits to this and other sites in order to provide 
				 advertisements about goods and services of potential interest to you. The information collected through this process is anonymous 
				 and does not link online actions to an identifiable person. If you would like more information and want to explore the option of
				  not having this information collected by third-party advertisers, <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/">click here.</a>
				  <div class="hgt20"><!-- --></div>
				  <div class="font11bold">Tags</div>
				  <div class="hgt5"><!-- --></div>
				  In conjunction with our own and our affiliates’ marketing campaigns, we may also use technology to capture certain
				   information relating to reservations you make through our website.&nbsp; We will usually collect this information by 
				   placing a Web beacon (a single-pixel GIF) within our reservation pages.&nbsp; The information we collect is anonymous
				    and will include the total amount of the transaction and the system-generated booking reference.&nbsp; We will use this
					 information to monitor the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns and may pass this on to our affiliates for similar
					  purposes.&nbsp; &nbsp;We may employ a third party service provider to collate and report on the information collected.
					  <div class="hgt20"><!-- --></div>
					 <div class="font11bold">Log Files</div>
					 <div class="hgt5"><!-- --></div>
					 Like most standard website servers we use log files that collect Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, Internet
					  Service Provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, and number of clicks. We use this information 
					  to analyse trends, administer the site, track user's movement in the aggregate, diagnose problems with our servers, and to 
					  gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. This information is not linked to personally identifiable information.
					   We also use a tracking utility called ATG Dynamo that uses log files to analyse user movement.
					   <div class="hgt20"><!-- --></div>
					   <div class="font15bold">Communications from the Site</div>
					   <div class="hgt5"><!-- --></div>
					   <div class="font11bold">Special Offers and Updates</div>
					   <div class="hgt5"><!-- --></div>
					   As noted above, established hotels.com members may occasionally receive information on products, services, and special
					    deals about which they may be interested. Out of respect for the privacy of our users, we present members with the
						 option not to receive these types of communications. Please see the “Choice/Opt-out” section below. 
						<div class="hgt20"><!-- --></div>
						<div class="font11bold">Trip Information and Customer Feedback</div>
						<div class="hgt5"><!-- --></div>
						If you book a trip through the our website, in addition to notifying you of your reservation status
						 (see “Reservation Orders” above), we will send you an email prior to your date of travel, containing up-to-date
						  information relevant to your trip and travel destination which you may find useful; we will on occasion include 
						  information about other products and services which may be of interest to you in connection with your forthcoming trip.
						   We will give you the choice to opt-out of receiving these emails for future reservations. In the interests of maintaining a
						    high standard of service for our customers, we may also send you an email once you have completed your travel, so that you can 
							provide us with valuable feedback on your travel experience, although again, we will offer you the choice of not receiving this.
					<div class="hgt20"><!-- --></div>
					<div class="font11bold">Newsletter</div>
					<div class="hgt5"><!-- --></div>
					If a user wishes to subscribe to our newsletter, we ask them to provide contact information, such as name and email address. 
					Out of respect for our users’ privacy we provide a way to opt-out of these communications. Please see the “Choice/Opt-out” 
					section below. 
					<div class="hgt20"><!-- --></div>
					<div class="font11bold">Service Announcements</div>
					<div class="hgt5"><!-- --></div>
					On rare occasions it is necessary to send out service-related announcements. For instance, if our service is temporarily 
					suspended for maintenance, we might send users an email. Generally, users may not opt-out of these non-promotional communications,
					 although they can deactivate their membership.
					 <div class="hgt20"><!-- --></div>
					<div class="font11bold">Customer Service</div>
					We communicate with users on a regular basis to provide requested services. This may include responding through email, 
					fax or phone, in accordance with the users' wishes.
					<div class="hgt20"><!-- --></div>
					<div class="font11bold">Choice/Opt-out</div>

					   arise in the normal course of business.
					   <div class="hgt20"><!-- --></div>

					   <div class="hgt5"><!-- --></div>

					   <div class="hgt5"><!-- --></div>

					 We also may contract with reputable third parties to facilitate the distribution of survey, promotion, or sweepstakes programs. 
					 Upon completion of these projects, all information is returned to us. 
					 <div class="hgt5"><!-- --></div>
					 This site uses technology, provided by Fireclick ®, that makes use of a small and transparent Java applet to provide you with a faster browsing

					<div class="hgt5"><!-- --></div>
					<div class="font11bold">Affiliated/Referring Websites</div>
					<div class="hgt5"><!-- --></div>
					If you were referred to our website from another website, we may share personally identifiable information about 
					you with the referring website to better understand the use of our website. Although we believe that the website 
					companies from which you were referred to us are reputable companies, we have not placed limitations on the referring
					 websites companies from using or disclosing your information without your permission. Therefore, we encourage you to
