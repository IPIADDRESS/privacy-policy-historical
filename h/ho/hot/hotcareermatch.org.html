          <p>Last updated    February 12, 2010. </p>
          <p> BY VISITING THIS WEBSITE AND REQUESTING INFORMATION, PRODUCTS OR  SERVICES THERON, YOU AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF  THIS PRIVACY POLICY. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH THE TERMS OF THIS PRIVACY  POLICY, PLEASE DO NOT PROVIDE ANY INFORMATION OR USE ANY OF THE  SERVICES OR PRODUCTS OFFERED OR PROVIDED ON ANY OF THE WEBSITES  REFERRED TO IN THIS PRIVACY POLICY.</p>
        <p> This policy describes the information  collection, use, and dissemination practices of <b><i>Hotcareermatch.org</i></b>,  ("<b><i>Hotcareermatch.org</i></b>") and applies to <b><i>Hotcareermatch.org</i></b>'s  collection, use, storage and disclosure of information by  <b><i>Hotcareermatch.org</i></b> on its (a) websites, including all its divisions,  subsidiaries and related companies (collectively, the "Websites"), and  (b) on various Third Party websites. <b><i>Hotcareermatch.org</i></b> is not  responsible for the information collection or privacy practices of  Third Party websites or applications.</p>
        <h4> 1. Collection of Information</h4>
        <p> 1.1 Survey Information. <b><i>Hotcareermatch.org</i></b> collects information from  individuals by various methods, including, but not limited to, when an  individual voluntarily completes the survey or registration page either  online or offline. (As used herein, "online" means using the Internet,  including the Websites, and related technologies, and "offline" means  by methods other than online, including in person, in the postal mail,  using telephones and cell phones, and other similar means.) In the  Surveys, <b><i>Hotcareermatch.org</i></b> may ask an individual to provide various  information, which may include his or her name, email address, street  address, zip code, telephone numbers (including cell phone numbers and  carriers), birth date, gender, salary range, education and marital  status, occupation, social security number, employment information,  personal and online interests, and such other information as may be  requested from time to time (together, "Survey Information").  Completing the Surveys is completely voluntary, and individuals are  under no obligation to provide Survey Information to  <b><i>Hotcareermatch.org</i></b> . </p>
        <p> 1.2 Site Membership or  Registration. To the extent registration is required to receive email  and possibly postal communications from <b><i>Hotcareermatch.org</i></b>, this  Privacy Policy also applies to consumers that have agreed to receive  e-mail marketing from <b><i>Hotcareermatch.org</i></b>, whether at our Website or  otherwise. We collect information in certain portions of our Website,  which may include your name, email address, street address, zip code,  telephone numbers (including cell phone numbers and carriers), birth  date, gender, education, occupation, employment information, and such  other information as may be requested from time to time or where guests  provide content submissions and suggestions or participate in  interactive online activities (i.e., by way of responding to questions  and surveys, community listings, ratings, searches and comparison  searches, bidding, purchasing, chat, games, or bulletin boards, etc.).  The personal profile information you submit to <b><i>Hotcareermatch.org</i></b>  remains your property, but by submitting that information to  <b><i>Hotcareermatch.org</i></b>, you grant <b><i>Hotcareermatch.org</i></b>, the right to  use that information for marketing purposes. <b><i>Hotcareermatch.org</i></b>, may  also use such information for content improvement and feedback  purposes. <b><i>Hotcareermatch.org</i></b> reserves the right to release current  or past member information in the event <b><i>Hotcareermatch.org</i></b> believes  that the membership is being or has been used in violation of its AUP  the Rules or to commit unlawful acts, if the information is subpoenaed,  if <b><i>Hotcareermatch.org</i></b> is sold or acquired, or when  <b><i>Hotcareermatch.org</i></b> deems it necessary or appropriate. By agreeing to  these terms, you hereby consent to disclosure of any record or  communication to any Third Party when <b><i>Hotcareermatch.org</i></b>, in its  sole discretion, determines the disclosure to be appropriate. </p>
        <p> "Subscription" occurs when an end-user registers for  <b><i>Hotcareermatch.org</i></b>'s services, via registration at our website.  <b><i>Hotcareermatch.org</i></b> collects personally identifiable information  about our subscribers, based on: information gathered at the time of  registration, subscriber interaction and response to subsequent  electronic mailings and website use. Information collected may include,  but is not necessarily limited to: name, email address, postal address,  birth date, telephone number, interests, user behavior and other  demographic information. This information enables us to better tailor  our content to subscribers' needs and to help our clients to promote  and sell their products and services. </p>
        <p> 1.3 Requests  for Assistance or Service. Other occasions when <b><i>Hotcareermatch.org</i></b>  obtains information from individuals include (1) when an individual  requests assistance through <b><i>Hotcareermatch.org</i></b>'s customer service  department, and (2) when an individual voluntarily subscribes to a  <b><i>Hotcareermatch.org</i></b>'s service or newsletter (together, "Other  Information").</p>
        <p> 1.4 Cookies, Web Beacons, and Other  Info Collected Using Technology. <b><i>Hotcareermatch.org</i></b> currently uses  cookie and web beacon technology to associate certain Internet-related  information about an individual with information about the individual  in our database. Additionally, <b><i>Hotcareermatch.org</i></b> may use other new  and evolving sources of information in the future (together,  "Technology Information").</p>
        <p> (a) Cookies. A cookie is a  small amount of data stored on the hard drive of the individual's  computer that allows <b><i>Hotcareermatch.org</i></b> to identify the individual  with his or her corresponding data that resides in  <b><i>Hotcareermatch.org</i></b>'s database. Individuals who use the Websites need  to accept cookies in order to use all of the features and functionality  of the Websites. </p>
        <p> (b) Web Beacons. A web beacon is  programming code that can be used to display an image on a web page (by  using an &lt;img src="x"&gt; programming function -- see <a href="http://truste.org" target="blank">http://truste.org</a> for more information), but can also be used to transfer an individual's  unique user identification (often in the form of a cookie) to a  database and associate the individual with previously acquired  information about an individual in a database. This allows  <b><i>Hotcareermatch.org</i></b> to track certain websites an individual visits  online. Web beacons are used to determine products or services an  individual may be interested in, and to track online behavioral habits  for marketing purposes. For example, <b><i>Hotcareermatch.org</i></b> might place,  with the consent of a Third Party website, a web beacon on the Third  Party's website where cosmetics are sold. When Jane, an individual  listed in <b><i>Hotcareermatch.org</i></b>'s database, visits the cosmetic  website, <b><i>Hotcareermatch.org</i></b> receives notice by means of the web  beacon that Jane visited the cosmetics site, and <b><i>Hotcareermatch.org</i></b>  would then update Jane's profile with the information that Jane is  interested in cosmetics. <b><i>Hotcareermatch.org</i></b> may thereafter present  offers of cosmetic related products and services to Jane. In addition  to using web beacons on web pages, <b><i>Hotcareermatch.org</i></b> also uses web  beacons in email messages sent to individuals listed in  <b><i>Hotcareermatch.org</i></b>'s database. </p>
        <p> (c) New  TechnologyThe use of technology on the Internet, including cookies and  web beacons, is rapidly evolving, as is <b><i>Hotcareermatch.org</i></b>'s use of  new and evolving technology. As a result, <b><i>Hotcareermatch.org</i></b>  strongly encourages individuals to revisit this policy for any updates  regarding its use of technology. </p>
        <p> (d) Usage Tracking  and Log Files. <b><i>Hotcareermatch.org</i></b> tracks information related to the  electronic mailings and web pages viewed by users and subscribers, as  well as the hyperlinks clicked by subscribers, while viewing our emails  or visiting our websites. Log files are used to track and monitor  subscriber usage. </p>
        <p> (e) Optional Registration.  <b><i>Hotcareermatch.org</i></b> may offer free voluntary registration to  potential subscribers. During such registration, the subscriber is  required to supply an email address and other personal information.  This information is required if the subscriber wants to participate in  <b><i>Hotcareermatch.org</i></b> services. </p>
        <p> (f) Feedback and  Inquiries. You have the ability to contact <b><i>Hotcareermatch.org</i></b> to  provide us with their feedback. <b><i>Hotcareermatch.org</i></b> uses this  information to respond to you and analyze customer service issues. </p>
        <p> (g) IP Address. We collect your IP (Internet Protocol) address to help  diagnose problems with our server, and to administer this Site. An IP  address is a number that is assigned to your computer when you use the  Internet. Your IP address is also used to help identify you during a  particular session and to gather broad demographic data. </p>
        <p> (h) Clear GIFs. We use a common technology known as a "Clear GIF" or  "1-by-1 Pixel" on the Site and in e-mail communications with users. A  Clear GIF or "graphic interface format" is a small graphic (in fact,  truly a 1x1 pixel) that we (or our partners) place on a page of the  Site. We may also occasionally place GIFs in e-mail messages that we  send to users. GIFs, which do not contain any PII, provide us with  important information about how users use the Site and respond to  e-mail messages. With this information, we are better able to track the  performance of certain promotions and understand the effectiveness of  particular creative e-mail presentations. We may also allow our  advertisers and promotional partners the ability to use GIFs on the  Site solely to track users who link from their respective sites to this  Site, but this ability to track such activity does not allow these  entities access to user PII. </p>
        <p> 1.5 Outside  Information. <b><i>Hotcareermatch.org</i></b> may receive information about  individuals from Third Parties or from other sources of information  outside of <b><i>Hotcareermatch.org</i></b> including information located in  public databases ("Outside Information"). </p>
        <p> 1.6 No  Information Collected from Children. <b><i>Hotcareermatch.org</i></b> will never  knowingly collect any personal information about children under the age  of 13. If <b><i>Hotcareermatch.org</i></b> obtains actual knowledge that it has  collected personal information about a child under the age of 13, that  information will be immediately deleted from our database. Because it  does not collect such information, <b><i>Hotcareermatch.org</i></b> has no such  information to use or to disclose to Third Parties.  <b><i>Hotcareermatch.org</i></b> is designed this policy in order to comply with  the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act ("COPPA"). </p>
        <p> 1.7 Links to External Websites. <b><i>Hotcareermatch.org</i></b>'s emails and  websites contain links to external websites. You will be taken to  external websites if you click on these links. Your information may be  passed from <b><i>Hotcareermatch.org</i></b>'s database to the external website,  and/or external database, for your convenience (e.g. your information  may be used to pre-fill a form at a destination website).  <b><i>Hotcareermatch.org</i></b> is not responsible for the privacy practices or  content of any external website owner. We encourage you to review the  privacy policy of any website they visit. </p>
