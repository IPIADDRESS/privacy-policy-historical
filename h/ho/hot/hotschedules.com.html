        our use of it. The steps we take to protect your personal information and how you can review and correct 
        your personal information are also covered here. By accessing our websites, you are consenting to the 
        information collection and use practices described in this privacy statement. </p>
      <p><b>Our collection of information</b> Information collected directly from you Generally, you can visit HotSchedules' websites without entering 
        any personal information.  On certain pages, we may ask you for personal information to provide a service 
        or carry out a transaction that you have requested. The personal information we collect may include: 
        contact details, such as your name, title, company/organization name, e-mail address, telephone and fax 
        numbers, and physical address; information about your company, and job function; your e-mail marketing 
        preferences; financial information (including credit card or account information); information such as 
        your nationality and country of residence that allows us to determine your eligibility under export control 
        regulations to receive information about certain technologies; information used to customize and facilitate 
        your use of our websites, including login and technical information; inquiries about and orders for our 
        products and services; information that assists us in identifying the products and services that best meet 
        your requirements; event registration information; and feedback from you about our websites and our products 
        and services generally. </p>
      <p>You are not required to provide any of this information, but if you do not,
        we may not be able to provide you the requested service or complete your transaction.</p>
      <p><i>Information collected automatically:</i> We collect information about your visit to our sites, 
        including what pages you view, the number of bytes transferred, the links you click, the materials you 
        access, and other actions taken within HotSchedules' sites. On sites that you enter with a user ID, we 
        may connect this information with your identity to determine your potential interests in our products 
        and services. We also collect certain standard information that your browser sends to every website you 
        visit, such as your Internet Protocol (IP) address, your browser type and capabilities and language, your 
        operating system, the date and time you access the site, and the website from which you linked to our site. 
        We do not link this information to your identity.</p>
      <p><b>Our use of information</b></p>
      <p><i>Services and transactions.</i> We use your personal information to deliver services or carry out transactions 
        you have requested, such as providing information on HotSchedules products, registering purchased products, 
        processing product orders, handling service issues, replacing product manuals, answering customer service 
        requests, facilitating use of our websites, and so forth. In order to offer you a more consistent experience 
        in your interactions with HotSchedules, information collected by our websites may be combined with information 
        we collect by other means.</p>
      <p><i>Website improvement.</i> We may use your personal information to improve our websites and related HotSchedules 
        products or services, or to make our websites easier to use by eliminating the need for you to repeatedly enter 
        the same information or by customizing our websites to your particular preference or interests.</p>
      <p><i>Communications.</i> With your permission, we may use your personal information gathered via our websites to inform 
        you of products or services available from HotSchedules. When collecting information that might be used to contact 
        you about our products and services, we will always give you the opportunity to opt-out of receiving such 
        communications. Moreover, each e-mail communication we send includes an unsubscribe link allowing you to stop 
        delivery of that type of communication. If you elect to unsubscribe, we will remove you from the relevant list 
        within 10 business days.</p>
      <p><i>Employment Applications.</i> In connection with a job application or inquiry, you may provide us with information about 
        yourself, such as a resume or curriculum vitae. We may use this information throughout HotSchedules and its controlled 
        subsidiaries and affiliates for the purpose of employment consideration. We will keep the information for future 
        consideration unless you direct us not to do so.</p>
      <p><b>Our use of cookies and web beacons</b> Cookies are small files that websites save to your hard disk or to your browser's memory. We may use them to track the number 
        of times you have visited the site, to track the number of visitors to the site, to determine and analyze visitors' use of 
        our sites (including the effectiveness of online advertising), to store information that you provide such as your preferences, 
        and to store technical information useful for your interactions with our websites. We may use session cookies (cookies that 
        are deleted when your browser session ends) to store your user ID, elements of your user profile, to facilitate your movement 
        around our websites (particularly in connection with information searches and order placement) and other information useful in 
        administering the session. You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most Internet browsers automatically accept 
        cookies, but you can usually modify your browser settings to decline cookies or to notify you when a cookie is being placed on 
        your computer. If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to fully experience the features of HotSchedules' 
        websites or other websites that you visit. Our sites also may contain electronic images known as web beacons - sometimes 
        called single-pixel gifs - that allow us to count the number of users who have visited those pages. We may include web beacons 
        in promotional e-mail messages or Newsletters in order to determine whether messages have been opened and acted upon.</p>
      <p><b>Disclosure of your personal information</b> Except as described below, personal information you provide to HotSchedules through our websites will not be shared outside of 
        HotSchedules and its controlled subsidiaries and affiliates without your permission.</p>
      <p><i>Disclosure to service providers.</i> HotSchedules contracts with other companies to provide services on our behalf, such 
        as hosting websites, sending out information, processing transactions, and analyzing our websites. We provide these companies 
        with only those elements of your personal information they need to deliver those services. These companies and their employees 
        are prohibited from using that personal information for any other purpose.</p>
      <p><i>Disclosure to distributors.</i> In responding to a request made by you, we may share your personal information with 
        companies that distribute our products. In those cases, we provide these companies with only those elements of your personal 
        information they need to respond to your request, and these companies and their employees are prohibited from using that 
        personal information for any other purpose. In some cases, we may seek your permission to share your information with 
        distributors for marketing purposes other than responding to a request from you. However, we will not share your information 
        for such marketing purposes unless we have obtained your express consent to do so.</p>
      <p><i>Disclosure in connection with transactions.</i> In connection with certain transactions, we may disclose some or all 
        of your personal information to financial institutions, government entities, and shipping companies or postal services 
        involved in fulfillment.</p>
      <p><i>Disclosures in connection with acquisitions or divestitures.</i> Circumstances may arise where for strategic or other 
        business reasons HotSchedules decides to sell, buy, merge or otherwise reorganize. Such a transaction may involve the 
        disclosure of personal information to prospective or actual purchasers, or receiving it from sellers. It is HotSchedules' 
        practice to seek appropriate protection for information in these types of transactions.</p>
      <p><i>Disclosure for other reasons.</i> We may disclose personal information if required to do so by law or in the good-faith 
        belief that such action is necessary to comply with legal requirements or with legal process served on us, to protect and 
        defend our rights or property, or in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of any individual.</p>
      <p><b>Security</b> HotSchedules is committed to protecting the security of your personal information. We use a variety of security technologies 
        and procedures to help protect your personal information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. For example, we store 
        the personal information you provide on computer systems with limited access that are located in facilities to which access 
        is limited. For sites to which you login, it is your responsibility to ensure the security of your password and not to reveal 
        this information to others. </p>
      <p><b>Reviewing your personal information</b> In some cases, you can review and correct personal information provided through our websites by going to the page on which 
        you provided the information. In all cases, you can make a request to review and correct your personal information collected 
        via our websites or ask HotSchedules to stop using it by sending an email to support@hotschedules.com . We may take steps to 
        verify your identity before providing you access to your personal information. You can help us to maintain the accuracy of 
        your information by notifying us of any change to your mailing address, phone number, or e-mail address.</p>
      <p><b>Children's information</b> HotSchedules does not knowingly collect information from children and does not target its websites that collect information 
        to children.</p>
      <p><b>Links to other sites</b> Our websites may contain links to other sites such as HotSchedules distributors and sales affiliates, professional and 
        government organizations, and publications. We also link to third-party providers that host, maintain and operate on-line 
        training curricula. While we try to link only to sites that share our high standards and respect for privacy, we are not 
        responsible for the content, security, or privacy practices employed by other sites.</p>
      <p><b>Enforcement of this privacy statement</b> If you have questions regarding this statement or our handling of your personal information, please contact us. We will 
        promptly address your concern and strive to reach a satisfactory resolution. </p>
      <p><b>Changes to this privacy statement</b> HotSchedules may occasionally update this privacy statement. When we do, we will revise the "last updated" date at the top 
        and bottom of the privacy statement. We will obtain your opt-in consent for any updates to this privacy statement that 
        materially expand the sharing or use of your personal information in ways not disclosed in this privacy statement at the 
        time of collection.</p>
