Except as described below, personal information you provide to HotSchedules through our Site or Services will not be shared outside of HotSchedules and its controlled subsidiaries and affiliates without your permission.</p>

These companies and their employees are prohibited from using that personal information for any other purpose.</p>

	<p><em>Disclosure to distributors.</em> In responding to a request made by you, we may share your personal information with companies that distribute our products. In those cases, we provide these companies with only those elements of your personal information they need to respond to your request, and these companies and their employees are prohibited from using that personal information for any other purpose.

Our Services are not intended for anyone under the age of 13. If you are under 13, do not use or provide any information on or through our Services.

If you are a parent or guardian or otherwise believe we might have any information from or about a child under 13, please contact us so that we can delete the child’s information. The Site and Services will never knowingly accept, collect, maintain or use any information from a child under the age of 13. If a child whom we know to be under the age of 13 sends personal information to us online, we will only use that information to respond directly to that child or notify parents.</p>

	<p><strong>Third party sites</strong><br>

Our Site or Services may contain links to other sites such as HotSchedules distributors and sales affiliates, professional and government organizations, and publications. We also link to third-party providers that host, maintain and operate on-line training curricula. While we try to link only to sites that share our high standards and respect for privacy, we are not responsible for the content, security, or privacy practices employed by other sites.</p>

	<p>The Site and Services may incorporate the Google Maps API. Accordingly, if applicable, by accessing or using our Site or Services, you hereby agree to be bound by Google’s Privacy Policy (available at http://www.google.com/privacy.html).</p>

	<p><strong>Your California Privacy Rights</strong><br>
