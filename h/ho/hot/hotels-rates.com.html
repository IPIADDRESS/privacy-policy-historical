      <br>
      We are committed to protecting your personal privacy and the information 
      you entrust with us. <br><br>
      We will not ask you for information that does not have a purpose and we 
      will not require information to be disclosed that is not absolutely necessary. 
      <br><br>
      Any information obtained by byRate will not be shared with any third 
      parties with the exception of the booking engine used to make your reservations. 
      All of our data is kept private within the company. We will not disclose 
      personal information except to appropriate authorities as required by law.<br><br>
                    <p><span class="black8under">Here is more specific information 
                      that we have to collect and the reasons why we do it:</span><br>
              <br>
              We need to have your name, email address, physical address, phone 
              number and credit card number to ensure that we are able to make 
              and confirm your reservation. We do not share this personal information 
              with outside parties except to the extent necessary to complete 
              your reservation. At most hotels, it will then be held until you 
              can pay in person. <br>
              <br>
              This type of contact information is necessary in order to notify 
              you in the event of difficulties or unforeseen obstacles fulfilling 
              your reservation. In some cases, paper tickets may need to be mailed 
              to you. Therefore, the easier we can make contact with you, more 
              in tune we can be in serving you.<br>
              <br>
              We will use the information you provide about yourself in order 
              to make the Hotels-Rates.com website as user friendly as possible. 
              We want to know you to better serve you. From time to time we may 
              ask you for more information about your travel interests. Or offer 
              you an opportunity to voice your opinion by taking a surveys. In 
              the future this information may be used to help us make more applicable 
              travel recommendations including destinations. However, this information

              the users experience.<br>

              visit in collective or aggregated data that does not identify you
