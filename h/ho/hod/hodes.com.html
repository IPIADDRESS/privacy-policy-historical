This Privacy Policy also covers how personal and other inf<strong>o</strong>rmation that we receive or collect about you is treated. It also describes the choices available to you regarding our use of your personal information and how you can access and update this information. Please read the information below to learn more regarding your privacy and your use of the Symphony Talent Sites and Services.</p>
<p>You acknowledge that this Privacy Policy is designed to be read in connection with the Sites’ Terms of Use, which are available at&nbsp;<a href="http://www.symphonytalent.com/terms-of-use/">http://www.symphonytalent.com/terms-of-use/</a>&nbsp;and that by accessing or using our Sites, whether as a Job Seeker or Recruiter, you explicitly accept the collection, use and transfer of your information as described in this Privacy Policy, and you agree to be bound by the Sites’ Terms of Use.</p>
<p>If you do not want your information to be collected, used, and transferred as described by this Privacy Policy, you may revoke your consent to our Privacy Policy by emailing us at&nbsp;<a href="mailto:privacy@symphonytalent.com">privacy@symphonytalent.com</a>&nbsp;or by exiting the Site and not accessing the Services.</p>
<p>We reserve the right to change this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you about significant changes in the way we treat your personal information by either placing a prominent notice on our Sites, and/or sending a notice to the primary email address you provided to us prior to the change becoming effective. We will also update our privacy information on this page. It is your responsibility to review any updates to our Privacy Policy.

You should note as you read this Privacy Policy, that it is a single Privacy Policy for all different types of users and the Services we offer. As such, some of the information discussed herein may not appear to be relevant to the specific Services you wish to use. As an example, if you are a job seeker who is registering for job alert emails, the sections in this Privacy Policy relating to information such as a “Social Security Number” are not relevant to you. We only collect, store and use information that is needed to provide the Services you choose to use.</p>
<p>If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please feel free to contact us by emailing us at&nbsp;<a href="mailto:privacy@symphonytalent.com">privacy@symphonytalent.com</a></p>
<p>IMPORTANT: BY USING SYMPHONY TALENT SITES AND/OR SERVICES AVAILABLE ON THE SITES, YOU GIVE YOUR CONSENT THAT ALL PERSONAL INFORMATION THAT YOU SUBMIT MAY BE PROCESSED BY US IN THE MANNER AND FOR THE PURPOSES DESCRIBED BELOW. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS, DO NOT USE THE SITES OR ACCESS THE SERVICES.</p>
<p><strong>Scope of this Privacy Policy</strong></p>
<p>This Policy applies to information we collect on sites owned or controlled by Symphony Talent or its affiliated companies (hereinafter “Symphony Talent”). Affiliated companies are entities that control, are controlled by or are under common control with Symphony Talent.</p>
<p>If you are using our Sites to look or offer yourself for work, apply for a job, sign up for alerts or other services, participate in a job survey, take a skills assessment, complete a background check, or perform other career-related activities (a “Job Seeker”), we share your information with potential employers, headhunters, recruiters, hiring managers and other human resource professionals (collectively “Recruiter” or “Recruiters”). We are unable to control their use of your data. We also do not control the data practices of those who access your information on or through our Sites, or other third parties with whom we work with to provide Services that you may choose to use. &nbsp;You may wish to review the privacy policies of those sites so you can understand how they collect, use and share your information.</p>
<p>If you are using our Sites as a Recruiter, we do not control the data practices of third parties with whom we work with to provide Services that you may choose to use, nor parties that you may request we work with to integrate other services and systems you may use.</p>
<p>Some of our pages utilize framing techniques to serve content to/from our partners while preserving the look and feel of our Site. Please be aware that you are providing your personal information to these third parties and not to Symphony Talent Sites. Information collected on our Sites is stored in the United States; therefore, your information is subject to U.S. law.</p>
<p><strong>Information We Collect</strong></p>
<p>We collect three types of information when you use our Sites: Personal Information (“PI”), Company Information, and Passively-collected Information.&nbsp; You acknowledge that any and all materials you upload to the Symphony Talent Sites (“Submissions”), are subject to this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p><em><strong>Personal Information:&nbsp;</strong></em>This refers to information that lets us know the specifics of who you are. When you engage in certain activities on this Site, such as registering, purchasing a product or service, or sending us feedback, we may ask you to provide certain information about yourself.</p>
<p>When you use our Sites as a Job Seeker or as a Recruiter, you create a profile, which contains a core set of PI, which acts as a login authentication to identify you (a “Profile”). We store this Profile in the United States.</p>
<p>You use your Profile to access our Services, and you add, update and delete information on your Profile as you use the Services. The Services that you choose to use determines the type of information collected, the use of that information by Symphony Talent and by others, and your control over that information.</p>
<p>For example, your Profile will always contain:</p>
<ol>
<li>your name;</li>
<li>your email address; and</li>
<li>a password that you set.</li>
</ol>
<p>Then, depending on the Services you use, we may collect and store in your Profile:</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>contact information such as address, telephone number;</li>
<li>information about your education and occupation background, skills and experience, awards, memberships and affiliations, activities and interests;</li>
<li>information imported by you and/or your connections from third party sites;</li>
<li>information about third parties, such as references or contacts which you provide to us with the third parties’ express written consent to do so;</li>
<li>your resume, cover letters, patents, work examples and other documents (“Supporting Documents”);</li>
<li>your preferences and favorites; and/or</li>
<li>your age, gender, race or ethnicity, if permitted by local law and you choose to provide it.</li>
</ol>
<p>Depending on the Services you choose to use, some or all of your Profile may be made available to other parties. Your password is never shown to any other party.</p>
<p>We attempt to limit access to our Sites to Recruiters, but we do not and cannot guarantee that other parties will not gain access to this database. Furthermore, we cannot control the use of information in your Profile by third parties who access the Sites. Once your Profile has been disclosed, Symphony Talent is not able to retrieve it from the third parties who have seen, downloaded, printed or otherwise stored it.</p>
<p>Some Services (such as background checks and various new hire on-boarding functions employers may require of you, or your purchasing of other Services we may offer you, etc.), may require that you provide very sensitive information (“Permitted Hidden Information”) such as: Social Security Number or National Identification Number.</p>
<p>Permitted Hidden Information is not stored in, and is not visible in, your Profile. Other than for storage as Permitted Hidden Information, you should not put Social Security Numbers, bank accounts, personality profiles, or other information you would not want made public, in your Profile, Public Submissions, or any Supporting Document.</p>
<p>Some Services allow you to set your Profile, parts of your Profile, your Supporting Documents and some types of Submissions that you make visible to the public areas of Symphony Talent Sites (“Public Submission”). Public Submissions can be seen by any user on the Symphony Talent Sites, and by any person on the Internet. You can retract Public Submissions at any time by adjusting your privacy settings in your profile. However, anyone who has viewed your Profile, including your Public Submissions, may have kept a copy of them.</p>
<p>You may delete your Profile (which deletes your Supporting Documents and Public Submissions), from our Sites at any time. Some Countries and States require that we, and/or Recruiters that use our Services, retain a copy of the information you provided. Deleting your Profile from our Sites does not guarantee that copies of your information are also being deleted.</p>
<p>If you provide us with details of a reference, it is your responsibility to ensure that the person is aware that you have forwarded his or her contact information and has consented in writing for you to do so. By providing the details of a reference, you warrant and represent that you have obtained that individual’s consent.

<p>We also share passively-collected information (including location data) about Symphony Talent Site visitors with third parties to serve advertisements to you on our Sites, on other sites with which we have a business relationship, and via our Services. We may also aggregate data regarding employment qualifications, education, age, experience level or other information relevant to improving the relevancy of the Services we offer you, the advertising we display and/or send to you. This aggregated data does not identify you personally.</p>
<p>At times we may be required by law enforcement or judicial authorities to provide information to the appropriate governmental authorities. In such cases, we will disclose information upon receipt of a court order, subpoena, bankruptcy proceedings, or other legal process or to cooperate with a law enforcement investigation when we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud, or respond to a government request. We fully cooperate with law enforcement agencies in identifying those who use our Services for illegal activities. We reserve the right to report to law enforcement agencies any activities that we in good faith believe to be unlawful.</p>
<p>We may disclose and transfer information to a third party who acquires any or all of Symphony Talent’s business, whether such acquisition is by way of merger, consolidation or purchase of all or a substantial portion of our assets. You will be notified via email and/or a prominent notice on our Sites of any change in ownership or uses of your personal information, as well as any choices you may have regarding your personal information.</p>

These third parties may employ clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs), images, and scripts that help them better manage content on our Sites. We may tie the information gathered to your Profile to help us better serve you, however we never provide that information back to those third parties. You can opt out of third party cookies by setting your browser to decline cookies. Symphony Talent does not respond to web browser “do not track” signals. You can opt out of targeted advertising from networks Symphony Talent works with by visiting&nbsp;<a href="http://preferences-mgr.truste.com/">http://preferences-mgr.truste.com</a>, or if you reside in the European Union, you may visit&nbsp;<a href="http://www.youronlinechoices.eu/">http://www.youronlinechoices.eu/</a>. Please note this does not opt you out of being served advertising. You will continue to receive generic ads by others.</p>
<p><strong>How You Update and/or Delete your Information</strong></p>
<p>Depending on what Services&nbsp;you use, you may be able to access, update or delete your information in different ways. &nbsp;For instance, some services such as Background Checks delivered by third parties may be legally required to keep your information for a period of time.</p>
<p>1) If you had taken an Assessment as part of applying for a job with a specific company via the SkillCheck.com website, you need to contact us at privacy@symphonytalent.com&nbsp;in order to have your assessment results&nbsp;deleted from that system.</p>
<p>2) If you had applied to a job for a specific employer via the HRApply.com system, you need to visit that employer’s career website to log in and delete your profile.</p>
<p>3) If you have joined an employer’s Talent Community, signed up for job alerts, joined TheHive.com, were referred to a job by a friend, participate as an employee&nbsp;in the Employee Referral program, attended a recruiting event, or are a user of any of the Symphony Talent Sites,&nbsp;you may access, review, correct, update, change or delete your Profile or any Supporting Documents at any time. To make any modification, you may log into your account at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thehive.com/">https://www.TheHive.com</a>&nbsp;and make the desired changes. You may need to set/reset your password in order to gain access to update/delete your information.</p>
<p>Access to or correction, update, or deletion of your Profile may be denied or limited by Symphony Talent if it would violate another person’s rights and/or as otherwise permitted by applicable law. If you wish to delete or close your account and remove your Profile altogether, you can do so at any time by visiting&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thehive.com/">https://www.TheHive.com</a>. If you delete your Profile&nbsp;we will retain an archival copy of your Profile that is not accessible by you or third parties. Archival copies are retained only for as long as needed for audit and record purposes, and/or by law (“Archival Period”). We will also keep logs and information that may relate to your activity on our Site.</p>
<p>If you wish to re-establish your Profile during the Archival Period, you may re-join our Sites, and providing you use and authenticate with the same email address as you originally used to create your Profile, your full Profile and history will be restored, minus your Name, Address, Phone number, and any Permitted Hidden Information you may have previously added. You may re-add this information.</p>
<p><strong>How We Store Information</strong></p>
<p>We retain all the aggregate non-identifying information we gather about you such as recruiter notes, selection status, and others in an effort to make your, and other’s use of our Sites more efficient. We keep this non-identifying information even if you delete your Profile.</p>
<p>We may retain your personal information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you services, comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes and enforce our agreements.</p>
<p>If you change your Profile, those changes will be provided to any party that accesses your Profile through our Sites and Services, provided they still maintain your consent to disclose your Profile to them.</p>
<p>While you are able to change and delete your Profile from our Sites, anyone who previously had your consent or otherwise viewed your Profile and/or used our Sites may have kept a copy of it. Some Countries and States require that we, and/or Recruiters that use our Services, retain a copy of the information you provided as you used the Services. Deleting and/or changing your Profile from/on our Sites does not guarantee that these copies are also being deleted/changed.</p>
<p>Upon request we will provide you with information about whether we hold any of your personal information. If you have additional requests regarding your information, please contact us at privacy@symphonytalent.com. Symphony Talent will respond to information access requests within thirty (30) days of receipt. If we require additional time to respond, we will acknowledge receipt of your request within a reasonable timeframe&nbsp;and supplement our response within the time period required by applicable law.</p>
<p>If you have not logged onto our Site for an extended period, we may deactivate your Profile. You can reactivate your Profile simply by logging back in to any of our Sites within the Archival Period. Deactivated Profiles may be deleted. Our policy is to delete accounts and Profiles if a user does not log in within eighteen (18) months. We may extend or reduce this period at our discretion. If we change the period, we will update this notice. We will notify you at the email address you provided before we delete your account in this manner.</p>
