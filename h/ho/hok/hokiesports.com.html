</p><p><b>Surveys &amp; Contests</b>

</p><p><b>Security</b>

</p><p>This website takes precautions to protect our users' information.  When users submit sensitive information via the website, your information is protected both online and off-line.
</p><p>When our registration/order form asks users to enter sensitive information (such as credit card number and/or social security number), that information is encrypted and is protected with the best encryption software in the industry - SSL.  While on a secure page, such as our order form, the lock icon on the bottom of Web browsers such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to un-locked, or open, when you are just 'surfing".  To learn more about SSL, follow this link <a href="http://www.verisign.com">http://www.verisign.com</a>.
</p><p>While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also do everything in our power to protect user-information off-line.  All of our users' information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted in our offices.  Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, a billing clerk , a customer service representative or ticket order processing personnel) are granted access to personally identifiable information. Personal information not linked to financial transactions are stored for customer service purpose only. Our employees use password-protected screen-savers when they leave their desk.  When they return, they must re-enter their password to re-gain access to your information.  Furthermore, ALL employees are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy practices.  Every quarter, as well as any time new policies are added, our employees are notified and/or reminded about the importance we place on privacy, and what they can do to ensure our customers' information is protected.  Finally, the servers that we store personally identifiable information on are kept in a secure environment, within a locked cabinet.
</p><p>If you have any questions about the security at our website, you can send an email to <a href="mailto:hokiesportssecurity@vt.edu">hokiesportssecurity@vt.edu</a>.


</p><p><b>Supplementation of Information</b>
</p><p>In order for this website to properly fulfill its obligation to our customers, it is necessary for us to supplement the information we receive with information from 3rd party sources.

</p><p><b>Special Offers</b>

</p><p>We send all subscribers to <b>hokie</b>sports<b>.com</b><i>-the newspaper</i> a welcoming email to verify password and username. Established members will occasionally receive information on products, services, special deals, and a newsletter. Out of respect for the privacy of our users we present the option to not receive these types of communications. Please see our choice and opt-out below.

</p><p><b>Site and Service Updates</b>
</p><p>We also send the user site and service announcement updates. Members are not able to un-subscribe from service announcements, which contain important information about the service. We communicate with the user to provide requested services and in regards to issues relating to their account via email or phone.

</p><p><b>Correction/Updating Personal Information:</b>
</p><p>If a user's personally identifiable information changes (such as your zip code), or if a user no longer desires our service, we will endeavor to provide a way to correct, update or remove that user's personal data provided to us.  This can usually be done at the member information page or by emailing our Customer Support at <a href="mailto:hokipoki@vt.edu">hokipoki@vt.edu</a>. 

</p><p><b>Choice/Opt-out</b>

</p><p>Our users are given the opportunity to "opt-out" of having their information used for purposes not directly related to our site at the point where we ask for the information.  For example, our order form has an "opt-out" mechanism so users who make a purchase from us, but don't want any marketing material, can keep their email address off of our lists.  
</p><p>Users who no longer wish to receive our newsletter or promotional materials from our partners may opt-out of receiving these communications by replying to unsubscribe in the subject line in the email or email us at <a href="mailto: hokipoki@vt.edu">hokipoki@vt.edu</a>.
</p><p>Users of our site are always notified when their information is being collected by any outside parties.  We do this so our users can make an informed choice as to whether they should proceed with services that require an outside party, or not.

</p><p><b>Notification of Changes</b>
</p><p>If we change our privacy policy, we will post those changes on our Homepage so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under circumstances, if any, we disclose it.  If at any point we decide to use personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time it was collected, we will notify users by way of an email.  Users will have a choice as to whether or not we use their information in this different manner. We will use information in accordance with the privacy policy under which the information was collected.
