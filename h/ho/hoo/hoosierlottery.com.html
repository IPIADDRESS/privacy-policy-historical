Changes will be posted on the Hoosier Lottery Website. By accessing the Hoosier Lottery Website, Players and Persons consent to and accept this Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy describes the Hoosier Lottery’s privacy practices regarding information collected at any time through any means. <br> <br> For purposes of this Privacy Policy, “you” or “your” means each person, group of individuals, entity or entities.<br> <br> For purposes of this Privacy Policy, “Personal Information" means information about a natural person that is readily identifiable to that specific individual. Personal Information includes, among other information, an individual’s name, address, social security number, telephone number, date of birth, password information, and any other personally identifiable information. A domain name or Internet protocol address is not considered Personal Information.</p>
<h3><strong>II. Basic Principles</strong></h3>

In the event of authorized law enforcement investigations and pursuant to any required legal process, information from these sources may be used to help identify an individual.</p>
<h3><strong>IX. Enforcement</strong></h3>
<p>Personals who believe their Personal Information is not handled in accordance with this Privacy Policy should contact the Director of Corporate Social Responsibility and Compliance, who will discuss the issue with the complainant, conduct and investigation and report back to the complainant and attempt to resolve the issues quickly and amicably.</p>
