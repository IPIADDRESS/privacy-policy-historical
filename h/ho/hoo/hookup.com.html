<p class="c3"><strong><span class="c11">No fee usually required</span></strong></p>
<p class="c3"><span class="c1">You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to exercise any of the other rights). However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive, or excessive. Alternatively, we could refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances.</span></p>
<p class="c3 c8"><strong><span class="c5">What we may need from you</span></strong></p>
<p class="c3"><span class="c1">We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your personal data (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response.</span></p>
<p class="c3"><strong><span class="c5">Time limit to respond</span></strong></p>
<p class="c3"><span class="c1">We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month. Occasionally it could take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this case, we will notify you and keep you updated.</span></p>

<p class="c3"><span class="c11">Legitimate Interest&nbsp;</span><span class="c1">means the interest of our business in conducting and managing our business to enable us to give you the best service/product and the best and most secure experience. We make sure we consider and balance any potential impact on you (both positive and negative) and your rights before we process your personal data for our legitimate interests. We do not use your personal data for activities where our interests are overridden by the impact on you (unless we have your consent or are otherwise required or permitted to by law). You can obtain further information about how we assess our legitimate interests against any potential impact on you in respect of specific activities by contacting us.</span></p>
<p class="c3"><span class="c11">Performance of Contract</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;means processing your data where it is necessary for the performance of a contract to which you are a party or to take steps at your request before entering into such a contract.</span></p>
<p class="c3"><span class="c11">Comply with a legal obligation&nbsp;</span><span class="c1">means processing your personal data where it is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation that we are subject to.</span></p>
<p class="c3 c8"><strong><span class="c5">Third Parties</span></strong></p>
<p class="c3"><strong><span class="c5">External Third Parties</span></strong></p>
<ul class="c15 lst-kix_list_43-0 start">
<li class="c3 c4"><span class="c5">Compliance with Laws.&nbsp;</span><span class="c1">We may disclose your information where we are legally required to do so to comply with applicable law, government requests, a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process, such as in response to a court order or a subpoena (including in response to public authorities to meet national security or law enforcement requirements).</span></li>
<li class="c3 c4"><span class="c5">Vital Interests and Legal Rights.&nbsp;</span><span class="c1">We may disclose your information where we believe it is necessary to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding potential violations of our policies, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the safety of any person and illegal activities, or as evidence in litigation in which we are involved.</span></li>
<li class="c3 c4"><span class="c5">Vendors, Consultants, and Other Third-Party Service Providers.&nbsp;</span><span class="c1">We may share your data with third-party vendors, service providers, contractors, or agents who perform services for us or on our behalf and require access to that information to do that work. Examples include: payment processing, data analysis, email delivery, hosting services, customer service, and marketing efforts. We may allow selected third parties to use tracking technology on the website, which will enable them to collect data about how you interact with the website over time. This information may be used to, among other things, analyze and track data, determine the popularity of certain content and better understand online activity. For example, we use Google Analytics to help us understand how our customers use the website (you can read more about how Google uses your personal data here:&nbsp;</span><span class="c10 c21"><a class="c2" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.google.com/int%27l/en/policies/privacy/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1540992998112000">https://www.google.com/int’l/en/policies/privacy/</a></span><span class="c1">).

<h3 class="c3"><span class="c11">Your EEA Legal Rights</span></h3>
<p class="c3"><strong><span class="c1">You have the right to:</span></strong></p>
<p class="c3"><span class="c11">Request access</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;to your personal data (commonly known as a “data subject access request”). This enables you to receive a copy of the personal data we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it.</span></p>
<p class="c3"><span class="c11">Request correction&nbsp;</span><span class="c1">of the personal data that we hold about you. This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide to us.</span></p>
<p class="c3"><span class="c11">Request erasure&nbsp;</span><span class="c1">of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal data where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal data where you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below), where we may have processed your information unlawfully, or where we are required to erase your personal data to comply with local law. Note, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request.</span></p>
<p class="c3"><span class="c11">Object to processing</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;of your personal data where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms. You also have the right to object where we are processing your personal data for direct marketing purposes. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which override your rights and freedoms.</span></p>
<p class="c3"><span class="c11">Request restriction of processing&nbsp;</span><span class="c1">of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal data in the following scenarios:</span></p>
<ul class="c15 lst-kix_list_47-0 start">
<li class="c3 c13"><span class="c1">If you want us to establish the data’s accuracy.</span></li>
<li class="c3 c13"><span class="c1">Where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it.</span></li>
<li class="c3 c13"><span class="c1">Where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise, or defend legal claims.</span></li>
<li class="c3 c13"><span class="c1">You have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it.</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="c3"><span class="c11">Request the transfer</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;of your personal data to you or to a third party. We will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Note that this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you.</span></p>
<p class="c3"><span class="c11">Withdraw consent at any time</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;where we are relying on consent to process your personal data. However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent. If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain products or services to you. We will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent.</span></p>
