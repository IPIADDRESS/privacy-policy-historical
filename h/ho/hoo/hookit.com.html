        <p><strong>WHAT DOES THIS PRIVACY POLICY COVER? </strong><br>
        This Privacy Policy covers Hookit.com's treatment of personal information that Hookit.com gathers when you are on the Hookit.com Web site, Hookit.com-powered Community Sites and when you use Hookit.com services.</p>
        <p>This policy does not apply to the practices of third parties that Hookit.com does not own or control, or to individuals that Hookit.com does not employ or manage.</p>
        <p><strong>WHEN THIS PRIVACY POLICY APPLIES</strong><br>
        This Privacy Policy applies whether you are accessing Hookit.com and/or Hookit.com Community Sites via a personal computer, a mobile device or any other technology or devices now known or hereafter developed or discovered (each, a “Device”) and whether you are accessing as a Member or other user. This Privacy Policy is a part of the terms and conditions which are set forth in our <a target="_blank" href="/terms/default.aspx">Terms of Use</a> Agreement. This Privacy Policy governs only the Personal Information and Other Information (as those terms are defined below) collected by us via Hookit.com or Hookit.com-powered Community Sites and does not cover any such information collected by any other company or third party, unless specifically stated. We may from time to time, combine Information (as that term is defined below) with other information we collect from other sources, such as information received from Sponsors, marketing companies or Advertisers and, if we do so, our use of the resulting combined Information will be subject to this Privacy Policy.</p>
        <p>Your continued use of Hookit.com and/or Hookit.com Community Sites indicates your acceptance of this Privacy Policy and of the collection, use, disclosure, management and storage of your Personal Information and Other Information as described herein. We reserve the right to revise this Privacy Policy at any time by posting an updated Privacy Policy without advance notice to you. Such revisions will be effective immediately upon posting.

        <p><strong>ELIGIBILITY</strong><br>
        Visitors to Hookit.com and Hookit.com Community Sites may participate in many activities without providing any personally identifiable information. However, if a user wants to participate in certain of our interactive features, we ask the user to register and provide us with the following information: the user's e-mail address and age information. When the person who registers indicates that he or she is under 13, we will either collect no personally identifiable information from that individual or inform the child that a parent's verifiable consent is required or we will collect the e-mail address of the user's parent in addition to the user's e-mail address. We use the parent's e-mail address to seek the parent's verifiable consent or notify the parent of his/her child's online activities and enable the parent to unsubscribe his/her child from a newsletter or other similar activity. Parents are also provided with the option to download a form to sign and fax to our corporate offices to provide verifiable consent for their child to participate in the services, which is located at Under 13 Form. If a user is under 13, we will not condition his/her participation in an online activity on the disclosure of more information than is reasonably necessary to participate in the activity. If you would like to review any personally identifiable information that we have collected online from your child, have this information deleted, and/or request that there be no further collection or use of your child's information or if you have questions about these information practices, you may contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@hookit.com.com">privacy@hookit.com</a>, or via mail at Hookit.com, Attn: Privacy Under 13, 6650 Lusk Blvd, Suite B201, San Diego, CA 92121.</p>
        <p>If you are between 13 and 17 or under the age of majority where you live, before you use Hookit.com or Hookit.com Sites please review this Agreement with your parents or guardians. Until you reach the age of majority where you live, you certify that your parents or guardians have consented to your use, they have agreed to this Agreement on your behalf, and you agree to provide them with your current registration e-mail address and password at all times. You understand that your parents or guardians may ask us to modify or terminate your use or access, and we may do so at their request or for any other reason, at any time, without notice or responsibility to anyone.</p>
        <p>By your use, you certify that you are at least 13 years of age or the required greater age for certain features and meet any other eligibility requirements. If you are not yet 13 years old or the required greater age for certain features and/or do not meet other eligibility requirements, please discontinue using Hookit.com and Hookit.com Sites immediately and do not send any Information about yourself. If we discover that a user under age 13 does not have verified parental consent and/or has provided us with Personal Information or Other Information, we will delete it.</p>

        <strong><br>
        Joint Registration </strong></p>

After you have registered at Hookit.com or your first Community Site, your Hookit.com membership makes joining other Community Sites easy. When logged in, Hookit.com recognizes you as a Hookit.com Member at all Hookit.com-powered Community Sites that you visit, so you need not login again. To join any additional Community Site that you visit, and gain access to your Hookit.com-powered Member features and services at that site, simply click the “Join Now” button. (Note that some Community Sites may set additional requirements for membership, such as geographic location or minimum age. Also note that, for your online privacy and security, if other people have access to your computer or Device, we recommend you log out of Hookit.com after visiting your Community Sites.)<br type="_moz">

        <p><strong>COOKIES</strong></p>
        - Cookies To enhance your experience on Hookit.com and with Community Sites, we may use "Cookies." Cookies are small data files placed in your Device’s browser when you visit a Community Site. Cookies may be used for a number of purposes, such as tracking usage patterns, measuring the effectiveness of advertising, to help serve advertisements, limiting multiple responses and registrations, facilitating your ability to navigate Community Sites, and as part of a verification or screening process. Cookies automatically identify your web browser whenever you visit Hookit.com and Community Sites. Also, by recording how and when you use Hookit.com and Community Sites, Cookies help us determine which areas are popular and which are not. Additionally, accepting Cookies may allow you, among other things, to personalize your experience on Hookit.com and Community Sites. We do use session cookies to ensure that visitors under the age of 13 provide a parental email address to assist with our compliance with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act. In the case of children using our website and services, we use parents' e-mail addresses to notify them when we have received personal information such as e-mail addresses from their children and to give parents the option to remove their child's name from our lists. Parents have the option to agree to the collection and use of their child's information without consenting to the disclosure of the information to third parties. Once you log out or close your browser, session cookies expire and no longer have any effect.<br type="_moz">
        <br>
        - Opting Out If you do not wish to allow for use of Cookies, you may generally opt-out of providing this information by setting your browser to reject Cookies or by controlling the preferences in third-party applications such as Norton Internet Security. If you do not wish for Cookies to track your specific activity, you may set your browser to reject Cookies, adjust your e-mail settings from HTML to text-only display, and control the preferences in third-party applications such as Norton Internet Security.

        <p><strong>THIRD PARTY ADVERTISERS, CONTENT PROVIDERS AND SERVICE PROVIDERS</strong><br>
        When you visit Community Sites or Sponsor Profile, Advertisers may serve certain content, including, for example, advertisements. Advertisers also may set their own Cookies or other tracking technologies to identify your preferences, recognize you (if you have previously had contact with the Advertisers) and determine on which web site their advertisement was displayed and whether or not you clicked it. Third-party content providers and service providers also may use tracking technologies to determine how many times you have viewed their content or used their services. This information also helps advertising partners deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be most relevant to you. We do not have access to or control the use of tracking technologies by third parties, what information they collect or how they use it. Third parties’ use of tracking technologies is subject to their own privacy policies. Therefore, we encourage you to investigate and ask questions directly of them in this regard.</p>
        <br><p><strong>THIRD PARTY SOCIAL NETWORKING SERVICES</strong><br>
        You may have the opportunity to access or interact with the Services via other social networking websites and services ("SNSs") like Facebook, Twitter and MySpace. Consequently, your Personal Information may be shared with those SNSs and they may share data with us.

In the event that you choose to provide your information directly to a third party SNSs, your information will be governed by the policies of those other SNSs.

We encourage you to read the privacy policies or statements of the other websites you visit.</p>
        <p>Some of those third party services may also provide us with information from your accounts there to enhance and personalize your use of this Site. For example, you can allow Facebook to tell us who your Facebook friends are so you can follow their activity on Hookit.com. You can remove Hookit.com from your Facebook services to block this feature by visiting your Facebook account, in which case we will delete the information that we receive from your accounts with those other services.
