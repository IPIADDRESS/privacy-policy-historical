<p> <strong>WHAT DOES THIS PRIVACY POLICY COVER?&nbsp;</strong><br> This Privacy Policy covers Hookit’s treatment of personal and other information that Hookit gathers when you are on the Hookit website, Hookit mobile applications, Community Sites and when you use our Services.</p>
<p> This policy does not apply to the practices of third parties that Hookit does not own or control – for example servers, search engines or third party sites – or to individuals that Hookit does not employ or manage.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p> <strong>WHEN THIS PRIVACY POLICY APPLIES</strong><br> This Privacy Policy applies whether you are accessing Hookit and/or Community Sites via a personal computer, a mobile device or any other technology or devices now known or hereafter developed or discovered (each, a “Device”) and whether you are accessing as a Member or other user.</p>
<p>This Privacy Policy operates alongside the terms and conditions which are set forth in our&nbsp;<a href="/terms/"><u>Terms of Use</u></a>&nbsp;Agreement. This Privacy Policy governs only the Personal Information and Other Information (as those terms are defined below) collected by us via Hookit or Community Sites and social media (please see How We Collect Your Information below) and does not cover any such information collected by any other company or third party, unless specifically stated. We may from time to time combine Information (as that term is defined below) with other information we collect from other publicly available sources, such as information received from businesses, events, social networks, other websites, service providers, marketing companies or Advertisers and, if we do so, our use of the resulting combined Information will be subject to this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p> Your continued use of Hookit and/or Community Sites will be subject to this Privacy Policy and you are hereby notified of the collection, use, disclosure, management and storage of your Personal Information and Other Information as described herein.</p>
<p>We reserve the right to revise this Privacy Policy at any time by posting an updated Privacy Policy without advance notice to you. Such revisions will be effective immediately upon posting. Notice of material changes will be posted on Hookit or Community Sites and wherever possible will be provided by e-mailing you or notifying you upon login about these changes, in such form of notice as we consider suitable. We encourage you to check this Privacy Policy and the&nbsp;<u>Terms of Use</u>&nbsp;Agreement often for updates.</p>
<p> We are committed to protecting users’ privacy. Keeping the Personal Information you share with us secure and ensuring your understanding of how we collect, use, disclose and maintain your Personal Information is important to us. We maintain certain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards to protect your Personal Information but &nbsp;no data transmission online is 100% secure from intrusion, and we ask that you not provide us with or post sensitive or confidential information.&nbsp;</p>
<p> <strong>ELIGIBILITY</strong><br> Visitors to Hookit and Community Sites may participate in many activities without providing any personally identifiable information. However, if a user wants to participate in certain of our interactive features, we ask the user to register and provide us with the following information: the user’s name, e-mail address, gender, preferred sport, and age information.&nbsp;</p>
<p> If you are between 13 and 17 or under the age of majority where you live, before you use Hookit, our Services, or any Community Sites please review the Privacy Policy and Terms of Use with your parents or guardians. Until you reach the age of majority where you live, you certify that your parents or guardians have consented to your use, they have accepted the Privacy Policy and Terms of Use on your behalf, and you agree to provide them with your current registration e-mail address and password at all times. You understand that your parents or guardians may ask us to modify or terminate your use or access, and we may do so at their request or for any other reason, at any time, without notice or responsibility to anyone.</p>
<p><strong>Children</strong><br> Hookit and the Hookit App provide services that are intended for a general audience.&nbsp; Users are required to provide their dates of birth to access certain Hookit features.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If a user identifies himself or herself as under 13, we require verifiable parental consent if we collect personal information from such a user. This is to comply with COPPA in the United States, and similar laws in many EU states including the United Kingdom. However, the relevant age in your jurisdiction may vary.</p>
<p>In the process of obtaining parental consent, we provide parents with a description of the information we collect from our users, how that information is used, who that information may be shared with, what types of information may be made public, and how a parent may access their child’s personal information or request that their child’s account be disabled.&nbsp; We will not knowingly ask children under the age of 13 to provide any personal information other than that which is reasonably necessary to provide Hookit services.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p> Because Hookit is available to users of all ages, if a parent grants consent to their child’s use of the site, that child will have the ability to send and receive communications with Hookit users of all ages.&nbsp;&nbsp; We urge children to check with their parents before entering information on any website and we urge parents to discuss with their children restrictions regarding providing personal information to people they do not know online.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;Parents may review, edit, request the deletion of, or prevent further collection or use of their child’s personal information or make any other inquiry regarding this privacy policy by sending an email to privacy@hookit.com or by mail at Hookit, Attn: Privacy Under 13, 3398 Carmel Mountain Rd, Suite 100, San Diego, CA 92121.

<p>Other than in respect of your personal data rights, Hookit and Community Sites are established and maintained in the United States, meaning that you are accessing a community network in the U.S. Hookit and Community Sites are governed by and operated in accordance with the laws of the U.S. Hookit makes no representation that Hookit or Community Sites are governed by or operated in accordance with the laws of other nations.</p>
<p>Please be aware that any Personal Information or Other Information you provide to us or we obtain as a result of your use of Hookit or Community Sites will be collected in the U.S. or transferred to the U.S. by or on behalf of the Community Sites.

<p> <strong>REGISTERING WITH HOOKIT AND COMMUNITY SITES</strong><br> <strong><br> Joint Registration&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p> – When you become a Member of a Hookit and/or a Community Site, you are registered with Hookit as well as that Community Site. Your e-mail address and password combination (collectively, “Login”) gives you immediate access to your Hookit account and the Community Site features. After you have registered at Hookit, you may join other Community Sites. When logged in, Hookit recognizes you as a Hookit Member if the Community Site uses a Hookit.com sub-domain so you do not need to login again. To join, simply click the “Join Now” button or similar option provided on the Community Site to join. To join any additional Community Site not using a Hookit.com subdomain, simply sign in using your Hookit Login information to gain access to the features and services at that site (Note that some Community Sites may set additional requirements for membership, such as geographic location or minimum age. Also note that, for your online privacy and security, if other people have access to your computer or Device, we recommend you log out of Hookit after visiting your Community Sites.). Hookit and each Community Site that you join may have access to the updated registration and profile Information that you provide on Hookit or the Community Site, including, but not limited to, your e-mail address and mailing address. Other information, such as information relating to your Hookit Score (as defined below) and postings to Hookit and/or the Community Sites you have joined, also may be shared with Hookit and/or your Community Sites.</p>
<p>– Terms of Use and Governing Policies</p>
<p>By registering, you acknowledge that we will need to make certain uses of your data to provide services and administer your account and use of our sites, including tracking your activities and your use of Hookit and Community Sites. You also agree to the&nbsp;<u>Terms of Use</u>&nbsp;Agreement. Please note that our use of your Information is governed by this Privacy Policy, while Community Sites’ use of your information may additionally be governed by their own privacy statements or policies.</p>
<p> – Non-Hookit Services and Offerings.</p>
<p>Please note that each Community Site’s integration with Hookit may be highly customized so, in addition to Hookit Services, Community Sites may provide features, functions, services, promotions, advertisements and other offers (as well as associated registration forms, requests for Information, “opt-ins” or “opt-outs” for communications, software downloads and the like) that are not affiliated with or provided by Hookit. Please take care when using any such offerings and familiarize yourself with the third-party policies and agreements, if any, that govern such use. We are not responsible for the use of any such non-Hookit offerings, or for the accuracy, use or misuse of any information that you may disclose or receive in connection with such use. If you have questions about whether a particular feature, function, service, offer or any other portion of a Community Site, you may e-mail us at privacy@Hookit.com or mail us at the address provided below.</p>
<p> <strong>HOW WE USE AND COLLECT YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION <br> </strong><br> “Personal Information” means information that would allow someone to identify you or contact you as an individual. For our lawful purposes as set out in this Privacy Policy, this will include your full name, e-mail address, physical address, telephone number, athlete support application information, precise location, mobile device identifier, or personal web site URL, and any other personally identifiable information or content you post on our Community Sites, or via Social Media Services sign-in, or otherwise provide to us.</p>
<p>“Other Information” means any information other than Personal Information that is collected by Hookit, our Services or Community Sites. Other Information includes, but is not limited to, non-personally identifiable data regarding how Members and other users navigate and use Hookit, our Services and Community Sites, including the number and frequency of visitors to each page, the length of their stays, the type of browser used (for example, Internet Explorer or Firefox), the operating system used (for example, Windows or Mac), the domain name of each user’s Internet service provider&nbsp; and certain other information (for example, “click stream” data).&nbsp; &nbsp;“Information” means, collectively, Personal Information and Other Information. “IP Address” means the number automatically assigned to your Device when you access the Internet, which our web servers use to identify where to send the information that your Device requests.</p>
<p><strong>How we collect and use your information</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The majority of information about you we process is information we collect ourselves.</p>
<p>We collect Personal Information and Other Information about you when you provide it to or make it available for collection by us on Hookit or Community Sites, including when you register or join a Community Site, participate in any services, features or functions of a Community Site, participate in promotions such as athlete programs, sweepstakes and contests, or in the course of any other exchanges of data, E-commerce transactions and/or activities. We collect your IP Address when you visit or request pages from Hookit or Community Sites.</p>
<p>We may also ask you to provide us with Other Information, including demographic or similar information. If we link this Other Information with your Personal Information, we will treat it as Personal Information.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, Community Sites that you join may also receive your registration Information and certain Other Information relating to your use of the Community Sites.&nbsp;&nbsp;We also collect information via third party social media sites, as below.</p>
<p> Hookit analyzes Personal Information made available by you once registered and combines it with other information collected from publicly through the Internet and third parties such as events, organizations, social networks, other websites, service providers, marketing companies and businesses, in order to create a score for athletes (“Hookit Score”). Hookit may present your Hookit Score and/or the data used to create it on Hookit, our mobile application(s), Community Sites and/or other third party websites who use our Services. We may also use your Personal Information, Other Information and other content you provide to us to improve the Service:&nbsp; for example, we may track your sports activities, exposure and performance in order to compare your Hookit Score to that of other athletes and match you with businesses to allow you to participate in athlete support programs and/or to earn deals.</p>
<p> <u>Paid areas of our site</u></p>
<p> In addition, as part of our current and planned services we may, at any time, offer additional features that require you to register or otherwise provide Personal Information, including for example, credit card information, or we may require a fee to gain access to any portion of Hookit. You may choose not to provide certain Information, but then you may be unable to take advantage of or participate in Hookit, our Services and/or Community Sites. </p>
<p><u>Third party sites</u></p>
<p> There may be times where we receive your Personal Information from a Third Party Site in order to provide our Services to you through that Third Party Site (including, for example, if you have directly provided personally-identifiable information to register separately with a Third Party Site and opt-in to Hookit, that information is then imported to Hookit pursuant to applicable privacy policies and law). There also may be circumstances when we receive personally-identifiable information about you from other sources and combine that with Information collected through Hookit and/or Community Sites. In each of those cases, we will use your Personal Information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p><u>Collection by social media </u></p>
<p> You can choose to access certain third party social media Web sites and services through our Services (such as Twitter or Facebook) (“Social Media Services”).</p>
<p>When you do so, you are sharing information with those Social Media Services, and the information you share with them will be governed by their privacy policies and terms of service. You may also be able to modify your privacy settings with these Social Media Services to, for example, control what information the Social Media Services disclose to third parties like Hookit.</p>
<p>When you add Social Media Service accounts to the Services or log into the Services using your Social Media Services account, we will collect relevant information necessary to enable our Services to access that Social Media Service, but you will provide your login information, like your password, directly to such Social Media Service (and not to Hookit). As part of such integration, the Social Media Service will provide us with access to certain information that you have provided to such Social Media Service, and we will use, store and disclose such information in accordance with this Privacy Policy and, if and to the extent applicable, the policies of such Social Media Services.</p>
<p>In addition, we may provide certain information about you or your activities on the Services, or that you have otherwise provided to us, to such Social Media Services as part of such integration (including information that may be used by such Social Media Services to personalize ads for you). However, please remember that the manner in which Social Media Services use, store and disclose your information is governed by the policies of such third parties, and Hookit shall have no liability or responsibility for the privacy practices or other actions of any Social Media Services that may be enabled within the Service. Specifically, with Facebook, the Services utilize the following data and permissions: the ability to access your data “offline”, your email address, to read your stream or feed, likes, birthdate, education, location, work history, and hometown.</p>
<p> If you agree to allow us to collect information concerning your location, we may collect that information by, for example, using your browser’s location functionality, or from photos or videos you post to Hookit or from a linked Instagram or other media sharing account.&nbsp; If you access Hookit through our mobile app and have agreed to allow us to do so, we may collect location information (including precise geo-location information) from the location services of your phone.&nbsp; You may stop us from collecting location information from your phone at any time by disabling location services in your phone’s settings.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

Therefore, if you later decide that you do not want that third party to use your Personal Information, you will need to contact the third party directly. Please note that, once you are a Hookit member (either by registering at Hookit or a Community Site), if you agree to join an additional Community Site, you are asking us to provide your Hookit registration information to that additional Community Site so that you may register with them.</p>
