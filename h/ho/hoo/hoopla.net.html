      <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
      <b>On May 25, 2018, Hoopla Software, Inc. (“Hoopla”) updated its Privacy Policy to reflect that Hoopla fully complies with the General Data Protection Regulation.</b><br>

<br>
<br><p>
The privacy of your personal information is very important to us.  This statement outlines what personal information Hoopla collects about you and how we use it in the Hoopla application, widgets, products and services, our website located at www.hoopla.net (the “Site”), and our application located at app.hoopla.net (the “App”) (collectively, the “Service”). If you have any questions or concerns relating to privacy or security, please send an email to <a href="mailto:privacy@hoopla.net">privacy@hoopla.net</a>.
</p>

<br><p>
Hoopla complies with the EU-US and Swiss-US Privacy Shield Frameworks as set forth by the US Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information from European Union member countries and Switzerland transferred to the United States pursuant to Privacy Shield.  Hoopla has certified that it adheres to the Privacy Shield Principles with respect to such data.  If there is any conflict between the policies in this privacy policy and data subject rights under the Privacy Shield Principles, the Privacy Shield Principles shall govern.  To learn more about the Privacy Shield program, and to view our certification page, please visit <a href="https://www.privacyshield.gov/">www.privacyshield.gov</a>.
</p>

<br><p>
The United States Federal Trade Commission (FTC) is the enforcement authority with jurisdiction over this compliance with the Privacy Shield.
</p>

<br><p>
Hoopla complies with the provisions of the Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament, known as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). For purposes of Article 14(2) of the GDPR, Hoopla relies on the following lawful basis for processing Personal Data: consent, compliance with law and legitimate interest.
</p>

<br>
<h3><b>Information Collection</b></h3>

<br><p>
To use the Service or to contact us for information about our services, you will have to provide the personal information needed to activate your account. By “personal information,” we mean data that is unique to an individual, such as your name, e-mail address, and company information, user IDs and passwords, online identifiers, device information, billing and transaction information, credit card or other financial information, contact preferences, and similar information. Hoopla collects information via email, through the Site, or other direct contact from you, and in the Service, that is voluntarily given to us.  
</p>

<br>
<h4>Tracking Technology</h4>

<p>
Tracking Technology: Cookies are pieces of data stored on your computer’s hard drive by a Web site. Cookies are an industry standard and used by most major web sites and online applications to improve their services. We tie personal information you provide to us to cookies. Hoopla uses cookies for user convenience. The cookie will tell our system certain information so you don’t have to fill in the same information each time you visit us. The cookie feature can be turned off on your browser. For more information on turning off the cookie feature, consult your browser “Help” section. If you choose to turn off cookies, you can still access some parts of the Service, but you won’t be able to access the App.
</p>

<p>
We use our third party tracking-utility partners to gather certain information automatically and store it when you use the Service. This information includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data. We use this information to analyze trends, to administer the Service, to track users’ movements around the Service and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole.
</p>

<br>
<h4>IP Addresses</h4>

<p>
An Internet Protocol (IP) address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer by your Internet service provider whenever you access the Internet. This number may be the same each time you access the Internet or it may change. Like other Internet sites, Hoopla uses IP addresses to collect aggregate information about numbers of visitors and Site usage. Hoopla reserves the right to use IP addresses to identify individuals if (1) Hoopla is required to disclose such information by any applicable law or legal process (like a subpoena or court order); or (2) Hoopla is required to do so to protect the safety of the public or other users of the Service, to enforce the Terms of Use, or otherwise to protect our rights.
</p>

<br>
<h4>Testimonials</h4>

We post customer testimonials/comments/reviews on our Site which may contain personally identifiable information. We do obtain the customer’s consent via email prior to posting the testimonial to post their name along with their testimonial. If you want your testimonial removed please contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@hoopla.net">privacy@hoopla.net</a>.
</p>

<br>
<h4>Blogs</h4>

<p>
Our Site offers publicly accessible blogs or community forums. You should be aware that any information you provide in these areas may be read, collected, and used by others who access them.
</p>

<br>
<h4>Social Media Features and Widgets</h4>

<p>
Our Site includes social media features, such as the Facebook Like button and widgets, such as the share this button or interactive mini-programs that run on our Site.

</p>

<br>
<h3><b>How We Use Information</b></h3>

<h4>Security</h4>

<p>
We take precautions to protect your information and have implemented administrative, technical, and physical measures designed to protect your personal information from accidental loss and from unauthorized access, disclosure, use, alteration, or destruction. When you submit sensitive information via the Service, your information is protected both online and offline. Hoopla utilizes generally-accepted security measures (such as encryption) to protect against the misuse or unauthorized disclosure of any sensitive personal information you submit to us (such as log in information). However, like other Internet sites and web applications, we cannot guarantee that it is completely secure against attempts to evade security measures or intercept transmissions over the Internet. You are responsible for maintaining the security of your username and password for the Service.
</p>

<br><p>
We also protect your information offline. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, billing or customer service) are granted access to personally identifiable information.
</p>

<br>
<h3><b>Sharing</b></h3>

<br><p>
We share aggregated demographic information with our partners and advertisers. This is not linked to any personal information that can identify any individual person.
</p>

<br><p>
Hoopla may transfer personal information to companies that help us provide our Service.

</p>

<br><p>
