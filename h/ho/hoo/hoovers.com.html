</h2>
<p>Hoover's, a Dun &amp; Bradstreet (D&amp;B) company, puts you on the fastest path to business. We deliver comprehensive insight and analysis about the companies, industries and people that drive the economy, along with powerful tools to find and connect with the right people to get business done. Hoover's offers proprietary business information through the Internet, data feeds, wireless devices and co-branded alliances with other online services. Our website features a database of information on more than 30 million corporations and organizations, and more than 35 million business professionals. Hoover's sells subscriptions to marketing, sales and business development professionals, and we also publish our information in various reference books.
</p>
<p>Since becoming a D&amp;B company, Hoover's has expanded both the breadth of information that is available on our website and the tools that are accessible to our customers. We provide such features as corporate family tree information and customized data feeds that allow our customers to access the information in their preferred format. Hoover's also provides industry insight through our First Research Industry Profiles, which cover market trends, business challenges and industry opportunities.
</p>
<p>Hoover's considers itself to be a steward of the information that we collect, manage and provide. It is our responsibility to safeguard the information within our care and we are committed to managing our data in a secure and responsible manner. We provide products and services based on information about millions of businesses and business professionals. Our information management practices are guided by our <strong class="subh">Global Privacy Principles</strong>, which serve as the foundation of our data management policies and practices. These Principles commit Hoover's to the following tenets:
</p>
<p><strong class="subh">Notice:</strong> Hoover's informs users and customers how we collect, use, manage and share information.
</p>
<p><strong class="subh">Data Quality:</strong> Hoover's employs substantive measures to produce high-quality, timely and reliable data, including direct contact with businesses and quality assurance procedures during data collection and processing.
</p>
<p><strong class="subh">Use &amp; Disclosure:</strong> Hoover's uses and discloses data in accordance with defined policies that respect a business's and business professional's choice to restrict the marketing use of their contact information.
</p>
<p><strong class="subh">Access &amp; Correction:</strong> Hoover's provides businesses and business professionals with access to their business information within the Hoover's databases and with an opportunity to correct verified inaccuracies.
</p>
<p><strong class="subh">Data Security:</strong> Hoover's applies appropriate technical, physical and administrative data security measures to protect data against unauthorized access and disclosure.
</p>
<p><strong class="subh">Accountability:</strong> Hoover's seeks to adhere to its Global Privacy Principles through ongoing compliance, training, documentation, assessment and dispute resolution initiatives.
</p>
<p>Hoover's delivers products and services through the Internet more effectively and efficiently than ever before. As a leading provider of business information, our products and services serve to enable and enhance commerce. Our business customer needs continue to evolve, as do public expectations about Data Privacy and the technology that we employ to provide our products and services. Our approach to information management and Data Privacy enables us to adapt and respond to these changes while remaining committed to our Principles. The free flow of information must be fairly balanced against privacy and data protection interests, and Hoover's is committed to employing such a balance.
</p>

We collect individual and business identifiable information from website visitors when you register to be a member of Hoover's, purchase products and services through our website, sign up to participate in Hoover's Community Forum, subscribe for e-mail newsletters and alerts, enter a contest, fill out a survey, or fill out a form to request additional information, receive free incentives, request white papers or request case studies. We also collect information offline from business partners and vendors. The business information that we collect includes the following:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Company and business professional contact information, including name, title, address, phone number, fax number and e-mail address; </li>
  <li>Detailed company profiles and statistics, including industries and number of employees; </li>
  <li>Background information regarding company management, such as the educational and career histories of company principals; </li>
  <li>Company operational histories, including territories, subsidiaries, affiliates and lines of business; </li>
  <li>Summary business information regarding profitability, debts, assets, net worth and business relationships; </li>
  <li>Business professional data as it relates to their professional lives, such as name, company, title, job function, business contact information and trade associations; and </li>
  <li>Credit/debit card information in order to process certain customer payments. </li>
</ul>
<p>We also collect information about website visitors indirectly through standard web logs, such as IP addresses, browser types (e.g. Internet Explorer), areas of the website that are visited and the website from which a visitor came. We routinely use this web log information in the aggregate in order to administer and improve our website. While some of this data may be traceable to an individual, we only seek to identify individuals whom we believe are using our website for improper purposes.
</p>
<h2 class="subh">How Do We Use and Share Information?
</h2>
<p>Hoover's uses the identifiable business and business professional information that we collect to operate our website, to offer a variety of business information products and services for use in making risk management and marketing decisions, and to carry out transactions that you request or authorize. Hoover's will not sell, rent or share registered user business contact information to unaffiliated third parties for marketing purposes without the registered user's consent. In conjunction with D&amp;B, Hoover's maintains a separate professional contacts directory in which your company and individual business contact information may be listed. Hoover's licenses our business and professional contact information to authorized resellers and third party businesses for marketing purposes. Being listed in Hoover's company databases and professional contacts directories offers benefits to businesses and business professionals, including identification and recognition in the marketplace and the prospect of beneficial commercial opportunities and partnerships.
</p>
<p>Hoover's shares information with third party service providers, such as credit card processors, auditors, attorneys, consultants and contractors, in order to support Hoover's Internet websites and business operations. Hoover's contractually requires that these recipients only use the information for the intended purpose of the disclosure and that they destroy or return the information when it is no longer needed. When necessary or appropriate, we may disclose information in response to a court order, subpoena, law enforcement proceeding, regulatory inquiry or when otherwise legally required. We may also disclose information as required or appropriate in order to protect our website, business operations or legal rights, or in connection with a sale or merger involving Hoover's assets or business.
</p>
<p>From time to time, Hoover's compiles online and offline transaction and registration information for internal analyses, such as market research, quality assurance, customer experience and operational benchmarking initiatives.
</p>
<h2 class="subh">You Have Choices

<h2 class="subh">Cookies, Web Beacons, Pixel Tags and GIF's
</h2>
<p>We design the layout and features of our website so that new visitors may anonymously learn about our products and services without revealing their identities. For new visitors, we use cookies or Web beacons to collect limited data, such as the date, time and areas of our website that are visited, as well as the website from which the new visitor came. When you select one of our products or services, register for a newsletter or e-mail alert, or complete a survey, we may try to identify your browser and we may combine information from cookies, Web beacons and other information collected online with other data that we maintain about you. By improving the features, marketing and content of our website and by making your online experience more convenient and meaningful, we are able to better serve our customers' needs.
</p>
<p>A cookie is a small text file that is stored on your computer's hard drive and that often includes an anonymous unique identifier. When you visit a website, that website's computer asks your computer for permission to store this text file in a section of your hard drive that is specifically designated for cookies. Each website can send its own cookie to your browser if your browser's preferences allow it. Your browser will only permit a website to access the cookies that it has previously sent to you and not the cookies sent to you by other websites. Some of our business partners, such as third party advertisers, use cookies that originate from their websites. We have no access to, or control over, these cookies. For more information, please see the "Third Party Advertisers" section below. We use cookies to store login or other information on your computer, which serves to improve our website functionality and tailor our services to your preferences and interests. For certain services, we offer users the ability to store a user ID or password within a cookie so that they do not need to re-enter it when they subsequently return to our website. Cookies, in conjunction with our Web server's log files, allow us to calculate the aggregate number of people visiting our website and to assess which parts of the site are most popular. This information helps us to constantly improve our website and better serve our customers. We do not store credit/debit card numbers in cookies. Most Internet browsers allow users to decide whether to accept cookies and how long to keep them on their hard drive. You may reset your browser to refuse cookies and still use our website, although website access and functionality may be slower and less convenient.
</p>
<p>A Web beacon is a graphic image, such as a pixel tag or clear GIF, which is placed on a Web page or in an e-mail message to monitor user activity, such as whether the Web page or e-mail message is accessed or clicked. They are often invisible because they are very small in size. They are also used on many Web pages for alignment purposes. We sometimes use Web beacons to provide an independent accounting of how many people visit our website or to gather statistics about browser usage on our website. Some of our Web pages and HTML-formatted e-mail newsletters use Web beacons in conjunction with cookies. It is difficult for you to limit the use of Web beacons because there is no easy way to distinguish their use from alignment and other purposes. Web beacons may also be loaded from a different Web server than the rest of the page.
</p>
<p>We use third party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our website. In the course of serving advertisements, our third party advertisers and partners may place or recognize a unique cookie on your browser. These companies may use information about your visits to D&amp;B and other websites in order to provide advertisements on this site and other sites about goods and services that may be of interest to you. These third party partners monitor how guests use our website and determine which of our online features they prefer. We may report information to our partners about our customers and the products and services they order, as well as aggregated, non-identifiable information about our guests' use of our website. For more information, please see the "Third Party Advertisers" section below.
</p>
<h2 class="subh">Third Party Advertisers
</h2>
<p>We use third party advertising companies to serve our Internet ad banners on our website and other websites on which we advertise. If you view a Web page where our ads appear, the advertising company may place a cookie on your computer or use a Web beacon to access a cookie that they previously placed on your computer. These companies do not collect information that can personally identify you, but they may use information about your visits to our website and other websites to measure the effectiveness of ads. We do not disclose any personally identifiable information to these companies. We share aggregate website usage information with third party advertisers and partners for the purpose of effectively targeting our online advertisements. Unless you are previously notified, these advertising companies do not link any online behavior or cookies with other information that can be used to personally identify you, such as your name, address, telephone number or e-mail address, when working with Hoover's.
</p>
<p>These third party advertising networks also track visitors' online usage and behavior patterns. These companies may use information about your visits to Hoover's and other websites in order to provide advertisements on this site and other sites about goods and services that may be of interest to you. The result of these efforts is the creation of an online profile that attempts to predict individual user interests, preferences and purchasing habits. The third party advertising networks then accordingly customize the advertising content served to users when visiting other websites.
</p>
<p>The <em>Network Advertising Initiative</em> (NAI) is a self-regulatory cooperative of online marketing and analytics companies. The NAI provides educational content and opt-out tools to help Internet users learn about and address online behavioral marketing practices. Through the NAI's online options, you may opt out of particular NAI network members' behavioral advertising programs or you may opt out of all NAI network members' programs. Opting out will prevent the given network from which you opted out from using your Web preferences and usage patterns to deliver targeted online ads. The NAI opt-out only works with participating third party advertising networks that use cookies and Web beacons to execute their advertising initiatives. If you would like additional information about online behavioral marketing and your options regarding these standard Internet practices, please visit the <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/">NAI website</a>.
