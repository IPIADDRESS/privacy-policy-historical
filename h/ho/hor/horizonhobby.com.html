								  Protocol/Internet Protocol ("TCP/IP") network, such as the World 
								  Wide Web. Networks like the Web use the TCP/IP protocol to route information 
								  based on the IP address of the destination. In other words, an IP address 
								  is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you 
								  are surfing the web, allowing web servers to locate and identify your computer. 
								  Computers require IP addresses in order for users to communicate on the 
								  Internet, browse and shop.
