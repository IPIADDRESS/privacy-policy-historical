								  that you just came from, which URL you next go to, what browser you are

								  IP address is an identifier for a computer or device on a Transmission Control 
								  Protocol/Internet Protocol ("TCP/IP") network, such as the World 
								  Wide Web. Networks like the Web use the TCP/IP protocol to route information 
								  based on the IP address of the destination. In other words, an IP address 
								  is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you 
								  are surfing the web, allowing web servers to locate and identify your computer. 
								  Computers require IP addresses in order for users to communicate on the 
								  Internet, browse and shop.

								  may use action tags to count the number of times that visitors click on 
								  a particular page section or visit the pages of our site. Without collecting 
								  any personally identifiable information, they use that data to tell us which 
								  are the most effective sections of our sites. <br>
								<br>
								  Email Distributor's Use of Action Tags: Our third-party email distributor 
								  may use action tags. They may, for example, keep track of when a promotional 
								  email is opened and provide HORIZON HOBBY, INC.'s Online Catalog with ongoing 
								  aggregated reports of how many customers have responded.<br>

								  On occasion, unaffiliated third parties will "frame" HORIZON HOBBY,

								  HOBBY, INC.'s Online Catalog's site. HORIZON HOBBY, INC.'s Online Catalog
