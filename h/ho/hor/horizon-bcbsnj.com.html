<p><b class="blue">NOTICE OF INFORMATION PRIVACY PRACTICES</b></p>

<p><b class="blue">THIS NOTICE DESCRIBES HOW MEDICAL INFORMATION ABOUT YOU MAY BE USED AND DISCLOSED AND HOW YOU CAN GET ACCESS TO THIS INFORMATION.  PLEASE REVIEW IT CAREFULLY.</b></p>

<p><b class="blue">To Our Customers and
Potential Customers:</b></p>

<p>
Horizon Blue Cross Blue Shield of
New Jersey and its affiliated companies* want you to know that we recognize 
our obligation to keep information 
about you secure and confidential. 
Unlike many other financial and health institutions, we do not
sell information about you and we do not
share your information except to conduct
our business — <i>Making
Healthcare Work</i><sup style="font-size:8pt;">SM</sup> for you.</p>

<p>As required by law, we publish this Notice
to explain the information that we collect
and how we maintain, use and disclose it in
administering your benefits. We will abide
by the statements made in this Notice.
<i>Except as permitted by law and as
explained in this Notice, we do not disclose
any information about our past, present or
future customers to anyone</i>. When we use
the term "Customer Information," we are
referring to financial or health information
that is "nonpublic," including any
information from which a judgment could
possibly be made about you. When we use
the term "Protected Health Information" or
"PHI," we are referring to individually
identifiable oral, written and electronic
information concerning the provision of, or
payment for, health care to you. We refer
to Customer Information and PHI
collectively as "Private Information."</p>

<p><i><b class="blue">Members of self-funded plans</b></i><br>
If you are a participant or beneficiary of a
self-funded group health plan, we may use
and disclose your Private Information as
described in this Notice. However, our use or
disclosure is dictated by an arrangement with
your employer (or other sponsor of your benefits
plan) or that plan itself. That plan may use and
disclose your Private Information differently than
is described here. With respect to your
individual rights, you should ask your plan
administrator how to exercise those rights,
along with any other question you may have
regarding your plan’s privacy policies and
practices.</p>

<p><i><b class="blue">What information do we collect?</b></i><br>
In providing your health coverage, we
collect Customer Information and PHI from
the following sources:
<i></i></p><ul><i>
<li>Information we receive from you or your
policyholder on applications, other forms or
Web sites we sponsor.
</li><li>Information we obtain from your
transactions with us, our affiliates or others,
such as health care providers;
</li><li>Information we receive from consumer
reporting agencies or others, such as
Medicare, state regulators and law
enforcement agencies.
</li></i></ul>
<p></p>

<p><i><b class="blue">How do we protect Private Information?</b></i><br>
Our employees are trained on the need to
maintain your Private Information in the strictest
confidence. They agree to be bound by that
promise of confidentiality and are subject to
disciplinary action if they violate that promise.
We also maintain appropriate administrative,
technical and physical safeguards to reasonably
protect your Private Information. Finally, in
those situations where we rely on a third party
to perform business, professional or insurance
services or functions for us, that third party must
agree to safeguard your Private Information. That
business associate must also agree to use
it only as required to perform its functions
for us and as otherwise permitted by our
contract and the law. In these ways, we
carry out our confidentiality commitments
to you.</p>

<p><i><b class="blue">When must we seek your
authorization before disclosing
Private Information?</b></i><br>
There may be circumstances where we
will seek your authorization before making
a disclosure of your Private Information.
This is to ensure that we have your
permission to make that disclosure. For
example, you may have asked someone
who is not your personal representative (or
the policyholder) to contact us on your
behalf to obtain information about your
claims. Before we disclose your Private
Information to that person, we would seek
your authorization to do so, unless
otherwise permitted or described in this
Notice.</p>

<p>If you give us your authorization, you are
permitted to revoke that authorization at any
time in writing. We will honor your
revocation once it is processed, except to
the extent that we have taken action in
reliance upon your original authorization.</p>

<p><i><b class="blue">Uses and disclosures of Private
Information that do not require
authorization</b></i><br>
Most of our routine use and disclosure of
your Private Information occurs in
administering your coverage. In those
instances, we are not required to seek
your authorization. For instance, we are
generally permitted to make disclosures of
your Private Information without
authorization for purposes of treatment,
payment and health care operations. In
this Notice, we provide examples of those
routine purposes, although not every use
or disclosure that falls into those
categories is listed.</p>

<p>Please note that we will limit the
disclosure of certain information in
accordance with laws governing the
special nature of the information (e.g.,
HIV/AIDS, substance abuse, genetic
information). Also, where a state permits
minors of a certain age or status to seek
treatment without parental consent,
information that would normally be
provided to our customers may be limited,
if requested and we are informed that
treatment was rendered that way. That is
because we must protect the privacy of that
minor’s information in accordance with
those state laws.</p>

<p>
<table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0">
<tbody><tr><td valign="top"><b class="blue">•</b></td><td>
<i><b class="blue">Payment Activities</b><br>
We routinely use and disclose Private
Information in connection with your
health care coverage, to determine your
eligibility for coverage and benefits, and
to see that the treatment and services you
receive are properly billed and paid. To
do this, we may share Private
Information with health care providers,
their billing agents, insurance
companies, and others. Our payment
activities can also include the use of
Private Information for: risk adjustment,
billing, claims management, collection
activities, utilization review, medical
necessity determinations, drug rebate
contract reporting of drug utilization,
underwriting and other rate-setting
activities. For example, a claim for
medical services rendered to you may
be submitted electronically from a billing
service on behalf of your provider. Our
claims processors will then use your
Private Information to process your
claim. If we need additional information
to process it, we may contact your
provider to obtain that information.
When we do that, we disclose Private
Information to your provider in order to
identify and discuss your claim with him
or her. Your provider then discloses the
needed, additional Private Information
that will enable us to properly process
your claim. In this example, each of
these entities involved — your provider,
his or her billing service and Horizon
BCBSNJ and/or its affiliated companies —
is covered by and must protect and
safeguard your Private Information either
because they are "covered entities" or
"business associates" of covered
entities under the federal privacy
regulations.</i>

<i><b class="blue">Health Care Operations Activities</b><br>
We routinely use and disclose Private
Information to conduct our health care
business, including all the activities that
are defined by federal regulation as
"health care operations." They include,
but are not limited to: case management
and care coordination, utilization review,
quality assessment and improvement,
network provider credentialing,
population-based research to improve
health or reduce health care costs, and
contacting providers and members
with information about treatment
alternatives. For example, we may use
and disclose Private Information to
remind you about the availability or
value of preventive care or of a disease
management program. Other health
care operations activities include
compliance and auditing activities,
evaluating provider performance,
underwriting, formulary development,
information systems management, fraud
and abuse detection (by ourselves or for
other plans or providers), facilitation of
a sale, transfer, merger or consolidation
of all or part of Horizon BCBSNJ and/or
its affiliated companies with another
entity (including due diligence related to
the transaction), customer service and
general business management, among
others.</i>

We may use or disclose your Private
Information for a number of
treatment-related activities. We are
permitted to tell you about possible
treatment options or alternatives, inform
you of health-related benefits or
services, inform you of a relevant
disease management program that may
be of interest to you, and seek your
voluntary participation in such programs
to help improve your health and assist in
the coordination of your overall health
care. For example, our diabetes
disease management business
associate may, after reviewing PHI that
we had provided, determine that you
might suffer from diabetes. You may
then receive a notice that we have
enrolled you in our disease
management program. If you do not
want further contact about, or to
participate in, the program, you only
need to notify us. Our business
associate would then be instructed to
not use or disclose your information
further, which it must follow due to its
contract with us.</i>

purposes. For example, we may
disclose your PHI when disclosure
would facilitate payment for services
under another health plan. In addition,
we are permitted to disclose PHI to
other covered entities so they can
conduct certain of their health care
operations. We may also disclose
it for purposes of their fraud and
abuse detection or compliance. But we
will only disclose PHI to another
covered entity for these purposes if that

<p>You should understand that, except as
permitted or described in this document,
we will not disclose your Private
Information without a written authorization
from you. And except for disclosures of
PHI made directly to you or your personal
representative, for your treatment, or
pursuant to your authorization, the federal
rules require us to use and disclose only
the minimum PHI necessary to accomplish
our purpose. For example, if we need to
disclose your PHI to our utilization review
care manager to help determine the
medical necessity of a particular claim, we
would likely not disclose your entire claim
history and medical record. That is
because your entire record is probably not
necessary to make the determination for
that one claim.</p>
