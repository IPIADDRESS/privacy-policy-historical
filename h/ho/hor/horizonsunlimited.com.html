			 <h2 align="center">Privacy Policy for Horizons Unlimited </h2>
			 <p>Your privacy is important to us. To better protect your privacy we provide this notice explaining our online information practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used. To make this notice easy to find, we make it available on our homepage and at every point where personally identifiable information may be requested.</p>
			 <h4 align="left">What  information do we collect and why</h4>
			 <p align="left"><b>It is our policy</b> to respect the purpose for which 
				our site visitors gave us personal information. The information you provide is used only to fulfill your specific request, unless you give us permission to use it in another manner, for example by opting in to the Ezine/newsletter mailing list. </p>
			 <p align="left">The type of personally identifiable information we collect may include names, e-mail 
				addresses, postal addresses (for mailing HU products only), nationality and type of motorcycle ridden.</p>
			 <p align="left">The purposes for which we collect and use information about individuals 
				include the following: </p>
			 <ul>
				<li>sending the Horizons Unlimited Ezine/newsletter to travellers who ask for it</li>
		    </ul>
			 <ul>
			   <li>obtaining and responding to feedback from travellers</li>
		    </ul>
			 <ul>
				<li>allowing people to share their experiences with fellow travellers 
				 on the HUBB, via forms (e.g. Shipping, Border Crossings) and in the Ezine</li>
			 </ul>
			 <ul>
				<li>administering the HUBB to make it the best possible experience for 
				 the motorcycle travellers' community</li>
			 </ul>
			 <ul>
				<li>contacting travellers about HUBB postings, shipping or border crossing 
				 experiences</li>
			 </ul>
			 <ul>
				<li>sending HU DVDs, t-shirts, mugs or other products to travellers who order them directly from us (for the Achievable Dream DVD series only, we also advise travellers by e-mail as new DVDs become available to order) </li>
		    </ul>
			 <ul>
			   <li>organising Horizons Unlimited Travellers Meetings, including registering 
			     participants (for these events only, we request a mobile phone number 
			     for participants, to use in the unlikely situation that we have to contact 
			     them about changes or cancellations while they are on route to the event)			      </li>
		    </ul>
			 <ul>
				
			   <li>advising travellers about upcoming HU Travellers Meetings in their area</li>
		    </ul>
			 <ul>
			   <li>providing links to websites that we deem of interest to our 
			     readers in our Links  pages or in the Ezine </li>
		    </ul>
			 <h4 align="left">Subscriptions</h4>
			 <p align="left"><b>It is our policy</b> to send the Ezine only to those 
				who request it (that is, opt-in). We remove names immediately upon request 
				through convenient unsubscribe links in every mailing. Every issue of 
				our Ezine clearly explains how to unsubscribe.</p>
			 <h4 align="left">Mailing Lists </h4>
			 <p align="left"><b>It is our policy </b>to not sell, rent, or loan our 
				subscriber lists to third parties for e-mail marketing. Who is a third 
				party? Well, the first party is you, the second party is us, so it's basically 
				anyone who's not you or us. </p>
			 <p align="left">While we sell advertising in our ezine and on the site 
				to other companies, we never allow third parties any use of these subscriber 
				lists.</p>
			 <p align="left">We also do not buy mailing lists from other companies, so the only contact information we  have is from individuals who have contacted us directly (see above). </p>
			 <h4 align="left">Security and Disclosure on the Site</h4>
			 <p align="left"><b>It is our policy</b> to store subscriber and password 
				files with personal information in a secure manner. We store such files 
				in areas not accessible to Web browsers, behind password protection, or 
				off-line.</p>
			 <p align="left">Spammers collect e-mail addresses from html web pages using 
				robots (spambots). We use encoded e-mail addresses that a spambot can't 
				read (but your browser can) throughout the site, and in forms where possible, 
				to protect e-mail addresses from being 'harvested' in this manner.</p>
			 <h5 align="left">Horizons Unlimited Bulletin Board (HUBB)</h5>
			 <p align="left">When you register for the HUBB, we require a valid e-mail address to confirm your registration and to keep spammers
			 	out!   Your e-mail address is ONLY visible to the Administrators (Grant and Susan).  You can optionally enter
			 	information, such as name, nationality, bike, etc. to be viewable by registered users. You can access and update your personal
			 	information in the 'User Options - Profile' section at any time. </p>
			 <p align="left">If someone needs to contact you we provide a Private Messaging system and email system
			 	via the HUBB to send you messages. You can choose, in your User Profile, to allow or disallow either.</p>
			 <p align="left">We strongly recommend NOT putting your e-mail address
			 	in a posting. Why is this important? The HUBB pages are ordinary html 
				web pages, like 99.99% of the web, which means that a spambot can read 
				your e-mail address and "harvest" it, and add you to their list 
				of people to send spam to.  </p>
			 <p align="left"> Submitting information on Forms</p>
			 <p align="left">When you submit shipment information via the Shipping form, 
				you must register and provide us with your e-mail address so we can contact 
				you if necessary about your shipment details. We do not accept anonymous 
				shipment postings (to prevent shipping companies or individuals from posting 
				advertisements under the guise of shipment details), and your full name 
				will be included in the shipment posting, but your e-mail address is not 
				disclosed unless YOU put it into the details of the shipment. We recommend 
				you NOT do this, for the reasons above.</p>
			 <p align="left">This is for YOUR protection. Your security and privacy 
				is important to us, and we do all we can to ensure it.</p>
			 <h4 align="left">Cookies</h4>
			 <p align="left"><b>It is our policy</b> to use cookies in a responsible
			   manner to help our visitors, not snoop on them. 'Cookies' are

			 <p align="left">We send a 'session cookie' to your computer if and when 
			   you log in to enter or edit your shipments or travellers details by entering 
			   your e-mail address and password. These cookies allow us to recognize 
			   you if you use multiple pages in our site during the same session, so 
			   that you don't need to re-enter your password multiple times. Once you 
			   log out or close your browser, these session cookies expire and no longer 
			   have any effect.</p>
			 <p align="left"> Please note that when you are finished, if you are on 
			   a shared computer, in an internet cafe etc, for your security you should 
			   always logout of ANY system you are logged into, be it here, or Hotmail 
			   / Yahoo etc. Also, you should close all browser windows, delete temporary 
			   files and the history of sites visited.</p>
			 <p align="left">At your option (when you register for the HUBB), we also
			   use longer-lasting cookies on the HUBB bulletin board to
			   allow the software to  recognize you as a HUBB user if you
			   return	to the HUBB using the same computer and browser. </p>
			 <p align="left">We do NOT collect or use information from cookies to develop
			   a profile about our visitors or shoppers. </p>

Be very aware when riding the major roads in these countries, as cars and especially trucks and touringcars don't mind a biker.
touringcars will overtake even when you are approching, they only flash their lights for you to go into the side of the road or desolve into nothing.
And passing in blindcorners or up hill is rather standard.
Be extremely carefull on the road from Puno to Arequipa (Peru) at the part of Jura, near the cement factory. 
It is kow to have a high death toll.
For me my journey ended here after a fatal collision with a truck.
Bike is total loss I was extremely lucky to get away with minor injuries.

From Turkey we plan to cross the top of Africa, i.e. Syria to Algeria and cross into Spain, where we will rest for a couple of weeks before a mad dash back through Spain &amp;amp; France in time for Christmas.
 
We plan to spend some time in Roumania and Bulgaria on the way out, some time in Kyrgyzstan, probably on the way out (which looks amazing) and of course Mongolia. We will be taking bikes and walking boots and we will be using both as much as we can.
 
If there is anyone planning something similar, or planning to cross the top of Africa towards the end of the year it would be good to hear from you, with a view to possibly hooking up to cross some of the more remote parts of the route and share a guide where appropriate (e.g. Libia).
 
Has anyone obtained a visa to cross Iran recently? Or a multiple entry visa for Russia? I have read that you now have to have been to Russia on a single entry visa before they will issues a multiple entry one?

As far as I can work out, in Egypt the maximum import tax is about 240%. I believe a Swedish Carnet reflects this at 235%. In the UK it is 800%.... FFS why ?

As for the other expensive countries, namely:  Iran,Pakistan, India, Bangladesh and Nepal, which are charged at 500% by the RAC, I have done some research into their import duty rates. The results I have come up with are as follows. (The justification and references are at the bottom).
Iran, 100%
Pakistan, 120%
India,  102%
Bangladesh, 87%
Nepal, 94%.

Now I understand, in the event of a claim, there will be a lot of inflated fees to be paid, but how the extra 400% can be justified is beyond me.

It's nice if you can afford to tie up a large chunk of money at the bank and then still afford to actually travel but in reality, it boils down to insurance, namely Lloyds of London through R.L. Davidson (who also indemnify the ADAC in Germany). 
On top of that is a clause that in the event of a claim, they will of course pay out, but Lloyds are fully entitled to claim back their losses from guess who....  

This is what they say....
http://media.rac.co.uk/pdf/rac-private-prop.pdf
3. It must be clearly understood that this insurance guarantee, if taken up, does not relieve you of paying duty should the necessity arise. Lloyd’s Underwriters are entitled under the Indemnity to recover from you the amount paid. Our Guarantee merely enables you to take the vehicle out of Great Britain without having to freeze a lump sum in this country.

Makes you wonder what insurance realy is.

So why is it so expensive - the multiplier that is ?
In Germany a carnet for a ϵ15,000 bike (£12,800) for Egypt is ϵ3000
In the UK it is, for a £12,800 bike, 12k x 8 = £102.4k x 10% = £10,240 of which you get back £5,120 (ϵ6,000) if no claim is made.
Basically 4 times as much up front and 2 times as much when finished satisfactorily.

The Germans will take you to court for any losses they incur. The Brits (Davidsons) will take your money (as they are an insurance company ) then let Lloyds make their claim to you to recover their losses.

Is it worth it ?????   or are we better of winging it with the exception of countries that will not let you in at all without a carnet, Kenya for example. As can be seen below many will allow entry at a fraction of the cost.
Nepal for example will allow motorcycles in without a carnet for 100 Nepalese Rupees per day, about £0.90 per day for up to 30 days, thereafter £4.50 per day, wheras a carnet will allow up to 6 months in a year.

Extorionate madness. Is someone in the upper echelon of the RAC married to a director of Davidsons or Lloyds.

This BTW is in no way meant criticize Paul Gowan at the RAC in any way as I understand from many posts that he is an extremely helpful guy but he does not set the rates.

Feel free to comment, I realy would love to be completely wrong...

This is the best I can find for the various countries, some from government customs sites, some not. References and relevant data.

 Iran – 100%
  Ref     Automotive industry in Iran - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
  IMPORTS
  Car imports have risen, from $184 million in 2002 to $1.5 billion in 2007. In 2006, the government lowered the automotive import tariff levels to 90 percent for light weight vehicles and since then a huge influx of imported vehicles has been witnessed in the country. The tariff level for import of heavy vehicles is even lower at 20 percent, due to low levels of local production and high demand.
  Indicative listing of import tariff rates in 2006 Item Tariff rate chemical products 10% ordinary metals 10% measurement instruments 10% medical equipment 10% food industry 15% mining raw production 15% leather industry 15% paper and wood fabrics 15% mechanical machinery 15% agricultural raw production 25% electric machinery 25% automotive vehicles 100%
  Pakistan – 120%
  Ref:   http://www.mofa.gov.pk/Downloads/ImportofVehicles.pdf
  This is for normal new imports. It is not possible for foreign nationals to improt used.
  Assessed value is typically 140% of actual value as they include all shipping charges etc as part of the cost.
  Say vehicle value of 1200 cc bike = £10,000 X 140% = £14000
  Add duty   £14,000 x 60% =                                               £8,400
  Add Sales tax   (£14,000 + £8,400) x15% =                     £3,360
  Add Income tax (£14,000 + £8,400 + £3,360) x 0.05% =    £13
  Add federal duty tax (£14,000 + £8,400) x 1% =               £224
  Total taxes for a £10,000 bike =                                     £11,997  or 120% of original value

If so, I'd like to join the ride. 

I'm an experienced moto traveler (Western Canada, US, Alaska, Mexico &amp;amp; Central America). I usually ride solo, but I live in the north and I know that traveling solo to Prudhoe is not a good idea given the sparse population, rough roads and unpredictable, possibly extreme, weather conditions along the way.

Sooo, if you're making plans to go to Prudhoe this summer and wouldn't mind a riding partner, please contact me at: tsiyah@hotmail.com. You can also read about my travels so far at: Lowerider: Life's a Journey...Enjoy the Ride. :mchappy:">Alaska July-August ...</a>
