	    <p>(Last updated March 9, 2006)</p>
	    <p>Thank you for your interest in Honeyfund.com (referred to herein as "we" or "us") and our website, <a href="/">www.honeyfund.com</a> (the "Site"). This privacy policy was created to let you know why we collect information from you and what we do with it. By using the Site, you consent to the following terms.</p>
	    <p>This statement discloses the privacy practices for Honeyfund.com. It covers:</p>
	    <ol>
	      <li>What personally identifiable information is collected from you through Honeyfund.com</li>
	      <li>How the information is used</li>
	      <li>With whom the information may be shared</li>
	      <li>What choices are available to you regarding collection, use, and distribution of the information</li>
	      <li>How you can correct any inaccuracies in the information</li>
        </ol>
	    <h3>How we collect your information</h3>
	    <h4 class="last"><em>Information collected at registration</em></h4>
	    <p class="first">Honeyfund.com collects personal information when you register with us and when you use Honeyfund services. Honeyfund.com may combine this information about you with information we obtain from business partners or companies. During registration, we require members to give us basic contact information (such as your and your future spouse's first names, last names and e-mail addresses) and demographic information (such as your zip or postal code, and ages). The information requested on the registration form may change from time to time. Although additional demographic information may be requested at the time of registration, only information marked "required" is necessary for registration and utilization of our services.</p>
	    <p>Users who give gifts to Honeyfund.com members are not required to register. However, some information is collected during the "Give a Gift" process, including first and last name and e-mail address. This information is associated with the member's account.</p>
	    <p>We do not accept registrations from persons under the age of 18. Honeyfund services are available only to persons who are 18 years of age and over. If we learn that a user is under the age of 18, we will terminate the account and delete the user's information. Honeyfund.com will not be liable for any content or advertisements viewed by minor children in violation of the terms of this agreement.</p>
	    <h4 class="last"><em>Information collected through use of Honeyfund.com</em></h4>
	    <p class="first">In addition to the  questions you answer when you register for Honeyfund.com membership, 


we collect information necessary to create your honeymoon registry, including but not limited to at least one registry item and a contact person. When you enter this information and publish your honeymoon registry, you agree to make it public and accessible by visitors to Honeyfund.com.</p>
	    <p class="first">Honeyfund.com also collects system information such as IP addresses (in other words, the location of your computer on the Internet) for system administration, troubleshooting, security, and to examine overall traffic trends. (For example, IP addresses help us determine the percentage of people coming from various search engines, such as Google or Yahoo!) This information, in aggregate form, is recorded for administrative purposes. IP addresses may be linked to personal account information for security purposes, for instance, to prevent spammers from abusing Honeyfund.com's e-mail features.</p>
	    <p>Honeyfund.com and its partners use cookies, small data files stored on your computer, to customize portions of our site to your preferences and to analyze traffic trends on our site.  For example, Honeyfund.com uses a cookie to identify you as a Honeyfund.com member and to provide you with access to your personal account. This way, you don't have to login every time you come to Honeyfund.com. If you do not allow your browser to accept cookies, please understand that some of the areas or functionality within our site may be limited.</p>
	    <p>You can browse Honeyfund.com without registering or providing any personal information. However, in order to take advantage of our honeymoon registry service, you are required to provide us with information such as your names, e-mail address, real-world address, wedding date, and roles in the wedding.</p>
	    <h3>What we do with the information we collect</h3>
	    <p>Information we collect from your membership helps us to make your registry available to your guests, improve our content, customize certain pages for you, send promotional information, and update you about Honeyfund.com.</p>
	    <h3>With whom do we share information</h3>
	    <p>Honeyfund.com may use certain third party vendors (e.g., data storage and processing facilities) to assist us in providing our services, and we may transfer your personal information to these parties, subject to similar obligations of confidentiality to those contained in this Privacy Policy. Honeyfund.com also may share names, e-mail and postal addresses, telephone numbers and demographic information with other pre-screened organizations that have specific direct mail product and service offers we think may be of interest to you. We may also disclose information about you as we believe is reasonably necessary to comply with law, regulation or other governmental authority or to prevent harm to yourself of others. Finally, we may disclose your personal information upon a transfer or sale to another entity of all or substantially all of our stock or assets in the line of business that this privacy policy relates or upon any other corporate reorganization.</p>
