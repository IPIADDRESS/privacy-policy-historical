      </div>
      <p align="justify">Last Updated: May 6, 2008</p>
      <p align="justify">Honest E Online, Inc/HonesteOnline.com strives to offer 
        its visitors the many advantages of Internet technology and to provide 
        an interactive and personalized experience. We may use Personally Identifiable 
        Information (your name, e-mail address, street address, telephone number) 
        subject to the terms of this privacy policy. We will never sell, barter, 
        or rent your email address to any unauthorized third party. Period."</p>
      <p align="justify">How we gather information from users</p>
      <p align="justify">How we collect and store information depends on the page 
        you are visiting, the activities in which you elect to participate and 
        the services provided. For example, you may be asked to provide information 
        when you register for access to certain portions of our site or request 
        certain features, such as newsletters or when you make a purchase. You 
        may provide information when you participate in sweepstakes and contests, 
        message boards and chat rooms, and other interactive areas of our site. 
        Like most Web sites, Honest E Online, Inc/HonesteOnline.com also collects 
        information automatically and through the use of electronic tools that 
        may be transparent to our visitors. For example, we may log the name of 
        your Internet Service Provider or use cookie technology to recognize you 
        and hold information from your visit. Among other things, the cookie may 
        store your user name and password, sparing you from having to re-enter 
        that information each time you visit, or may control the number of times 
        you encounter a particular advertisement while visiting our site. As we 
        adopt additional technology, we may also gather information through other 
        means. In certain cases, you can choose not to provide us with information, 
        for example by setting your browser to refuse to accept cookies, but if 
        you do you may be unable to access certain portions of the site or may 
        be asked to re-enter your user name and password, and we may not be able 
        to customize the siteâ€™s features according to your preferences.</p>
      <p align="justify">What we do with the information we collect</p>
      <p align="justify">Like other Web publishers, we collect information to 
        enhance your visit and deliver more individualized content and advertising. 
        We respect your privacy and do not share your information with anyone.</p>
      <p align="justify">Aggregated Information (information that does not personally 
        identify you) may be used in many ways. For example, we may combine information 
        about your usage patterns with similar information obtained from other 
        users to help enhance our site and services (e.g., to learn which pages 
        are visited most or what features are most attractive). Aggregated Information 
        may occasionally be shared with our advertisers and business partners. 
        Again, this information does not include any Personally Identifiable Information 
        about you or allow anyone to identify you individually.</p>
      <p align="justify">We may use Personally Identifiable Information collected 
        on Honest E Online, Inc/HonesteOnline.com to communicate with you about 
        your registration and customization preferences; our Terms of Service 
        and privacy policy; services and products offered by Honest E Online, 
        Inc/HonesteOnline.com and other topics we think you might find of interest. 
      </p>
      <p align="justify">Personally Identifiable Information collected by Honest 
        E Online, Inc/HonesteOnline.com may also be used for other purposes, including 
        but not limited to site administration, troubleshooting, processing of 
        e-commerce transactions, administration of sweepstakes and contests, and 
        other communications with you. Certain third parties who provide technical 
        support for the operation of our site (our Web hosting service for example) 
        may access such information. We will use your information only as permitted 
        by law. In addition, from time to time as we continue to develop our business, 
        we may sell, buy, merge or partner with other companies or businesses. 
        In such transactions, user information may be among the transferred assets. 
        We may also disclose your information in response to a court order, at 
        other times when we believe we are reasonably required to do so by law, 
        in connection with the collection of amounts you may owe to us, and/or 
        to law enforcement authorities whenever we deem it appropriate or necessary. 
        Please note we may not provide you with notice prior to disclosure in 
        such cases.</p>
      <p align="justify">Affiliated sites, linked sites and advertisements</p>
      <p align="justify">Honest E Online, Inc/HonesteOnline.com expects its partners, 
        advertisers and affiliates to respect the privacy of our users. Be aware, 
        however, that third parties, including our partners, advertisers, affiliates 
        and other content providers accessible through our site, may have their 
        own privacy and data collection policies and practices. For example, during 
        your visit to our site you may link to, or view as part of a frame on 
        a Honest E Online, Inc/HonesteOnline.com page, certain content that is 
        actually created or hosted by a third party. Also, through Honest E Online, 
        Inc/HonesteOnline.com you may be introduced to, or be able to access,

        or other third parties may use cookies or other technology to attempt 
        to identify some of your preferences or retrieve information about you. 
        For example, some of our advertising is served by third parties and may 
        include cookies that enable the advertiser to determine whether you have 
        seen a particular advertisement before. Other features available on our 
        site may offer services operated by third parties and may use cookies 
        or other technology to gather information. Honest E Online, Inc/HonesteOnline.com

        information, and is not responsible for any actions or policies of such 
        third parties.</p>
      <p align="justify">You should also be aware that if you voluntarily disclose 
        Personally Identifiable Information on message boards or in chat areas, 
        that information can be viewed publicly and can be collected and used 
        by third parties without our knowledge and may result in unsolicited messages 
        from other individuals or third parties. Such activities are beyond the 
        control of Honest E Online, Inc/HonesteOnline.com and this policy.</p>
