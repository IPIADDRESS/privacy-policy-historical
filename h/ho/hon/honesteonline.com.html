<p>Honest E Online, Inc/HonesteOnline.com strives to offer its
  visitors the many advantages of Internet technology and to provide an
  interactive and personalized experience. We may use Personally
  Identifiable Information (your name, e-mail address, street address,
  telephone number) subject to the terms of this privacy policy. We will
  never sell, barter, or rent your email address to any unauthorized
  third party. Period.</p>
<p>How we gather information from users</p>
<p>How we collect and store information depends on the page you
  are visiting, the activities in which you elect to participate and the
  services provided. For example, you may be asked to provide information
  when you register for access to certain portions of our site or request
  certain features, such as newsletters or when you make a purchase. You
  may provide information when you participate in sweepstakes and
  contests, message boards and chat rooms, and other interactive areas of
  our site. Like most Web sites, Honest E Online, Inc/HonesteOnline.com
  also collects information automatically and through the use of
  electronic tools that may be transparent to our visitors. For example,
  we may log the name of your Internet Service Provider or use cookie
  technology to recognize you and hold information from your visit. Among
  other things, the cookie may store your user name and password, sparing
  you from having to re-enter that information each time you visit, or
  may control the number of times you encounter a particular
  advertisement while visiting our site. As we adopt additional
  technology, we may also gather information through other means. In
  certain cases, you can choose not to provide us with information, for
  example by setting your browser to refuse to accept cookies, but if you
  do you may be unable to access certain portions of the site or may be
  asked to re-enter your user name and password, and we may not be able
  to customize the siteâ€™s features according to your preferences.</p>
<p>What we do with the information we collect</p>
<p>Like other Web publishers, we collect information to enhance
  your visit and deliver more individualized content and advertising. We
  respect your privacy and do not share your information with anyone.</p>
<p>Aggregated Information (information that does not personally
  identify you) may be used in many ways. For example, we may combine
  information about your usage patterns with similar information obtained
  from other users to help enhance our site and services (e.g., to learn
  which pages are visited most or what features are most attractive).
  Aggregated Information may occasionally be shared with our advertisers
  and business partners. Again, this information does not include any
  Personally Identifiable Information about you or allow anyone to
  identify you individually.</p>
<p>We may use Personally Identifiable Information collected on
  Honest E Online, Inc/HonesteOnline.com to communicate with you about
  your registration and customization preferences; our Terms of Service
  and privacy policy; services and products offered by Honest E Online,
  Inc/HonesteOnline.com and other topics we think you might find of
  interest. </p>
<p>Personally Identifiable Information collected by Honest E
  Online, Inc/HonesteOnline.com may also be used for other purposes,
  including but not limited to site administration, troubleshooting,
  processing of e-commerce transactions, administration of sweepstakes
  and contests, and other communications with you. Certain third parties
  who provide technical support for the operation of our site (our Web
  hosting service for example) may access such information. We will use
  your information only as permitted by law. In addition, from time to
  time as we continue to develop our business, we may sell, buy, merge or
  partner with other companies or businesses. In such transactions, user
  information may be among the transferred assets. We may also disclose
  your information in response to a court order, at other times when we
  believe we are reasonably required to do so by law, in connection with
  the collection of amounts you may owe to us, and/or to law enforcement
  authorities whenever we deem it appropriate or necessary. Please note
  we may not provide you with notice prior to disclosure in such cases.</p>
<p>Affiliated sites, linked sites and advertisements</p>
<p>Honest E Online, Inc/HonesteOnline.com expects its partners,
  advertisers and affiliates to respect the privacy of our users. Be

  advertisers, affiliates and other content providers accessible through

  or view as part of a frame on a Honest E Online, Inc/HonesteOnline.com
  page, certain content that is actually created or hosted by a third
  party. Also, through Honest E Online, Inc/HonesteOnline.com you may be

  operated by a third party.</p>
<p>While on our site, our advertisers, promotional partners or
  other third parties may use cookies or other technology to attempt to
  identify some of your preferences or retrieve information about you.
  For example, some of our advertising is served by third parties and may
  include cookies that enable the advertiser to determine whether you
  have seen a particular advertisement before. Other features available
  on our site may offer services operated by third parties and may use
  cookies or other technology to gather information. Honest E Online,
  Inc/HonesteOnline.com does not control the use of this technology by
  third parties or the resulting information, and is not responsible for
  any actions or policies of such third parties.</p>
<p>You should also be aware that if you voluntarily disclose
  Personally Identifiable Information on message boards or in chat areas,
  that information can be viewed publicly and can be collected and used
  by third parties without our knowledge and may result in unsolicited
  messages from other individuals or third parties. Such activities are

  policy.</p>
