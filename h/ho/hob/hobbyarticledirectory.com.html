<p>HobbyArticleDirectory.com strives to offer its visitors the many  advantages of Internet technology and to provide an interactive and  personalized experience. We may use Personally Identifiable Information  (your name, e-mail address, street address, telephone number) subject  to the terms of this privacy policy. We will never sell, barter, or  rent your email address to any unauthorized third party. Period.</p>
<p><strong>How we gather information from users</strong></p>
<p>How we collect and store information depends on the page you are  visiting, the activities in which you elect to participate and the  services provided. For example, you may be asked to provide information  when you register for access to certain portions of our site or request  certain features, such as newsletters or when you make a purchase. You  may provide information when you participate in sweepstakes and  contests, message boards and chat rooms, and other interactive areas of  our site. Like most Web sites, HobbyArticleDirectory.com also collects  information automatically and through the use of electronic tools that  may be transparent to our visitors. For example, we may log the name of  your Internet Service Provider or use cookie technology to recognize  you and hold information from your visit. Among other things, the  cookie may store your user name and password, sparing you from having  to re-enter that information each time you visit, or may control the  number of times you encounter a particular advertisement while visiting  our site. As we adopt additional technology, we may also gather  information through other means. In certain cases, you can choose not  to provide us with information, for example by setting your browser to  refuse to accept cookies, but if you do you may be unable to access  certain portions of the site or may be asked to re-enter your user name  and password, and we may not be able to customize the site's features  according to your preferences.</p>
<p><strong>What we do with the information we collect</strong></p>
<p>Like other Web publishers, we collect information to enhance your  visit and deliver more individualized content and advertising. We  respect your privacy and do not share your information with anyone.</p>
<p>Aggregated Information (information that does not personally  identify you) may be used in many ways. For example, we may combine  information about your usage patterns with similar information obtained  from other users to help enhance our site and services (e.g., to learn  which pages are visited most or what features are most attractive).  Aggregated Information may occasionally be shared with our advertisers  and business partners. Again, this information does not include any  Personally Identifiable Information about you or allow anyone to  identify you individually.</p>
<p>We may use Personally Identifiable Information collected on  www.HobbyArticleDirectory.com to communicate with you about your  registration and customization preferences; our Terms of Service and  privacy policy; services and products offered by  www.HobbyArticleDirectory.com and other topics we think you might find of  interest.</p>
<p>Personally Identifiable Information collected by  HobbyArticleDirectory.com may also be used for other purposes, including but  not limited to site administration, troubleshooting, processing of  e-commerce transactions, administration of sweepstakes and contests,  and other communications with you. Certain third parties who provide  technical support for the operation of our site (our Web hosting  service for example) may access such information. We will use your  information only as permitted by law. In addition, from time to time as  we continue to develop our business, we may sell, buy, merge or partner  with other companies or businesses. In such transactions, user  information may be among the transferred assets. We may also disclose  your information in response to a court order, at other times when we  believe we are reasonably required to do so by law, in connection with  the collection of amounts you may owe to us, and/or to law enforcement  authorities whenever we deem it appropriate or necessary. Please note  we may not provide you with notice prior to disclosure in such cases.</p>
<p><strong>Affiliated sites, linked sites and advertisements</strong></p>
<p>HobbyArticleDirectory.com expects its partners, advertisers and  affiliates to respect the privacy of our users. Be aware, however, that  third parties, including our partners, advertisers, affiliates and  other content providers accessible through our site, may have their own  privacy and data collection policies and practices. For example, during  your visit to our site you may link to, or view as part of a frame on a  www.HobbyArticleDirectory.com page, certain content that is actually created  or hosted by a third party. Also, through HobbyArticleDirectory.com you may  be introduced to, or be able to access, information, Web sites,  features, contests or sweepstakes offered by other parties.  HobbyArticleDirectory.com is not responsible for the actions or policies of  such third parties. You should check the applicable privacy policies of  those third parties when providing information on a feature or page  operated by a third party.</p>
<p>While on our site, our advertisers, promotional partners or other  third parties may use cookies or other technology to attempt to  identify some of your preferences or retrieve information about you.  For example, some of our advertising is served by third parties and may  include cookies that enable the advertiser to determine whether you  have seen a particular advertisement before. Other features available  on our site may offer services operated by third parties and may use  cookies or other technology to gather information. HobbyArticleDirectory.com  does not control the use of this technology by third parties or the  resulting information, and is not responsible for any actions or  policies of such third parties.</p>
<p>You should also be aware that if you voluntarily disclose Personally  Identifiable Information on message boards or in chat areas, that  information can be viewed publicly and can be collected and used by  third parties without our knowledge and may result in unsolicited  messages from other individuals or third parties. Such activities are  beyond the control of HobbyArticleDirectory.com and this policy. </p>
<p><strong>Children</strong></p>
<p>HobbyArticleDirectory.com does not knowingly collect or solicit  Personally Identifiable Information from or about children under 13  except as permitted by law. If we discover we have received any  information from a child under 13 in violation of this policy, we will  delete that information immediately. If you believe  HobbyArticleDirectory.com has any information from or about anyone under 13,  please contact us at the address listed below.</p>
<p><strong>Contacting Us</strong></p>

<p><strong>Changes to this Policy</strong></p>
<p>HobbyArticleDirectory.com reserves the right to change this policy at any  time. Please check this page periodically for changes. Your continued  use of our site following the posting of changes to these terms will  mean you accept those changes. Information collected prior to the time  any change is posted will be used according to the rules and laws that  applied at the time the information was collected.</p>
<p><strong>Governing law</strong></p>
<p>This policy and the use of this Site are governed by Utah law. If a  dispute arises under this Policy we agree to first try to resolve it  with the help of a mutually agreed-upon mediator in the following  location: Salt Lake City. Any costs and fees other than attorney fees  associated with the mediation will be shared equally by each of us.</p>
<p>If it proves impossible to arrive at a mutually satisfactory  solution through mediation, we agree to submit the dispute to binding  arbitration at the following location: Salt Lake City, under the rules of the  American Arbitration Association. Judgment upon the award rendered by  the arbitration may be entered in any court with jurisdiction to do so.</p>
<p>This statement and the policies outlined herein are not intended to  and do not create any contractual or other legal rights in or on behalf  of any party.</p>
