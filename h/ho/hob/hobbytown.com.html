Your privacy is important to us. To better protect your privacy, we provide this notice explaining our online information practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used at this site.</p>
 
					<p>You can freely access much of our website without providing any personal information. Certain areas of our website, for example purchasing products, entering contests, filling out surveys, and receiving newsletters, emails or other promotional information from us, require that you submit some personal information. We do not collect any personal information without your knowledge! We use the information that we collect about you to fulfill your product and service purchases and to create a more personalized online experience.</p>
 
					<p>This is just a brief overview, so please read on for more details about our Privacy Policy. This Policy may change from time to time, so please check back periodically.</p>

 					<td id="privacy"><p>In order to better provide you with numerous products and services, HOBBYTOWN USA's websites collects two types of information about its visitors: Personally Identifiable Information and Non-Personally Identifiable Information. Our primary goal in collecting information from you is to provide you with a smooth, efficient, and customized experience while using our site.</p>
					
					<p><strong><font color="#333333">Personally Identifiable Information</font></strong></p>
					
					<p>This refers to information that lets us know the specifics of who you are. Personal information is requested when you order a product, register for a Wish List, enter contests or sweepstakes, fill out surveys, and send us feedback. For example, this information might include your name, billing address, shipping address, telephone number, email address, credit card or other payment information, and product details. With this information, HOBBYTOWN USA's Online Catalog can fill your orders and better provide you with personalized services.</p>
 
					<p>If you visit HOBBYTOWN USA or one of the sites available through a link on our site, they will independently collect, use and share your personal information in accordance with their own privacy policies. If you have questions about their information practices, please read their privacy policies.</p>
					
					<p><strong><font color="#333333">Non-Personally Identifiable Information</font></strong></p>
					
					<p>This refers to information that does not by itself identify a specific individual. We gather certain information about you based upon where you shop on our site in several ways. This information is compiled and analyzed on both a personal and an aggregated basis. For example, this information may include the website's Uniform Resource Locator ("URL") that you just came from, which URL you next go to, what browser you are using, and your Internet Protocol ("IP") address. A URL is the global address of documents and other resources on the World Wide Web. An IP address is an identifier for a computer or device on a Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol ("TCP/IP") network, such as the World Wide Web. Networks like the Web use the TCP/IP protocol to route information based on the IP address of the destination. In other words, an IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you are surfing the web, allowing web servers to locate and identify your computer. Computers require IP addresses in order for users to communicate on the Internet, browse and shop.</p></td>

					<td id="privacy"><p>Our primary goal in collecting personal information is to provide HOBBYTOWN USA's website visitors with a superior customized online experience. We use the customer contact information to fill orders, contact purchasers to inform them of their order status, to send promotional information, to enhance the operation of our site and administer our systems.</p>
 
					<p>We review the actions of the HOBBYTOWN USA's website visitors on an aggregate basis to determine customers' preferences. HOBBYTOWN USA's website also does research on our visitors' demographics, interests, and pages viewed based on the information provided to us during ordering, a promotion, from our server log files, from contests, drawings or surveys. We will use this data to tailor the visitor's experience at our site, to improve our marketing and promotional efforts, to statistically analyze site use, to improve our product offerings, and to customize our site's content, layout, and services.</p>
 
					<p>HOBBYTOWN USA's website also shares your personally identifiable information with HOBBYTOWN USA and third parties who provide services to us, our customers and website visitors. Those third parties include authorized contractors, temporary employees and consultants and other companies working with us (collectively, "agents"). Where we believe it to be appropriate (in our sole discretion), we will ask our agents not to disclose or use your personal information for purposes other than to provide services to you or HOBBYTOWN USA's websites.</p>
 
					<p>Although we take appropriate measures to safeguard against unauthorized disclosures of information, we cannot assure you that personally identifiable information that we collect will never be disclosed in a manner that is inconsistent with this Privacy Notice. Inadvertent disclosures may result, for example, when third parties misrepresent their identities in asking the site for access to personally identifiable information about themselves for purposes of correcting possible factual errors in the data.</p></td>

						<p><strong><font color="#333333">Online Surveys and Polling</font></strong></p>
						
						<p>In order to improve our services to you, we ask some of our customers to voluntarily complete surveys. Individual survey answers are confidential, although Non-Personally Identifiable Information is collected and disclosed to third parties. If you do not wish to participate in a survey, simply decline to participate when asked.</p>
 
						<p><strong><font color="#333333">Contests and Sweepstakes</font></strong></p>

						<p>When you enter a contest or other promotion, we may ask you for contact information such as your name, address and email address in order to administer the contest, to send you promotional emails, notify winners and make the winners' list publicly available pursuant to certain states' laws. Your consent to such promotional use and disclosure of this information is a condition of your participation. As a condition of receiving any prize, you will be required to submit an Affidavit of Eligibility, for us to ensure that you are eligible to receive the prize according to the Contest Rules.</p>
 
						<p><strong><font color="#333333">Newsletters &amp; Promotional Emails</font></strong></p>

						<p>We offer free newsletters and promotional emails as a service to our customers. We will send you newsletters and emails periodically listing current specials and deals. To stop receiving our newsletter, send an email to us at marketing@hobbytown.com.</p>
 
						<p><strong><font color="#333333">Contact Information and Third Party Data</font></strong></p>

If you report a problem with our site, we may collect such information in a file specific to you. If you contact us through our feedback area or by calling one of our customer service representatives, we may ask for your name, email address and order information in order to send you a reply.

						<p><strong><font color="#333333">Cookies</font></strong></p>

						<p>HOBBYTOWN USA's website may use cookies from time to time. Cookies are small text files a website can use to recognize a repeat visitor to the website. We use cookies for various reasons. Cookies enable us to provide you with a better experience by allowing us to understand what areas of this Site are of interest to our members. These cookies do not track individual information. Cookies from HOBBYTOWN USA's website can only be read by HOBBYTOWN USA's websites. If you do not want HOBBYTOWN USA's website to deploy cookies in your browser, you can set your browser to reject cookies or to notify you when a website tries to put a cookie in your browser software. If you choose to disable cookies in your browser, you can still access most of this Site, however, your ability to use some of the products and/or services, including the shopping cart, at this Site may be affected.</p>
 
						<p><strong><font color="#333333">Action Tags</font></strong></p>
						
						<p>We may use action tags in the operation of our site. An action tag is a method used to track responses or actions by customers who view certain information on our site. Action tags are images embedded in a website page that are used to transparently collect information. Our content servers may use action tags to count the number of times that visitors click on a particular page section or visit the pages of our site. Without collecting any personally identifiable information, they use that data to tell us which are the most effective sections of our sites.</p>
 
						<p>Email Distributor's Use of Action Tags: Our third-party email distributor may use action tags. They may, for example, keep track of when a promotional email is opened and provide HOBBYTOWN USA's Online Catalog with ongoing aggregated reports of how many customers have responded.</p>
 
						<p>On occasion, unaffiliated third parties will "frame" HOBBYTOWN USA's website site in an effort to collect customer information. To ensure your privacy, make sure that your order originates from HOBBYTOWN USA's website. HOBBYTOWN USA's website is not in any manner responsible in the event that you do disclose information to an unaffiliated framing site.</p></td>

We will disclose your Personally Identifiable Information to HOBBYTOWN USA. Additionally we will disclose your Personally Identifiable Information to third parties to charge your credit card, fill your order, deliver your order, provide customer service, provide you with credit and deliver promotional emails to you from HOBBYTOWN USA's website. For example, we must release your credit card information to the card-issuing bank to confirm payment; and release your address and telephone information to the delivery service to deliver products that you ordered.</p>
 
					<p><em>Other Parties:</em> We do not sell, trade, or rent your Personally Identifiable Information to others without your consent. We may provide Non-Personally Identifiable Information about our customers' sales, traffic patterns, and related site information to third parties, but these statistics do not include any Personally Identifiable Information. We may release account information when we believe that such release is reasonably necessary to enforce or apply our Terms and Conditions or to protect the rights, property, and safety of HOBBYTOWN USA's website, our users, or others. If customers do not pay us for products ordered, we may submit their account information to a third party collection agency.</p>
 
					<p><em>Compliance with Service of Process or Law Enforcement:</em> Occasionally HOBBYTOWN USA's website may be asked by law enforcement or judicial authorities to provide Personally Identifiable Information to the appropriate governmental authorities.
