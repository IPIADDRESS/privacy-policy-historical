            out surveys, and receiving newsletters, emails or other promotional information
            from us, require that you submit some personal information. We do not collect any
            personal information without your knowledge! We use the information that we collect

            What information does the HobbyTown USA® site collect from you? In order to better
            provide you with numerous products and services, the HobbyTown USA® site collects
            two types of information about its visitors: Personally Identifiable Information
            and Non-Personally Identifiable Information. Our primary goal in collecting information
            from you is to provide you with a smooth, efficient, and customized experience while
            using our site.
        </p>
        <p class="size12">
            <strong>Personally Identifiable Information</strong>
        </p>
        <p class="size12">
            This refers to information that lets us know the specifics of who you are. Personal
            information is requested when you order a product, register for a Wish List, enter
            contests or sweepstakes, fill out surveys, and send us feedback. For example, this
            information might include your name, billing address, shipping address, telephone
            number, email address, credit card or other payment information, and product details.
            With this information, USA® can fill your orders and better provide you with personalized
            services.
        </p>
        <p class="size12">
            If you visit HobbyTown USA® or one of the site available through a link on our site,
            they will independently collect, use and share your personal information in accordance
            with their own privacy policies. If you have questions about their information practices,
            please read their privacy policies.
        </p>
        <p class="size12">
            <strong>Non-Personally Identifiable Information</strong>
        </p>
        <p class="size12">
            This refers to information that does not by itself identify a specific individual.
            We gather certain information about you based upon where you shop on our site in
            several ways. This information is compiled and analyzed on both a personal and an
            aggregated basis. For example, this information may include the site's Uniform Resource
            Locator ("URL") that you just came from, which URL you next go to, what browser
            you are using, and your Internet Protocol ("IP") address. A URL is the global address
            of documents and other resources on the World Wide Web. An IP address is an identifier
            for a computer or device on a Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol ("TCP/IP")
            network, such as the World Wide Web. Networks like the Web use the TCP/IP protocol
            to route information based on the IP address of the destination. In other words,
            an IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever
            you are surfing the web, allowing web servers to locate and identify your computer.
            Computers require IP addresses in order for users to communicate on the Internet,
            browse and shop.
        </p>
        <p class="size12">
            Where do we collect information from you and how do we use it? Our primary goal
            in collecting personal information is to provide our site visitors with a superior
            customized online experience. We use the customer contact information to fill orders,
            contact purchasers to inform them of their order status, to send promotional information,
            to enhance the operation of our site and administer our systems.
        </p>
        <p class="size12">
            We review the actions of the site visitors on an aggregate basis to determine customers'
            preferences. The HobbyTown USA® site also does research on our visitors' demographics,
            interests, and pages viewed based on the information provided to us during ordering,
            a promotion, from our server log files, from contests, drawings or surveys. We will
            use this data to tailor the visitor's experience at our site, to improve our marketing
            and promotional efforts, to statistically analyze site use, to improve our product
            offerings, and to customize our site's content, layout, and services.
        </p>
        <p class="size12">
            Our site also shares your personally identifiable information with HobbyTown USA®
            and third parties who provide services to us, our customers and site visitors. Those
            third parties include authorized contractors, temporary employees and consultants
            and other companies working with us (collectively, "agents"). Where we believe it
            to be appropriate (in our sole discretion), we will ask our agents not to disclose
            or use your personal information for purposes other than to provide services to
            you or the HobbyTown USA® site.
        </p>
        <p class="size12">
            Although we take appropriate measures to safeguard against unauthorized disclosures
            of information, we cannot assure you that personally identifiable information that
            we collect will never be disclosed in a manner that is inconsistent with this Privacy
            Notice. Inadvertent disclosures may result, for example, when third parties misrepresent
            their identities in asking the site for access to personally identifiable information
            about themselves for purposes of correcting possible factual errors in the data.
        </p>

            USA®, and to monitor the level of activity on our site. We collect information from
            visitors to our site regarding the URLs they came from, domain types (e.g., .com
            or .org), their IP addresses, the date and time of their visit or order, the number

            any search terms entered on our site.

            you will have the opportunity to review the product order form and make changes

        <p class="size12">
            In order to improve our services to you, we ask some of our customers to voluntarily
            complete surveys. Individual survey answers are confidential, although Non-Personally
            Identifiable Information is collected and disclosed to third parties. If you do
            not wish to participate in a survey, simply decline to participate when asked.

            to send you promotional emails, notify winners and make the winners' list publicly

            and disclosure of this information is a condition of your participation. As a condition

        <p class="size12">
            The HobbyTown USA® site may use cookies from time to time. Cookies are small text
            files a site can use to recognize a repeat visitor to the site. We use cookies for
            various reasons. Cookies enable us to provide you with a better experience by allowing
            us to understand what areas of this Site are of interest to our members. These cookies
            do not track individual information. Cookies from the HobbyTown USA® site can only
            be read by our site. If you do not want the HobbyTown USA® site to deploy cookies
            in your browser, you can set your browser to reject cookies or to notify you when
            a site tries to put a cookie in your browser software. If you choose to disable
            cookies in your browser, you can still access most of this Site, however, your ability

            <strong>Action Tags</strong>
        </p>
        <p class="size12">
            We may use action tags in the operation of our site. An action tag is a method used
            to track responses or actions by customers who view certain information on our site.
            Action tags are images embedded in a site page that are used to transparently collect
            information. Our content servers may use action tags to count the number of times
            that visitors click on a particular page section or visit the pages of our site.
            Without collecting any personally identifiable information, they use that data to
            tell us which are the most effective sections of our site.
        </p>
        <p class="size12">
            Email Distributor's Use of Action Tags: Our third-party email distributor may use
            action tags. They may, for example, keep track of when a promotional email is opened
            and provide the HobbyTown USA® with ongoing aggregated reports of how many customers
            have responded.
        </p>
        <p class="size12">
            On occasion, unaffiliated third parties will "frame" the HobbyTown USA® site in
            an effort to collect customer information. To ensure your privacy, make sure that
            your order originates from our site. The HobbyTown USA® site is not in any manner
            responsible in the event that you do disclose information to an unaffiliated framing
            site.
        </p>
        <p class="size12">
            With whom do we share your information? Fulfillment: The information collected by
            the HobbyTown USA® site is used for processing orders, keeping you informed about
            your order status, for statistical purposes, for improving our site and its performance,
            and to notify you of products or special offers that may be of interest to you.
            We will disclose your Personally Identifiable Information to HobbyTown USA®. Additionally
            we will disclose your Personally Identifiable Information to third parties to charge
            your credit card, fill your order, deliver your order, provide customer service,
            provide you with credit and deliver promotional emails to you from our site. For
            example, we must release your credit card information to the card-issuing bank to
            confirm payment; and release your address and telephone information to the delivery
            service to deliver products that you ordered.
        </p>
        <p class="size12">
            Other Parties: We do not sell, trade, or rent your Personally Identifiable Information
            to others without your consent. We may provide Non-Personally Identifiable Information
            about our customers' sales, traffic patterns, and related site information to third
            parties, but these statistics do not include any Personally Identifiable Information.
            We may release account information when we believe that such release is reasonably
            necessary to enforce or apply our Terms and Conditions or to protect the rights,
            property, and safety of HobbyTown USA's site, our users, or others. If customers
            do not pay us for products ordered, we may submit their account information to a
            third party collection agency.
        </p>
        <p class="size12">
            Compliance with Service of Process or Law Enforcement: Occasionally our site may
            be asked by law enforcement or judicial authorities to provide Personally Identifiable
            Information to the appropriate governmental authorities. We will disclose Personally
            Identifiable Information upon receipt of a court order, subpoena, or to cooperate
            with a law enforcement investigation, without prior notice to you. The HobbyTown
            USA® site fully cooperates with law enforcement agencies in identifying those who
            use our services for illegal activities. We reserve the right to report to law enforcement
            agencies any activities that we in good faith believe to be unlawful.
        </p>
        <p class="size12">
            How can you update or correct your Personally Identifiable Information? We believe
            you should have the ability to access and edit the personal information that you
            have provided to us. During the online ordering process you can review, change,
            or delete the information that you have submitted. You may change any of your personal
            information in your account online at any time. We encourage you to promptly update
            your information if it changes. You may ask to have the information on your account
            deleted or removed; however, because we keep track of past purchases, you cannot
            delete information associated with past purchases. Also, as a security measure we
            "back up" the data stored on our systems, and such prior information cannot be completely
            removed from our databases. As a result, you should not expect that all of your
            Personally Identifiable Information will be completely removed from our backed-up
            databases.

        <p class="size12">
            What are your choices regarding collection, use, and distribution of your information?
            Email: We may from time to time send you email or other communications regarding
            current promotions, specials and new additions to the site. You may "opt-out," or
            unsubscribe from our newsletters by following the unsubscribe instructions in any
            email you receive from us, or by sending an email to marketing@HobbyTown.com. After
            doing so, site users will not receive future communications or mailings unless they

            Cookies: You may also set your browser so that it will not accept "cookies" to prevent

            What security precautions are in place to protect against the loss, misuse, or alteration
            of your information? In order to most efficiently serve you, credit card transactions
            and order fulfillment are handled by established third party banking, processing
            agents and distribution institutions. They receive the information needed to verify
            and authorize your credit card or other payment information and to process and ship
            your order.
