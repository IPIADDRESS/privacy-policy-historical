<body><p align="center"><b>Privacy Statement 
	for Hobo
    Series of Websites
    and Newsletters</b></p>
<p></p>
    
    <blockquote>
      <p>Hello,<br>
		Privacy or respect for our visitors is a major priority for
      the Hobo series of websites. Whether just a visitor to a webpage, or submit to a message
      board, or read one of newsletters we take this responsibility serious. </p>
      <p>E-MAIL PRIVACY<br>
      Your e-mail has never been, and never will be available to any third party. <br>
      ( That means nobody )</p>
      <p>E-MAIL PRIVACY ( Ugly and mis-leading tactics...
      Examples of we DO NOT DO)<br>
      I, Andy the Hobo subscribe to lots of newsletters. I am always trying to limit
      the number of extra emails in my box. This is especially important, because I am a
      traveler, and work out of Internet Cafes. Extra emails take up time and can be annoying. I
      am not a big proponent of the crazy anti-spam attackers. I think hitting the delete button
      is pretty easy, and some folks out there are going overboard in their McCarthyism or
      Gestapo Techniques. I think this needs to end. But.... the problem has become more
      complicated, and LARGE WEBSITES LIKE MINE are not becoming a BIG
      PROBLEM. The large websites learn ways around the rules and are becoming the
      biggest spammers of them all. Knowledge is power in a sense, and the misuse of this
      knowledge and power is misguide and sometimes dangerous. So I am going to explain some
      ways that unethical sites collect your email, and then send advertisements to you </p>
      <p>BUSINESS PRACTICES.</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>PROBLEM: <br>
        Making it impossible to unsubscribe because there is not explanation in newsletter on how
        to unsubscribe.</p>
        <p>HOBO SOLUTION:<br>
        Easy ways to unsubscribe:<br>
        Link at the bottom of ALL newsletters to unsubscribe.</p>
        <p>PROBLEM: <br>
        Send you to a page of newsletters. But there is lots and lots of newsletters, and there is
        no way to remember, or understand which is the newsletter you need desire to leave.</p>
        <p>HOBO SOLUTION:<br>
        Easy ways to unsubscribe:<br>
        Link at the bottom of ALL newsletters to unsubscribe.<br>
        All newsletters are treated as separate, not related to or enmeshed in the other.</p>
        <p>PROBLEM: <br>
        No NEWS. You subscribed to newsletter to receive new information and help on the theme or
        subject. You receive a letter with just an advertisement or the announcing a new
        something, that has nothing to do with the topic or the webpage of that is related to the
        newsletter, or associated. This is an ADVERTISEMENT.</p>
        <p>HOBO SOLUTION:<br>
        All newsletters are newsletters with content about the topic</p>
        <p>PROBLEM: <br>
        Infer or pretend they are being only benevolent to the public, and / or non-profit. And
        .org on the end, or portraying themselves as donating money to a good cause.</p>
        <p>HOBO SOLUTION:<br>
        All newsletters are newsletters with content about the topic.<br>
        NOTE: There are ADVERTISEMENTS in our newsletters,<br>
        This is NOT a NON-Profit company. We try to earn money to stay viable.</p>
      </blockquote>
