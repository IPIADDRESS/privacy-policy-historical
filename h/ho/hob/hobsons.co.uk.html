                        3. Passing on Information about You</b><br>
                        <br>
                        We may disclose information obtained from you to third parties to enable us to perform services requested by you, together with aggregate (but not individual) statistics to potential advertisers. Information includes the number of users we have, their typical ages, locations, etc. We will only pass on information about you as an individual (as opposed to aggregate information) to third parties with your prior consent. If you give your consent, third parties may occasionally send communications to you to provide information, offers, and services that may be of interest to you. The more we know about you, the more value we can offer you by way of personalised services. We may store certain personal information and use this to offer you personalised services, information, and offers. Once you have given consent, you can ask us and third parties to stop providing such services to you at any time by e-mailing

                        4. Security</b><br>
                        <br>
                        Keeping information about you secure is very important to us. However, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be totally secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your personal information, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information which you send to us, and you do so at your own risk.<br>
                        <br>
                        Hobsons will take precautions to protect against the loss, misuse, and alteration of your user data. Only authorized employees and subcontractors will be given access to the information you provide us. It is our policy that your data will only be forwarded to organizations such as employers and consumer organizations in accordance with the preferences expressed by you. Apart from this authorized disclosure, our systems are designed to ensure that your data can only be viewed online if your logon ID and password are entered correctly. While we cannot guarantee that loss, misuse, or alteration of data will not occur, we take many precautions aimed at preventing such occurrences.<br>
                        <br>
                        You are ultimately responsible for the security of your logon ID and password. Please take care when using and storing them. We recommend that you do not divulge your password to anyone. You should log out of your browser at the end of each computer session to ensure that others cannot access your personal information, especially if you share a computer with someone else or are using a computer in a public place such as a library or Internet cafe.<br>

                        <br>
                        Assumptions are made about your interests depending on the campaign you respond to. For example, if you registered with Hobsons via our careers in engineering guide, we assume you are interested in a job in engineering. Assumptions are also made about your interests depending on the courses you have studied, and your gender is automatically determined by your title; for example Miss = female.<br>
                        <br>
                        If you provide us with an e-mail address from a university, we assume you are studying at that university unless you provide us with information to the contrary. We assume you speak certain languages based on your nationality. This assumption is very limited, however, and for most nationalities no language assumption is made.<br>
