		<h2 id="collect">What kind of online information does HOB collect? </h2>
		<p>You can visit most pages on our site as a guest, remaining anonymous by not providing information about yourself. Without this information, however, you will not be able to fully access all of the features and functionality of the site. We do collect some limited information about your visit but none of this information is personally identifiable to you.</p>

		<h2 id="howused">How does HOB use and share my information? </h2>
		<p><strong>Personally non-identifiable information.</strong> We collect aggregated, personally non-identifiable information. This information includes: your Internet location (IP address), your Internet entry point (ISP domain name), your software and its configuration used to access this site.</p>
		<p>This data is not linked to your personal information and are used to: diagnose problems with our systems, identify and analyze trends, track user movement (anonymously) through our websites and electronic communications, better administer our online products, and gather broad demographic information. We sometimes share aggregate demographic data with partners and advertisers.</p>
		<p><strong>Personally identifiable information.</strong> We receive and store any personally identifiable information you enter on our Web Site or give us in any other way.   Specifically, we collect: (a) information you provide when registering or making purchases on the Web Site; (b) information you provide to Ticketmaster when purchasing tickets to an HOB event (which is passed along to us); and (c) information about your transactions with HOB.  We use this information to: complete your orders, send prizes to contest winners, send merchandise for online store purchases, contact you when necessary, and send information about our company, including promotional material. Also, we are provided information, including email addresses, from various partners when you enter into transactions on their websites.</p>
		<p><strong>Providing Artists with contact information.</strong> When you purchase tickets to an HOB event, whether from HOB or from Ticketmaster, HOB may share your name, zip code, and  email address, with the artist to allow the artist to contact you to provide you with information related to that Artist, such as upcoming concerts or other events for fans, or to promote goods related to that Artist, such as T-shirts and CDs.  If, before the date of the HOB event for which you have purchased tickets, you request not to receive promotional emails from HOB (see below re: unsubscribing from emails), then we will not pass your contact information on to the Artist or other third parties.</p>
		<p><strong>HOB online orders.</strong> When you make an online purchase from HOB, we use your information to process your order. We will send you emails to confirm your order, and we may need to contact you via phone, postal mail or email if we have other questions. In addition, you will be signed up to receive email updates about HOB upcoming events and offers in your area.  When we first save your information, you will also be automatically signed up to receive email updates. You may opt-out of receiving future electronic mailings by <a href="#unsubscribe">following the instructions outlined below</a>.</p>
		<p><strong>Personalized experience.</strong> In order to deliver information specific to your needs, or to make your experience more convenient, we may use your identifiable information in a variety of ways on our website and in our emails. These methods may include: sending you emails based on the information you provided or presenting you with particular offerings on our website based on your geographic location. When you enter a contest or take some action on our website that requires you to enter personal information, we may also use your personal information to automatically enter data into the required data fields for that contest or action.</p>
		<p><strong>Contests and sweepstakes.</strong> We regularly run co-sponsored contests and giveaways. Participation in these contests is completely voluntary; you have the choice whether or not to disclose information required for contest registration. Information requested may include: contact information (such as name and shipping address), and demographic information (such as zip code, age level). Contact information is used to notify winners and award prizes. Additionally, we sometimes share registration information with our co-sponsors. We are not responsible for the use of such information by these or other parties. By participating in our contests, you agree we may use your information for marketing or promotional purposes.</p>

		<h2 id="secure">How does HOB protect my information and my orders?</h2>
		<p><strong>Data security with online orders.</strong> We use advanced security methods (Secure Socket Layer (SSL) 128-bit encryption) on all pages transmitting private financial information, such as credit card numbers. The SSL protocol ensures that your information is sent directly to HOB and that only HOB can decode it.</p>
		<p><strong>Physical security of equipment storing personally identifiable information.</strong> Access to our computer equipment (servers) storing personally identifiable information is restricted to authorized personnel. These personnel have access to this equipment only for administrative purposes.</p>
		<p><strong>Employee practices regarding security of personally identifiable information.</strong>  Authorized personnel access users' information records for the sole purpose of system maintenance.</p>

		<h2 id="update">How do I view or update my account information?</h2>
		<p>You may <a href="http://store.hob.com/account/?source=HOBPRIVACY">view or update your account</a> information at any time. Once you have signed in, you may view, edit, or delete your account information.</p>

		<h2 id="unsubscribe">How do I opt out / unsubscribe from email communications?</h2>
		<p>You may unsubscribe from our email lists at any time by visiting <a href="http://store.hob.com/support/help/unsubscribe.aspx?source=HOBPRIVACY">http://store.hob.com/support/help/unsubscribe.aspx</a> and entering the email address you used when you created your account. Please allow 2-3 business days for these changes to take effect.  HOB will not transfer your contact information to its marketing partners or to Artists after you have unsubscribed from our email lists.  However, if your contact information was previously shared with such third parties, you may still receive email communications from such third parties, because they are not a part of HOB and therefore are not subject to this privacy policy.  If you do not want to receive email communications from these parties, you should also contact them directly to advise them of your preferences.</p>

		<h2 id="children">How does HOB protect children's privacy?</h2>
		<p>As a general audience site, we do not knowingly collect or use personal information from children under 13 without first obtaining verifiable consent from their parents. If we become aware that an account holder is under 13 and has signed up without prior verifiable parental consent, we will delete his or her account. Please visit the <a href="/resources/inc/apps/redirects/redir.asp?target=http://www.ftc.gov/ogc/coppa1.htm" target="external">Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998</a> (COPPA) website for more information on protecting children's online privacy.</p>

		<h2 id="beacons">How does HOB use cookies and web beacons? </h2>
		<p><strong>Cookies.</strong>  We use cookies — a small amount of data, often containing an anonymous unique identifier, sent from our computers and stored on your computer system. We set cookies on your computer for a number of purposes, including to: ensure you do not see the same ad repeatedly, deliver content specific to your interests, and save your password so you do not have to re-enter it each time you visit our site.</p>
		<p><strong>Web beacons.</strong> During some visits we may use software tools such as JavaScript to measure and collect session information, including page response times, download errors, length of visits to certain pages, page interaction information (such as scrolling, clicks, and mouse-overs), and methods used to browse away from the page. We use this information to help personalize your web expierence and the emails we send you and to improve our products.</p>

		<h2 id="questions">What if I have questions or comments about this policy?</h2>
		<p>We welcome your questions or comments regarding this privacy statement. Please contact us by <a href="/support/customerservice/emailform.asp">email</a> or postal mail at:</p>
