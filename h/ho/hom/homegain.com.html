<!-- BEGIN PRIVACY POLICY -->

HomeGain is committed to protecting the privacy of its users. When you register for HomeGain's online services, the information you provide to us is used only to provide the services you have registered for, to deliver email notifications to you (or people you designate as your recipients), and from time to time, validate your identity. Our data collection policies with regard to current and future services allow you to choose how much information you provide to us, and to control how we use that information. Read below to find out more. 
<br><br>
<b>Our Commitment to You</b>
<br><br>
HomeGain is committed to making your HomeGain experience satisfying and safe. Our data collection policies allow you to choose
how much information you provide to us, and what HomeGain does with the information you supply. HomeGain will keep your 
information within HomeGain unless you consent to our supplying all or a portion of your information to third parties as a 
part of one of the HomeGain service offerings. However, if you tell HomeGain not to send you further emails, this instruction 
may be communicated to third parties who send email on HomeGain's behalf solely to allow us to comply with your instructions. 
HomeGain collects information online to allow you to use our services. Depending on the service you are accessing, you could 
be asked at various times to provide information such as your name, email address, street address, contact phone number or 
other information related to of the property you are seeking to buy or sell, and/or what type of customer you are seeking to 
attract. On other occasions such as when we require payment for HomeGain services, we may request your credit card number to 
conclude the transaction. We request this information to deliver on the services you are requesting, and to allow us to 
provide our strongest value to you - a personalized online experience. Information collected online is often defined as being 
either anonymous or personally identifiable:
<br><br>
1.	<b>Anonymous Information</b> refers to information that cannot be tied back to a specific individual. For instance, we may know that thousands of people have visited this HomeGain Privacy Policy webpage, but we do not necessarily know their names, where they live, or their date of birth. What we collect from transactions such as this constitutes anonymous information. Many of the individuals who access our services decline to use the personalization features that are available to them, and therefore those individuals are anonymous to us and the only data we collect about them is anonymous information. 
<br><br>
2.  <b>Personally Identifiable Information</b> refers to information that tells us specifically who you are, such as your name, email address or phone number. In many cases we need this information to provide the personalized or enhanced service that you have requested. We hope that, like many of our customers, you will find it beneficial to provide Personally Identifiable Information to HomeGain so that we may provide valuable services to you.   Registering with HomeGain will also cause a HomeGain cookie to be issued; this cookie allows HomeGain to "recognize" you when you are on HomeGain site to allow us to personalize our service for you.
<br><br>
<b>Third Party Advertisers.</b>
<br><br>
We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our Web site. These companies serve their ads from their own web sites, independently of HomeGain.  As such, they may use cookies or request personal information from you, or they may share anonymous information about your visit with third parties.
<br><br>
<b>Third Party Cookies</b>
<br><br>
In the course of serving advertisements to this site, our third-party advertiser may place or recognize a unique "cookie" on your browser.
<br><br>
<b>What Personally Identifiable Information of yours is collected by HomeGain</b>
<br><br>
When you register for HomeGain online services, the information you provide to us is used to provide the service for which you have registered.  Depending on the services you have chosen to use, some or all of your Personally Identifiable Information may be used by HomeGain to provide such services, and, solely to service your request or with your consent, certain Personally Identifiable Information may be shared with other parties. For example, if you register to use our Find a REALTOR® service and agree to its terms, some of your information may be shown to real estate agents (e.g., characteristics of the home you wish to sell), but not all of your information if you are a seller (e.g., your email, since this service protects your anonymity).
When registering for HomeGain services, you provide HomeGain with your email address.  We will use your email address to deliver these HomeGain services, such as notifying you of new agent proposals if you registered for our Find a REALTOR® service.  We and our partners may also send you information about other services if you have opted in to receiving such notifications.
<br><br>
<b>HomeGain Cookies</b>
<br><br>
A cookie is a small text file that is stored by your browser that contains information related to a web site. Each web site you visit may store a cookie on your computer that contains information assigned by that web site. Each such cookie can only be read by the web site that created the cookie. 
HomeGain only uses temporary cookies (also known as session cookies) that are not stored on your hard drive - they are discarded when you close your browser. We use this cookie to keep track of your visit to HomeGain so that we can deliver our services to you. This cookie only contains information that you have consented to provide HomeGain, and information generated by HomeGain that is needed to provide our services. This cookie information is not shared with or used by any third party.
<br><br>
<b>Information Distribution</b>
<br><br>
If you are providing us Personally Identifiable Information, it will be used within HomeGain's site to deliver our services. Depending on the service and your preferences provided to HomeGain when registering for these services, your information may be provided to a third party to service your request. HomeGain will not share, rent or sell your information to third parties without your permission. 
HomeGain may be required by law enforcement or judicial authorities to provide Personally Identifiable Information to the appropriate governmental authorities. If requested by law enforcement or judicial authorities, we will provide this information upon receipt of the appropriate documentation.  
<br><br>
<b>EMAIL: What choices are available to you regarding collection, use, and distribution of the information</b>
<br><br>
HomeGain offers you the ability to control the email communications we make to you. It is our intention to give you as much control over our relationship as possible. Registering for a HomeGain service requires that you consent to receive emails about that service from HomeGain.  However, HomeGain gives you the opportunity to unsubscribe to general email communication from us - clear directions for doing so will appear in the email messages we send to you. 
At times, HomeGain may enter into co branding arrangements with other companies, and if so, an opt-in or opt out question may be present to allow email contact from these company's as well. Their opt-in/out features are specific to each organization, but you should not receive email from these organizations unless you have indicated that it is acceptable.  Before consenting to receive email from third parties, you should read their privacy policy and terms of use, if applicable, to make sure you are comfortable dealing with that company.  As you can understand, HomeGain can not make commitments on behalf of other companies.
All email from HomeGain partners who gain your permission to send you commercial email, will include an opportunity to opt out of future communications. HomeGain reserves the right to send a one-time registration confirmation email, and Service Alert messages to its customers to inform them of service changes or issues with the Terms of Use. 
<br><br>
<b>What kind of security procedures are in place to protect against the loss, misuse, or alteration of information under the company's control</b>
<br><br>
HomeGain operates secure data networks protected by industry standard firewall and password protection systems. Our security and privacy policies are periodically reviewed and enhanced as necessary, and only authorized individuals have access to the information provided by our customers. Any particularly sensitive information, such as a customer's credit card number collected for a commerce transaction, is encrypted prior to transmission. You the consumer are ultimately responsible for the security of your HomeGain Member Name and password. Please take care to store your HomeGain Member Name separately from your account password, or better yet, choose a password that you don't need to write down at all. 
<br><br>
<b>How you can correct any inaccuracies in the information</b>
<br><br>
HomeGain believes strongly in providing you with the ability to access and edit the personal information that you have provided to us. To update the information retained about you, please visit our My HomeGain Control Center area.
