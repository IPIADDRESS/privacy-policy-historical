<br><br>
We take appropriate security measures (including physical, electronic and procedural measures) to help safeguard personally identifiable information from unauthorized access and disclosure. Only authorized employees are permitted to access personally identifiable information, and they may do so only for permitted business functions. In addition, we use firewalls to help prevent unauthorized persons from gaining access to personally identifiable information.
<br><br>
Your account is password protected. We use industry standard measures to protect personally identifiable information that is stored in our database. We limit the access to personally identifiable information to those employees and contractors who need access to perform their job function, such as our customer service personnel. If you have any questions about our security measures, please contact us. Although we take appropriate measures to safeguard against unauthorized disclosures of information, we cannot assure you that personally identifiable information will never be disclosed.
<br><br>
You hereby acknowledge that we are not responsible for any intercepted information sent via the internet, and you hereby release us from any and all claims arising out of or related to the use of intercepted information in any unauthorized manner.
<br><br>
We want you to feel comfortable and secure while using our Site. However, no system can be completely secure. Therefore, although we take steps to secure personally identifiable information, we do not promise, and you should not expect, that personally identifiable information will always remain secure. Users should also take care with how they handle and disclose personally identifiable information and should avoid sending personally identifiable information through insecure email.
<br><br>
5. Controlling Personally Identifiable Information
<br><br>
We may provide areas on our Site where you can post information about yourself and others and communicate with others.Such postings are governed by our Terms of Use. In addition, such postings may appear on other websites or when searches are executed on the subject of your posting. Whenever you voluntarily disclose personally identifiable information on publicly-viewable web pages, that information will be publicly available and can be collected and used by others. For example, if you post your email address, you may receive unsolicited messages. We cannot control who reads your posting or what other users may do with the information you voluntarily post, so we encourage you to exercise discretion and caution with respect to personally identifiable information. Please do not include information in your submissions that you expect to keep private.
<br><br>
You may send inquiries to other users, merchants and service providers, via clickable links and submission forms on our Site listings.

If you call the user, you may be asked to leave a return telephone number, which telephone conversation may be recorded and disclosed as described herein. Do not share personally identifiable information in any e-mail, post, inquiry or phone call if you do not want the user, merchant or service provider to subsequently contact you. These inquiries are sent to the user you select and will be retained by us. The resulting inquiry is available for review only by the user to it was initially addressed and to our customer service employees, who may be asked by users for their past inquiry information. While the content of these inquiries is not shared with any other party, the Site may, from time to time, use third party e-mail servers to send and track receipt of the inquiry e-mails, and analyze the pattern of inquiry usage reported by these third party tracking systems.
