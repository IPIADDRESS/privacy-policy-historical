    <li>We DO NOT SHARE any personal information (including email address) we collect WITH ANYONE other than Home Again service providers in order to deliver the services and products offered under the HomeAgain® program.  Those service providers include:  (1) the pet recovery service which contacts clients of lost pets during the recovery process, (2) ASPCA National Poison Control Center, which provides the 24-hour/7-day-a-week emergency medical service, (3) the shelter providing care until the lost pet is returned, and (4) other providers who manage (or provide the technical support for) our payment processing, customer communications, call centers and website.</li>
    <li>NO DATA THAT WE COLLECT IS GIVEN TO ANYONE WHO MAY CONTACT YOU FOR ANY PURPOSE NOT RELATED TO THE HOMEAGAIN® PROGRAM.</li>
