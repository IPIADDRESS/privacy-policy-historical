<h2>
	<strong>The Information We Collect:</strong></h2>
<p>
	This notice applies to all information collected or submitted on the Homeschool-Life.com website. On some pages, you can request membership registration in your respective Homeschool group web site. The types of personal information collected at these pages are:</p>
