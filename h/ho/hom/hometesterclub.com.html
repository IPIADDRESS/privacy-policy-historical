            <h2>Buchanan Group Privacy Policy</h2>
            <p><strong>Buchanan Advertising (Australia) Pty Ltd.</strong> (<strong>Buchanan </strong>or <strong>We/we </strong>or<strong> Our/our </strong>or <strong>Us/us</strong>) is committed to respecting the privacy of your personal  information.<br>
  This Privacy Policy explains our policy for dealing  with personal information that we collect through our website www.brandpower.com  , any related <strong>Buchanan</strong><strong>w</strong>ebsite, social media  page, internal website, intranet and any <strong>Buchanan </strong>mobile  applications (each, a “<strong>Website</strong>”) and  the privacy of individuals who provide personal information by any other means  to <strong>Buchanan</strong>, including either  physically or electronically including via completion of surveys (together, the  “<strong>Collection Channels</strong>”).<br>
  You may contact us with any queries you may have in  respect of this Privacy Policy or your personal information by contacting <strong>Buchanan’s privacy officer</strong> via email: <a href="mailto:privacy@buchanangroup.com">privacy@buchanangroup.com</a> or telephone:  +61 (0)3 9644 0000. </p>
<p><strong>Personal  information is important to Buchanan</strong></p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Buchanan </strong>is  committed to safeguarding personal privacy. It recognises that you have a right  to control how your personal information is collected and used. Providing  personal information is an act of trust and it is taken seriously. Unless given  consent to do otherwise, <strong>Buchanan </strong>will  only collect and use personal information as set out below. </li>
  <li>Throughout this Privacy Policy, we refer to your 'personal information',  which means information which identifies you as an individual or which renders  you reasonably identifiable. Your full name, gender, date of birth, home  address, home telephone number, mobile telephone number, email address and  workplace contact details are examples of information which may constitute  personal information. Personal information may also include information we may  collect about your individual preferences.</li>
  <li><strong>Buchanan </strong>has  developed and implemented its Privacy Policy with respect to personal  information to reflect world best practice on privacy policies. These  principles meet and exceed the requirements of the <em>Privacy Act 1988</em> (Cth) (as amended) and the 13 Australian Privacy  Principles.</li>
  <li>In order to keep up with changing legislation and best practice, we may  revise this Privacy Policy at any time without notice. We will post any changes  to this Privacy Policy on our Websites, so we encourage you to check this  Privacy Policy from time to time.</li>
  <li>In addition to the provisions of this Privacy Policy, there may also be  specific and additional privacy and consent provisions that apply to certain Collection  Channels. Because those specific and additional provisions also relate to your  privacy protection, we recommend that you review them wherever they appear. In  the event of any inconsistency between the provisions of this Privacy Policy  and those other specific and additional provisions, the specific and additional  provisions will prevail. </li>

Personal information will not be collected by any person who is known by Buch<strong>anan </strong>to be under the age of fifteen (15) without the  consent of a parent or legal guardian. Persons under age fifteen (15) may only  use <strong>our Websites </strong>with the involvement  and consent of a parent or legal guardian.  </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Passive  Information Collection</strong></p>
<ol start="13">
  <li>As with many commercial websites, we may also collect information which  tells us about visitors to our Websites. For example, we may collect  information about the date, time and duration of visits and which pages of a  Website are most commonly accessed. This information is generally not linked to  the identity of visitors, except where a Website is accessed via links in an  email we have sent or where we are able to uniquely identify the device or user  accessing a Website. By accessing a Website via links in an email we have sent  and/or by accessing a Website generally, you consent to the collection of such  information where it is personal information. </li>
  <li>As you navigate through our Websites, certain information can be  passively collected (that is, gathered without you actively providing the  information) using various technologies, such as Unique Device Identifiers (<strong>UDI</strong>), cookies, Internet tags or web  beacons, and navigational data collection (log files, server logs,  clickstream). In certain circumstances, this information may be considered  anonymous information, or personal information under the <em>Privacy Act 1988</em> (Cth). This is dependent on the device used and  the method by which an individual connects to the Internet. Your Internet  browser automatically transmits to the Website you are browsing some of this  anonymous information or personal information, such as the URL of the website  you just came from, the Internet Protocol (<strong>IP</strong>)  address, the UDI (if applicable) and the browser version your device is  currently using. Our Websites may also collect anonymous information or  personal information from your device through cookies and Internet tags or web  beacons. You may set your browser to notify you when a cookie is sent or to  refuse cookies altogether, but certain features of a Website might not work  without cookies and this may limit the services provided by a Website. Cookies  and other technical methods may involve the transmission of information either  directly to us or to another party authorised by us to collect information on  our behalf. </li>
  <li>Our Websites may use and combine such passively collected anonymous  information or personal information from various third party sources, including  as described in paragraph 14, to provide better service to Website visitors and  users, customise a Website based on your preferences, compile and analyse  statistics and trends, and otherwise administer and improve a Website for your  use. We may combine your visitor session information or other information  collected through tracking technologies with personally identifiable  information from time to time in order to understand and measure your online  experiences and to determine what products, promotions and services are likely  to be of interest to you. By accessing a Website, you consent to information  about you being collected, compiled and used in this way.</li>
  <li>“Cookies” are pieces of information that a Website transfers to a  computer's hard disk for record keeping purposes. Most web browsers are set to  accept cookies. <strong>Buchanan </strong>may use  cookies to make use of a Website and services as convenient as possible.  Cookies do not themselves personally identify users, although they do identify  a user's browser. Cookies allow <strong>Buchanan </strong>to  monitor the items you may want to access as you move through a Website, and  record how many people are using the different parts of a Website.</li>
  <li>"Session" cookies are temporary bits of information that are  used to improve navigation, block visitors from providing information where  inappropriate (a Website "remembers" previous entries of age or  country of origin that were outside the specified parameters and blocks  subsequent changes), and collect aggregate statistical information on a Website.  They are erased once you exit your web browser or otherwise turn off your  computer. </li>
  <li>"Persistent" cookies are more permanent bits of information  that are placed on the hard drive of your computer and stay there unless you  delete the cookie. Persistent cookies store information on your computer for a  number of purposes, such as retrieving certain information you have previously  provided (such as passwords), helping to determine what areas of a Website  visitors find most valuable, and customising a Website based on your  preferences on an ongoing basis. Persistent cookies placed by a Website on your  computer may hold personally identifiable information, but only if you have  registered or have otherwise consented to the retention of personally  identifiable information you have provided to the Website. Otherwise, a Website's  server only knows that an unidentified visitor with your cookie has returned to  the Website. </li>
  <li>You can set your browser to accept all cookies, to reject all cookies,  or to notify you whenever a cookie is offered so that you can decide each time  whether to accept it. To learn more about cookies and how to specify your  preferences, please search for "cookie" in the "Help"  portion of your browser. </li>
  <li>A Website may use IP addresses. An IP address is a number assigned to  your computer by your Internet service provider so you can access the Internet  and is generally considered to be non-personally identifiable information,  because in most cases an IP address is dynamic (changing each time you connect  to the Internet), rather than static (unique to a particular user's computer).  The IP address can be used to diagnose problems with a server, report aggregate  information, determine the fastest route for your computer to use in connecting  to a Website, and administer and improve the Website.</li>
  <li>"Internet tags" (also known as single-pixel GIFs, clear GIFs,  invisible GIFs, and 1-by-1 GIFs) are smaller than cookies and tell a Website  server information such as the IP address and browser type related to the  visitor's computer. Tags may be placed both on online advertisements that bring  people to a Website and on different pages of a Website. Such tags indicate how  many times a page is opened and which information is consulted.</li>
  <li>"Navigational data" (log files, server logs, and clickstream  data) are used for system management, to improve the content of a Website and  the user experience, market research purposes, and to communicate information  to visitors.</li>
  <li>We may also use these technologies in HTML emails that we send to our  visitors for a number of purposes including: to determine whether our visitors  have opened or forwarded those emails and/or clicked on links in those emails;  to customise the display of banner advertisements and other messages after a  visitor has closed an email; and to determine whether a visitor has made an  enquiry or a purchase in response to a particular email. </li>
