<h1>Background</h1>

<p>Buchanan Group is required by the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth) (<strong>Privacy Act</strong>) to comply with ten  National Privacy Principles (<strong>NPPs</strong>) (subject to the other provisions of  that Act).&nbsp; The NPPs regulate the manner in which personal information is handled  throughout its life cycle, from collection to use and disclosure, storage,  accessibility and disposal.&nbsp; Buchanan  Group is also required to comply with the Spam Act 2003  (Cth) (<strong>Spam Act</strong>) and the Do Not Call  Register Act 2006 (Cth) (<strong>Do Not Call  Register Act</strong>). &nbsp;</p>

  <h1>What is personal  information?</h1>

<p>Personal information is information or an opinion, in any form  and whether true or not, about an individual  whose identity is apparent or can reasonably be ascertained from the  information or opinion.&nbsp; Examples include  an individual's name, address, contact number and email address. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>  Special  provisions apply to the collection of personal information which is sensitive information.&nbsp; &nbsp;This  includes health information and information about a persons' race, ethnic  origin, political opinions, membership of political, professional or trade  associations, religious or philosophical beliefs, sexual preferences and  criminal history.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<h1>Collection of  personal information by Buchanan Group</h1>

  <li>    Buchanan  Group will collect personal  information only by lawful and fair means and not in an unreasonably  intrusive manner.</li>
  <li>    When  Buchanan Group collects personal  information directly from you, we will take reasonable steps at or  before the time of collection to ensure that you are aware of certain key  matters, such as the purposes for which we are collecting the information, the  organisations (or types of organisations) to which we would normally disclose  information of that kind, the fact that you are able to access the information  and how to contact us (for example, where personal information is collected on a form, we will generally  include a written privacy statement on the form which sets out these details).</li>
  <li>    Buchanan  Group will collect your personal  information directly from you where it is reasonable and practicable to  do so.&nbsp; Where Buchanan Group collects  information about you from a third party, we will still take reasonable steps  to ensure that you are made aware of the details set out above.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Use and disclosure  of personal information by Buchanan Group</h1>

<p>If Buchanan  Group uses or discloses your personal  information for a purpose (<strong>secondary purpose</strong>) other the main  reason for which it was originally collected (<strong>primary purpose</strong>), to the  extent required by the Privacy Act, we will ensure that:</p>
<ul>
  <li>  the  secondary purpose is related to the primary purpose of collection (and directly  related in the case of sensitive information), and you would reasonably expect  that Buchanan Group would use or disclose your information in that way; </li>
  <li>    you  have consented to the use or disclosure of your personal information for the  secondary purpose; </li>
  <li>    the  use or disclosure is required or authorised by or under law; or</li>
  <li>    the  use or disclosure is otherwise permitted by the Privacy Act (for example, as a  necessary part of an investigation of suspected unlawful activity).</li>
</ul>
<h1>How might we  contact you?</h1>

<p>We may contact you in a variety of ways,  including by post, email, SMS, telephone call or facsimile. </p>
<p><em>Spam</em><br>
  We will not send you any commercial  electronic messages such as SMSs or emails unless this is permitted by the Spam  Act (for example, if we have your express or inferred consent to do so).&nbsp; Any commercial electronic message that we  send will identify Buchanan Group as the sender and will include our contact  details.&nbsp; The message will also provide  an unsubscribe facility.&nbsp; If you do not  wish to receive commercial electronic messages from us, please let us know (our  contact details are provided at the end of this policy).&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Do  Not Call Register</em><br>
  We will not call you on a number listed on  the Do Not Call Register unless this is permitted under the Do Not Call  Register Act and related instruments (for example, if we have your express or  inferred consent to do so).&nbsp; If you do  not wish us to call you on a particular number, please let us know (our contact  details are provided at the end of this policy).</p>
<h1>Data quality and  security</h1>

<p>To the  extent required by the Privacy Act, Buchanan Group will take reasonable steps  to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>  make  sure that the personal information that  we collect, use and disclose is accurate, complete and up to date;</li>
  <li>    protect  the personal information that  we hold from misuse and loss and from unauthorised access, modification or  disclosure; and</li>
  <li>    destroy  or permanently de-identify personal  information that is no longer needed for any purpose that is permitted  by the Privacy Act.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Anonymity</h1>

<p>Buchanan  Group will generally provide individuals with the option of not identifying  themselves when entering into transactions when it is lawful and practicable to  do so.&nbsp; </p>

  <h1>Use of Commonwealth  government identifiers</h1>

<p>Buchanan  Group will not use Commonwealth government identifiers (<strong>Identifiers</strong>) (such as Medicare numbers) as its own identifier of  individuals.&nbsp; We will only use or  disclose Identifiers in the circumstances permitted by the Privacy Act.</p>

  <h1>Transfer of  personal information overseas</h1>

<p>If Buchanan  Group transfers your personal  information outside Australia,  we will comply with requirements of the Privacy Act that relate to transborder  data flows.</p>

If Members have any concerns about their personal information being published in this way, they are advised to remove any personal information from the Public Material they post, or not to use these services.</p>
<p>As indicated in the &lt; Terms of Use &gt;, we may use Public Material for any promotional purposes of BG and its clients.  This may include using Public Material which may include personal information (for example, reproducing in promotional materials testimonials which include either your personal information or a user name which identifies you), unless you opt out of this in your member profile page.</p>
