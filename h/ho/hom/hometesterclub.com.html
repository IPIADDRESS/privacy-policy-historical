  <p><strong>Buchanan Group Privacy  Policy.</strong><br>
    Buchanan Advertising (Australia) Pty Ltd. ACN 155 718 942  (“Buchanan Group”) and the other companies and organisations which make up  Buchanan Group are committed to protecting the privacy of your personal  information.&nbsp; This Privacy Policy explains how Buchanan Group manages the  personal information that we collect, use and disclose and how to contact us if  you have any further queries about our management of your personal  information.&nbsp; This Privacy Policy does not cover personal information  collected or held by Buchanan Group about its employees.<br>
  <strong>Background</strong><br>
    Buchanan Group is required by the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth) (<strong>Privacy Act</strong>) to comply with ten National Privacy  Principles (<strong>NPPs</strong>) (subject to the  other provisions of that Act).&nbsp; The NPPs regulate the manner in which  personal information is handled throughout its life cycle, from collection to  use and disclosure, storage, accessibility and disposal.&nbsp; Buchanan Group  is also required to comply with the Spam Act 2003 (Cth) (<strong>Spam Act</strong>) and the Do Not Call Register Act 2006 (Cth)  (<strong>Do  Not Call Register Act</strong>). &nbsp;<br>
  <strong>What is personal  information?</strong><br>
    Personal information is information or an opinion, in any form  and whether true or not, about an individual whose identity is apparent or can  reasonably be ascertained from the information or opinion.&nbsp; Examples  include an individual's name, address, contact number and email address.  &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
    Special provisions apply to the collection of personal  information which is sensitive information.&nbsp; &nbsp;This includes health  information and information about a persons' race, ethnic origin, political  opinions, membership of political, professional or trade associations,  religious or philosophical beliefs, sexual preferences and criminal  history.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
  <strong>Collection of personal  information by Buchanan Group</strong><br>
    To the extent required by the Privacy Act:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Buchanan Group will  not collect personal information about you unless that information is necessary  for one or more of our functions or activities.&nbsp;</li>
    <li>Buchanan Group will  collect personal information only by lawful and fair means and not in an  unreasonably intrusive manner.</li>
    <li>When Buchanan Group  collects personal information directly from you, we will take reasonable steps  at or before the time of collection to ensure that you are aware of certain key  matters, such as the purposes for which we are collecting the information, the  organisations (or types of organisations) to which we would normally disclose  information of that kind, the fact that you are able to access the information  and how to contact us (for example, where personal information is collected on  a form, we will generally include a written privacy statement on the form which  sets out these details).</li>
    <li>Buchanan Group will  collect your personal information directly from you where it is reasonable and  practicable to do so.&nbsp; Where Buchanan Group collects information about you  from a third party, we will still take reasonable steps to ensure that you are  made aware of the details set out above.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>Use and disclosure of  personal information by Buchanan Group</strong><br>
    If Buchanan Group uses or discloses your personal information  for a purpose (<strong>secondary purpose</strong>) other the main reason for which it was originally collected (<strong>primary purpose</strong>), to the extent required by the Privacy Act,  we will ensure that:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>the secondary purpose  is related to the primary purpose of collection (and directly related in the  case of sensitive information), and you would reasonably expect that Buchanan  Group would use or disclose your information in that way;</li>
    <li>you have consented to  the use or disclosure of your personal information for the secondary purpose;</li>
    <li>the use or disclosure  is required or authorised by or under law; or</li>
    <li>the use or disclosure  is otherwise permitted by the Privacy Act (for example, as a necessary part of  an investigation of suspected unlawful activity).</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>How might we contact  you?</strong><br>
    We may contact you in a variety of ways, including by post,  email, SMS, telephone call or facsimile.<br>
  <em>Spam</em><br>
    We will not send you any commercial electronic messages such as SMSs or emails  unless this is permitted by the Spam Act (for example, if we have your express  or inferred consent to do so).&nbsp; Any commercial electronic message that we  send will identify Buchanan Group as the sender and will include our contact  details.&nbsp; The message will also provide an unsubscribe facility.&nbsp; If  you do not wish to receive commercial electronic messages from us, please let  us know (our contact details are provided at the end of this policy).&nbsp;<br>
  <em>Do Not Call Register</em><br>
    We will not call you on a number listed on the Do Not Call Register unless this  is permitted under the Do Not Call Register Act and related instruments (for  example, if we have your express or inferred consent to do so).&nbsp; If you do  not wish us to call you on a particular number, please let us know (our contact  details are provided at the end of this policy).<br>
  <strong>Data quality and  security</strong><br>
    To the extent required by the Privacy Act, Buchanan Group will  take reasonable steps to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>make sure that the  personal information that we collect, use and disclose is accurate, complete  and up to date;</li>
    <li>protect the personal  information that we hold from misuse and loss and from unauthorised access,  modification or disclosure; and</li>
    <li>destroy or permanently  de-identify personal information that is no longer needed for any purpose that  is permitted by the Privacy Act.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>Anonymity</strong><br>
    Buchanan Group will generally provide individuals with the  option of not identifying themselves when entering into transactions when it is  lawful and practicable to do so.&nbsp;<br>
  <strong>Use of Commonwealth  government identifiers</strong><br>
    Buchanan Group will not use Commonwealth government identifiers  (<strong>Identifiers</strong>) (such as Medicare numbers) as its own  identifier of individuals.&nbsp; We will only use or disclose Identifiers in  the circumstances permitted by the Privacy Act.<br>
  <strong>Transfer of personal  information overseas</strong><br>
    If Buchanan Group transfers your personal information outside  Australia, we will comply with requirements of the Privacy Act that relate to  transborder data flows.<br>
  <strong>Access and correction  of your personal information</strong><br>
    Please contact Buchanan Group if you would like to access or  correct the personal information that we hold about you.&nbsp; Buchanan Group  will generally provide you with access to your personal information (although a  fee may be imposed), and will take reasonable steps to amend any personal  information that is incorrect.&nbsp; In some circumstances, Buchanan Group may  not permit access to your personal information, or may refuse to correct your  personal information, in which case we will provide you with reasons for this  decision.<br>
