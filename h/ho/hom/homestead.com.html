<b>Does Homestead share member account information?</b>
As a general rule, except as otherwise contemplated in this Privacy Policy, Homestead will not disclose any of your personal information without your permission, except under special circumstances, such as when we believe in good faith that the law requires it. Any information provided by you for the purpose of registering a domain name will become part of the public WHOIS database and you will not be able to opt-out of this directory.
</p>
<p>
<b>Business Partners:</b>
In addition to disclosing personal information to agents who provide services to you on Homestead's behalf, Homestead may disclose your personal information to business partners, but this is specifically described to you prior to data collection or prior to transferring the data. Our business partners have separate privacy and data collection practices. Homestead has no responsibility or liability for these independent policies. For more information regarding the partner or service and their privacy policies, return to that partner's home page and click on their Privacy Policy link. Additionally, Homestead may disclose your personal information to a third party who is a successor in interest, in the event of a merger, reorganization, change of control, acquisition or sale of all or substantially all of Homestead's assets.
</p>
<p>
<b>Agent:</b>
We employ other companies and individuals who are subject to confidentiality obligations, to perform functions on our behalf. Examples include, but are not limited to, web site design services, sending postal mail and e-mail, registering a respective domain name, removing repetitive information from customer lists, analyzing data, providing marketing assistance, providing customer service, and collecting and processing payments for the Homestead subscription service. They have access to personal information needed to perform their functions, but may not use it for other purposes.
</p>
<p>
<b>Promotions, Sweepstakes/Contests:</b>
Some Homestead promotions, sweepstakes/contests may require that you provide additional information, such as your mailing address, social security number or credit card number. Such information may be shared with a third party if such third party is sponsoring the "event" or if the information is necessary in order to administer the service or process your transaction.
</p> 
<p>
Some Homestead promotions and sweepstakes/contests may also offer opportunities to request additional information from sponsors and/or may require that you share some basic information in order to participate. By requesting more information or by participating, you give Homestead permission to transfer your personal information to the sponsor or partner so they can fulfill your request.
</p>
<p>
<b>Legally Compelled Disclosure and Other:</b>
Homestead may disclose or access account information when we believe in good faith that the law requires it or for the protection of our legal rights. Homestead may also disclose information in special cases when we have reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be violating the Homestead Member Agreement. We can disclose any personal information about you to law enforcement or other government officials as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate, in connection with a violation of the Homestead Member Agreement, an investigation of fraud, intellectual property infringements, or other activity that is illegal or may expose us to legal liability.

Homestead makes every effort to ensure the confidentiality of all information you provide about yourself.

<b>How secure is my account information?</b>
Homestead uses industry standard efforts to safeguard the confidentiality of your personally identifiable information, such as firewalls and Secure Socket Layers. We make every effort to protect the loss, misuse, and alteration of the information under our control. In addition, we always use a secure connection when collecting personal financial information from you. However, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.
</p>
<p>
Your Homestead account is password-protected so in addition to those partners or agents who may provide you services, only you and those you designate can access it and view the member information relevant to your account. Ultimately, you are responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your passwords and any account information. Remember to log out of your Homestead account and close your browser window when you are done. This ensures that others cannot access your personal information if your computer is accessible to others.

<b>What are cookies and how does Homestead use them?</b>
Cookies are small pieces of information stored on your hard drive, not on our site. The use of cookies is an industry standard, generally used by most major Web sites to improve their services. Homestead uses cookies because they allow us to store your password without your having to constantly re-enter it. Cookies can also help us track your behavior on our site so that we can tailor our marketing message to better match your needs and interests. Finally, by tracking behavior on our site, cookies allow us to better understand how members use our site, which in turn helps us focus our resources on features that are most popular with our members. You are always free to decline our cookies if your browser permits, but some parts of our site may not work properly if you do so.

<b>Has this Privacy Policy been reviewed by a third party for approval?</b>
Homestead is a licensee of the TRUSTe Privacy Program. TRUSTe is an independent, non-profit organization whose mission is to build users trust and confidence in the Internet by promoting the use of fair information practices.

<p>
<b>How does Homestead protect Children's Privacy?</b>
Homestead does not direct its services towards minors and we do not allow Children under the age of 13 to sign up for Homestead Services. No information should be submitted to or posted at Homestead by children under the age of 13 ("Children") without the prior consent of their parent or guardian.
</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>
<b>Verifiable Parental Consent.</b>
We are required by law to obtain verifiable parental consent in order to collect, use, or disclose personal information from Children. Before we collect any information on a Child, we require the parent or guardian (collectively, the "Parent") to verify his or her consent by either completing a consent form which may be obtained by e-mailing kidsafety@homesteadsupport.com or by providing us with their credit card or social security number. By agreeing to the registration of his or her Child a Parent (i) agrees that the Child's online activities are subject to a number of rules and policies, including without limitation this Privacy Policy and the Member Agreement, and (ii) consents to our collection, use, and disclosure of personal information about the Child as described in this Privacy Policy. We make special provisions to allow parents to control the personal information we collect from Children as described below.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<b>Collector of Personal Information.</b>
Homestead Technologies Inc. owns and operates this web site and this policy only addresses the activities of Homestead. Other sites (including those that we link to) and the sites of our members may have their own policies, which we do not control and which are not addressed by this policy.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<b>What and How Personal Information is Collected.</b>
</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>
<b>Collection by Homestead.</b>
We may directly collect the following types of personal information about Children: name, address, email address, parent's registration information, birthdates, gender, or such other data that may help us to better tailor our services for each member. In addition, our servers may collect personal information indirectly and automatically (through, for example, the use of "cookies") about Children's activities while using our services, including internet sites and web pages visited.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<b>Public Areas.</b>
"Public Areas" are those member web sites and other areas, such as chat rooms, guest books and other means of online communication, in which a member or a third party may send a communication that is publicly available to other members. Public Areas provide special circumstances relating to the collection and disclosure of personal information. Members voluntarily may disclose any personal information whatsoever when they participate in Public Areas, but should exercise caution when doing so. In these instances, Homestead does not control that disclosure, and the personal information may be available to anyone who is also participating in that Public Area.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<b>Prohibited Collection.</b>
We are prohibited by law from conditioning Children's participation in a game, the offering of a prize, or another similar activity on the Child's disclosure of more Personal Information than is reasonably necessary to participate in that activity.
</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<b>Our Use of Personal Information.</b>
Homestead may use Children's personal information: to operate its site, to fulfill a requested transaction, for record keeping, for technical support or maintenance, to obtain verifiable parental consent for the collection of personal information, or for marketing directly to the Child.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<b>Disclosure of Personal Information.</b>
</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>
<b>Disclosure by Homestead.</b>
Except as contemplated in this section, we will not share personal information with a third party who does not agree to maintain the confidentiality of that personal information using reasonable security measures. We may disclose aggregated information about our members but that information contains no personal information. In some situations, we share personal information with third parties who provide support for the internal operations or enhancement of the services.
</p>
</li>
<p>
Unfortunately, due to the existing regulatory environment, we cannot ensure that all of your private communications and other personal information will never be disclosed in ways not otherwise described in this Privacy Policy. By way of example (without limiting the foregoing), we may be forced to disclose personal information to the government or third parties under certain circumstances, or third parties may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private communications. We can (and you can authorize us to) disclose any personal information about you to law enforcement or other government officials as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate, in connection with an investigation of fraud, intellectual property infringements, or other activity that is illegal or may expose us to legal liability.
</p>
<li>
<p>
<b>Public Disclosure by Members.</b>
Any time any member, including Children, voluntarily discloses personal information in a Public Area, that personal information may be used by third parties. In these cases, the member must choose whether or not to disclose personal information.
</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<b>Review and Control of Personal Information.</b>
If parents/guardians wish to request that their child's information be deleted or that no further information be collected from their child, please e-mail us at <a href="mailto:kidsafety@homesteadsupport.com">kidsafety@homesteadsupport.com</a>.
</p>
