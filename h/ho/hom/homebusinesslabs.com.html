						Home  Business Labs&nbsp;understands consumers’ concerns over the use of their  personal information. We hope this information will relieve any concerns your  company may have regarding our email policies.&nbsp;Home Business Labs&nbsp;and  its affiliated sites use only an “opt-in or opt out” method of obtaining  customer information, and it is not our policy or desire to send unsolicited  email.

Home Business Labs&nbsp;email messages  sent always include information about the origin of the emails and instructions  on how recipients can unsubscribe from receiving future email messages.
					</p>
					<p>
						From  time to time, Home Business Labs&nbsp;will enter into an arrangement with a  third party website to allow individuals to opt into our marketing program on  those third party websites. In each case the third party websites have  represented and warranted to us, among other things,
					</p>
					<p>
						that  the data was collected voluntarily from individuals on website registrations  and co-registrations,
					</p>
					<p>
						that  the sellers have a right, under any applicable privacy statements, to transfer  the data to us, and
					</p>
					<p>
						that  Home Business Labs&nbsp;has the right to send marketing offers to the  individuals.
					</p>
					<p>
						We  hope this information satisfies any questions or concerns you may have  regarding the email practices of Home Business Labs.
