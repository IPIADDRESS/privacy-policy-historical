<p><strong>Your Rights</strong></p>
<p><strong>Use of Consumer Reports</strong></p>
<p>Homesite Group Incorporated uses information from consumer reporting agencies such as your credit, claims, and insurance history. This helps us to fairly determine eligibility for our programs and ensure accurate rates for all policies.</p>
<p><strong>Insurance Claims History</strong></p>
<p>We obtain information about insurance claims history from A-PLUS. For information or to dispute any report regarding your insurance claims history, contact the A-PLUS Consumer Inquiry Center at 1-800-709-8842. Note: to protect your privacy, only you can discuss your claims history with A-PLUS (an agent won’t be able to do it for you).</p>
<p><strong>Insurance Credit Score</strong></p>
<p><em>All states (excluding California and Maryland)</em><br>
We obtain information from Trans Union Corporation to determine your insurance credit score. This inquiry will not affect your credit score, as it is considered a “soft hit”. Trans Union can provide a free copy of your credit report, and if you believe that report is inaccurate, they can respond to disputed items, but Trans Union cannot comment on your insurance application.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>COLORADO HOMEOWNER’S, RENTER’S, AND CONDOMINIUM OWNER’S DISCLOSURE FORM</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This disclosure form is a basic guide to the major coverages and exclusions in your policy. It is only a general description and not a contract or a policy of any kind. All coverages are subject to the terms, conditions, special limits, and exclusions of your policy and all applicable endorsements.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>PLEASE READ YOUR POLICY FOR DETAILS! This disclosure form shall not be construed to replace any provision of the policy itself. In the event of any conflict between the policy and this disclosure form, the provisions of the policy shall prevail.</strong></p>
<p>This disclosure form also provides some guidelines on cancellation, nonrenewal, increase in premium, and changes in coverage. These factors are general in nature and do not represent the only reasons a policy may be terminated or changed. Please contact your agent or company for further information.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>BASIC COVERAGES-HOMEOWNERS</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Homeowners policies include two basic sections. The first section provides protection for your home and your personal property. The second section provides protection for you when you’re legally responsible (at fault) for an accident you have caused. It also includes medical payments coverage for persons, other than you or members of your household, who are injured in an accident that happens on your property. Homeowners policies do not cover automobiles.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>HOMEOWNERS-PROPERTY</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>WHAT IS COVERED:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Your policy will pay for loss or damage to your house, your furniture, and other personal belongings when caused by the losses shown in the attached chart. Only limited coverage is provided for jewelry, silverware, furs, business property, and other valuables.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Most policies have a deductible. The deductible is the amount of the loss that you, the policyholder, are responsible for paying. Your insurer will pay for the rest of the covered loss up to the policy limits.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Your policy also will pay for additional living expenses if a covered loss renders your home uninhabitable and you must temporarily live elsewhere. This coverage pays, for a specified period, for reasonable and necessary extra living expenses you incur over what you would have normally spent to maintain your standard of living if no loss had occurred.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>EXCLUSIONS-WHAT IS NOT COVERED:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The policy does not provide coverage for all possible losses. The following are examples of some of the losses that are NOT covered:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>Loss or damage that an insured intentionally causes;</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Flooding, earth movement, settling, cracking, bulging, shrinking, or expanding of the structure, other structures, or of pavements, driveways, or sidewalks;</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Pollution and contamination;</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Birds, vermin, or house pets;</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>Wear and tear.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>HOMEOWNERS-PERSONAL LIABILITY</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>WHAT IS COVERED:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Your policy pays for bodily injury and property damage to another’s property for which you or a member of your household is legally responsible (at fault). This includes the cost of defending you or a member of your household in a liability lawsuit.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>EXCLUSIONS-WHAT IS NOT COVERED:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The following are examples of some of the liability exclusions:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>Any loss that an insured intends or should expect to happen;</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Bodily injury to an insured person or property damage to an insured person’s property;</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Damage which results from the ownership or use of an automobile and other types of motorized land vehicles, aircraft, or certain watercraft;</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Liability resulting from transmission or exposure of a communicable disease or sexual molestation.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>BASIC COVERAGES-RENTER’S AND CONDOMINIUM OWNER’S POLICIES</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>Renter’s Policy</li>
</ol>
<p>A renter’s (tenant’s) policy provides coverage for your personal property and for your personal liability in the same way that a homeowners policy does. The general coverages for the causes of loss shown in the attached chart are the same under a renter’s policy, however, the building you live in is not covered. The amount of protection you choose will depend upon the value of the personal property you wish to insure.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>Condominium Unit Owner’s Policy</li>
</ol>
<p>A Condominium Unit Owner’s Policy is similar to a renter’s policy in that it provides coverage for your personal property and personal liability. It differs, however, in that it also provides coverage for building items, including additions and alterations you make to your unit, that are your insurance responsibility under the governing rules of the condominium association. A limited amount of coverage for loss assessments levied on the unit owners by the condominium association is also provided.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>III.        CANCELLATION, NONRENEWAL, INCREASE IN PREMIUM, AND CHANGES IN COVERAGE</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong> Cancellation and Nonrenewal</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>You may cancel your policy at any time by writing to your company and indicating the date the cancellation is to take effect.</p>
<p>Your company may choose to cancel or nonrenew your policy. If your policy is canceled or nonrenewed, you will receive advance notice. Some examples of reasons for cancellation and nonrenewal include, but are not limited to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Failure to pay your premium when it is due;</li>
<li>Knowingly making a false statement or a material misrepresentation on your application for your policy;</li>
<li>An unacceptable number of claims;</li>
<li>A substantial change in the use or occupancy of the premises.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li><strong> Increase in Premium</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Conditions that may increase your premium include, but are not limited to:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>Change of use of your home or premises;</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>A general rate increase. This results from the loss experience of a large group of policyholders rather than from a loss suffered by an individual policyholder. A general rate increase applies to many persons in the group, not just those who had losses.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Adjustment for inflation. Some companies include inflation coverage in their policies. This coverage can automatically increase the amount of your insurance coverages as inflation pushes up the cost of replacing your home. The increases may be based on a construction cost index and may be reflected in the premium on each renewal date.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li><strong> Changes in Coverage</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A number of situations may change the insurance coverage you have. For example, you may choose to change the type of coverage you have, increase or reduce your limits or deductibles, or add optional coverages.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>These factors are general in nature and do not represent the only reasons a policy may be changed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Please contact your agent or company with any questions about changes in coverage that you wish to make or about changes that your company has made.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>LOWERING YOUR COSTS</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Although the general classifications used by insurance companies to set rates may be beyond your control, it is possible to reduce the cost of your homeowners insurance without giving up necessary protection. Here are some tips:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Take the Highest or Broadest Deductible You Can Afford</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Insurance should protect you from major losses. Choosing a higher deductible may result in lower premiums.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Check With Your Insurance Agent Before You Buy or Rent a New Home.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Insurance rates are higher for some types of buildings.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ask If You Are Eligible for Discounts</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some companies may offer discounts for characteristics which make your property subject to less chance of a loss. These may include discounts or credits for a new home, if you have had no recent losses, if you are over a certain age, or if your home has smoke alarms, automatic fire sprinkler systems, and/or burglar alarms.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Compare Coverages, Premiums, and Service When You Shop for Insurance.</p>

<p>* Types of policy go by various names with different insurance companies. The kinds of losses covered and policy conditions may vary by company.</p>
<p>** Dwelling coverage in the Condominium Owner’s policy is limited to those building items for which the insured is made responsible under the Condominium Association’s contract.</p>

<p><strong>Maryland Only</strong></p>
<p><strong>Flood Coverage Disclosure Notice</strong></p>
 
<p><strong>All homeowner insurance policyholders are cautioned that:</strong></p>
<p>Your policy excludes coverage for damage caused by flooding of all types. This exclusion may exclude any and all damages resulting from storm surge from a hurricane, surface water, flash floods, waves, tidal water, tidal waves, wind driven rain or water, or any other overflow of water, and spray from any of these events. For further details, please see the language of your policy. The language of your policy will control the obligations of the parties.</p>
 
<p>You are further advised that to be covered for such a loss, you will have to obtain a separate flood insurance policy by applying to the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP). Your need for flood coverage can be confirmed with the NFIP or your mortgage lender. If available in your location, the NFIP can provide both structure and contents coverage. A claim under a flood insurance policy may be adjusted and paid on a different basis than a claim under a homeowners policy.</p>
 
<p>You can contact the National Flood Insurance Program for information at:</p>

<strong>Statement of Additional Optional Coverages</strong><br>
<strong>Not included in the Standard Homeowners Insurance Policy</strong></p>
<p>Your standard homeowners insurance policy does not cover all risks. You may need to obtain additional insurance to cover loss or damage to your home, property, and the contents of your home to cover the risks related to business or personal activities on your property.  We offer the following additional coverages that you may choose to purchase. We urge you to review these optional endorsements and credits.</p>
<p><strong><em>Extended Replacement Cost on Dwelling </em></strong>This endorsement can be used to increase Coverage A (dwelling) by either 25% or 50% to better accommodate a customer's needs.</p>
 
<p><strong><em>Earthquake </em></strong>This covers against a direct physical loss caused by an earthquake or earth movement. You may add this additional coverage for an additional premium. It is subject to a percentage of Coverage A deductible.</p>
 
<p><strong><em>Increase Deductibles </em></strong>By increasing the deductible, the policyholder may lower the cost of annual insurance premium. For instance increasing a $500 deductible to a $1000, 1% or 2% may decrease the annual premium significantly.</p>
 
<p><strong><em>Increase Limits on Other Structures </em></strong>Provides additional limits for Coverage B if needed. Only structures on the insured premises apply. You may increase up to double the original Coverage B amount.</p>
 
<p><strong><em>Water Back up and Sump Overflow </em></strong>Provides coverage for direct physical loss due to water backing up through sewers or drains and water which overflows from a sump. This is not a flood coverage, which requires a separate policy.</p>
 
<p><strong><em>Replacement Cost on Personal Property </em></strong>This endorsement protects the customer from receiving the depreciated value for their personal property. Instead contents will be replaced with new items of like kind and quality.</p>
 
<p><strong><em>Increased Limits on Personal Property </em></strong>This endorsement offers the insured the ability to increase certain personal property coverages from the standard homeowners limit. For instance, the basic homeowners policy insures jewelry for up to $1000 for the named perils; a customer may choose to increase that coverage to $5000.</p>

<p><strong><em>Increased Limits on Business Property </em></strong>For additional premium, this endorsement may increase the coverage for "business" property on the "residence premises".</p>
 
<p><strong><em>Scheduled Personal Property </em></strong>For additional premium, we offer open perils coverage for items such as jewelry, furs, cameras, musical instruments, silverware, fine arts and golfer's equipment. Not subject to a deductible, these items would be covered for the appraised value.</p>
 
<p><strong><em>Special Computer Coverage </em></strong>For additional premium, this would broaden the coverage for your computer due to direct physical loss. For example, if the policyholder drops a glass of water on the computer, this would be covered. This endorsement is subject to the policy deductible.</p>

<p><strong><em>Identity Theft </em></strong>This endorsement covers up to $15,000 for expenses incurred by the insured as a direct result from identity theft. The deductible would only be $250.</p>
 
<p><strong><em>Loss Assessment Coverage </em></strong>Specially designed for condominium owners, this coverage provides protection for assessments made by the condominium association resulting from loss to the property. The policyholder can choose the limit of coverage they wish up to $25,000 if the loss is caused by an insured peril.</p>
 
<p><strong><em>Watercraft </em></strong>This endorsement extends the limit of liability on your homeowners policy to your watercraft. This does not cover for the physical loss of the watercraft.</p>
 
<p><strong><em>Personal Injury </em></strong>With this endorsement, you can extend the limit of liability on your homeowners policy to cover you against libel, slander, and invasion of privacy.</p>
 
<p><strong><em>Home Day Care Coverage </em></strong>Registered family day care providers can purchase liability coverage in the amount of at least $300,000 to protect you against claims of bodily injury, property damage, or personal injury arising out of your activities as a day care provider.</p>
<p><strong><em>***Additional endorsements and credits are subject to availability and qualification.</em></strong></p>

Homesite Group Incorporated and all other insurance companies are prohibited by law from using anyone’s confidential abuse status as a basis for denying coverage; refusing to issue, renew, or reissue a policy; canceling or otherwise terminating a policy; restricting or excluding policy coverage or benefits; or charging a higher premium for a policy.</p>
<p>A protected person has a right to request access to any confidential abuse information we have about them in our records or files.

<p><strong>Virginia Only</strong></p>
<p>In connection with this application for insurance, we shall review your credit report or obtain or use an insurance credit score based on the information contained in that credit report. We may use a third party in connection with the development of your insurance credit score. You may request that your credit information be updated and if you question the accuracy of the credit information, we will, upon your request, reevaluate you based on corrected credit information from a consumer reporting agency.</p>

<p><strong>West Virginia Only</strong><br> 
Your credit information is used by Homesite Group Incorporated to produce an insurance score. This insurance score has an effect on the premium that you pay for your insurance. Homesite group Incorporated is required by the Insurance Commissioner to recheck your credit information no less than once every 36 months for changes. You have the option to request that Homesite group Incorporated recheck your insurance score more frequently than once every 36 months, but you can only make this request once during any twelvemonth period. If there has been a change in your insurance score, Homesite Group Incorporated shall re-underwrite and re-rate the policy based upon the current credit report or insurance score. The change in your insurance score may result in an increase or a decrease in the premium that you pay for your insurance. Any changes in your premium will take place upon renewal if your request is made at least 45 days before your renewal. If the request is made less than 45 days before your renewal date, the insurer shall re-underwrite and re-rate the policy for the following renewal.
