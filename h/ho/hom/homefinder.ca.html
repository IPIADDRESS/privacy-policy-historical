        your right to the privacy of the personal information you
        provide us on our Web sites. To that end, unless you
        designate otherwise or we state otherwise in the
        submission form where information is collected, any
        personal information you provide to HomeFinder.ca will be
        known only to two parties: you and HomeFinder.ca. The
        following policy is intended to explain how your personal
        information will be treated as you make use of our sites
        and their features. Personal information includes your
        name, street and e-mail addresses, click-through activity
        and any other personal information you may provide here.
        This policy may change from time to time, so please check
        back periodically.<br>
        <br>
        <b>Home Listings Section<br>
        </b>HomeFinder.ca does not monitor or control any of the
        email links found in the Home Listing sections of this
        site. This section is offered by HomeFinder.ca as a free
        service for realtors to advertise property for sale. The
        information in the Home Listings sections of this site
        are entered by the sales agent who is listing the
        property. HomeFinder.ca does not review these for
        accuracy or authenticity.<br>
        <br>
        <b>Traffic Data<br>
        </b>Each time a visitor comes to a HomeFinder.ca Web
        site, our server, like most on the Web, collect some
        basic technical information, including, for example, the
        visitor's domain name (e.g., whether the user is logged
        on from WebTV.net or home.com) referral data (e.g., we
        record the address of the last URL a user visited prior
        to clicking through to a HomeFinder.ca Web site) and
        browser and platform type (e.g., Internet Explorer
        browser on a Macintosh platform).<br>
        <br>
        We also count, track and aggregate the visitor's activity
        into our analysis of general traffic flows at our sites
        (e.g. tracking where traffic comes from, how traffic
        flows within the HomeFinder.ca sites, etc.). To these
        ends, we may merge information about visitors and visits
        into group data, which may then be shared on an
        aggregated basis with our advertisers; but we will not
        disclose your individual identity or personally
        identifiable data without your permission. When we do
        present aggregated information to outside companies, no
        one will be able to identify you or contact you.<br>
        <br>
        <b>Use of HomeFinder.ca Cookies<br>
        </b>A cookie is a small amount of data that is sent to
        your browser from a Web server and stored on your
        computer's hard drive. We use cookies in a limited way to
        help record traffic data through our banners, to identify
        unique browsers that visit us and to track usage
        throughout our site. This is the only place HomeFinder.ca
        uses cookies. Cookies cannot be used to identify
        individuals, only machines.<b><br>
        <br>
        Realtor Membership<br>
        </b>HomeFinder.ca collects personal information from
        Realtors who sign up to submit listings, including first
        and last names, e-mail address, street address and phone
        numbers. We do not share this information with other
        companies and will not do so (except in aggregate form,
        which does not reveal members' identities) without first
        obtaining a member's consent.<br>
        <br>
        <b>Promotion<br>
        </b>From time to time, HomeFinder.ca may sponsor
        sweepstakes, contests or other events which require the
        collection, processing and storage of individual contact
        and demographic information (e.g., your age and province
        of residence) to be used for the event. HomeFinder.ca may
        also co-sponsor these events along with other companies,
        in which case the user's individual contact and
        demographic information is likely to be shared with other
        participating sponsors. A registrant's personal contact
        and demographic information will not be released to
        third-party or non-participating organizations without
        the user's consent, and HomeFinder.ca will request that
        co-sponsors of such events uphold the privacy of the
        registrants' information.<br>
        <br>
        <b>Surveys<br>
        </b>HomeFinder.ca will from time to time conduct
        voluntary surveys of visitors to the site to obtain
        aggregate demographic information about them. Such
        information may be compiled and shared in the aggregate
        with advertisers and other third parties, but no personal
        details will be traceable or associated with specific
        individuals.<br>
        <br>
        <b>Other disclosure of personal information<br>
        </b>HomeFinder.ca will not otherwise use or disclose your
        personal information without your consent except (i) as
        described in this privacy policy, or (ii) as required by
        law, court order or as requested by other government or
        law enforcement authority. This policy does not protect
        information you send via an email link to a realtor in
        the Home Listing sections of this site.<br>
        <br>
        <strong>Hyperlinks are Not Endorsements<br>
        </strong>HomeFinder.ca makes no representations about any
        other web site which you may access through this one. A
        link to a non-HomeFinder.ca web site does not mean that
        HomeFinder.ca endorses or accepts any responsibility for
        the content, or the use, of such web site. It is your
        responsibility to take precautions to ensure that
        whatever you select for use is free of such items as
        viruses and other items of a destructive nature.<br>

        <b>Who can I ask if I have any additional questions?<br>
        </b>If you have any further questions or concerns about
        HomeFinder.ca's privacy policies and use of personal
        information, please send them to </font><a href="mailto:privacy@homefinder.ca"><font size="2" face="Arial">privacy@homefinder.ca</font></a></td>
