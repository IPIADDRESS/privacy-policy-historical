You can remain anonymous while you are browsing our website, but once you complete an application for a loan, we will use the information stated therein to determine if you are eligible for the loan you requested. We may retain all of the information you provide to us in that application process, including personally-identifying information such as your name, income, assets, liabilities, age, social security number, and employment.
