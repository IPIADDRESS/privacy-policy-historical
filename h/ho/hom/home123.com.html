In some instances, we may have already shared your information with one of our authorized third parties before you changed your email and newsletter choices. FTC email compliance guidance allows us to send you transactional and relationship email without offering you the opportunity to opt-out of receiving those types of email. In those cases, you may have to directly contact those third parties to opt-out of receiving their communications. </p>
