						<p>Some of the third parties whom you may meet on our website  (e.g., sponsors, advertisers, and third party services providers) may ask you for  additional data.&nbsp; When these third  parties are requesting additional data from you, they, not us, will be  collecting that data on their servers and/or website(s).&nbsp; This additional data will be subject to the  third party’s privacy statements and terms of service.&nbsp; Because we do not control the privacy  practices or policies of these third parties, you should review their privacy  statements and terms of service before you provide them with any personal data  in order to learn more about how they collect and use your personal information.&nbsp; </p>
						<p><strong>Collecting of data in  mobile applications:&nbsp; </strong></p>
						<p>When using mobile applications and services to connect with  us (including mobile applications that we provide you and mobile applications  that you use to connect with us), we may collect personal information from you  such as your phone number, mobile device type, and communications carrier.&nbsp;&nbsp; We use this information in order to set up  and manage our relationship with you as well as contact you about your  services.&nbsp; We use your information to  process and personalize your requests.&nbsp;  We also use the information for support, to develop new features, and to  improve the overall quality of our products and services.&nbsp; We may also use the information to show you a  history of your activity, to provide you with statistics about you or your use  of our product or service, or to provide you with a better user  experience.&nbsp; If you give us permission,  we may also use your information to contact you about special offerings that  may interest you.&nbsp; If you sign up for a  mobile message service from us, you will have the opportunity to stop receiving  mobile messages by following the instructions in the message or on our  website.&nbsp; You are responsible for all  charges incurred by you with your mobile communications carrier for any mobile  messaging services.&nbsp; Please be aware that  if you use location enabled products and services on whatever device you use to  connect with us, you may be sending us location information which may or may  not reveal your actual location.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
						<p>In the event you sign up for a third-party application or  service through our website(s) or through a mobile device, we may share  information about your mobile device in order to provide the information or  service you requested.<strong>&nbsp; </strong>Your carrier may have access to the  information we collect.&nbsp; You should  review your carrier’s privacy statement and the privacy statements for any  third-party services or applications you use.&nbsp; </p>
						<p>You are required to follow all applicable laws, including  unsolicited communication laws.&nbsp; If you  sign up for a mobile messaging service (e.g., SMS or MMS) through which you  have the ability to send mobile (“text”) messages to other individuals or  businesses, you understand that you will be responsible if you violate those  laws.&nbsp; You should also be aware that your  mobile service provider may be required to monitor your messages for  inappropriate content, and your provider may pass on that monitoring obligation  to us. To fulfill these requirements, we may monitor your mobile messages for  inappropriate content.&nbsp; </p>
						<p>&nbsp;</p>
						<p><strong><u>How do we protect  the information we collect?&nbsp; </u></strong></p>
						<ol>
						  <li>We use industry recognized security safeguards  and technologies to protect the information we collect from loss, misuse, or  unauthorized alterations.&nbsp; </li>
						  <li>We have physical, electronic, and procedural  safeguards enveloping our servers.&nbsp; &nbsp;</li>
						  <li>We train our employees to be mindful of  protecting your information.&nbsp; </li>
						  <li>We engage third party resources, as well as  using our internal resources, to monitor and review our security  procedures.&nbsp; </li>
						  <li>We encrypt sensitive data that you send to us  and maintain that encryption when the data is in transit.&nbsp; </li>
					  </ol>
						<p>&nbsp;<br>
						  How you protect your personal data plays a big role in  preventing loss or misuse of your personal data.&nbsp; There are a number of paths to identity theft  and fraud scams, some of which look very authentic but are actually not.&nbsp; For example, e-mail phishing scams look like  an authentic email from a company you are dealing with, or may have had  dealings with, and may warn you of a problem with your account, or raise some  other threating condition requiring you to take immediate action by clicking on  a link in the email or opening an attachment to the email.&nbsp; In some instances, they may say you have won  a prize or are the beneficiary of some monetary reward or bequest.&nbsp; Your first reaction to an unsolicited  suspicious e-mail should be to seek independent verification of the e-mail’s  substance and content – do <strong><u>NOT</u></strong> click on the links, open the attachments, or even reply to the e-mail.&nbsp; For example, call the sender of the e-mail  or, if appropriate, open your Internet browser and visit their website directly  by entering the website’s address (the “URL”) yourself and without using a link  in the suspicious e-mail.&nbsp; For additional  information about how you can protect your personal data, take a look at the  online resources provided by the <a href="http://www.ftc.gov">Federal Trade  Commission</a> including the <a href="http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/edu/microsites/idtheft/">FTC’s Identity Theft Site</a>.&nbsp; We will not request sensitive personal data  from you via an e-mail.&nbsp; If you receive  an e-mail that appears to have come from us requesting such information, please  forward it us at <a href="mailto:security@home123.com">security@home123.com</a>.  &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
						<p><strong><u>How do we use  the information we collect?&nbsp; </u></strong></p>
						<ol>
						  <li>We use your data to provide you with information  and services that you request from us and/or third parties, to inform you about  other products and services, and to customize your experience on our  website(s).&nbsp; </li>
