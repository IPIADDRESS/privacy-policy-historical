               Welcome to homegoods.com (the "Website"), a website for HomeGoods, a division of The TJX Companies, Inc. ("TJX"). TJX, HomeGoods, Marshalls, T.J. Maxx, Bob's Stores, A.J. Wright, and its other affiliates are the "TJX Businesses." This Privacy and Security Policy applies to and is a part of the Website which is also governed by the Website's Terms of Use. If any of the terms of this Privacy and Security Policy directly conflict with the Website Terms of Use, the terms of this Privacy and Security Policy shall apply and control.<br>
              <br>
              HomeGoods wants to make your online experience convenient and safe. We want you to know what information we collect, how we may use that information, how we protect that information, and how we share that information. Personal information is information about an identifiable individual, which includes name, address, e-mail address, telephone number, and other information that is identifiable to you, as more particularly defined by privacy legislation. By using the Website, or by providing us with your personal information at our stores, in our promotions and in other ways when you interact with us, you signify your assent to the conditions stated in this Privacy and Security Policy and the Terms of Use. This Privacy and Security Policy does not apply to information about our employees or to information provided to us in connection with employment opportunities.<br>
              <br>
              <strong>What Information We Collect</strong><br>
              <br>
              When you shop with us, we collect the personal information you provide us in connection with your purchase transaction, such as your name and telephone number. We also collect and maintain records and history about customers' purchases and product preference. If you pay by credit card, debit card or check, you provide us with your account information. If you return merchandise or request a refund or exchange, you provide us with your personal information. Also, when you register or create an online account with us, sign up for e-mail, enroll in any loyalty or other reward program, contact customer service, participate in our surveys, enter our sweepstakes, contests or other promotions, or send us feedback or submissions, you are providing us your personal information.<br>
              <br>
              <strong>Other Types of Data Collection</strong><br>
              <br>
              When you visit our Website, our servers will automatically collect certain information describing your visit, including your IP address and browser information. This automatically collected information provides us with data regarding the use of the Website.<br>
              <br>
              We may also use a third party to help us gather and analyze information about the areas that you visit on the Website in order to evaluate and improve the customer experience and the convenience of the Website, and to help us evaluate some of the specific information that you provide to us. For example, when you choose to sign up for e-mail, our third-party service provider will help us analyze the information you have provided so that we can personalize your experience when you visit the Website in the future by giving you more of the information that you will find useful. To find out more about our service provider's privacy policy, or if you would like to deactivate our ability to analyze your browsing through the use of this service, please <a href="http://www.coremetrics.com/company/privacy.html#services" target="_blank">click here</a>. <br>
              <br>
              <strong>Use of Cookies</strong><br>
              <br>
              We and some of our third-party service providers use cookies. A cookie is a small text file written by an Internet server to a website user's browser where information is exchanged between them, and which is stored on a computer's hard drive to allow us to recognize and track users on our Website to assist us in providing our customers with a productive online experience. Cookies enable us to store information about your use of our Website such as the areas you visit and the length of your stay. Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies and can be reset by using the "Help" portion of the toolbar to refuse all cookies or indicate when a cookie is being sent. Should you choose to disable any cookies associated with the Website, you will not be able to take full advantage of all the Website's features, but you should be able to navigate the Website without difficulty.<br>
              <br>
              <strong>How We Use the Information We Collect</strong><br>
              <br>
              When we do collect information from you, we may use it for a number of purposes, including to:
            </p><ul><li>process and complete your purchase 
              transaction; 
 
     </li><li>identify your product and service 
              preferences so that we can notify you of new or additional 
              products, services and promotions relating to the TJX Businesses 
              that might be of interest to you; 
 
      </li><li>improve merchandise selections and 
              customer service; 
 
          </li><li>notify you about new services, features, 
              promotions and special offers relating to the TJX Businesses we 
              think you will find valuable; 
 
          </li><li>respond to your inquiries; 
 
         </li><li>administer your participation in 
              promotions, contests and sweepstakes in which you have chosen to 
              participate; 
 
        </li><li>measure the advertising effectiveness of 
              our online and other advertisements and offers; 
 
        </li><li>help us understand Website activity and 
              improve your use of our Website; and 
 
        </li><li>help us prevent fraud, and minimize credit risk.</li></ul>
              In order for us to maintain the accuracy of your personal information and improve our communication with you, we may also combine the information we collect with other public demographic information. On rare occasions we may also be required to disclose your information as is required by law pursuant to lawful requests such as subpoenas, court or agency orders, or as we may reasonably determine to be necessary to protect our rights or the rights of others, to avert harm to persons or property, or to enforce our Website Terms of Use or this Privacy and Security Policy.<br>
              <br>
              <strong>Those With Whom We Share Your Information</strong><br>
              <br>
              We may share your personal information among the TJX Businesses (which are affiliates owned by TJX, including HomeGoods, T.J. Maxx, Marshalls, A.J. Wright, Bob's Stores, Winners, HomeSense, and T.K. Maxx). They may use this information to offer products and services to you consistent with the purposes identified in this statement. Your information may also be transferred as an asset in connection with a merger or sale (including any transfers made as a part of an insolvency or bankruptcy proceeding) involving all or part of the TJX Businesses or as part of a corporate reorganization, stock sale or other change in corporate control.<br>
              <br>
              If a contest, sweepstakes or promotion is jointly sponsored by us and one or more other sponsors, your information may be shared with such sponsors. We do not control other sponsors' use of your personal information, and their use of your information will be in accordance with their own privacy policies. If you do not wish your information to be shared in this manner, you may opt not to participate in such jointly sponsored contests, sweepstakes or promotions. Such promotions may also be subject to additional rules and regulations governing your participation.<br>
              <br>
              We may also share certain personal information we collect about you with third parties who perform services for us or with whom we contract for the purposes described in this Privacy and Security Policy. For example, we may use third parties to host our Website, operate certain of its features, send e-mails, print or send mailings, run our sweepstakes, contests or other promotions, authorize and process your payments, and analyze data and our advertising effectiveness. These third-party service providers are given the information that they need to perform their designated functions and we do not authorize them to use or disclose your personal information for their own or any others' marketing purposes.<br>
              <br>
              <strong>Policies for Children </strong><br>
              <br>
              We do not seek nor will we knowingly collect personal information from anyone under the age of 13.<br>
              <br>
              <strong>Links</strong><br>
              <br>
              When you use our Website, you may discover that it may contain links to other sites that are not owned or operated by the TJX Businesses. Also, links to our Website may be featured on other websites on which we advertise. These links are not intended to be referrals or endorsements of the linked or host sites, and the TJX Businesses do not warrant, represent or assume any responsibility or liability for the accuracy, security, completeness or operation of any linked site (or any site contained in a linked site) or any host site, or the practices or privacy and other policies contained in any linked site (or any site contained in a linked site) or any host site. We advise you to familiarize yourself, therefore, with the specific legal, privacy and security information contained in any such linked or host sites.<br>
              <br>
              Our Website also contains links to other websites operated by the other TJX Businesses. We advise you to review the legal, privacy and security information for each such site to which you link, as the terms and conditions of use and the personal information you provide may vary from website to website. <br>
              <br>
              We may use third parties to serve our advertisements on other websites. These companies may use online tools such as pixel tags to report certain information (but not your name, address, e-mail address or telephone number) about your visits to our Website and the websites which advertise and feature links to our Website, in order to measure the advertising effectiveness of our ads. We contractually restrict these companies from using your personally identifiable information for their own or any others' marketing purposes, or from sharing your personal information with anyone other than the TJX Businesses.<br>
              <br>
              <strong>How We Protect Your Information</strong><br>
              <br>
              We employ various security measures designed to help protect the personal information that we collect from you online. We have instituted software firewalls to protect our servers and network. Unfortunately, no collection or transmission of information over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, and therefore, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any such information.<br>
              <br>

              <strong>NOTICE TO CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS<br>
              <br>
              YOUR CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS</strong><br><a name="CA"></a>
              <br>
              If you are a California resident, California law provides that you be given the opportunity to opt-out of our sharing your personal information with third parties which would use such personal information for direct marketing. Absent such an opt-out, we may share your information with other TJX Businesses (which are affiliates owned by TJX, including HomeGoods, T.J. Maxx, Marshalls, A.J. Wright, and Bob's Stores), to provide you with information about their products, services or promotions that we think may be of interest to you; or your information could be transferred to a successor to HomeGoods in the event of a merger, sale or corporate reorganization involving HomeGoods. Accordingly, per California law, we provide a way for you to opt-out if you do not want us to share your information in this manner.<br>
              <br>
              California residents can opt-out of our sharing your information as described above by contacting Customer Service, Monday - Friday 9:00 a.m. - 5:00 p.m. (Eastern Time) at the following toll-free number: 1-800-888-0776, and requesting that you would like to opt-out from receiving all marketing communications from HomeGoods and all other TJX Businesses. If you have already received communications from us, it will expedite the opt-out process if you are prepared to provide us with the exact name, and e-mail and/or postal mail addresses under which you have been receiving communications from us. Please note that it may take us up to thirty (30) days to fully process your opt-out request.<br>
