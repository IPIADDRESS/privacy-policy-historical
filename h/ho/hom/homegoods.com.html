		<p>In order for us to maintain the accuracy of your personal information and improve our communication with you, we may also combine the information we collect with other public demographic information. </p>	 
			 
		<p><strong>With Whom We Share Your Information </strong></p>
         <p>We may share your personal information among the TJX Businesses (which are affiliates owned by TJX, including T.J. Maxx, HomeGoods, A.J. Wright, Marshalls, Bob’s Stores, Winners, HomeSense, and T.K. Maxx). They may use this information to offer products and services to you consistent with the purposes identified in this statement. Your information may also be transferred as an asset in connection with a merger or sale (including any transfers made as part of insolvency or bankruptcy proceedings) involving all or part of the TJX Businesses or as part of a corporate reorganization, stock sale or other change in corporate control.</p>
		 
<p>If a contest, sweepstakes or promotion is jointly sponsored by us and one or more other sponsors, your information may be shared with such sponsors. We do not control other sponsors' use of your personal information, and their use of your information will be in accordance with their own privacy policies. If you do not wish for your information to be shared in this manner, you may opt not to participate in such jointly sponsored contests, sweepstakes or promotions. Such promotions may also be subject to additional rules and regulations governing your participation.</p>

<p>We may also share certain personal information we collect about you with third parties who perform services for us or with whom we contract for the purposes described in this Privacy Notice. For example, we may use third parties to host our Website, operate certain of its features, send e-mails, print or send mailings, run our sweepstakes, contests or other promotions, conduct customer research, authorize and process your payments, manage and analyze data and our advertising effectiveness, and fulfill gift card orders. These third-party service providers are given the information that they need to perform their designated functions and we do not authorize them to use or disclose your personal information for their own or any others’ marketing purposes.  When you apply for the TJX Rewards™ Card, we share the information you provide with the financial institution that issues the card.</p>

<p>On rare occasions we may also be required to disclose your information as is required by law pursuant to lawful requests such as subpoenas, court or agency orders, or as we may reasonably determine to be necessary to protect our rights or the rights of others, to avert harm to persons or property, or to enforce our Website Terms of Use or this Privacy Notice.

          <p>We do not seek nor will we knowingly collect personal information from anyone under the age of 13. </p>
		  
          <p><strong>Links </strong></p>
          
		  <p>Our Website may contain links to other sites that are not owned or operated by the TJX Businesses. These include links to sites hosted by our service providers or partners where, for example, you may apply for the TJX Rewards™ Card or purchase our gift cards.  Also, links to our Website may be featured on other websites on which we advertise. These links are not intended to be referrals or endorsements of the linked or host sites, and the TJX Businesses do not warrant, represent or assume any responsibility or liability for the accuracy, security, completeness or operation of any linked site (or any site contained in a linked site) or any host site, or the practices or privacy and other policies contained in any linked site (or any site contained in a linked site) or any host site. We advise you to familiarize yourself, therefore, with the specific legal, privacy and security information contained in any such linked or host sites. </p> 

<p>Our Website also contains links to other websites operated by the other TJX Businesses. We advise you to review the legal, privacy and security information for each such site to which you link, as the terms and conditions of use and the personal information you provide may vary from website to website.</p>


          <p><strong>How We Protect Your Information </strong></p>
          <p>We employ various security measures designed to help protect the personal information that we collect from you online. We have instituted software firewalls to help protect our servers and network. Unfortunately, no collection or transmission of information over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, and therefore, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any such information.</p>
