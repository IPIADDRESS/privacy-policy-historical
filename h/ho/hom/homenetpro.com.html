      	<h2 class="h2">Last Updated: 7-24-14</h2>
    <p class="main-p">HomeNetPro.Com strives to 
    offer its visitors the many advantages of Internet technology and to provide 
    an interactive and personalized experience. We may use Personally 
    Identifiable Information (your name, e-mail address, street address, 
    telephone number) subject to the terms of this privacy policy. We will never 
    sell, barter, or rent your email address to any unauthorized third party. 
    Period."</p>
    <h3 class="h3">How we gather information from users</h3>
    <p class="main-p">How we collect and store 
    information depends on the page you are visiting, the activities in which 
    you elect to participate and the services provided. For example, you may be 
    asked to provide information when you register for access to certain 
    portions of our site or request certain features, such as newsletters or 
    when you make a purchase. You may provide information when you participate 
    in sweepstakes and contests, message boards and chat rooms, and other 
    interactive areas of our site. </p>
		<p class="main-p">Like most Web sites, HomeNetPro.Com also 
    collects information automatically and through the use of electronic tools 
    that may be transparent to our visitors. For example, we may log the name of 
    your Internet Service Provider or use cookie technology to recognize you and 
    hold information from your visit. Among other things, the cookie may store 
    your user name and password, sparing you from having to re-enter that 
    information each time you visit, or may control the number of times you 
    encounter a particular advertisement while visiting our site. </p>
		<p class="main-p">As we adopt 
    additional technology, we may also gather information through other means. 
    In certain cases, you can choose not to provide us with information, for 
    example by setting your browser to refuse to accept cookies, but if you do 
    you may be unable to access certain portions of the site or may be asked to 
    re-enter your user name and password, and we may not be able to customize 
    the site’s features according to your preferences.</p>
    <h3 class="h3">What we do with the information we collect</h3>
    <p class="main-p">Like other Web publishers, we 
    collect information to enhance your visit and deliver more individualized 
    content and advertising. We respect your privacy and do not share your 
    information with anyone.</p>
    <p class="main-p">Aggregated Information 
    (information that does not personally identify you) may be used in many 
    ways. For example, we may combine information about your usage patterns with 
    similar information obtained from other users to help enhance our site and 
    services (e.g., to learn which pages are visited most or what features are 
    most attractive). Aggregated Information may occasionally be shared with our 
    advertisers and business partners. Again, this information does not include 
    any Personally Identifiable Information about you or allow anyone to 
    identify you individually.</p>
    <p class="main-p">We may use Personally 
    Identifiable Information collected on HomeNetPro.Com to communicate with you 
    about your registration and customization preferences; our Terms of Service 
    and privacy policy; services and products offered by HomeNetPro.Com and 
    other topics we think you might find of interest.</p>
    <p class="main-p">Personally Identifiable 
    Information collected by HomeNetPro.Com may also be used for other purposes, 
    including but not limited to site administration, troubleshooting, 
    processing of e-commerce transactions, administration of sweepstakes and 
    contests, and other communications with you. Certain third parties who 
    provide technical support for the operation of our site (our Web hosting 
    service for example) may access such information. </p>
		<p class="main-p">We will use your 
    information only as permitted by law. In addition, from time to time as we 
    continue to develop our business, we may sell, buy, merge or partner with 
    other companies or businesses. In such transactions, user information may be 
    among the transferred assets. </p>
		<p class="main-p">We may also disclose your information in 
    response to a court order, at other times when we believe we are reasonably 
    required to do so by law, in connection with the collection of amounts you 
    may owe to us, and/or to law enforcement authorities whenever we deem it 
    appropriate or necessary. Please note we may not provide you with notice 
    prior to disclosure in such cases.</p>
    <h3 class="h3">Affiliated sites, Linked sites and Advertisements</h3>
    <p class="main-p">HomeNetPro.Com expects its 
    partners, advertisers and affiliates to respect the privacy of our users. Be 
    aware, however, that third parties, including our partners, advertisers, 
    affiliates and other content providers accessible through our site, may have 
    their own privacy and data collection policies and practices. For example, 
    during your visit to our site you may link to, or view as part of a frame on 
    a HomeNetPro.Com page, certain content that is actually created or hosted by 
    a third party. </p>
		<p class="main-p">Also, through HomeNetPro.Com you may be introduced to, or be 
    able to access, information, Web sites, features, contests or sweepstakes 
    offered by other parties. HomeNetPro.Com is not responsible for the actions 
    or policies of such third parties. You should check the applicable privacy 
    policies of those third parties when providing information on a feature or 
    page operated by a third party.</p>
    <p class="main-p">While on our site, our 
    advertisers, promotional partners or other third parties may use cookies or 
    other technology to attempt to identify some of your preferences or retrieve 
    information about you. For example, some of our advertising is served by 
    third parties and may include cookies that enable the advertiser to 
    determine whether you have seen a particular advertisement before. </p>
		<p class="main-p">Other 
    features available on our site may offer services operated by third parties 
    and may use cookies or other technology to gather information. 
    HomeNetPro.Com does not control the use of this technology by third parties 
    or the resulting information, and is not responsible for any actions or 
    policies of such third parties.</p>
    <p class="main-p">You should also be aware that 
    if you voluntarily disclose Personally Identifiable Information on message 
    boards or in chat areas, that information can be viewed publicly and can be 
    collected and used by third parties without our knowledge and may result in 
    unsolicited messages from other individuals or third parties. Such 
    activities are beyond the control of HomeNetPro.Com and this policy.</p>
    <h3 class="h3">Children/Minors</h3>
    <p class="main-p">HomeNetPro.Com does not 
    knowingly collect or solicit Personally Identifiable Information from or 
    about children under 13 except as permitted by law. If we discover we have 
    received any information from a child under 13 in violation of this policy, 
    we will delete that information immediately. If you believe HomeNetPro.Com 
    has any information from or about anyone under 13, please contact us at the 
    address listed below.</p>

    mediator in the following location: Carlsbad, NM. Any costs and fees other

    submit the dispute to binding arbitration at the following location: 
    Carlsbad, NM. under the rules of the US Arbitration Association. Judgment 
    upon the award rendered by the arbitration may be entered in any court with 
    jurisdiction to do so.</p>

      <h3 class="h3">What Information Do We Collect?</h3>
      <p class="main-p">When you visit our site you may provide us with two types of information: 
      personal information you actively choose to disclose ("Active 
      Information") and use information collected, in a way not visible to you, 
      on an aggregate anonymous basis as you and others browse our site 
      ("Passive Information").</p>
      <p class="main-p">If you choose to post information on our site or maintain email, snailmail or 
      telephone contact with us, we may retain such information also.</p>
      <h3 class="h3">No Use of Our Site by Persons Under 13</h3>
      <p class="main-p">No person under 13 should disclose information on this site. You may learn 
      more about protecting children's privacy online by visiting www.ftc.gov/kidzprivacy.<b> </b></p>
		<h3 class="h3">Passive Information Collected</h3>
      <p class="main-p">Our site utilizes a standard technology called "cookies" to collect 
      information about how our site is used. Passive Information gathered may 
      include the date and time of visits, the site pages viewed, time spent at 
      our site, the sites visited just before and just after our site. Passive 
      Information is collected on an aggregate basis without any association to 
      your personal information so that you remain anonymous. If you do not wish 
      to transmit "cookie" information about yourself, you may turn off the 
      cookie function in your web browser; please consult the "Help" section of 
      your browser to correctly do so.</p>
      <h3 class="h3">What is a Cookie?</h3>
      <p class="main-p">Cookies are a feature of web browser (Internet Explorer, 
		Firefox, Chrome, Netscape 
      Navigator, etc.) software that allows web servers to recognize the 
      computer used to access a site. They are small pieces of data that are 
      stored by a user's web browser on one site to simplify subsequent 
      interactions with that site by the same user or to use the information to 
      streamline the user's transaction on related web pages. This makes it 
      easier for a user to move from site to site and to complete transactions 
      over the Internet. Cookies should make your online experience easier and 
      more personalized. To find out more about cookies, including how to disable 
      and/or remove cookies, please visit www.cookiecentral.com</p>
		<h3 class="h3">Do-Not-Track</h3>
		<p class="main-p">The Site does not currently respond to browser “do not track” signals or other similar mechanisms.</p>
      <h3 class="h3">How Do We Use the Information Collected?</h3>
      <p class="main-p">Broadly speaking, persons we employ directly, or as contractors or agents 
      at our direction, use Active Information for purposes of administering our 
      business activities, providing customer services such as support, and 
      making available other products or services we think may be of interest to 
      our users. We may use the Active Information or Passive Information you 
      provide to us to contact you about changes to our site, new services, 
      features or products we offer, or other information we think you shall 
      find valuable. If at any time you do not wish to receive such information, 
      please send us an email .</p>
      <p class="main-p">We use Passive Information to gather information about our users and to 
      enhance and design our site to make it easier, faster and friendlier to 
      use. Additionally, cookies help us know information about how many people 
      visit our site, when they visit and how they use our service. We do not 
      connect any of this information to your personal information or email 
      address. However, Passive Information may result in your viewing of 
      particular advertising based on your user habits for your viewing on our 
      site.</p>
      <h3 class="h3">Your Information In Relation to Others We Link To</h3>
      <p class="main-p">You may be able to access other websites through our site. When you do so you 
      are doing so subject to their policies regarding privacy and data 
      collection and you should read those sites' privacy policies to make sure 
      you agree to them before using such sites. When you choose to shop at such 
      sites, you should read their privacy policies to make sure you agree to 
      them before making purchases.</p>
      <h3 class="h3">Sharing Information with Advertisers or Other Third Parties</h3>
      <p class="main-p">We may disclose anonymous information about user habits, characteristics and 
      user patterns, based on aggregate user statistics to advertisers on our 
      site.</p>
      <h3 class="h3">Sharing Information with the Government or As Otherwise Required by Law</h3>
      <p class="main-p">We may be required by law or government agency to disclose both Active and 
      Passive Information you have provided to us. If you were referred by an 
      affiliate partner of ours, your name and email address may be shared with 
      them when you place an order at our site.</p>
      <h3 class="h3">How Do We Secure Active Information and Passive Information?</h3>
      <p class="main-p">We secure your personal information submitted by you by using reasonable 
      efforts to prevent unauthorized access or disclosure, or accidental loss 
      or destruction of Active Information and Passive Information. Your 
      postings on this site and other communications you may have with us via 
      email or snail mail may not be secure unless we advise you that security 
      measures are in place prior to your sending information. Therefore, if you 
      choose to communicate with us through these means, you are assuming the 
      risk of doing so and we request that you do not send or post sensitive 
      information through these means.</p>
      <h3 class="h3">How Can You Choose Not to Receive Information About Products or Services 
      By Us or to Correct, Delete or Access Your Information</h3>
      <p class="main-p">If you desire not to receive information about products or services we think 
      may be of interest to you or if you wish to access, delete or correct you 
      information, please send us an email to support (at) homenetpro.com</p>
      <p class="main-p">We reserve the right to revise this policy at our discretion. Please check
