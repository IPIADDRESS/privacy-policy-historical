    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial" size="2"><strong>How we gather information 
    from users:</strong></font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial" size="2">How we collect and store 
    information depends on the page you are visiting, the activities in which 
    you elect to participate and the services provided. For example, you may be 
    asked to provide information when you register for access to certain 
    portions of our site or request certain features, such as newsletters or 
    when you make a purchase. You may provide information when you participate 
    in sweepstakes and contests, message boards and chat rooms, and other 
    interactive areas of our site. Like most Web sites, HomeNetPro.Com also 
    collects information automatically and through the use of electronic tools 
    that may be transparent to our visitors. For example, we may log the name of 
    your Internet Service Provider or use cookie technology to recognize you and 
    hold information from your visit. Among other things, the cookie may store 
    your user name and password, sparing you from having to re-enter that 
    information each time you visit, or may control the number of times you 
    encounter a particular advertisement while visiting our site. As we adopt 
    additional technology, we may also gather information through other means. 
    In certain cases, you can choose not to provide us with information, for 
    example by setting your browser to refuse to accept cookies, but if you do 
    you may be unable to access certain portions of the site or may be asked to 
    re-enter your user name and password, and we may not be able to customize 
    the siteâ€™s features according to your preferences.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial" size="2"><strong>What we do with the 
    information we collect:</strong></font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial" size="2">Like other Web publishers, we 
    collect information to enhance your visit and deliver more individualized 
    content and advertising. We respect your privacy and do not share your 
    information with anyone.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial" size="2">Aggregated Information 
    (information that does not personally identify you) may be used in many 
    ways. For example, we may combine information about your usage patterns with 
    similar information obtained from other users to help enhance our site and 
    services (e.g., to learn which pages are visited most or what features are 
    most attractive). Aggregated Information may occasionally be shared with our 
    advertisers and business partners. Again, this information does not include 
    any Personally Identifiable Information about you or allow anyone to 
    identify you individually.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial" size="2">We may use Personally 
    Identifiable Information collected on HomeNetPro.Com to communicate with you 
    about your registration and customization preferences; our Terms of Service

    other topics we think you might find of interest.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial" size="2">Personally Identifiable

    including but not limited to site administration, troubleshooting, 
    processing of e-commerce transactions, administration of sweepstakes and 
    contests, and other communications with you. Certain third parties who 
    provide technical support for the operation of our site (our Web hosting 
    service for example) may access such information. We will use your 
    information only as permitted by law. In addition, from time to time as we 
    continue to develop our business, we may sell, buy, merge or partner with 
    other companies or businesses. In such transactions, user information may be 
    among the transferred assets. We may also disclose your information in 
    response to a court order, at other times when we believe we are reasonably 
    required to do so by law, in connection with the collection of amounts you 
    may owe to us, and/or to law enforcement authorities whenever we deem it 
    appropriate or necessary. Please note we may not provide you with notice 
    prior to disclosure in such cases.</font></p>

    their own privacy and data collection policies and practices. For example, 
    during your visit to our site you may link to, or view as part of a frame on

    third parties and may include cookies that enable the advertiser to 
    determine whether you have seen a particular advertisement before. Other 
    features available on our site may offer services operated by third parties 
    and may use cookies or other technology to gather information. 
    HomeNetPro.Com does not control the use of this technology by third parties

      Cookies are a feature of web browser (Internet Explorer, Netscape 
      Navigator, etc.) software that allows web servers to recognize the 
      computer used to access a site. They are small pieces of data that are 
      stored by a user's web browser on one site to simplify subsequent 
      interactions with that site by the same user or to use the information to 
      streamline the user's transaction on related web pages. This makes it 
      easier for a user to move from site to site and to complete transactions
