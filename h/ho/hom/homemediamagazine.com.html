Also, we rent e-mail lists compiled from e-mail addresses gathered from our sites.

On-line registration   and website usage is restricted to adults who are professionally engaged in   the businesses we serve. No one under age 13 is allowed to provide any personal   information or use any public discussion areas, forums and chats comprising   part of our sites. Minors between the ages of 13 and 17 must get the permission   of their parent(s) or legal guardian(s) before making purchases, including   subscriptions, on our sites. In the event that we learn we have collected any   personal information from a child under the age of 13 without verification   of parental consent, we will delete that information from our database as quickly   as possible</p> <h4><br>   <strong>Updating Visitor Information</strong></h4> <p>Many of our Site functions (but not all) provide you with the option of correcting,   updating and modifying your personal and/or financial information, or visitor   profile, at any time and as often as desired. The only item of information   you cannot change is your username ID selected at registration for a trade   show, event or conference.</p> <h4><strong>Third Party and Affiliated Links</strong></h4> <p>Our sites may from time to time contain external links to other websites,   including suppliers, advertisers and affiliates. We have no control over, and   are not responsible for, the content of, or information gathered by, these   other websites. We do not endorse any of these websites or the products or   services associated with such websites merely because they are linked to any   of our sites. In addition, users of our sites should also be aware that, when   you voluntarily disclose personal information in chat areas or bulletin boards,   that information may be collected by others and may result in unsolicited messages   from others.</p> <h4><strong>Cookies</strong></h4> <p>A “cookie” is a bit of data sent by a website through the browser   to the computer of the user visiting the site, and enables our sites to return   the results the browser expects. We may use temporary, session-specific cookies   to ensure visits to our sites is smooth and customized for the visitor – for   example, to control the display of ads, to track usage patterns on our sites,   to deliver editorial content, and to record registration and personalization   information. Such cookies allow us to provide a visitor’s browser with   information tailored to the visitor’s preferences and needs. We also may   use permanent or persistent cookies that remain on a visitor’s computer   after the visitor leaves our sites. We use this data on an anonymous basis   and we do not correlate this information with personal data of any user.</p> <p>Most website browsers automatically accept cookies, but you may be able to   turn off the cookie acceptance option in your browser’s settings. However, disabling   the cookie support function of the browser may prevent some portions of our sites   from functioning properly, and you may not be able to utilize fully all of our   sites’ features and information.<br>   We may from time to time use advertising companies to develop banner ads for   our sites. These ads may contain cookies that may be sent to your browser through   the banner ads. We do not have control over cookies placed by our advertisers,   nor do we have access to any information their cookies may collect.</p> <h4><strong>Opt-Out Option</strong></h4> <p>Visitors to our sites can decide if they want to receive targeted promotional   information from Questex Media Group or targeted promotional information sponsored   by our marketing partners. On the visitor registration pages, prospective visitors   can choose to request that we not e-mail them advertising and promotional information   from Questex Media Group or our partners. Should visitors accept promotional   email from Questex Media Group, any email they receive will include instructions   on how to be removed from our promotional email list.</p> <p>If you do not wish to have your personally identifying information shared,   or if you do not wish to receive future commercial communications from us by   e-mail, you may change your preferences at any time simply by: (i) writing   to us (and please include your e-mail address), or (ii) by following the unsubscribe   instructions contained within the e-mail you receive from us. We will update   your preferences as soon as is reasonably practicable. If you have registered   on any part of our sites, please use the mechanism on our sites that allows   you to change or update your profile, preferences or information, if available,   to keep all such data accurate and up-to-date. The only item of information   you cannot change is your username ID selected at registration for a trade   show, event or conference.</p> <p>Please note that if you opt-out as described above, we will not be able to   remove your personal information from the databases of third parties with which   we have already shared your personal information (i.e., to which we have provided   your personal information prior to our receipt of your opt-out request).</p> <p>If you choose to remove yourself from our lists by opting-out as described   above, we will make every reasonable effort to forward your opt-out request   (including your e-mail address) to the specific third-party marketer whose   offer you received from us prompting your opt-out or unsubscribe request, so   that it can include your e-mail address on its own do-not-email list; however,   Questex Media Group does not bear any responsibility for ensuring that any   third party complies with your opt-out or unsubscribe request vis-à-vis   its own lists.</p> <h4><strong>Security and Encryption</strong></h4> <p>We use procedural and technical safeguards to protect your personal information   against loss or theft as well as unauthorized access and disclosure to protect   your privacy, including encryption, “firewalls” and Secure Socket   Layers. We treat data as an asset that must be protected against loss and unauthorized   access. We employ many different security techniques to protect such data from   unauthorized access by users inside and outside the company. However, “perfect   security” does not exist on the Internet.</p> <h4><strong>Privacy Statement Coordinator</strong></h4> <p>If you have any questions regarding our privacy statement, please feel free   to contact us by letter at the address below, or by e-mail at <script language="JavaScript" type="text/javascript">
