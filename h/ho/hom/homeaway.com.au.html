      <h2 align="center">Privacy Statement</h2>
      <p><strong>1. PURPOSE</strong> <br>
We are committed to the protection of personal privacy as required under the
  Privacy Act 1988 (Cth) ("the Privacy Act") and have adopted a set
  of privacy principles based on the National Privacy Principles contained in
  Schedule 3 of the Privacy Act. </p>
      <p><strong>2. Our Privacy Protection Principles are: <br>
        </strong><em>Principle 1 - Collection</em> <br>
  We will only collect personal information that is necessary for one or more
  of its functions or activities. We will only collect personal information by
  lawful and fair means and not in an unreasonably intrusive way. At or before
  the time (or, if that is not practicable, as soon as practicable thereafter),
  we collect personal information about an individual from the individual, we
  will take reasonable steps to ensure that the individual is aware of: <br>
  (a) How to contact us<br>
  (b) The fact that he or she is able to gain access to the information;<br>
  (c) The purposes for which the information is collected;<br>
  (d) The organisation to which we usually discloses information of that kind;
  and<br>
  (e) The main consequences (if any) for the individual if all or part of the
  information is not provided.</p>
      <p> If it is reasonable and practicable to do so, we will collect personal
        information about an individual only from that individual. If we collect
        personal information about an individual from someone else, we will take
        reasonable steps to ensure that the individual is or has been made aware
        of the matters listed from (a) to (e). </p>
      <p> <em>Principle 2 - Use &amp; Disclosure </em><br>
  We will only use or disclose personal information about an individual for a
    purpose other than the primary purpose of collection (a secondary purpose)
    if:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Both of the following apply:
            <ol>
              <li> The secondary purpose is related to the primary purpose of
                collection and, if the personal information is sensitive information,
                directly related to the primary purpose of collection;</li>
              <li> the individual would reasonably expect us to use or disclose
                the information for the secondary purpose; or</li>
            </ol>
        </li><li> The individual has consented to the use or disclosure; </li>
      </ul>
      <p><em>Principle 3 - Data Quality</em> <br>
  We will take reasonable steps to make sure that the personal information it
    collects, uses or discloses is accurate, complete and up-to-date. </p>
      <p><em>Principle 4 - Data Security</em><br>
  We will take reasonable steps to protect the personal information it holds
    from misuse and loss and from unauthorised access, modification or disclosure.<br>
  We will take reasonable steps to destroy or permanently de-identify personal
  information if it is no longer needed for any purpose for which the information
  may be used or disclosed under our Privacy Protection Principle 2. </p>
      <p><em>Principle 5 - Openness</em><br>
  We will set out in a document clearly expressed policies on its management
    of personal information. We will make the document available to anyone who
    asks for it. On request by an individual, we will take reasonable steps to
    let the individual know, generally, what sort of personal information it
    holds, for what purposes, and how it collects, uses, and discloses that information. </p>
      <p><em>Principle 6 - Access and Correction </em><br>
  If we hold personal information about an individual, we will provide the individual
    with access to the information on request by the individual, in a form or
    manner suitable to the individual's reasonable needs. </p>
      <p><em>Principle 7 - Identifiers </em><br>
  Except as specifically authorised under the Privacy Act, we will not adopt
    as its own identifier of an individual an identifier of the individual that
    has been assigned by: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>An agency; or </li>
        <li> An agent of an agency acting in its capacity as agent; or</li>
        <li>A contracted service provider for a Commonwealth contract acting
          in its capacity as contracted service provider for that contract. </li>
      </ul>
      <p>We will not use or disclose an identifier assigned to an individual
        by an agency (or by an agent or contracted service provider mentioned
        above) unless: </p>
      <ul>
        <li> The use of disclosure is necessary for us to fulfill its obligations
          to the agency;</li>
        <li>One or more of paragraphs in Privacy Protection Principle 2 above
          apply to the use or disclosure; or</li>
        <li>The use or disclosure is permitted under the regulations to the Privacy
          Act.<br>
                    <em>Note</em> - the terms 'agency' and 'contracted service
                    provider' in Privacy Protection Principle 7 are defined in
                    the Privacy Act, but, in general, relate to Commonwealth
                    Government agencies. </li>
      </ul>
      <p><em>Principle 8 - Anonymity</em> <br>
  Wherever it is lawful and practicable, individuals will have the option of
    not identifying themselves when entering transactions with us. However, in
    most cases it will not be practicable for the transactions to proceed to
    finality or for us to provide pre and post-paid services without requiring
    their identification. </p>
      <p><em>Principle 9 - Sensitive Information </em><br>
  We will not collect Sensitive Information about an individual unless:</p>
      <ul>
        <li> the individual has consented; or</li>
        <li> the collection is required by law; or</li>
        <li>the collection is necessary to prevent or lessen a serious and imminent
          threat to the life or health of any individual, where the individual
          whom the information concerns:</li>
        <li>is physically or legally incapable of giving consent to the collection;
          or</li>
        <li>physically cannot communicate consent to the collection; or</li>
        <li>the collection is necessary for the establishment, exercise or defence
          of a legal or equitable claim.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><em>Principle 10 - Privacy of Network Communications</em><br>
  When installing, operating, or maintaining our network, we will take whatever
    measures are practicable, or are required by law, to ensure the privacy of
    communications passing over our network. </p>
      <p><em>Principle 11 - New Services and Developments and Procedures.</em><br>
  we will consider the privacy impact of new business processes and services
    before they are introduced.</p>
      <p>Privacy expectations<br>
  We will provide services with privacy standards that are commensurate with
    community expectations and which enables individual customers to choose a
    higher degree of privacy protection where practicable.</p>
      <p>Privacy implications of change<br>
  The privacy impact arising from the introduction of the new services or products
    will be balanced against their benefit to the general community and will
    take into consideration the extent, means and cost by which privacy concerns
    can be mitigated. Where practicable, we will provide customers with the ability
    to choose between differing degrees of privacy protection. </p>
      <p><em>Principle 12 - Compliance Audit</em><br>
  We will maintain an independent compliance audit program to ensure its Privacy
    Protection Principles and policies remain appropriate and that we operate
    in compliance with those Principles and policies. </p>
      <p><strong>3 DEFINITIONS </strong><br>

  or an opinion forming part of a database), whether true or not, and whether
  recorded in a material form or not, about an individual whose identity is apparent,
  or can reasonably be ascertained, from the information or opinion.<br>
