	<h1><a name="top"></a>Privacy Policy</h1>
<br class="spc">
<p class="aboutText">Homescape.com respects the privacy of its users. 
  In this document we explain how we use information you supply 
  us via the Homescape.com web site. This privacy policy may 
  be modified in the future. If it is, a new policy will be 
  posted on our web sites.</p>
<p class="aboutText">Homescape.com is not responsible for the content 
  or the privacy policies of any web sites to which it may link.</p>
<p class="aboutText"><strong>What personal information do we collect?</strong></p>

<p class="aboutText"><strong>Registration:</strong> When you sign 
  up to use one of our services, request a price quote or enter 
  a contest, we may specifically ask for information about you, 
  including name, age, address, phone number, and demographic 
  information. Registrants must be 18 years of age and agree 
  to the terms and conditions of the web site.</p>
<p class="aboutText"><strong>Premium Services:</strong> Some parts 
  of our web site may use an order form for you to request optional 
  services. We collect a visitor's credit card information to 
  bill the user for these optional services. All other areas 
  of our web site are free.</p>
<p class="aboutText"><strong>Cookies:</strong> Cookies are small 
  text files that are placed on your computer's hard drive by 
  our computers (or servers) to identify your computer. Cookies 
  are only read by the server that placed them there and are 
  unable to execute any code or virus. We use cookies to recognize 
  you when you visit our site, to personalize your experience 
  and generally to serve you better. For example, if you have 
  entered your ZIP code on one of our forms, it is stored in 
  a cookie so you do not have to enter it again. Cookies can 
  also tell us which advertising you have seen on our site, 
  allowing us to offer you a more diverse selection of advertising 
  information. Cookies may also compile data (which is not identifiable 
  to any specific individual) about our visitors and may be 
  shared with other companies such as an outside advertising 
  company.</p>

<p class="aboutText"><strong>IP Addresses:</strong> Homescape.com 
  also compiles IP addresses, the location of your computer 
  on the Internet, for administrative purposes</p>

<p class="aboutText"><strong>How do we use the information we collect?</strong></p>
<p class="aboutText">Homescape.com may perform statistical analyses 
  of user behavior in order to measure interest in the various 
  areas of our site, for development purposes, and to inform 
  advertisers and partners about consumers clicking on their 
  advertising or other messages. In these analyses, we will 
  disclose information to third parties only in aggregate form.</p>
<p class="aboutText"><strong>E-mail:</strong> Using the e-mail addresses 
  provided by registrants, Homescape.com, its advertisers, affiliates, 
  partners, or third parties may periodically send promotional 
  e-mail. In any case where we might use an email address for 
  this purpose, you will be able to indicate at registration 
  that you do not wish to receive such promotional e-mails from 
  Homescape.com, its advertisers, affiliates, partners or third 
  parties. However, by registering, you agree that Homescape.com 
  may contact you by e-mail regarding account status, changes 
  to the registrant agreement, and to confirm registration. 
  In addition, if you provide your email address or other contact 
  data in connection with a request for product information, 
  Homescape.com, an advertiser, affiliate, partner or third 
  parties, as applicable, will use that information to contact 
  you.</p>

<p class="aboutText"><strong>Data Security:</strong> To prevent 
  unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy and ensure the 
  appropriate use of information, we have put in place appropriate 
  procedures to protect the information we collect online, including 
  reasonable and appropriate security for credit card submissions.</p>
<p class="aboutText"><strong>What is Homescape.com's relationship 
  with affiliates and business partners?</strong></p>
<p class="aboutText">We have close relationships with affiliated 
  newspapers and other business partners. Certain of those affiliates 
  and partners have web pages that are branded both with our 
  trademarks and the trademarks of our business partners. You 
  may visit us through a co-branded page that is, for example, 
  a Homescape.com page that is co-branded with XYZ Newspaper's 
  web site.</p>
<p class="aboutText"><strong>With whom do we share the information 
  we collect?</strong></p>
<p class="aboutText">In the future, Homescape.com may share your 
  personally identifiable information with third parties for 
  direct marketing purposes, but only if you have authorized 
  Homescape.com to do so. At the present time, Homescape.com 
  will only share personally identifiable information with third 
  parties as is necessary for those third parties to provide 
  information or perform services specifically requested by 
  you. Additionally, if you entered the Homescape.com web site 
  through a site maintained by one of our affiliates or business 
  partners, then your personally identifiable information may 
  be shared with that affiliate or business partner, provided 
  that use of the information does not violate this privacy 
  policy.</p>

<p class="aboutText"><strong>Message Boards:</strong> Homescape.com 
  may offer message boards, or forums, on some of its web sites. 
  Any information you disclose when posting a message in these 
  forums becomes public. Moreover, registrants who post a message 
  in our forums make their e-mail addresses available to others 
  through a feature of our software, which could result in unsolicited 
  e-mail from third parties.</p>
<p class="aboutText"><strong>Children's Guidelines:</strong> We 
  believe that it is especially important to protect children's 
  privacy online. Note: we define "children" as minors 
  younger than 13. We do not knowingly collect or use any personal 
  information from children. We do not knowingly allow children 
  to register with us, or to participate in any of our promotions 
  or contests. We encourage parents to get involved with your 
  children's online usage and to be aware of the activities 
  in which they are participating. You should be aware that 
  if your child voluntarily discloses his or her name, e-mail 
  address, or other information on any web site, such disclosures 
  may result in unsolicited messages.</p>
<p class="aboutText"><strong>Does this privacy statement extend 
  to links to other sites?</strong></p>

<p class="aboutText">This site contains links to other sites. While 
  we encourage our business partners to adopt privacy policies 
  that build users' trust and confidence in the Internet, we 
  are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content 
  of web sites linked to any of our sites. We may allow third 
  parties to sponsor promotions and sweepstakes through our 
  site. Use of any personal information provided to such a third 
  party will be governed by that party's privacy policy.</p>
  
  <p class="aboutText"><strong>Collection of certain information by Homescape.com and third parties</strong></p>

<p class="aboutText">Homescape.com, newspaper affiliates, business partners and other third parties may collect information about you when using the site through the use of cookies and web beacons. For example, Homescape.com uses third-party companies to serve advertisements when you visit the site and to collect statistical information regarding site usage. Third-party advertising companies may use non-personally identifiable information about your visits to the site and other websites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. In addition, Homescape.com may share statistical and behavioral data about visitors to this site with these third-party advertising companies for the purpose of managing and targeting advertisements on this site and on other websites. These third-party advertising companies may note some of the pages you visit on the site through the use of web beacons. In the course of serving advertisements to you, these third-party advertising companies may also place or recognize a unique "cookie" on your computer to allow them to recognize web beacons and otherwise improve advertising effectiveness. If you would like more information about the information collection practices of some of these third party advertising companies and learn which of these companies allow you to opt-out of this type of information collection, please click here.</p>
