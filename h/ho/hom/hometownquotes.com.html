              and its affiliates respect your right to confidentiality and do 
              not share your personally identifiable information unless it is 
              at your request to carry out a transaction or provide a service, 
              with your authorization, or as permitted by law. Even in that case, 
              when you submit information to HometownQuotes.Com, you authorize 
              us to share this information only with the qualified network of 
              HometownQuotes.Com members. Accordingly, we will continue to do 
              everything we can to ensure that your personally identifiable information

              sponsors unless you express an interest in the offer by e-mail or 
              by phone. You have the option to decline such offers and be removed
