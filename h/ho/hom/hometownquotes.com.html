<p><strong>Cookies, Web Beacons, and Other Information Collected Using Technology:</strong> HometownQuotes.com currently uses cookie and web beacon technology to associate certain internet-related information about you with information about you in its database. Additionally, HometownQuotes.com may use other new and evolving sources of information in the future.</p>
<p><strong>Cookies:</strong> “Cookies” are a feature on your browser software. If enabled, we may write cookies that may store small amounts of data on your computer about your visit to any of the pages of this website. Cookies assist us in tracking which of our features appeal the most to you and what content you may have viewed on past visits. When you visit this site again, cookies can enable us to customize our content according to your preferences. We may use cookies for the following: keep track of the number of return visits to this site; accumulate and report aggregate, statistical information on website usage; deliver specific content to you based on your interests or past viewing history; save your password for ease of access to our website. You can disable cookies, although our website may not function properly for you. Your browser preferences can be modified to accept or reject all cookies or request a notification when a cookie is set. We also use cookies to improve the performance of our advertising on other websites. Although you may not opt out of receiving online advertisements generally, you may control the collection of data on our site used for targeted GNC.com advertising during your visits to other websites. To opt-out of GNC.com data collection for targeted advertising on other sites, click here: <a href="http://media.hometownquotes.com/optout.html" target="_blank">Opt Out Now</a></p>
<p><strong>Web Beacons:</strong> A web beacon is a programming code that can be used to display an image on a web page but can also be used to transfer your unique user identification to a database and associate you with previously acquired information about an individual in a database. This allows HometownQuotes.com to track certain websites you visit. Web beacons are used to track online behavioral habits for marketing purposes to determine products or services you may be interested in. In addition to using web beacons on web pages, HometownQuotes.com may also use web beacons in email messages sent to individuals listed in HometownQuotes.com’s database.</p>
<p><strong>IP Addresses:</strong> HometownQuotes.com automatically tracks certain information based upon your behavior on the site. We may use this information to do internal research on our user’s demographics, interests, and behavior to better understand, protect and serve you and our community. This information may include the URL that you just came from (whether this URL is on the site or not), which URL you go to next (whether this URL is on the site or not), your computer browser information, and your IP address. Your Internet Protocol (“IP”) is a unique Internet “address” which is assigned to you by your Internet Service Provider (“ISP”). For local area network (“LAN”), DSL, or cable modem users, an IP address may be permanently assigned to a particular computer. IP addresses are automatically logged by web servers, collecting information about a user’s traffic patterns. While the IP address does not identify an individual by name, it may, with the cooperation of the ISP, be used to locate and identify an individual using the web. Your IP address can, however, reveal what geographic area you are connecting from, or which ISP you are using. Finally, other websites you visit have IP addresses, and we may collect the IP addresses of those websites and their pages.</p>
<p><strong>Computer Profiles:</strong> HometownQuotes.com may also collect and accumulate other anonymous data which will help us understand and analyze the internet experience of our visitors. For instance, HometownQuotes.com may accumulate visitor data relating to referring domain names, the type of browsers used, operating system software, screen resolutions, color capabilities, browser plug-ins, language settings, cookie preferences, search-engine keywords and JavaScript enablement. When you provide us with Personal Information, we are able to use such visitor data to identify you.</p>
<p><strong>Data Analysis:</strong> Data analysis technology may be employed from time to time if used by a client of HometownQuotes.com.</p>
<p><strong>New Technology:</strong> The use of technology on the Internet, including cookies and web beacons, is rapidly developing. As a result, HometownQuotes.com strongly encourages individuals to revisit this Privacy Policy for any updates regarding its use of new technology.</p>
<p><strong>No Information Collected from Children:</strong> HometownQuotes.com will never knowingly collect any Personal Information about children under the age of 13. If HometownQuotes.com obtains actual knowledge that it has collected Personal Information about a child under the age of 13, that information will be immediately deleted from its database. Because it does not collect such information, HometownQuotes.com has no such information to use or to disclose to third parties. HometownQuotes.com has designed this policy in order to comply with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”).</p>

<p><strong>Email and Unsubscribe Policy:</strong> HometownQuotes.com uses Personal Information to provide promotional offers by email to individuals. HometownQuotes.com may maintain separate email lists for different purposes. If email recipients wish to end their email subscription from a particular list, they need to follow the instructions at the end of each email message to unsubscribe from the particular list. This website also allows visitors to unsubscribe from this offer so that they will not receive future messages. After unsubscribing we will discontinue sending the particular messages as soon as technically feasible. HometownQuotes.com’s unsubscribe process impacts only the future delivery of electronic mailings disseminated by HometownQuotes.com on its own behalf. You may still receive electronic mailings sent on behalf of third parties and your Personal Information may still be shared with third parties for use in offline marketing and data appends, including email appends. You should also note that unsubscribing from HometownQuotes.com’s electronic mailings will not automatically unsubscribe the subscriber’s information from any third-party business associates and licensees of the data. Since third-party associates and licensee partners maintain separate databases from HometownQuotes.com, and you will need to unsubscribe from each source individually, if desired. This allows you the freedom to pick and choose which subscriptions to maintain and which to discontinue.</p>
<p><strong>Content of Email Messages:</strong> In certain commercial email messages sent by HometownQuotes.com, an advertiser’s name will appear in the “From” line but hitting the “Reply” button will cause a reply email to be sent to HometownQuotes.com. The “Subject” line of HometownQuotes.com’s email messages will usually contain a line provided from the advertiser to HometownQuotes.com.</p>
<p><strong>Solicited Email:</strong> HometownQuotes.com may notify you by email of special promotions offered by the insurance agents and underwriters in our network and/or other service or product providers. By registering and using this website you are agreeing to receive email from HometownQuotes.com or from third parties with whom HometownQuotes.com shares information in accordance with this Privacy Policy, or to individuals who have agreed on a third-party website to receive email from third parties. As such, HometownQuotes.com does not send unsolicited email messages. As a result, United States statutes requiring certain formatting for unsolicited email are not applicable to HometownQuotes.com’s email messages.</p>
<p><strong>Targeted Advertising:</strong> HometownQuotes.com uses Personal Information to target advertising to an individual. When an individual is using the internet, HometownQuotes.com may use technology to associate an individual with that person’s Personal Information, and HometownQuotes.com attempts to show advertising for products and services in which the person has expressed an interest in the surveys, indicated an interest by means of its technology, and otherwise. HometownQuotes.com may, at its discretion, target advertising by using email, direct mail, telephones, cell phones, SMS, text messaging and other means of communication to provide promotional offers.</p>

We will use the information we obtain in connection with our SMS Service in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

<p><strong>Profiles of Individuals:</strong> HometownQuotes.com uses Personal Information to make a profile of an individual.
