 </ul>

 </li>
 <li>
 
 <p><u>Information Voluntarily Provided About Your Travel Companion(s)</u></p>
 <p>When you make a reservation for someone else through our Online Services, we will request personal information and travel preferences about that individual. You should obtain the consent of any other individual(s) prior to providing us with their personal information and travel preferences.&nbsp; Your travel companion's information will only be available to view and amend through your account.&nbsp; Should your travel companion want to amend or delete their information themselves they can contact us directly at the information in the “Contact Us” section at the bottom of this policy.&nbsp;</p>
 </li>
 <li>
 
 <p><u>Information that we collect automatically</u></p>

 <p>When you visit us on our Online Services, we may collect certain information automatically from your device.&nbsp; In some countries, including countries in the European Economic Area, this information may be considered personal information under applicable data protection laws.</p>

 <p>Specifically, the information we collect automatically may include, but is not limited to, information like your IP address, device type, unique device identification numbers, browser-type (such as Firefox, Safari, or Internet Explorer), your Internet Service Provider (ISP), your operating system and carrier.&nbsp; For website users, details of any referring website or exit pages as well as broad geographic location (e.g., country or city-level location) may also be collected.&nbsp;</p>

 <p>We may also collect other technical information such as how your device has interacted with our Online Services, including the pages accessed and links clicked, for example, trips viewed and the time and date of these.&nbsp;</p>

 <p>Collecting this information enables us to better understand the visitors who come to our Online Services, where they come from, and what content on our Online Services is of interest to them.&nbsp; We use this information for our internal analytics purposes and to improve the quality and relevance of our Online Services for our visitors, for example, to customize your user experience, tailor your searches and show you advertisements that may be of interest. We may also use this automatic information to prevent and detect fraud.</p>

 <p>Some of this information may be collected using cookies and similar tracking technology, as explained further under the heading “Cookies and similar tracking technology.”</p>
 </li>
 <li>


 <p><em><u>Information we collect when you use Apps</u></em></p>

 <p>When you use one of your smart phone app, tablet app, or applications for other platforms (collectively “App” or “Apps” as applicable), we may also collect, for example:</p>

 <ul>
 
 <li>Information about the functionality of the Apps you access and use. This allows us to identify those areas of the Apps that are of interest to our customers so that we can refine and continuously improve the Apps.</li>
 <li>Your device’s unique device identifier (“UID”). Each App sends us the device's UID, a sequence of numbers or characters that are unique to your device. We use this on the first opening of the App so that we can confirm to our advertising networks the number of downloads resulting from clicks on their respective ad banners and other marketing tools. When an email address is provided, we associate this with your current UID/cookie ID for the purposes of providing a seamless experience across your devices.&nbsp;</li>
 <li>Information about your current location. When you use an App’s ‘find hotels near your current location’ or similar features that suggest relevant content based on location, or otherwise provide location-based services, we use information about your current location – provided by your device using GPS or similar technologies – to show relevant content or other localized information. We do not collect location data unless you expressly use a location-based feature, and you can switch off location data collection at any time through your phone settings menu.</li>
 <li>Error reporting information. This enables us to investigate the error and to improve the stability of the App for future releases. As part of these error reports, the App sends us information about the mobile device type and version, the UID, the time the error occurred, the feature being used and the state of the application when the error occurred. We may use this information to investigate and remediate the error and to assist you in completing an impacted booking.</li>
 </ul>


 <p>You have the ability to control what information an App sends to us. You can exercise this control either by changing the settings of the App under its setting menu or changing the settings of your mobile device. Alternatively, you can remove the App from your device entirely and access our services through our website.</p>

 </li>
 <li>
 <p><em><u>Information that we obtain from third party sources</u></em></p>

 <p>Periodically, we lawfully obtain personal information about you from affiliated entities, business partners and other independent third-party sources and add it to our account information. Examples of information we may receive includes updated contact information like email, purchase history, and demographic information.</p>
 </li>

 <p>When using a social media feature, if you have chosen to include personal information in your social media account, we may access information such as your name, profile picture, gender, birthday, email address, town or district and any other information you have chosen to make available.

Call recordings will be maintained consistent with this Privacy Policy.&nbsp; Any personal information obtained from you during the call will be treated in accordance with the provisions of this Privacy Policy.</p>

<ul class="spaced">
 <li><strong>Our group companies</strong> at times may share your personal information with our affiliated companies within the Expedia Group family, listed at the <a href="https://www.expediagroup.com/">expediagroup.com</a> website.&nbsp; This sharing enables us, for example, to enhance the products and services we offer, as well as potentially provide you with information about products and services, both travel-related and other, which we believe might interest you.&nbsp; Also, if you inquire about booking a vacation rental stay through another Expedia Group brand, such as HomeAway, we may on occasion share, for example, the number of your prior trips and any status level you have with an Expedia Group brand with the vacation rental owner, so they may have additional reassurance in approving your stay.&nbsp; To the extent that our parent company and corporate affiliates have access to your information, they will follow practices that are at least as restrictive as the practices described in this Privacy Policy. They will also take appropriate steps to comply with applicable laws governing the transmission of promotional communications and, at a minimum, give you an opportunity in any promotional email they send to choose not to receive such email messages from them in the future.</li>
 <li><strong>Third party services providers</strong> who provide data processing services to us (for example, to support the delivery of; provide functionality on; or help to enhance the security of our Online Services), or who otherwise process personal information for purposes such as credit card processing, business analytics, customer service, marketing, distribution of surveys or sweepstakes programs, and fraud prevention.&nbsp; Where third-party service providers have access to data they will only collect information as needed to perform their functions. They are not permitted to share or use the information for any other purpose.</li>
 <li><strong>Business partners</strong> with whom we may jointly offer products or services, or whose products or services may be offered on our Online Services.&nbsp; You can tell when a third-party business partner is involved in a product or service you have requested because their name will appear, either alone or with ours.&nbsp; If you choose to access these optional services, we will on occasions share information about you, including your personal information, with those partners. An example of a business partner would be a third-party loyalty program that you will earn points for, through a booking.</li>
 <li><strong>Travel suppliers</strong> such as hotel, airline, car rental, insurance, Property Owners, and, where available, activity providers, rail and cruise lines, who fulfil your travel reservations.&nbsp; Services provided by a third-party supplier are generally described as such.&nbsp; Please note that these suppliers also may contact you as necessary to obtain additional information about you, facilitate your travel reservation, or respond to a review you may submit in accordance with their own independent Privacy Policy. From time to time we may share anonymous reviews with our hotel suppliers.&nbsp; On such occasions we do not share reviewer names or contact information unless you have explicitly told us that we may.&nbsp; We are not responsible for the hotel deducing your identity from the content of your review and contacting you directly.</li>
 <li><strong>Social media providers</strong> when you access certain social media features through our Online Services, you will share information with the social media provider (such as Facebook).&nbsp; The information you share will be governed by the social media provider's privacy policy (including any data we may access via the social media provider).&nbsp; Social media providers should inform you about how you can modify your privacy settings on their site.</li>
 <li>If you connect your Expedia.com account to a social media provider, such as through “Facebook Connect,” we may make available to that social media provider the information related to your use of our Services, such as our rewards and loyalty program or the reviews you post on our Online Services.</li>
 <li>Any <strong>competent law enforcement body, regulatory, government agency, court or other third party</strong> where we believe disclosure is necessary (i) as a matter of applicable law or regulation, (ii) to exercise, establish or defend our legal rights, or (iii) to protect your interests or those of any other person;</li>
 <li>When we believe it is appropriate to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal or suspected illegal activities; to protect and defend the rights, property, or safety of our company or this website, our customers, or others; and in connection with our Terms of Service and other agreements;</li>
 <li>In connection with a corporate transaction, such as a divestiture, merger, consolidation, or asset sale, or in the unlikely event of bankruptcy.&nbsp; In the case of any acquisition, we will inform the buyer it must use your personal information only for the purposes disclosed in this Privacy Policy; or</li>
 <li>Any <strong>others with your consent</strong> to the disclosure.</li>
</ul>

<p>On occasion, we may share aggregate or anonymous information with third parties, including advertisers and investors.&nbsp; For example, we may tell our advertisers the number of visitors our website receives or the most popular hotels and vacation destinations.&nbsp;</p><h2 id="how-do-we-use-your-information">How do we use your information?</h2>

<p>The personal information we collect, or is collected on our behalf, may be transferred to, and processed in, countries other than the country in which you reside.&nbsp; These countries may have data protection laws that are different to the laws of your country (and, in some cases, may not be as protective). While such information is outside of your country of residence, it is subject to laws of such other countries, and may be subject to disclosure to the governments, courts or law enforcement or regulatory agencies of such other country, pursuant to the laws of such country</p>


<p>Specifically, the servers of our Online Services are located in the US, and our group companies and third party service providers operate around the world.&nbsp; This means that when we collect your personal information we may transfer and process it in any of these countries.&nbsp;</p><h2 id="data-retention">Data Retention</h2>

<p>We retain the personal information we collect from you where we have an ongoing legitimate business need to do so (for example, to provide you with a service you have requested or to comply with applicable legal, tax or accounting requirements).&nbsp;</p>

<p>When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or deidentify the data or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will take steps to securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.</p><h2 id="your-information-choices">Your information choices</h2>

<p><u>Data collected by us to serve you with relevant advertising</u>. We are committed to providing you with relevant content and information. To do this, we may, through cookies and other technologies used on this website, collect information about you, such as your travel related searches and whether you are looking for flights or hotels. We may use this information, together with other information we have collected about you from other sources, to serve you with more relevant ads on our website, across the internet, and on other devices that you may use.&nbsp; So, for example, if you search for a property in London on this site, you may see an ad for a London travel package on this site or on another website you visit.</p>

<p>Note that if you choose not to receive tailored ads, you will still see online advertisements, but they will be more general and less relevant to you.</p>


<p><u>Data collected by business partners and ad networks to serve you with relevant advertising</u>. We may allow third parties to collect information about your online activities through cookies and other technologies. These third parties include (1) business partners, who collect information when you view or interact with one of their advertisements on our sites; and (2) advertising networks, which collect information about your interests when you view or interact with one of the advertisements or tracking mechanisms they place on many different websites on the Internet. The information gathered by these third parties is used for example to make predictions about your characteristics, interests or preferences and to display advertisements on our sites and across the Internet tailored to your apparent interests.</p>

<p>Please note that we do not have access to or control over cookies or other technologies these third parties may use to collect information about your interests, and the information practices of these third parties are not covered by this Privacy Policy.

Participants in the leading Internet standards-setting organization that is addressing this issue are in the process of determining what, if anything, websites should do when they receive such signals. We currently do not take action in response to these signals. If and when a final standard is established and accepted, we will reassess how to respond to these signals.</p><h2 id="changes-to-this-notice-and-how-t">Changes to This Notice and How to Contact Us</h2>
