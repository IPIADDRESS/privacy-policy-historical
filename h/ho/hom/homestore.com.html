<b><a name="WhatInfo">What information is collected from me?</a></b>




</p><p align="justify"> The kinds of information we collect from you will vary, depending
  on how you use our Web sites. It’s&nbsp; possible to browse our sites without
  submitting any personally identifiable information (“personal&nbsp; information”)
  at all, but if you choose to take advantage of some of our products and services,
  you may&nbsp; be asked to provide information such as a user name and password,
  your real name, e-mail address,&nbsp; phone number, address, or—for certain
  financial products or services—your Social Security number&nbsp; and banking
  information, and—for certain e-commerce transactions—your credit card information.&nbsp;
  Whenever we ask for this kind of information, we strive to provide a link to
  this Privacy Policy to help&nbsp; you understand how your personal information
  will be used before you decide whether to disclose it. </p>

	<p align="justify">

			In addition to the information you choose to submit, our systems are set up to gather certain&nbsp;
		      anonymous data to help us better understand how our sites are being used and how we can improve&nbsp;
		      them.  This automatically gathered data includes your computer’s IP or “Internet Protocol” address,&nbsp;
		      statistics about how visitors navigate through our sites, and information provided through the use of&nbsp;
		      “cookies” (which are described in more detail below).

	</p>


<p align="justify"> Finally, as you visit our sites, be aware that third parties
  may at times be able to gather information&nbsp; from you. For example, third-party
  ad servers and companies that place ads on our sites may use their&nbsp;own
  cookies, and companies offering products or services through a Homestore.com
  Web site may&nbsp; use their own cookies and may collect and use the information
  you submit. In these cases, the third&nbsp; parties would use your information
  according to their own policies which may differ from this Privacy&nbsp; Policy.
</p>

<p align="justify">
<b><a name="HowInfo">How is my information used?</a></b>



	</p><p align="justify">

			  The use of your information depends on the context in which it is collected.  Therefore, pay special&nbsp;
			  attention to the categories below that relate to the features of our sites that you wish to utilize.  Also be&nbsp;
			  aware that Homestore.com may at times be legally compelled to disclose certain information, by&nbsp;
			  means such as subpoenas or court orders.

	</p>


<p align="justify"> <b><a name="Cookies">Cookies:</a></b> These are small files
  that we send to and store on your computer so that we may recognize it&nbsp;
  as a unique machine the next time you visit our sites. Our cookies are used
  for three reasons: (1) to &nbsp; keep track of your information for your own
  convenience; (2) to help us optimize your online&nbsp; experience by altering
  our content depending on your particular needs or browsing patterns, and to
  provide you with advertisements, products, and services of interest to you;
  and (3) to help us&nbsp; understand the size of our audience and their traffic
  patterns within our network. Some of our&nbsp; advertisers and third-party ad
  servers may also utilize their own cookies. Also, companies offering&nbsp; products
  or services through a Homestore.com Web site may use their own cookies. </p>
<p align="justify"> <b><a name="Registration">Registration:</a></b> The information
  you provide when you become a registered user of one of our sites is&nbsp; used
  primarily to help us customize your online experience. This information may
  also be shared&nbsp; among the various Web sites in the Homestore.com family
  to make your use of each site more&nbsp; convenient without having to register
  more often than necessary. Your e-mail address serves as a&nbsp; unique identifier
  in our record system, and it is used together with your password to prevent&nbsp;
  unauthorized access to any information you choose to store on our sites. The
  data you give us about&nbsp; your personal preferences and demographics (such
  as age, ZIP code, occupation, or other data) may be&nbsp; used to help us offer
  content, advertisements, products, and services that are most likely to appeal
  to&nbsp; you. In addition, we may share this information, in aggregate form,
  with our current and potential advertisers so they can know how to present their
  ads more effectively. Please note that we do not&nbsp; accept or store registration
  for anyone under the age of 13 under any circumstances. </p>

	<p align="justify">

				</p><ul>

				<li>Unless you specify that you’d prefer not to hear from us, we may also use the e-mail address you&nbsp;
					  provide at registration to contact you for promotional, administrative, or other reasons.  You may&nbsp;
					  have these communications terminated at any time.  If you indicate that you’re interested in&nbsp;
					  hearing from other companies, we may also share your contact information for that purpose.

				</li></ul>

	<p></p>

	<p align="justify">

			  <b><a name="Tools">Tools:</a></b>  Our sites allow you to use many helpful tools, such as financial and home improvement&nbsp;
			  calculators, real estate search tools, and others, without disclosing any personal information.  These&nbsp;
			  tools are for your benefit, and the information you submit when you use them (typically impersonal&nbsp;
			  data) is not disclosed to anyone or used for any purpose other than to provide you with the service&nbsp;
			  you’re seeking.

	</p>



	<p align="justify">

		      <b><a name="Requested">User-Requested Services:</a></b>  You may choose to request products or services of a more substantial or&nbsp;
			  personal nature when using our Web sites.  For example, you may apply for a loan, request our help in&nbsp;
			  locating a remodeling contractor, store your preferences for convenience in using our sites, or make an&nbsp;
			  online purchase.  The information you provide when seeking these services may be used in the&nbsp;
			  following ways:

	</p>

<p></p>


<p align="justify">

		</p><ul>

	<p align="justify">


  </p><li>For services provided by a Homestore.com Web site, the information you submit
    is used by us to&nbsp; provide the service you’ve requested. We may also share
    this information with subcontractors, but&nbsp; only to the extent necessary
    to fulfill your request. In addition, we may use the contact&nbsp; information
    and nonfinancial order information you’ve supplied, such as your e-mail address,
    as&nbsp; set out in the Registration section, above. For tools on HomeFair,
    we may, with your permission,&nbsp; contact you by phone to request additional
    information to help you find useful services. You are&nbsp; not required to
    cooperate with any telephone requests by HomeFair. If the service you request&nbsp;requires
    submission of financial information, such as a credit card number for an online
    purchase,&nbsp; rest assured that this financial information is used only
    for processing your payment, and is not&nbsp; retained after completion of
    your order. We may, however, store your nonfinancial order&nbsp; information
    for accounting purposes and to help us understand your preferences better,
    so we can&nbsp; offer you future products or services that you may find useful. <p></p>
    <p align="justify">


  </p></li><li>For products and services offered to you jointly by Homestore.com and a
    third party, your&nbsp; information may be shared with or independently gathered
    by the third party. In these situations,&nbsp; Homestore.com will only use
    your personal information as it would as if offering the product or&nbsp;
    service by itself, but the third party may use the information in different
    ways. You can tell when&nbsp; a product or service is offered by a third party,
    because that page of our Web site will be&nbsp; “cobranded,” displaying the
    third party’s logo or name along with our own, or you will be linked&nbsp;
    to the third party’s site to complete the transaction. Please be aware that
    each company we do&nbsp; business with has its own policies regarding the
    use and protection of your information which may&nbsp; differ from those outlined
    in this Privacy Policy. If you are concerned about how your personal&nbsp;
    information might be used or protected by a third party, we encourage you
    to become familiar&nbsp; with that company’s privacy policy before using the
    service or requesting the product, or to not request the particular product
    or service. <p></p>
    <p align="justify">

			</p></li><li>From time to time, we may wish to use personal information you provide when requesting a&nbsp;
				  product or service for purposes beyond those listed above.  If this is the case, you will always be&nbsp;
				  notified of the additional use prior to your submitting the personal information, and you’ll be&nbsp;
				  given a chance to "opt out" of that use or to not complete the request for the particular product or&nbsp;
				  service.

	<p></p>

		</li></ul>



<p align="justify"> <b><a name="SolInfo">Solicited Information:</a></b> You may
  occasionally see contests, surveys, and other features of our Web&nbsp; sites
  that ask you to provide us with information. When you choose to respond to these
  requests, the&nbsp; information you offer may be used for several reasons. These
  include the uses set out in the&nbsp; Registration section, above. They also
  include providing information to third parties as necessary for&nbsp; prize
  fulfillment and other aspects of any contest or similar offering. If we are
  going to use your&nbsp; personal information for any other purposes, we will
  notify you of that purpose and give you a chance&nbsp; to opt out before responding
  to our survey, contest form, or other request, or to not respond to or participate
  in the survey, contest or other request. </p>



<p align="justify"> <b><a name="Communication">User-Initiated Communication:</a></b>
  Our Web sites enable you to send e-mail to us or to third parties, and&nbsp;
  to participate in public bulletin boards and discussion groups. Whenever you
  choose to initiate these&nbsp; kinds of communication with us, or anyone else,
  you may expect to be contacted in return. Also&nbsp; remember that our bulletin
  boards and discussion groups are open to the public—what you post there can
  be seen by anyone and is not protected by Homestore.com. Please use your own
  discretion when&nbsp; deciding what to post publicly and whom to contact. </p>
<p align="justify"> <b><a name="Referrals">Referrals:</a></b> If you participate
  in any referral service we may offer, we will use the information you&nbsp;
  submit to determine which of our participating professionals may be able to
  serve your needs. We may&nbsp; then forward your name, contact information,
  and other responses to our sign-up form to the selected&nbsp; professional(s),
  who may then contact you using that information. Any information that you provide&nbsp;may
  also be used by us in accordance with the uses set out in the Registration section,
  above. </p>
<p align="justify"> <b><a name="AutoData">Automatically Gathered Data:</a></b>
  The information gathered automatically by our system—such as your&nbsp; computer’s
  IP address, the kind of browser you’re using, and a record of your navigation
  through our&nbsp; site—may be used by Homestore.com so we can understand how
  to make our sites convenient and&nbsp; useful to our audience. This information
  may also be shared among the various Web sites in the&nbsp; Homestore.com family
  and used for similar purposes. In addition, we may share this information, in&nbsp;
  aggregate form, with our current and potential advertisers so they can know
  how to present their ads&nbsp; more effectively. </p>



<p align="justify"> <b><a name="ColData">Collected Data:</a></b> We may link information
  collected from you through various means, including&nbsp; information collected
  automatically and through the use of cookies and registration information, or
  other personal information you provide to help us offer content, advertisements,
  products, and services&nbsp; that are most likely to appeal to you, and this
  information may also be shared among the various Web&nbsp;sites in the Homestore.com
  family. In addition, we may share this information, in&nbsp; aggregate form,
  with our current and potential advertisers so they can know how to present their
  ads&nbsp; more effectively. If you have indicated that you want to be contacted
  by third parties, we may use&nbsp; this information to select which names to
  provide to a particular third party in order to present you with&nbsp; products
  and services that are most likely to appeal to you, but we will not disclose
  this type of&nbsp; information, other than your contact information, to any
  such third party. </p>

<p></p>




<p align="justify">

<b><a name="Choices">What choices do I have regarding the use of my information?</a></b>

	</p><ul>

		<li>Reading this Privacy Policy should help you understand how any information you share with us might&nbsp;
			  be used.  If you feel concerned about any of these uses, you might elect not to participate in certain&nbsp;
			  services, features, or products that we offer.  We will never collect personal information about you&nbsp;
			  without your knowledge, so the decision whether or not to share this information is completely up to&nbsp;
			  you.

	</li></ul>

<p></p>



<p align="justify"> <b><a name="OptOut">How do I "opt-out"?</a></b>
</p><ul>


  <li>You also have the ability to terminate e-mail correspondence from us
    at any time. You will either be&nbsp; given the chance to opt out of direct
    mailings when you disclose your e-mail address to us, you can&nbsp; simply
    reply to our e-mail, typing “Unsubscribe” in the subject line or e-mail the
    appropriate Web&nbsp; master below with your request, and we will promptly
    remove your address from that e-mail service:&nbsp; <a href="mailto:Webmaster@Homestore.com">Privacy@Homestore.com</a>.
  </li><li>If you feel concerned about the cookies that are sent between our computers
    and yours, you may,&nbsp;through your Web browser, either choose to reject
    them automatically, or have your computer prompt&nbsp; you before accepting
    them. Generally this is done by selecting the appropriate cookies setting
    on your&nbsp; Web browser, usually found in “Internet Options” or “Preferences.”
    Please note, however, that some&nbsp; of our features and services depend
    on the use of cookies. Therefore, you will be unable to take&nbsp; advantage
    of those features if you choose not to accept cookies.
</li></ul>
<p></p>



<p align="justify">
<b><a name="ChangeInfo">How can I access and change my information?</a></b>

	</p><ul>

		<li>To view, edit, or delete the personal information you submitted at one of our sites during registration&nbsp;
			  or elsewhere as described above, follow the instructions found in the “My Profile” or “Edit Your&nbsp;
			  Profile” area of the site where you registered.  If you would like us to delete the personal information&nbsp;
			  we may gather from you in the other areas described above, please send a request to&nbsp;

<p></p>




<p align="justify">
<b><a name="ProtectedInfo">How is my information protected?</a></b>

	</p><ul>


  <li>Whenever personal information about you is stored on our computers, that
    information is password-protected from unauthorized access or use. In addition,
    this information is kept only on servers that are&nbsp; located behind a “firewall,”
    which makes their contents inaccessible to outside users.
  </li><li>Since your Social Security and financial information is especially sensitive,
    we take special care to&nbsp; keep it secure. We will only transmit or ask
    for this information over secure Internet connections,&nbsp; using SSL (Secure
    Sockets Layer) encryption—the currently accepted standard for online security—and
    security keys. In addition, we require password authentication from any third
    parties you’ve&nbsp;authorized to receive this information. Finally, your
    Social Security number, credit card number, and&nbsp; financial information
    are never stored on our servers. While this means you may have to enter this&nbsp;
    information more than once, we believe the added security is worth the extra
    effort.
  </li><li>Of course, we appreciate your help in safeguarding the integrity of your
    own and others’ privacy. We&nbsp; hope you’ll use common sense whenever you
    disclose personal information over the Internet. Just as&nbsp; importantly,
    we encourage you to let us know immediately if you suspect that the information
    you&nbsp; share with us is being used in any way contrary to this Privacy
    Policy. To contact us, send e-mail to&nbsp; <a href="mailto:Webmaster@homestore.com.">Webmaster@Homestore.com</a>.
