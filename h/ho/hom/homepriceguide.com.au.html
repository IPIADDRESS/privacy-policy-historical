However, due to the nature of some of our business activities, from time to time, we will handle personal information relying on the media exemption in the Privacy Act where appropriate. Where we do so, we will ensure that we comply with the Australian Press Council Privacy Standards. We may also rely on related bodies corporate, employee records and other exemptions in the Privacy Act.

<p><b>What is Personal Information</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When used in this Privacy Policy, the term “personal information” has the meaning given to it in the Privacy Act or any other applicable data protection law.

This may include (but is not limited to) your name, age, gender, postcode and contact details (including phone numbers and email addresses) and possibly financial information, including your credit card, direct debit or PayPal account information. If the information we collect personally identifies you, or you are reasonably identifiable from it, the information will be considered personal information.</span></p>

<p><b>Cookies</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In some cases we may also collect your personal information through the use of cookies and other tracking devices. When you access our website, we may send a “cookie” (which is a small summary file containing a unique ID number) to your computer. This enables us to recognise your computer and greet you each time you visit our website, without bothering you with a request to register or log-in. It also helps us keep track of products or services you view, so that we can send you news about those products or services. We also use cookies to measure traffic patterns, to determine which areas of our websites have been visited, and to measure transaction patterns in the aggregate. We use this to research our users’ habits so that we can improve our online products and services. If you do not wish to receive cookies, you can set your browser so that your computer does not accept them. We may also log IP addresses (the electronic addresses of computers connected to the internet) to analyse trends, administer the website, track user movements, and gather broad demographic information.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We may also collect anonymous data (which is not personal information) relating to your activity on our websites (including IP addresses) via cookies, or we may collect information from you in response to a survey. We generally use this information to report statistics, analyse trends, administer our services, diagnose problems and target and improve the quality of our products and services. To the extent this information does not constitute personal information because it does not identify you or anyone else, the Australian Privacy Principles do not apply and we may use this information for any purpose and by any means whatsoever.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In respect of residents of the European Economic Area (</span><b>EEA</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">), references to personal information in this Privacy Policy means any information that (either in isolation or in combination with other information) enables you to be identified directly or indirectly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In some instances, we may combine other information with personal information. If other information is combined with personal information or is used to build a profile of an individual (in a way which could be reasonably used to identify that individual), the combined information will be treated by us as personal information for so long as it remains combined.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are a resident in the EEA, you have the following rights in relation to your personal information (where applicable):</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(a) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><b>Access</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. As provided by applicable data protection law, you have the right to obtain from us confirmation as to whether or not personal data concerning you is being processed, and, where that is the case, to request access to the personal data. This access information includes – inter alia – the purposes of the processing, the categories of personal data concerned, and the recipients or categories of recipient to whom the personal data have been or will be disclosed. However, this is not an absolute right and the interests of other individuals may restrict your right of access. You may have the right to obtain a copy of the personal data undergoing processing free of charge. For further copies requested by you, we may charge a reasonable fee based on administrative costs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (b) &nbsp;&nbsp;</span><b>Rectification</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. As provided by applicable data protection law, you have the right to have incomplete or inaccurate personal information that we process about you rectified.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">c) &nbsp;&nbsp;</span><b>Deletion</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. As provided by applicable data protection law, you have the right to request that we delete personal information that we process about you, except we are not obliged to do so if we need to retain such data in order to comply with a legal obligation or to establish, exercise or defend legal claims or if other statutory restrictions apply.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(d) &nbsp;&nbsp;</span><b>Restriction</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Depending on the circumstances and as provided by applicable data protection law, you have the right to restrict our processing of your personal information where you believe such data to be inaccurate; our processing is unlawful; or that we no longer need to process such data for a particular purpose or where other legal grounds to request restriction apply unless we are not able to delete the data due to a legal or other obligation or because you do not wish for us to delete it or because other statutory restrictions apply.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(e) &nbsp;&nbsp;</span><b>Portability</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Depending on the circumstances and as provided by applicable data protection law, you have the right to obtain personal information we hold about you, in a structured, electronic format, and to transmit such data to you or another data controller, where this is (</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">i</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">) personal information which you have provided to us, and (</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ii</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">) if we are processing that data on the basis of your consent or to perform a contract with you.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">f) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><b>Objection</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Under certain circumstances, you have the right to object, on grounds relating to your particular situation, at any time to the processing of your personal data by us and we are required to no longer process your personal data. Such right to object especially applies if we collect and process your personal data for profiling purposes in order to better understand your interests in our products and services or for certain types of direct marketing. If you have a right to object and if you exercise this right, your personal data will no longer be processed for such purposes by us. You may exercise this right by contacting the Privacy Officer. Such a right to object may, in particular, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">not</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> exist if the processing of your personal data is necessary to take steps prior to entering into a contract or to perform a contract already concluded.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(g) &nbsp;&nbsp;</span><b>Withdrawing Consent</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. If you have consented to our processing of your personal information, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time, free of charge.
