<h3>2.1 Personal data</h3>

<p>For the purposes of the Federal Data Protection Act, "personal data" means any information concerning the personal or material circumstances of an identified or identifiable individual. This includes, for instance, your name, your telephone number, your address, payment details and any other data you provide to us when registering and opening a user account. Statistical data that we collect e.g. on visits to our webpages is not personal data in so far as it cannot be directly connected with you.</p>

<h3>2.2 Collection, processing and use</h3>

<p>Generally we only collect personal data where you either supply it yourself when registering a user account or making a booking or a booking request or provide it to us when contacting us by email or via the contact form. In these cases, we will use the personal data supplied by you exclusively for forwarding a booking or a booking request to our cooperating partners and tour operators or for making contact in accordance with your request. </p>

<p>Your personal data will only be disclosed or otherwise passed on to third parties if this is necessary for the purpose of forwarding a booking or a booking request or if you have previously consented to it. In all cases, we will treat your personal data as strictly confidential and will only pass it to the tour operator subject to compliance with the applicable rules under data protection law. HomeToGo will not transmit the personal data supplied by you to countries outside the scope of application of Directive 95/46/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 October 1995 and will only process it in accordance with the applicable data protection legislation unless you expressly consent to its transmission. </p>

For instance, you have the option to save and track offers. Data on your searches is stored for this purpose. Specifically, the search terms and offers are stored, as is technical information about your device and the browser. The data will only be processed for the functions described and for statistical purposes. It will not be disclosed to third parties unless in connection with the forwarding of a booking or a booking request to the relevant tour operator. </p>

<h3><b> 3.Use of your data for marketing purposes</b></h3>

<p>In addition to processing your data in order to forward a booking or a booking request to our cooperating partners and tour operators, we also use your data in accordance with the paragraphs below in order to communicate with you about our service offering, your searches, particular accommodation venues or other products or marketing campaigns and in order to recommend products or services to you that may be of interest to you. </p>

<p>You may revoke your consent to the use of your personal data for advertising purposes at any time, without incurring any charges other than the basic communication costs. To do this, it is sufficient to send a message in text form to the contact details (e.g. email, fax or letter) shown in Clause 1.</p>

<h3>3.1 Newsletter</h3>

<p>We use a double opt-in procedure for the sending of our newsletter. This means that we will only email you a newsletter if you have expressly confirmed to us in advance that we should activate the newsletter service. In order to receive the newsletter, you must enter your email in the box provided for this purpose. We will then send you an email notification and ask you to click the link contained in the email to confirm that you would like to receive our newsletter (this is known as a "double opt-in"). If you no longer wish to receive newsletters from us, you can revoke your consent at any time without incurring any charge other than the basic communication costs. To do this, it is sufficient to send a message in text form to the contact details (e.g. email, fax or letter) shown in Clause 1. Naturally, you will also find an unsubscribe link in every newsletter. </p>

<h3>3.2 Email product recommendations</h3>

<p>You will regularly receive product recommendations from us by email. You will receive these product recommendations whether or not you have subscribed to a newsletter. We want to provide you in this way with information about products from our service offering that may be of interest to you on the basis of your recent searches.</p>

<p>If you no longer wish to receive product recommendations from us, you can revoke your consent at any time without incurring any charge other than the basic communication costs. To do this, it is sufficient to send a message in text form to the contact details (e.g. email, fax or letter) shown in Clause 1.

<h3>3.3 Personalized advertising for you</h3>

The analysis and evaluation of this information enables us to improve our webpages and internet offering, as well as to send you personalized advertising. To this end, for instance, we may examine which of our advertising emails you open, in order to avoid sending you unnecessary emails.</p>

<p><i>I hereby agree that HomeToGo may use the data supplied by me, other information saved to my user account and pseudonymized usage data in order to present personalized advertising and/or particular offers and services to me.</i></p>

<h3><b>9.Social-Plugins</b></h3>

<p>HomeToGo provides you with different Social-Plug-Ins. As soon as you select one of them and click on the particular button, potentially a direct connection with the servers of the particular Social-Media-Provider will be established.</p>

<p>Our website also uses social plug-ins provided by the social network facebook.com, operated by Facebook Inc., 1601 S. California Avenue, Palo Alto, CA 94304, USA. The plug-ins are identifiable by a Facebook logo or the notice “Facebook Social Plug-in”.

Further you can block Facebook social plug-ins by using add-ons for your browser, like the “Facebook Blocker“.</p>

<p>Our website in addition uses social plug-ins provided by the social network plus.google.com, operated by Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, United States. The plug-ins are labeled with the Google logo, the Google +1 logo or with the addition “Google Social Plug-in”. When you visit a page of our website that contains such a social plug-in, your browser establishes a direct connection to Google servers. Google directly transfers the plug-in content to your browser which embeds the latter into the website, enabling Google to receive information about you having accessed the respective page of our website.
