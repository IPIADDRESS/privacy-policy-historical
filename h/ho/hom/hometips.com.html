				</font></b></p>
		<p><font size="-1">Home Tips cares about the safety of children. <br>
				Children should always get permission from their parents before sending any information <br>
				about themselves (such as their names, email addresses, and phone numbers) over the Internet, <br>
				to us or to anyone else. Kids under 13 are not allowed to register with our website or to <br>
				post on our site. We won't knowingly allow anyone under 13<br>
					to provide us any personally identifying information.<br>
			</font></p>
		<p><b><font size="-1" color="#330066">Information we do and don't collect<br>
				</font></b></p>
		<p><font size="-1">The information we gather on our site falls into two categories: <br>
			</font></p>
		<ul>
			<li type="circle"><font size="-1">Personally identifying information (such as your name, mailing address <br>
					and email address) you supply when you initiate transactions, register to receive <br>
					catalogs or newsletters, or use our bulletin boards if or when we have them; and<br>
				</font>
			
			</li><li type="circle"><font size="-1">Completely anonymous tracking information we collect as you navigate through our site.<br>
				</font>
			
		</li></ul>
		<p><font size="-1">Additionally, third-party providers featured on or linked to by our website -- such as vendors <br>
					of products and services offered through our site -- may gather the same kinds of information.<br>
			</font></p>
		<p><b><font size="-1" color="#330066">How we use the information we collect<br>
				</font></b></p>
		<p><font size="-1">We use the personally identifiable information you provide about yourself to fulfill your requests <br>
				for our products, programs, and services; to respond to your inquiries; to send you e-mail newsletters <br>
					you have requested; and to offer you other products or services that we believe may be of interest to you--<br>
					but only if you opt to receive this information.<br>
			</font></p>
		<p><font size="-1">In general, it is our policy not to share your e-mail address or any phone numbers you may provide us <br>
					with any third-party organizations. We do not share our e-mail mailing list with third parties.<br>
			</font></p>
		<p><font size="-1">Please note, however, that our site also may include links to other websites, and we provide access to products<br>
				and services offered by third parties. We share with these third parties such information as is necessary <br>
				to provide the products or services. We will not provide your email address to such third parties <br>
				unless it's necessary to provide services you have requested, or to allow you to participate in a co-sponsored <br>
				promotion. For example, we will provide your name and e-mail address to a marketing partner <br>
					from which you're purchasing goods or services, or from which you are requesting a catalog.<br>
			</font></p>
		<p><font size="-1">We also provide links to other websites, and provide access to products and services offered by third parties, <br>
				whose privacy policies we don't control. The privacy policies of these third party sites may differ from ours. <br>
				If you can't find the privacy policy of any of our provider partners through a link either from the site's <br>
				homepage or from the pages on which the products or services are offered, you should contact the provider <br>
					directly for more information.<br>
			</font></p>
		<p><font size="-1">If you ever receive mailings from us that you do not wish to receive, please tell us by sending an e-mail to this address:<br>
				<u>unsubscribe@hometips.com</u>. Please include your name and complete mailing address so we can remove you <br>
				from our database. Additionally, you will find further opt-out instructions below in this privacy policy.<br>
			</font></p>
		<p><font size="-1">Like most Internet sites, we track the total number of visitors using different sections and pages on our Web site. <br>
				Occasionally we also invite our users to anonymously share certain personal information about themselves -- <br>
				such as their age, income levels, hobbies and the like. In both cases, we aggregate this information and use it <br>
				to gain a better understanding of our users' interests, and to improve the quality of our sites. We also share this <br>
					aggregate information with advertisers, to help them gain a better understanding of the demographics of our audience.<br>
			</font></p>
		<p><font size="-1">Users also should be aware when they voluntarily disclose personally identifiable information <br>
				(e.g., user name, e-mail address) on HomeTipsâ€™ bulletin boards, that this information can be collected and used<br>
				by third parties. This may result in unsolicited messages from other posters or third parties. <br>
					Such activities are beyond our control.<br>
			</font></p>
		<p><b><font size="-1" color="#330066">Opt-out information<br>
				</font></b></p>
		<p><font size="-1">If you receive any mailing from us and no longer wish to receive such a mailing you can either follow the "unsubscribe" link<br>
				at the bottom of each of our newsletters or send us an e-mail to unsubscribe@hometips.com. <br>
				Please include the words "Unsubscribe from Newsletter" in the subject line to help us handle your request <br>
					as quickly as possible.<br>
			</font></p>
		<p><font size="-1">If you have shared your name and postal mailing address with us -- but do not wish to receive future mailings <br>
					from us or our marketing partners in the future -- please tell us. We will remove your name from our files.<br>
			</font></p>
		<p><font size="-1">To do so: <br>
			</font></p>
		<ul>
			<li type="circle"><font size="-1">Send an e-mail to this address: unsubscribe@hometips.com. <br>
					Please include your name and complete mailing address so we can remove you from our databases; <br>
				</font>
			
			</li><li type="circle"><font size="-1">Or send us a letter to this address: HomeTips, 3715 Market St.,Ste. 205, Glendale, CA, 91208.<br>
					Please include your name and complete mailing address so we can remove you from our databases. <br>
				</font>
			
			
		</li></ul>
		<p><font size="-1">You also can use the above addresses should you have any questions about our privacy policy.<br>
			</font></p>
		<p><b><font size="-1" color="#330066">Conclusion<br>
				</font></b></p>
		<p><font size="-1">The Internet is an evolving medium. If we need to change our Privacy Policy at some point in the future, <br>
				we'll post the changes here. And while the above statements and policies do not create any contractual <br>
				or other legal rights in or on behalf of any party, the staff at Home Tips wishes to reiterate our opening statement: <br>
			</font></p>
		<p><font size="-1">Your right to personal privacy is important to us. We will endeavor to respect it.</font></p>
