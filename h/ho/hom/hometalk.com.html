        us to share this information with our network of service providers and partners in order to try to provide the
        services you request. For example, when an approved member of our service professional network accepts a lead
        from a registered user, and that user indicates the personal information he is willing to share so that the
        service professional can contact the user, such as telephone numbers and E-mail addresses, that information is
        shared with our service professionals who have accepted a service request lead. In addition, in the event we do
        not have any service professionals in your service area, we have other approved contractual partners that
        fulfill services requests, or that utilize their own service professionals to supplement our network, and we
        share your information with them, subject to contractual confidentiality restrictions, in order to attempt to
        provide the services requested. Though we strive to preserve user privacy, due to the existing regulatory
        environment, we cannot ensure that all of your private communications and other personal information will always
        remain confidential. By way of example, we may disclose personal information when required by law wherein we
        have a belief that such action is necessary or advisable to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order,
        legal proceeding, process or investigation served on our business or Web site(s), or when we believe parties are
        misusing or attempting to misuse our Web sites or services, including but not limited to violating the law,
        committing fraud, deception, theft, attempting to harm or divert our business, engaging in threatening or
        inappropriate behavior or threatening to place, or placing themselves or others in danger. You should also be
        aware that courts of equity, such as U.S. Bankruptcy Courts, may have the authority under certain circumstances
        to require us to share or transfer your information to third parties. Finally, although we strive to protect
        your privacy, third parties beyond our control may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private
        communications. Therefore, we do not promise, and you should not expect, that your personal information or
        private communications will always remain private.<br>
