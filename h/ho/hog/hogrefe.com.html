<h2>5&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Contacting us by e-mail or via the contact form</h2>

This information is used to  clearly define your request and to improve how your concern is  processed. This information is explicitly provided on a voluntary basis  and with your consent; Article 6 Paragraph 1 a of the GDPR. If this  information relates to channels of communication (for example, e-mail  address, phone number), you are also agreeing that we may contact you  via these channels of communication where necessary in order to respond  to your concern.

<p>You can subscribe to our newsletter, through which we send you  information about our current offers, by providing your consent in  accordance with Article 6 Paragraph 1 a of the GDPR. <br>We use a "double opt-in process" when you register for our newsletter. This means  that once you have registered your e-mail address, we send you a  confirmation e-mail to that e-mail address in which we ask you to  confirm that you want us to send newsletters. If you do not confirm  registration within 24 hours, your information will be locked and  automatically deleted after a month .<br><br>We also save the IP  addresses you use and the time of registration and confirmation. The  purpose of this process is to provide evidence of your registration and  to be able to clarify any potential misuse of your personal data, where  necessary.<br><br>We only require an e-mail address to send newsletters.  Once you have confirmed your registration, we save your e-mail address  for the purpose of sending newsletters. The legal basis for this is  Article 6 Paragraph 1 a of the GDPR.<br><br>You do of course have the  option of unsubscribing from the newsletter at any time, and withdrawing  the consent given with future effect. In order to do so, please click  on the unsubscribe button in the newsletter received. <br><br>
</p>
<h4>6.2&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Newsletter tracking </h4>
<p>We wish to point out that we evaluate your user behavior when  sending out newsletters. For the purpose of this evaluation, the e-mails  sent include "web beacons", also known as "tracking pixels", which are  saved on our website. For evaluations, we link the specified data and  the web beacons to your e-mail address and an individual ID.<br><br>We  create a user profile using the data recorded so that we can tailor the  newsletter to your individual interests. In doing so, we record when you  read our newsletters and which links in them you click on, and from  this we draw conclusions about your personal interests. We link this  data with actions you carry out on our website. <br><br>You can object  to this tracking at any time by clicking on the separate link provided  in every e-mail. Information is only saved if you have subscribed to  newsletters. Once you unsubscribe, we only save data in a purely  statistical and anonymous way. <br><br>This kind of tracking is also  impossible if you have deactivated images in your e-mail program as the  default setting. In this case, however, the newsletter will not be fully  displayed and you may not be able to use all of the functions. If you  activate the images manually, the tracking described above will take  place.<br><br><br>
</p>
<h2>7&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Registration and client account</h2>

If you&nbsp; do  not confirm registration within 24 hours, your registration is  automatically deleted from our database. The above-mentioned data is  mandatory; however, all other information can be provided on a voluntary  basis via our portal.<br><br>After successful registration, you are  given personal, password-protected login details and you can view and  manage the data you have saved.

</p>
<h2>8&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Online orders - Shop</h2>
