<br><br>
Half Price Books believes that your personal information - including your purchase history, email and residential addresses, and credit card data - belongs to you. To serve you better, we collect this type of information when you provide it to us, but we do not rent or sell your information to our affiliates or other third parties.
<br><br>
The Half Price Books Privacy Policy as stated above applies when you make a purchase at any Half Price Books store, purchase a Half Price Books Gift Card, visit this site, subscribe to any of our Half Price Books mailing lists, including e-mail newsletters.
<br><br>
<!-- 
Since we have affiliated with Abebooks.com to provide you with the best online shopping experience, any personal information you provide when you visit the Abebooks.com is subject to <a href="http://www.abebooks.com/docs/Legal/" target="new">Abebooks.com's Privacy Policy</a>.
<br><br>
 -->
What We Collect &amp; Why. Our primary goal in collecting personal information is to provide you with a smooth, efficient, customized shopping experience. Below are the different types of information we may gather:
<br><br>
When You Contact Us. When you contact us, we use your email address, telephone number, and comments to help us assist you. We may also pass your feedback along to other departments or stores within our company in order to improve our service.
<br><br>	
We have stores in ARIZONA, CALIFORNIA, ILLINOIS, INDIANA, IOWA, KANSAS, KENTUCKY, MINNESOTA, MISSOURI, OHIO, PENNSYLVANIA, TEXAS, WASHINGTON, WISCONSIN. <a href="find_a_store.html">To find a store near you, click here</a>.
 <br><br>	
When You Subscribe to Half Price Books Email. <a href="questionnaire.asp">Half Price Books customers can choose to receive mail from us</a>, including our Half Price Books e-mail newsletters as well as information about special in-store offers, sales and other promotions. To ensure that we are providing materials of interest to our customers, we may monitor whether a particular email has been opened and whether recipients have clicked on the images and links therein.
<br><br>
Our HTML-based email messages include an invisible coded sensor, commonly known as a cookie, that is activated when the email message is opened. This sensor communicates the date and time the message was opened and, more importantly, whether or not the recipient is capable of receiving HTML-based email. Cookies do not communicate any additional information. Only those recipients who are able to accept HTML email will receive a cookie. As stated above, if you <a href="questionnaire.asp">sign up to receive e-mail</a> communications from Half Price Books, your e-mail address will not be rented or sold to any third party.
<br><br>
Affiliated Business. Half Price Books works closely with its affiliate Abebooks. In order to facilitate the purchase of books through the Web site, Abebooks discloses certain portions of your personal information to the individual bookseller from whom you order books, your credit card provider and the shipping company. Abebooks may also disclose some of your personal information to service providers that analyze Web site use. Half Price Books and Abebooks require their affiliated businesses, booksellers, suppliers and service providers to agree to use your personal information only for the purposes for which it is provided to them, and to protect the privacy of your personal information in a manner that is consistent with this Policy. You can opt out of certain (but not all) of those disclosures by <a href="http://www.abebooks.com" target="new">clicking here</a> and follow the appropriate procedure. Otherwise, if you do not wish your personal information to be disclosed to Abebooks' affiliated businesses, booksellers, suppliers and service providers, you may chose not to register as an Abebooks customer or order books through the Web site.
<br><br>
Law Enforcement and Legal Disclosure. Half Price Books may disclose your personal information to a government institution that has asserted its lawful authority to obtain the information or to comply with a subpoena or warrant or an order made by a court, person or body with jurisdiction to compel the production of information, or to comply with court rules regarding the production of records and information, or to its legal disclosure of your personal information, and that use and disclosure is not subject to this Policy. Where Half Price Books has reasonable grounds to believe the information could be useful in the investigation of unlawful activity or fraud, your personal information may be accessed.
<br><br>
What about links to and from other websites? Our Web site may offer links to other sites. Other sites have their own policies regarding privacy. If you visit one of these sites, you should review the privacy policy on that site. 
<br><br>
