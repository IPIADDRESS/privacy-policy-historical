<b><a name="2"></a>2.  Types of information we collect</b><br>
<br>
This Privacy Statement covers personal information, non-personal data collection and aggregate reporting.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Personal information</b> is information that is associated with your name or personal identity.  <abbr title="hewlett-packard">HP</abbr> uses personal information to understand better your needs and interests and to provide you with better service.  Once you choose to provide us with personal information, you can be assured it will be used only to support your customer relationship with <abbr title="hewlett-packard">HP</abbr>. We take seriously the trust you place in us.  <abbr title="hewlett-packard">HP</abbr> will not sell, rent or lease your personal information to others.<br>
    <br>
    On some <abbr title="hewlett-packard">HP</abbr> websites, you can order products or services, apply for instant credit, request information, subscribe to marketing or support materials, register yourself or your <abbr title="hewlett-packard">HP</abbr> products, or apply for a job at <abbr title="hewlett-packard">HP</abbr>.

<p><b><a name="8"></a>8.  Your information and third-party companies</b><br>
<br>
Certain <abbr title="hewlett-packard">HP</abbr> services are linked with those from unrelated third-party companies, some which offer you the option to share with both <abbr title="hewlett-packard">HP</abbr> and the third party personal data you provide.  Examples include the ability to register software products from multiple vendors from a single <abbr title="hewlett-packard">HP</abbr> Web page, to request communications from <abbr title="hewlett-packard">HP</abbr> marketing or solution partners, or to enable order completion through a reseller.  We will not share your personal information with those third-party companies unless you make that choice.&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><a name="9"></a>9.  Access to and accuracy of your information</b><br>
<br>
<abbr title="hewlett-packard">HP</abbr> strives to keep your personal information accurate.  We have implemented technology, management processes and policies to maintain customer data accuracy.  We will provide you with access to your information, including making reasonable effort to provide you with online access and the opportunity to change your information.  To protect your privacy and security, we will also take reasonable steps to verify your identity, such as a password and user ID, before granting access to your data.  Certain areas of <abbr title="hewlett-packard">HP</abbr>’s websites may limit access to specific individuals through the use of passwords and other personal identifiers.<br>
<br>
The most effective way to view and change your personal information is to return to the Web page where you originally submitted your data and follow the instructions on that Web page or use <abbr title="hewlett-packard">HP</abbr> Passport.&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><a name="10"></a>10.  Keeping your information secure</b><br>
<br>
<abbr title="hewlett-packard">HP</abbr> is committed to protecting the information you provide us. To prevent unauthorized access or disclosure, to maintain data accuracy, and to ensure the appropriate use of the information, <abbr title="hewlett-packard">HP</abbr> has in place appropriate physical and managerial procedures to safeguard the information we collect.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
We use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption when collecting or transferring sensitive data such as credit card information.  SSL encryption is designed to make the information unreadable by anyone but us. This security measure is working when you see either the symbol of an unbroken key or closed lock (depending on your browser) on the bottom of your browser window.<br>
<br>
Credit card numbers are used only for processing payment and are not used for other purposes.  As part of real-time payment processing, <abbr title="hewlett-packard">HP</abbr> subscribes to a fraud management service.  This service gives you and <abbr title="hewlett-packard">HP</abbr> an extra level of security to guard against credit card fraud to protect your financial data.&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><a name="11"></a>11.  Changes to this Statement</b><br>
<br>
If there are updates to the terms of <abbr title="hewlett-packard">HP</abbr>’s Online Privacy Statement, we will post those changes and update the revision date in this document, so you will always know what information we collect online, how we use it, and what choices you have.

Networks use the TCP/IP protocol to route information based on the IP address of the destination. In other words, an IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you are surfing the Web, allowing Web servers to locate and identify your computer. Computers require IP addresses in order for users to communicate on the Internet, browse and shop.<br><br></font></p>
