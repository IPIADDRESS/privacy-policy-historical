            <p><strong>Our Use of Cookies and Other Tracking Mechanisms</strong></p>

            <p>We and our third party service providers use cookies and other tracking mechanisms to track information
                about your use of our Services. We may combine this information with other personal information we
                collect from you (and our third party service providers may do so on our behalf). Currently, our systems
                do not recognize browser “do-not-track” requests. You may, however, disable certain tracking
                as discussed in this section (e.g., by disabling cookies), or the section below (e.g., by opting out of
                certain ad networks).</p>

            <p><strong><em>Cookies</em></strong>. Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer’s
                hard drive through your web browser for record-keeping purposes. Some cookies allow us to make it easier
                for you to navigate our Site and services, while others are used to enable a faster log-in process or to
                allow us to track your activities at our Site and Service. The Help portion of the toolbar on most
                browsers will tell you how to prevent your computer from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser
                notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. Visitors to our Site who
                disable cookies will be able to browse certain areas of the Site, but some features may not function.
            </p>

            <p><strong><em>Clear GIFs, pixel tags and other technologies</em></strong><strong>.</strong> Clear GIFs are
                tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies. In contrast to cookies, which
                are stored on your computer’s hard drive, clear GIFs are embedded invisibly on web pages or in
                emails. We may use clear GIFs (also known as web beacons, web bugs or pixel tags), in connection with
                our Site to, among other things, track the activities of Site visitors, help us manage content, and
                compile statistics about Site usage. We or our service providers may also use clear GIFs in HTML emails
                to our customers to help us track email response rates, identify when our emails are viewed and track
                whether our emails are forwarded.</p>

            <p><strong><em>Third-party Analytics</em></strong><strong>. </strong>We use third party analytics tools,
                including Google Analytics, to collect, monitor and analyze Site and App information, in order to
                improve functionality and user-friendliness, and to better tailor the Services to our users’
                needs. Accordingly, usage data is shared with Google, which has its own <a href="http://www.google.com/analytics/learn/privacy.html?rd=2">privacy policy</a> addressing how
                it uses such information. We encourage you to review this privacy policy to understand how Google uses
                such information.</p>

            <p><strong>ADVERTISING</strong></p>

            <p>We use third parties such as network advertisers to display advertisements on our Site, to assist us in
                displaying advertisements on third party websites, and to evaluate the success of our advertising
                campaigns. For example, we work with <a href="https://www.facebook.com/settings?tab=ads">Facebook
                    Ads</a> to display ads on Facebook, and <a href="http://www.google.com/policies/technologies/ads/">Google
                    Ads</a> to display ads on other third party sites. Network advertisers are third parties that
                display advertisements based on your visits to our Site as well as other websites. These third parties
                may use cookies, JavaScript, web beacons (including clear GIFs), Flash LSOs and other technologies to
                measure the effectiveness of their ads and to personalize advertising content to you. Their use of
                cookies and other technologies, and the information they collect, are governed by their own privacy
                policies, not this one. We may provide these third-parties with information about your usage of our Site
                and our services.</p>

            <p>You may opt-out of receiving ads that are based upon your visits to multiple third party websites from
                certain third-party ad networks (including Facebook and Google), which are operated by members of the
                Network Advertising Initiative (“NAI”) and the Digital Advertising Alliance (“DAA”).
                For more information regarding this practice by NAI members and DAA members, and your choices regarding
                having this information used by these companies, including how to opt-out of participating third-party
                ad networks, please visit their respective websites: <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/optout_nonppii.asp">www.networkadvertising.org/optout_nonppii.asp</a>

                of receiving promotional emails from us, we may still send you e-mails about your account or any
                Services you have requested or received from us.</p>

            <p>California law permits residents of California to request certain details about how their information is
                shared with third parties for direct marketing purposes. If you are a California resident and would like
