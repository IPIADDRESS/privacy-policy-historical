<p><strong>Our Use of Cookies and Other Tracking Mechanisms</strong></p>
<p>We and our third party service providers use cookies and other tracking mechanisms to track information about your use of our Services. We may combine this information with other personal information we collect from you (and our third party service providers may do so on our behalf). Currently, our systems do not recognize browser “do-not-track” requests.

<p><strong><em>Cookies</em></strong>. Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer’s hard drive through your web browser for record-keeping purposes. Some cookies allow us to make it easier for you to navigate our Site and services, while others are used to enable a faster log-in process or to allow us to track your activities at our Site and Service. The Help portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your computer from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. Visitors to our Site who disable cookies will be able to browse certain areas of the Site, but some features may not function.</p>
<p><strong><em>Clear GIFs, pixel tags and other technologies</em></strong><strong>.</strong> Clear GIFs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies.

We may use clear GIFs (also known as web beacons, web bugs or pixel tags), in connection with our Site to, among other things, track the activities of Site visitors, help us manage content, and compile statistics about Site usage. We or our service providers may also use clear GIFs in HTML emails to our customers to help us track email response rates, identify when our emails are viewed and track whether our emails are forwarded.</p>
<p><strong><em>Third-party Analytics</em></strong><strong>. </strong>We use third party analytics tools, including Google Analytics, to collect, monitor and analyze Site and App information, in order to improve functionality and user-friendliness, and to better tailor the Services to our users’ needs. Accordingly, usage data is shared with Google, which has its own <a href="http://www.google.com/analytics/learn/privacy.html?rd=2">privacy policy</a> addressing how it uses such information. We encourage you to review this privacy policy to understand how Google uses such information.</p>
<p><strong>ADVERTISING</strong></p>
<p>We use third parties such as network advertisers to display advertisements on our Site, to assist us in displaying advertisements on third party websites, and to evaluate the success of our advertising campaigns. For example, we work with <a href="https://www.facebook.com/settings?tab=ads">Facebook Ads</a> to display ads on Facebook, and <a href="http://www.google.com/policies/technologies/ads/">Google Ads</a> to display ads on other third party sites. Network advertisers are third parties that display advertisements based on your visits to our Site as well as other websites. These third parties may use cookies, JavaScript, web beacons (including clear GIFs), Flash LSOs and other technologies to measure the effectiveness of their ads and to personalize advertising content to you. Their use of cookies and other technologies, and the information they collect, are governed by their own privacy policies, not this one. We may provide these third-parties with information about your usage of our Site and our services.</p>
