                <h1>Hifishark Privacy Policy</h1>

<div><p>Last updated: December 12, 2016</p>

<p>
At Hifishark.com com we take your internet privacy seriously. The
purpose of this Privacy Policy page is to communicate our present (at
any given time) Policies and Procedures regarding the collection, use,
and dissemination of your information. We will not wilfully use, or
share your information with anyone, except as described on this page.
</p>
<p>
As we develop our business and offer more or different services, we
may have to change this Privacy Policy accordingly. In such cases the
changes will be posted on this page. Policy changes will be effective
immediately upon posting, and the corresponding Procedure changes may
come into effect at any time thereafter.
</p>
<h4>
What is collected and why?
</h4>
<p>
The primary goal of data collection at Hifishark.com is to deliver a
well-functioning and attractive Service to our users and to allow
third-party providers to do the same. Beyond this goal only the
requirements imposed by Danish or European Law are considered.
</p>
<h4>
User provided data
</h4>
<p>
Some facets of the Hifishark.com service requires the existence of a
virtual persona, a Profile, to serve as a link to your real persona,
the User. A profile may be established by the association of a Social
Network Account (SNA) from either Google.com or Facebook.com, in which
case we store the corresponding SNA id and associated email address
for future use. Alternatively, a profile may be created by the
submission of a validated email account and a password, which we then
store for future use. The involved information remains private and is
safeguarded by state of the art security measures.
</p>
<p>
Once you have a profile, you may chose to provide us further
information in order to customise our service. You may, e.g., store
search and display preferences, subscribe to Search Agents, or mark
listings of interest for future reference. In such cases, we store the
given information in association with your profile for your
convenience, but it is never shared with, or displayed to, any
third-party.
</p>
<h4>
Automatically collected data
</h4>
<p>
In order to ensure the best possible service we automatically collect
data a various levels. At the most basic level, we log the outcome of
every page access in order to detect abuse and errors. At higher
levels, we track the significant actions of all users for the purpose
of analytics, i.e., to assess and improve the effectiveness of the
Service and help us optimise your experience. Automatically collected
data is not systematically associated with your Profile, but may be
taken into account when reported errors are analysed.
</p>
<p>
Note, that we may allow third parties, e.g. Google Analytics, to help
us collect and analyse information about your use of our service.  We
do not control the use that such third parties make of the collected
information, which instead is governed by their own privacy policies.
</p>
<h4>
Cookies and Advertising
</h4>
<p>
In order to facilitate your user experience we use a mixture of
session cookies (that are never stored on your computer) and
persistent cookies (that stay on your computer for a predefined amount
of time) to remember your state and preferences. Some cookies are
related to authentication and security. They allow you to stay logged
in for prolonged periods of time, and help us establish your
identity. Other cookies are related to specific parts of our Service,
and help us remember your search and display
preferences. Hifishark.com does not respond to "do not track" signals,
but you can configure most browsers to reject cookies - in this case,
however, some parts of the Service may not be accessible to you.
</p>
<p>
Furthermore, we may allow third-parties, including <a href="http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/">Google</a>, to serve
you ads on Hifishark.com and to store cookies for future use. Although
we do not provide such third-parties with information that can
identify your personally, this use of cookies, including Google’s use
of the DART cookie, still enables them and their partners to serve you
ads based on your visits to Hifishark.com and/or other sites on the
Internet. We do not control whether third-parties respond to "do not
track" signals, but you may opt out of the use of advertising cookies,
including the DART cookie, by visiting the <a style="color:blue;" href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp">Network Advertising
Initiative opt-out page</a>.
</p>
<h4>
Forced Disclosure
</h4>
<p>
Note, that Hifishark.com is subject to current and/or future laws of
Denmark and the European Union. As such, we may not be able to ensure
that none of your private communications and other personally
identifiable information will ever be disclosed in ways not otherwise
described in this Privacy Policy, e.g. as part of legal
investigations.
</p>
<p>
Further note, that even the strong security measures we have in place
cannot ensure or warrant the security of your information or provide
guarantee against disclosure or loss due to a breach of these
measures.
