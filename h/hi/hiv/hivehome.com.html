<h2>How we store, protect and use information you give us</h2>

<p>This privacy policy applies to all personal information we
hold about individuals, sole traders and partnerships. It
doesn’t apply to information we hold about companies and
other organisations.</p>

<p>Hivehome.com is brought to you by British Gas, which is
owned by Centrica plc. Centrica plc and its subsidiary
companies believe it is important to protect your privacy,
and so we are committed to giving you a personalised service
that meets your needs in a way that also protects that
privacy.</p>

<p>This policy explains how we may collect information about
you and then use it to meet your needs. It also explains
some of the security measures we take to protect your
privacy, as well as giving you information about things that
we won’t do.</p>

<p>When we first ask you for your personal information, or when
you take a new service or product from us, we will give you
the opportunity to tell us if you do or do not want to
receive information from us about other services or
products. You can normally do this by ticking a box on an
application form or contract. You may change your mind at
any time by emailing us at the address below.</p><section><h3>1. Using your personal information</h3>

<p>1.1 We and our agents may use your information to:</p>

<ul><li>Provide you with the services you have asked for
(which may include loyalty and incentive schemes we may
run from time to time).</li><li>Offer you accounts, services and products from time to
time from us or our partners. To help us make these
offers we may use an automated scoring system, which
also uses information from credit reference agencies, as
well as other companies.</li><li>Help run, and contact you about improving the way we
run, any accounts, services and products we have
provided before, now or in the future.</li><li>Create statistics, test computer systems, analyse
customer information, create profiles and create
marketing opportunities (including using information
about what you buy from us and how you pay for it. For
example, the amount of gas you use and any discounts we
have offered you).</li><li>Help prevent and detect debt, fraud and loss.</li><li>Help train our staff.</li><li>Contact you in any way (including by email, phone,
text or multimedia message or other forms of electronic
communications (such as a message through your smart
meters)) about products and services we and our selected
partners are offering.</li></ul>

<p>1.2 We may also monitor and record any communications we
have with you, including phone conversations and emails,
to make sure we are providing a good service and meeting
our regulatory and legal responsibilities.</p></section><section><h3>2. Sources of information</h3>

<p>When we contact you, we may use any information we hold
about you to do so. So we may contact you by email,
phone, text message or other forms of electronic
communications (such as using smart meters) or by
visiting you. If we are contacting you to tell you about
any offers, as far as possible, do so in line with how
you have told us you would prefer to receive marketing
information (your recorded marketing preferences). You
can ask us not to send you any information on our offers
at any time by contacting us and giving us your account
details.</p></section><section><h3>3. Disclosing information</h3>

<p>3.1 We may allow other people and organisations to use
information we hold about you (including other Centrica
Group companies such as those using the British Gas,
Scottish Gas and Dyno Group brands):</p>

<ul><li>to provide services you have asked for, which may
include providing information to members of your family
or household, anyone acting on your behalf or other
people who may be interested (such as landlords or
letting agents),</li><li>as part of the process of selling one or more of our
businesses,</li><li>if we have been asked (for example by Ofgem or a
lawyer) to provide information for legal or regulatory
purposes,</li><li>as part of current or future legal action,</li><li>as part of government data-sharing initiatives, for
example, those designed to help stop fuel poverty,</li><li>to help manage any loyalty or rewards schemes.</li></ul>

<p>3.2 From time to time these other people or
organisations maybe outside the European Economic Area
(EEA), and as a result we may pass your information to
countries that do not have the same standards or
protection for personal information as the UK.</p>

<p>3.3&nbsp;If you give us information on behalf of someone
else, you confirm you have given them the information
set out in this document, and that they have given
permission for us to use their personal information in
the way we have described in clause 10. If you give us
sensitive information about yourself or other people
(such as health details or details of any criminal
convictions of members of your household), you agree
(and confirm that the person the information is about
has agreed) that we can use this information in the way
set out in this document.</p>

<p>3.4 You are entitled to have a copy of the information
we hold on you and to have any inaccurate information
corrected. We may charge a small fee for providing a
copy of any information we hold about you. For more
information about this please contact our Privacy Unit
at Lakeside West, 30 The Causeway, Staines, TW18 3BY. Or
you can email <a href="mailto:CentricaDataProtection@centrica.com">CentricaDataProtection@centrica.com</a></p></section><section><h3>4. Protecting your information</h3>

<p>We have strict security measures to protect personal
information. This includes following certain procedures
(for example, checking your identity when you phone us)
and encrypting (encoding) data on our websites.</p></section><section><h3>5. The internet</h3>

occasionally email you about our services and products.
When you first give us personal information through our
website, we will normally give you the opportunity to
say whether you would prefer us not to contact you by
email. However, you can always send us an email (at the
address set out below) at any time if you change your
mind.</p>

<p>Please remember that communications over the Internet,
such as emails and webmails (messages sent through a
website), are not secure unless they have been
encrypted. Your communications may go through a number
of countries before they are delivered - this is the
nature of the Internet. We cannot accept responsibility
for any unauthorised access or loss of personal
information that is beyond our control.</p>

potential customers use our website so we can develop

used a website. This means that when you go back to that
website, it can give you tailored options based on the
information it has stored about your last visit. You can
normally alter the settings of your browser to prevent
it from accepting cookies.</p>

<p>If you do not want us to use cookies in your browser,
you can set your browser to reject cookies or to tell
you when a website tries to put a cookie on your
computer. However, you may not be able to use some of
the products or services on our website without cookies.</p></section><section><h3>6. Cookies</h3>

sites. This privacy policy applies only to information
collected on this website.</p></section><section><h3>8. Further information</h3>
