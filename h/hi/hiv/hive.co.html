<h3>Consent:</h3>
<p><b>By using the Services you consent to the use of your Personal Information as described in this Privacy Policy.</b> Except as set forth in this Privacy Policy, your Personal Information will not be used for any other purpose without your consent. We may disclose your Personal Information to third parties with which we have business relations, including, without limitation, Brands and their representatives, venues and/or promotion companies and carefully selected organizations that want to inform you of products or services that may be of interest to you. You may withdraw your consent to the processing and/or disclosure of your Personal Information at anytime by contacting us (see further below in the section entitled: <i>Contact Us</i>). However, withdrawing consent may result in your inability to continue using the Website and/or the Services.</p>

<h3>Collection of Information:</h3>
<p>We aim to collect, use and disclose only such information as is required to enable us to manage your account, to provide the Services, to maintain our customer/visitor lists, to respond to your inquiries or provide feedback, for identification and authentication purposes, for service improvement, to administer contests and to process payments. We will maintain the confidentiality of any contact information you provide to us on signing up for our Services or contacting us with questions and we will use it only for the purposes for which we have collected it (subject to the exclusions and disclosures we have listed in this Privacy Policy), unless you agree that we may disclose it to other third parties.</p>

<p>Two types of information may be collected through the Website and our Services: Personal Information and Non-Personal Information. This Privacy Policy does not extend to the collection, use or disclosure of the following information which is currently not limited by applicable privacy laws: (a) information that is publicly available, such as names, addresses, telephone numbers and electronic address when listed in a directory or made available through directory assistance; or (b) Non-Personal Information (as defined further below).</p>

<p><b><i>"Personal Information"</i></b> is personally identifiable information, such as your name, home address, e-mail address, credit card information, birth date and gender. At the time of collection, we will identify the information being collected and the purposes for which it will be used. It is always your choice whether or not to provide Personal Information, but if you choose not to provide certain requested Personal Information you may not be able to use certain features of the Services and Website that require registration. We may collect Personal Information in respect of the Website through registration processes; social API authentications, communications with you; information downloads; service purchases; user support; contests; and surveys, or through any other interactions you make with our web tools.</p>

<p><b><i>"Non-Personal Information"</i></b> is information of an anonymous nature, such as the domain used to access the Website, and the type and version of browser or operating system being fused by visitors to the Website. Included is aggregate information, which is information such as demographic statistics of our users (e.g. average age or geographical allocation of our users), number of visitors, what pages users access or visit, and average time spent on the Website. Business contact information such as the name, title, business address, e-mail address, or telephone number of a business or professional person or an employee of an organization is not considered Personal Information.</p>

<p>Although the use of certain Non-Personal Information collected, used or disclosed through the Internet as described herein is not restricted (and to the extent that such is the case, the obligations under this Privacy Policy do not apply to such information), we provide information in this Privacy Policy about the collection of such information for the sake of transparency with respect to the operation of the Website. Such Non-Personal Information is collected or derived by us in the course of operating this Website. For example, our web servers may automatically collect Non-Personal Information that is provided through your browser or stored in a cookie when you choose to visit the Website.</p>

<li><b>System Logs &amp; Cookies:</b> Cookies are used by us to track content usage and traffic on the Website. A cookie is a feature of your web browser that consists of a text file that is placed on your hard disk by a web server. The Website uses cookies to help it compile aggregate statistics about usage of this Website, such as how many users visit the Website, how long users spend viewing the Website, and what pages are viewed most often. This information is used to improve the content of the Website and Services. You can set your browser to notify you when you are sent a cookie.

Accordingly, advertisement servers may compile information about where or whether you viewed their advertisements and which advertisements you clicked on. This information allows web advertisers to deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you. The Privacy Policy applies to cookies placed on your computer by us, but does not cover the use of cookies by any third-party web advertisers. For the privacy practices of such third-party web advertisers, you should consult the applicable privacy policy for the relevant third-party web advertiser(s)</li>

<h3>Important Exceptions:</h3>
<p>We may disclose your Personal Information to third parties without your consent if we have reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be causing injury to or interference with (either intentionally or unintentionally) our rights or property, other Website members, other users of the Services, or anyone else (including the rights or property of anyone else) that could be harmed by such activities. We may disclose Personal Information when we believe in good faith that such disclosure is required by and in accordance with the law. We may also disclose your Personal Information in connection with a corporate re-organization, a merger or amalgamation with another entity, a sale of all or a substantial portion of our assets or stock, including any due diligence exercise carried out in relation to the same, provided that the information disclosed continues to be used for the purposes permitted by this Privacy Policy by the entity acquiring the information.</p>

<h3>Security:</h3>
<p>The security of your Personal Information is important to us. We use commercially reasonable efforts to store and maintain your Personal Information in a secure environment. We take technical, contractual, administrative, and physical security steps designed to protect Personal Information that you provide to us. We have implemented procedures designed to limit the dissemination of your Personal Information to only such designated staff as are reasonably necessary to carry out the stated purposes we have communicated to you.</p>
<p>In certain areas, such as when you provide credit card or other payment information to us, the Website works to help protect the security of your credit card and other payment information during transmission by using industry standard Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption technology.</p>
<p>You are also responsible for helping to protect the security of your Personal Information. For instance, never give out your email account information for the Services to third parties.</p>

<h3>Retention:</h3>
<p>We will keep your Personal Information for as long as it remains necessary for the identified purpose or as required by law, which may extend beyond the termination of our relationship with you. We may retain certain data as necessary to prevent fraud or future abuse, or for legitimate business purposes, such as analysis of aggregated, non-personally-identifiable data, account recovery, or if required by law. All retained personal information will remain subject to the terms of this Privacy Policy. If you request that your name be removed from our databases, it may not be possible to completely delete all your Personal Information due to technological and legal constraints.</p>

<h3>Amendment of this Policy:</h3>
<p>We reserve the right to change this Privacy Policy at any time. If we decide to change this Privacy Policy in the future, we will post an appropriate notice on the home page at <a href="https://www.hive.co"><u>www.hive.co</u></a>.
