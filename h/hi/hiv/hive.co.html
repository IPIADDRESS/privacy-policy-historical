<h3>Consent:</h3>
<p><b>By using the Services you consent to the use of your Personal Information as described in this Privacy Policy.</b> Except as set forth in this Privacy Policy, your Personal Information will not be used for any other purpose without your consent. We may disclose your Personal Information to third parties with which we have business relations, including, without limitation, Brands and their representatives, venues and/or promotion companies and carefully selected organizations that want to inform you of products or services that may be of interest to you. You may withdraw your consent to the processing and/or disclosure of your Personal Information at anytime by contacting us (see further below in the section entitled: <i>Contact Us</i>). However, withdrawing consent may result in your inability to continue using the Website and/or the Services.</p>

<h3>Collection of Information:</h3>
<p>We aim to collect, use and disclose only such information as is required to enable us to manage your account, to provide the Services, to maintain our customer/visitor lists, to respond to your inquiries or provide feedback, for identification and authentication purposes, for service improvement, to administer contests and to process payments. We will maintain the confidentiality of any contact information you provide to us on signing up for our Services or contacting us with questions and we will use it only for the purposes for which we have collected it (subject to the exclusions and disclosures we have listed in this Privacy Policy), unless you agree that we may disclose it to other third parties.</p>

<p>Two types of information may be collected through the Website and our Services: Personal Information and Non-Personal Information. This Privacy Policy does not extend to the collection, use or disclosure of the following information which is currently not limited by applicable privacy laws: (a) information that is publicly available, such as names, addresses, telephone numbers and electronic address when listed in a directory or made available through directory assistance; or (b) Non-Personal Information (as defined further below).</p>

<p><b><i>"Personal Information"</i></b> is personally identifiable information, such as your name, home address, e-mail address, credit card information, birth date and gender. At the time of collection, we will identify the information being collected and the purposes for which it will be used. It is always your choice whether or not to provide Personal Information, but if you choose not to provide certain requested Personal Information you may not be able to use certain features of the Services and Website that require registration. We may collect Personal Information in respect of the Website through registration processes; social API authentications, communications with you; information downloads; service purchases; user support; contests; and surveys, or through any other interactions you make with our web tools.</p>

<p><b><i>"Non-Personal Information"</i></b> is information of an anonymous nature, such as the domain used to access the Website, and the type and version of browser or operating system being fused by visitors to the Website. Included is aggregate information, which is information such as demographic statistics of our users (e.g. average age or geographical allocation of our users), number of visitors, what pages users access or visit, and average time spent on the Website. Business contact information such as the name, title, business address, e-mail address, or telephone number of a business or professional person or an employee of an organization is not considered Personal Information.</p>

<p>Although the use of certain Non-Personal Information collected, used or disclosed through the Internet as described herein is not restricted (and to the extent that such is the case, the obligations under this Privacy Policy do not apply to such information), we provide information in this Privacy Policy about the collection of such information for the sake of transparency with respect to the operation of the Website. Such Non-Personal Information is collected or derived by us in the course of operating this Website. For example, our web servers may automatically collect Non-Personal Information that is provided through your browser or stored in a cookie when you choose to visit the Website.</p>

We may disclose Personal Information when we believe in good faith that such disclosure is required by and in accordance with the law. We may also disclose your Personal Information in connection with a corporate re-organization, a merger or amalgamation with another entity, a sale of all or a substantial portion of our assets or stock, including any due diligence exercise carried out in relation to the same, provided that the information disclosed continues to be used for the purposes permitted by this Privacy Policy by the entity acquiring the information.</p>

<h3>Security:</h3>
<p>The security of your Personal Information is important to us. We use commercially reasonable efforts to store and maintain your Personal Information in a secure environment.

All retained personal information will remain subject to the terms of this Privacy Policy. If you request that your name be removed from our databases, it may not be possible to completely delete all your Personal Information due to technological and legal constraints.</p>
