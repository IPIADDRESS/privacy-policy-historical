<p class="deck">Highmark's Online Privacy Policy</p>  

<p><a href="/hmk2/privacy/noticeofprivacy.pdf" target="_blank">View Notice of Privacy Practices</a> <img src="/hmk2/images/pdf.gif" alt="PDF" width="18" height="16"></p>
              
<p>At Highmark Inc. ("Highmark") we take the issue of
privacy very seriously. We want to assure Users of our websites (meaning any
individual, including site visitors as well as those individuals who provide
personal information via this website, herein referred to as  "User(s)")
that their information is secure and maintained in confidence, consistent with
applicable state and federal laws. Please read through the following pages, which
describe our online privacy policy.</p>

<h2>I. Information Collected Online</h2>

<p><span class="h3">A. General</span><br>
How you use the Highmark website will determine whether
or not we need to collect information from you and how much information we collect.
For many features, we do not require any information on who you are or ask questions
about you. For some of our features, we need to either verify your identity through
a login process, or collect sufficient information from you to provide the service
of that feature.</p>

<p> <span class="h3">B. Email, Product Inquiry </span><br>
Highmark invites Users to send secure messages to Highmark regarding website
accounts or Highmark's products or services. Highmark does not disclose secure
messages to any non-affiliated third parties. The information provided through
the use of these secure messages and feedback forms will be used by Highmark
representatives or other appropriate third parties who need to view this information
to respond to the inquiry.</p>

<p>Highmark has established an online communications service
for certain members to contact their physician's office regarding certain requests,
such as a referral or prescription renewal. Other members also have the ability
to discuss medical issues online with health coaches through the Blues On Call
feature. Messages sent by or to members who choose to use these online services
will be recorded in transaction logs, which may be reviewed to monitor the overall
effectiveness of the services and the responsiveness of the physicians and health
coaches.</p>

<p>Highmark
also invites Users to send emails and access products and services from non-related
service providers through links on the Highmark pages. Users should also review
the privacy polices contained on these websites for information regarding how
the service providers use the information. </p>

<p><span class="h3">C. Use of Cookies</span><br>
A cookie is a small piece of information about an Internet session that may be
created when an individual accesses a website.</p>

<p>Cookies can contain a variety of information, including the name of the website that issued them, where on
the site the User visited, passwords, and even User names and credit card numbers
that have been supplied via forms. Note that most Web browsers can be modified
by the User to prevent cookies from being attached to the User.</p>

<p>Highmark's website, and certain sites it provides links to, use cookies to facilitate easier
navigation within the sites and to provide a higher level of convenience for
Users, and for internal reporting and statistical purposes. The use of cookies
by the linked site is subject to the company's own privacy policies and in some
circumstances is subject to contractual obligations between Highmark and the
company.</p>

<h2>II. Use of Information Collected Online</h2>

<p>Highmark does not sell your non-public personal information
to anyone.</p>

<p>All information submitted by any individual to Highmark may be retained
to provide a record of such communications and to comply with any applicable
legal and/or regulatory requirements and may be verified for accuracy. In addition:</p>

<p>Highmark uses any information submitted by you on the Highmark sites as well as information
submitted by you on sites of non-related service providers that are linked to
Highmark to provide improved customer service, to provide relevant health care
related information, to provide information regarding general health topics,
to provide website updates, news, event notices and announcements, to update
information we have about you and/or your group, and to monitor the effectiveness
of our online services. In some cases, Highmark may use such information to provide
you with access to information on products, programs and services offered by
Highmark or our affiliates or subsidiaries.</p>

<p>If you receive e-mail updates, news, announcements and/or special notices from Highmark websites, Highmark uses the
name, demographic, e-mail and other contact information you supply to provide
those updates, news, announcements and notices through its own facilities or
those of a contracted service supplier. You may remove yourself from these mailings
at any time by following the removal instructions included in all such messages.
Your e-mail address and other contact information will be used only for Highmark-related
mailings and will not be given, sold or rented to any other party for any other
use without your prior approval.</p>

<p>Information may also be "cleansed" by Highmark (stripped of any information which could identify you personally, such
as your name or e-mail address), aggregated with other data, and used for general
research, classification purposes, marketing, or other purposes without permission,
but only in non-individually identifiable forms.</p>

<h2>III. Access to Information Collected Online</h2>

<p><span class="h3">A. Employees</span><br>
Certain Highmark employees may be provided with information regarding Users in
order to respond to the individual's needs and provide requested information
regarding specific products or services. Certain employees will also be provided
with information regarding Users in order to administer their or their group's
benefit programs and to monitor the effectiveness of the online services. Highmark
employees are required, by written confidentiality statements, corporate policies,
and state or federal laws or regulations to maintain the confidentiality of personal
information and to use strict standards of care in handling the information.
Employees who do not conform to these confidentiality requirements are subject
to disciplinary sanctions that may include dismissal.</p>

<p><span class="h3">B. Highmark Affiliates and Subsidiaries, Business Associates and Service Providers</span><br>
Highmark may disclose personal information of its Users collected through its
websites as permitted by law to affiliates and subsidiaries along with non-related
service providers that assist Highmark in meeting the needs of its customers.
Information collected by affiliates, subsidiaries and non-related service providers
may also be shared with Highmark as permitted by law. All such information will
be disclosed to respond to the individual's needs and to provide information
about products or services offered by or through Highmark, Highmark's affiliates,
subsidiaries and the non-related service providers. Personal information is treated
with the same standards of confidentiality that Highmark applies to other confidential
information. Highmark's subsidiaries and affiliates and subsidiaries are
subject to Highmark's corporate policies regarding privacy and confidentiality
and Highmark's non-related service providers and Business Associates are legally
bound by contract to employ at least the same strict standards of confidentiality
as employed by Highmark.</p>

<p><span class="h3">C. Third Parties</span><br>
Other than as set forth above, Highmark does not transmit any personal information
collected through its websites to any third party without the permission of
the individual. Personal information may be transmitted, however, if there is
a specific need to complete a transaction requested by the individual. Health
plan administrators will have access to online enrollment applications, but not
to other personal information collected online by Highmark.</p>

<p><span class="h3">D. Online Communication Services</span><br>
Highmark has access to messages sent by or to members who choose to use any online
communications services (e.g. Blues On Call). Highmark will not release the content
of specific messages to any third party without the member's consent, unless
permissible or required under applicable state or federal law.</p>

<h2>IV. Compliance Assurance</h2>
    
<p><span class="h3">A. Security</span><br>
Highmark uses commercially reasonable computer security technology selected and
implemented to provide adherence to the security and privacy policies described
in this online posting. Although we make reasonable efforts to protect your information
from unauthorized use or alteration, you should be aware there is always some
risk in sending information over the Internet.</p>

<p><span class="h3">B. Account Access</span><br>
Consistent with the requirements set forth under certain state and federal laws,
Highmark grants access to personal information only to those employees, affiliates,
subsidiaries and third parties as required to provide healthcare products and
services, or as you permit. All such employees, affiliates, subsidiaries and
third parties are subject to privacy policies, at least as restrictive as the
policy described in this online document.</p>

<p><span class="h3">C. Internal Compliance Program</span><br>
Highmark maintains an internal privacy compliance program to ensure compliance
with this privacy policy. This program includes oversight of the compliance program
by a Chief Privacy Officer whose function is to create, maintain, and enforce
privacy procedures in accordance with this policy. Highmark also has a Chief
Information Security Officer who oversees our information security systems and
procedures. Additionally, our compliance programs include on-going employee training,
on-going maintenance and updating of security systems and practices and maintenance
of customer feedback and complaint resolution process. Highmark reserves the
right to amend this policy at any time.</p>

<p><span class="h3">D. Questions and Concerns</span><br>

your personal information, please send us your question by clicking Contact Us
from the bottom of any of our Web pages.</p>
