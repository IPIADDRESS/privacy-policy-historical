<div class="subheader">YOUR PRIVACY IS OUR PRIORITY</div>

<div class="copy">
At Higher One, we want you to know that we take your privacy and online security very seriously. When you activate your OneAccount, 
you’re providing us with personal information about yourself. Higher One understands the importance of protecting the safety and 
confidentiality of the information you provide and we treat this information with the utmost security and respect. 
</div>

<div class="copy">
In addition to any legal compliance associated with the handling of your information, Higher One wants to earn your trust. So we’ve 
taken a number of steps to make sure that your information is completely safe, including but not limited to:
</div>

<ul class="copy">
	<li>Implementing numerous stringent physical and electronic security features to prevent unauthorized access. </li>
	<li>Conducting frequent reviews of our computer systems, including security features and data encryption.</li>
	<li>Limiting employee access to customer information to only those employees who need it for the normal performance of their jobs. 
	Our employees are required to acknowledge, in writing, their responsibility to maintain the confidentiality of all customer information. </li>
	<li>We always apply the same privacy policies and practices to our former customers that we do to our existing customers.</li>
</ul>


<div class="header"> 
You Can Help Too
</div>
<div class="subheader">

</div>

<ol class="copy">

	<li>When you’re done with an online session, make sure you log off of the program website before you move on to other sites.</li>

<div class="subheader">Keeping Your Information Private</div>

<div class="copy">
Occasionally, there may be products or services, either from our own affiliated companies or businesses that have partnered with us, 
which we think may be of interest to you. If we feel these products and services would provide added value to a cardholder, you’ll 
hear about these special offers from us, and not from a third party. Rest assured that Higher One would never share information with 
a company or entity that is not affiliated with us. You can control how Higher One contacts you through the notifications page on the 
OneCard Web site. Just log in and from the main menu bar select "Profile" then "Notifications". We may also share your contact 
information such as name, address, phone number and email address with your school so that we, and they, can better serve you. 
</div>

<div class="subheader">
Our First Priority…Is You
</div>

<div class="copy">
Your trust in Higher One is absolutely essential to us. That’s why it’s critical that Higher One go above and beyond what’s required 
of us to assure you and your family that we’re concerned and proactive with your online security. If you have problems or concerns, 
you can contact Customer Service anytime, 24 hours a day. Log on to your program Web site, and click on the link for "Easy Help", 
where you can find answers to frequently asked questions, or even submit a question or concern.
