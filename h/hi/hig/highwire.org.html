This Privacy Policy provides an explanation as to what happens to any personal data that you provide to us, or that we collect from you. We may change this policy from time to time by updating this page. You should check this page from time to time to ensure that you are happy with any changes. This policy is effective from May 23, 2012.
</p><p>
<strong><font size="-1" face="verdana,arial,helvetica">Information We Collect</font></strong>
</p><p>
- Details of your visits to our website and the resources that you access, including, but not limited to, traffic data, location data, weblogs and other communication data.<br>
- Information that you provide by registering for an account on the HighWire portal (name, email address), or by filling in forms on our website, such as when you signup to receive email alerts or register for personalization options on the HighWire portal.<br>
- Information provided to us when you communicate with us for any reason, including submitting a question or request through the <a href="http://highwire.stanford.edu/cgi/feedback">feedback/contact us</a> form on our site.
</p><p>
<strong><font size="-1" face="verdana,arial,helvetica">Specific to the HighWire Portal</font></strong>
</p><p> 
While using the HighWire Portal website, you can opt to establish a customized account that requires the input of account information (name, email address and password) and personalization preferences ('favorite' publications, email alerts, article preferences). We do not gather financial or demographic information. We maintain this information in strict privacy and do not share it with others except in the form of grouped statistics. None of the shared data is personally identifiable. You can update or delete your account and preference choices at anytime. 
In the case of our alerting services (such as <a href="/customize/#myalerts">eTOCS and Citetrack</a>), the e-mail addresses and names of users who elect to be alerted about content in selected publications are sent to the publishers of those publications; HighWire-affiliated publishers may use this information for marketing purposes. 
</p><p>
HighWire Press automatically receives and records information on our server logs from your browser including information such as the name of the domain and host from which you are accessing the Internet (for example, aol.com or stanford.edu); the Internet protocol (IP) address of your computer; the type of browser software you are using; and the pages you request for viewing. This information is used to understand how our site is being used. HighWire Press does not use this information to individually identify specific users and your activity on our site. Aggregated reports on overall site usage are developed and shared with HighWire-affiliated publishers, but individuals and their specific usage details are never personally identified. 
</p><p>
As part of the registration process, you have the option to allow your name and email address to be supplied to HighWire-affiliated publishers to receive email information about their associations and publications.
