         Protecting your privacy is important to Highwinds. We hope the following statement about the information we collect from the Highwinds Site will help you understand how Highwinds collects, uses and safeguards the personal information you provide to us on the Highwinds Site.
<br><br>
<strong>Collection and Uses of Personal Information:</strong>
<br>
Highwinds collects personally identifiable information about you from information you voluntarily provide when you register, make a purchase from or participate in the Highwinds Site. We receive general contact information including, but not limited to, your name, address, telephone number, organization name, e-mail address and credit card number. We might monitor your use of the Highwinds Site through your IP address, computer settings or most recently visited URL. We also may receive information about you from other sources, such as updated address information. Highwinds may contact you about your account status or changes to any policies relevant to you.
<br><br>
In general, Highwinds only uses the information you provide to us for the purpose for which the information was provided. For example, Highwinds uses the personal information gathered from the Highwinds Site to complete your requests and send you information about Highwinds. This information may include, but is not limited to, notifications of new products and services on the Highwinds Site or provided by some of our partners. Users may opt-out of receiving future mailings from Company and other entities by following the instructions set forth in the "Control of Personal Information" section below. Highwinds also uses this personal information to help Highwinds create a more user-friendly website. In order to periodically make enhancements to the Highwinds Site, Highwinds will use personal contact information to allow us to gauge the interests, needs and preferences of our customers. We use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server and to administer our web site. We might also use your personal information for product development, site tracking and analysis, marketing, advertising and customer support.
<br><br>
<strong>Disclosure of Personal Information:</strong>
<br>
We may also collect customer information on an aggregate basis and disclose the aggregate data to prospective partners or other outside parties. Aggregate customer statistics are not personally traceable to you.
<br><br>
Highwinds may post collected data on the Highwinds Site or share, rent sell or otherwise disclose data to third parties. Any third party to which Highwinds shares, rents, sells or otherwise discloses personal data will be carefully pre-screened by Highwinds, determined by Highwinds to be reputable, and will use the personal data for marketing products and services which Highwinds determines, in its sole judgment, that visitors might find of interest. Highwinds will disclose to third parties only information knowingly and voluntarily disclosed by visitors.
<br><br>
Through the use of third party cookies, advertisers will be electronically notified when visitors view or click on its advertisements.
<br><br>
Other than as explained above, Highwinds will not disclose your personally identifiable information to outside parties except: (i) to the extent necessary to provide you with a service you purchased from Highwinds, which is provided by a third party under contract with Highwinds, (ii) when we believe in good faith that any applicable law, regulation, or legal process requires disclosure; (iii) when we believe disclosure is necessary to protect or enforce our rights or the rights of another customer; or (iv) under urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users or members of the public. We may also provide information to governmental agencies or other companies assisting us in fraud prevention or investigation, when: (1) permitted or required by law; (2) attempting to protect you, another customer or Highwinds against actual or threatened fraud; or (3) investigating fraud that has already taken place.
<br><br>
<strong>Control of Personal Information:</strong>
<br>
To the extent that Highwinds uses personal identifiers (such as usernames and passwords) to verify your identity, maintain recordkeeping in our system, and for other purposes, it is your responsibility to safeguard this unique information so as not to allow unauthorized users to view personal information.
<br><br>
Highwinds allows you to change or modify the information you have previously provided to us. Upon request via e-mail or postal mail, Highwinds will provide you with a summary of any of your personal information retained by Highwinds. You may modify, correct, change, or update your personal record on Highwinds' database. Highwinds will only send personal records to the e-mail address on file for the visitor name associated with it. Upon request, Highwinds will also remove your personal information from its database, thereby canceling your registration, if any, and your license and permission to use the Highwinds Site. Unfortunately, to the extent such information is also stored in other databases, we cannot always ensure that such corrections or deletions will reach the other databases. We will use all reasonable efforts to ensure that your information is removed from or corrected in our records.
<br><br>
The Highwinds Site also provides you the opportunity to opt-out of receiving all marketing communications via your e-mail account from our partners or Highwinds. To opt-out of these e-mails, change or modify your personal information or cancel your registration, please send an e-mail to <a href="mailto:optout@highwinds.com" class="link">optout@highwinds.com</a>.
<br><br>
<strong>Use of Cookies and Other Technology:</strong>
<br>
A cookie is a message that is sent to your browser from a web server and stored locally on your hard drive to help you navigate a web site as easily as possible. We use cookies and other technology to recognize when you visit the Highwinds Site so that you do not need to re-enter all of your registration data at each connection, as well as to store and track customers' preferences and uses of the Highwinds Site. We also use cookies that contain no personal information. These cookies help us estimate the number of customers using our Highwinds Site, determine which areas of the Highwinds Site are the most appealing and serve targeted advertising. The use of such technology is now common throughout the industry and you will encounter them on most web sites. You may adjust your browser setting to reject all cookies; however, please note that if you do so, Highwinds may prohibit you from participating in certain services or promotions.
<br><br>
We may also use technology such as clear GIFS on the Highwinds Site to help us better manage content on the Highwinds Site. We also may use clear GIFS in our HTML-based emails to let us know which emails have been opened by recipients. This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns. If you would like to opt-out of these emails, please see the "Control of Personal Information" section.
<br><br>
Some of our business partners (e.g., advertisers) may use cookies or similar technology on the Highwinds Site. We have no access to or control over these cookies. This privacy statement covers the use of this technology by the Highwinds Site only and does not cover the use of this technology by any advertisers.
<br><br>
<strong>Third Parties:</strong>
<br>
The ads appearing on the Highwinds Site are delivered to users by our advertising partners. We share web site usage information about users with a reputable third party for the purpose of targeting our Internet banner advertisements on the Highwinds Site. Our partners may use cookies and clear GIFs on this site, which would allow the partner to recognize a user's cookie when a user visits this site. The information that any partner collects and shares through this technology is not personally identifiable.
<br><br>
To learn more about the choices available to you regarding this anonymous information, please see the section entitled "Control of Personal Information."
<br><br>
The Highwinds Site may contain links to other web sites. Highwinds is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such web sites. Please check the privacy policies on the linked site before disclosing information to anyone.
<br><br>
<strong>Information about Children:</strong>
<br>
We do not knowingly post or collect personally identifiable information from children under the age of sixteen (16) without a parent or guardian's consent. If a parent or guardian contacts us at <a href="mailto:optout@highwinds.com" class="link">optout@highwinds.com</a> to inform us that an underage child has provided us personal information without their consent, Highwinds will remove the information about the child from our marketing database.
<br><br>
<strong>General Comments on Privacy:</strong>
<br>
While Highwinds has endeavored to create a secure and reliable site for its customers, Highwinds cannot ensure or warrant the security or confidentiality of any information customers transmit to and from the Highwinds Site. When disclosing any personal information, you should remain mindful that the information is potentially accessible to the public, and consequently, can be collected and used by others without your consent.
<br><br>
You are the ultimate controller of personal information. You are solely responsible for maintaining the secrecy of any password used to log in, if any, and you should always be mindful and responsible whenever disclosing information online. Highwinds will use all commercially reasonable efforts to safeguard the privacy of your personal information, whether in electronic or tangible form. However, transmissions made by means of the Internet cannot be made completely secure.
<br><br>
<strong>California Privacy Rights:</strong>
<br>
Once a calendar year, California residents who provide personal information in obtaining products or services for household use are entitled to request and obtain from Highwinds information about the customer information that we shared, if any, with other businesses for their direct marketing uses, such as the types of information shared and the names and addresses of those businesses for the prior calendar year. To request such information, please contact us at <a href="mailto:optout@highwinds.com" class="link">optout@highwinds.com</a>.
