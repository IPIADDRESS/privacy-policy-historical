<ol>
<li><strong>Personal Information Collected on this SITE.</strong></li>
<li>a.&nbsp;<strong>Visitors.</strong>&nbsp;No personally-identifiable information is collected on SITE from Visitors that browse the SITE for information.</li>
<li>b.&nbsp;<strong>Requester.</strong>&nbsp;Personally-identifiable information collected on the SITE is gathered on our “register ” webpages. These fields include name, address, phone number, email address, gender, age and other information necessary for the system to provide you with the information responsive to your request. The personal information a Requester submits to the SITE remains property of the requester, but by submitting that information to the SITE, you, as a Requester, grant the SITE, the right to use that information for the purposes disclosed below.</li>
<li><strong>No Information Collected from Children.</strong>&nbsp;The SITE is a general audience SITE and is intended to be used by adults. The SITE does not knowingly solicit, collect, or attract personal information from or about children. The SITE is not intended for children and the SITE does not want to collect any personally identifiable information from Users who are under the age of 13. The safety of children is very important to the SITE, and the SITE strongly recommends that parents review this Privacy Policy and understand its terms and conditions, so that the SITE is used only by persons age 13 and over.</li>
<li><strong>How We May Use Your Personal Information.</strong>&nbsp;The SITE may use a Requester’s personal information to provide the requested services, including services that display customized content and advertising. We may disclose, transfer, sell or lease a Requester’s personal information to third party businesses and to other entities affiliated with the SITE. In addition, we may join together with other businesses to bring opportunities to our Requesters. This means we may use personal information to provide promotional offers to Requesters by means of email advertising, telephone marketing, direct mail marketing, online banner advertising, and package stuffers, among other possible uses (collectively, “Promotions”). Third party businesses may include providers of direct marketing services and applications, including lookup and reference, data enhancement, suppression and validation.

The SITE may maintain separate email lists for different purposes. On all SITE emails, there is an unsubscribe option at the bottom of the email.</li>
</ol>
<p>The SITE’s unsubscribe process impacts only the future delivery of electronic mailings disseminated by the SITE on its own behalf. A Requester should also note that unsubscribing from the SITE’s electronic mailings will not automatically unsubscribe the Requester’s information from any third parties businesses. Since third party businesses maintain separate databases from the SITE, a Requester will need to unsubscribe from each source individually, if desired.</p>

Requester understands that a Requester’s wireless carrier’s standard rates apply to these messages.</li>
<li><strong>Security.</strong>&nbsp;The SITE uses industry standard security measures to protect the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our reasonable control Although we make good faith efforts to store the information collected on SITE in a secure operating environment that is not available to the public, we cannot guarantee complete security.
