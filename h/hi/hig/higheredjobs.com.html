	<h2>PRIVACY PHILOSOPHY</h2>
	
	<p>Internet Employment Linkage Inc., publisher of HigherEdJobs.com, has created this Privacy Policy
	to demonstrate our firm commitment to keeping personally identifiable information private. Our data collection
	policies allow you to choose how much information you provide us and how we use the information
	you have shared.  It is our intent to use this information to help further your success in seeking
	or filling a position in the field of higher education through the use of our Web Site.</p>
	
	<h2>THE INFORMATION WE COLLECT AND HOW WE USE IT</h2>
	
	<p>A. Anonymous Information. You can always browse the Public Site and
			search for posted positions without providing any personally identifiable information to
			HigherEdJobs.com. We gather general
			information about the number of users browsing the Web Site, the number of
			users who view certain posted positions, and how users navigate through our Web
			Site. This information is collected
			anonymously and only in the aggregate.
			We use this information to provide aggregated statistical feedback to
			the institutions posting positions on our Web Site, to publicize our Web Site
			and to further develop our Web Site to maximize the benefits realized by our
			users.</p>
	
	<p>B. Personally Identifiable Information. 
			HigherEdJobs.com collects personally identifiable
			information when you register for a personal account through My HigherEdJobs,
			create a Resume Profile and when you elect to receive information from us
			through Insider Update or other similar "opt-in" services we may provide.
			"Opt-in" services are only offered when the
			user purposefully checks a box or another method of indicating their specific
			intention of being included for the service so provided. When you create a user ID and password, we
			collect your name, e-mail address, state and country of residence,
			academic/administrative focus, years in higher education and years of work
			experience. We may also request other
			information such as your zip code, career level, highest degree earned, salary
			level and professional affiliations.
			Any information you provide to HigherEdJobs.com when registering for a
			personal account is maintained and accessible only by HigherEdJobs.com. We use this information in the aggregate for
			demographic purposes. We may use that
			information to e-mail you information about maintenance schedules, new
			institutional subscribers information, as well as special promotions and other
			general updates from HigherEdJobs.com or third parties that may be relevant to
			you and your search for a position in higher education. HigherEdJobs.com provides
			you with the opportunity to opt-out of these types of communications. If you choose to receive these types of
			communications at the time of registration or by opting in for a particular
			service, and later decide you no longer want to receive them, simply follow the
			opt-out procedures contained on the Web Site.
			WE DO NOT SELL OR OTHERWISE SHARE ANY OF YOUR PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION WITH ANY THIRD PARTY OTHER 
			THAN IS OUTLINED IN THIS PRIVACY POLICY.</p>
			
	<p>We post customer testimonials on our web site which may contain personally identifiable information such 
			as the customer's name.  We do obtain the customer's consent prior to posting the testimonial to post 
			their name along with their testimonial.  If you wish to update or delete your testimonial,
			you can contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@higheredjobs.com">privacy@higheredjobs.com</a>.</p>		
	
	<p>You may also provide personal information about other people, such as their name, date of birth and gender.
			This information is only used for the sole purpose of completing your request or for whatever reason it may have been provided.</p>
	
	<p>C. Resume Center. If you register for a personal My HigherEdJobs
			account, you will have the option of posting a form of your resume on the
			Restricted Site. We request certain
			personally identifiable information in order for you to post your resume, such as your name
			and address, e-mail address and experience working in higher education.
			We include this information, when and only
			if you so elect, in a database for institutional and other paying subscribers
			to search for potential candidates online. 
			In addition, you have the ability to draft a personal resume and cover
			letter in the resume textbox. There are
			two primary ways you can use the Resume Center:</p>
		
		<ol>
			<li>You can create and store your resume on our database, but <u>not</u>
				allow it to be searched by any institutions of higher education or other
				employer-subscribers. Not allowing your
				resume to be searchable means that you can use it to apply for a position
				online, but it will <u>not</u> be searchable through our resume database.</li>
			<li style="margin-top:8px;">You can store your resume in our database and allow it to be searched by
				universities and employers that subscribe for access to our resume
				database. You may elect to have your
				personal contact information disclosed to universities and employers searching
				our database, or not have any personal contact information disclosed. You may remove
				your resume from our searchable database at any time.
				However, university and other subscribers who have paid for
				access to the database may have retained a copy of your resume in their own
				files or databases. We are not responsible for the retention, use, or privacy
				of resumes, nor any information disclosed on your resume or cover letter posted
				on our Web Site. Please note that once
				you create a resume online and permit it to be searched, all information
				contained in your resume and cover letter can be collected and used by our
				paying subscribers. This may result in
				unsolicited messages from third parties, for which Internet Employment Linkage,
				Inc. is not responsible.</li>
		</ol>

	<h2>SECURITY MEASURES ARE IN PLACE</h2>
	
	<p>This Web Site has security
			measures in place to protect the loss, misuse and alteration of the information
			contained on our Web Site. During the
			subscription or registration process, you will have the option to provide a
			password for your account. We authenticate
			your access to our Web Site through your use of your user ID and password, and
			protect your information with firewall protections.
			 Our security and privacy policies are periodically reviewed and
			enhanced as necessary. Particularly
			sensitive information, such as a college or university's credit card number
			collected for a commerce transaction, is encrypted prior to transmission using
			a Blowfish Encryption Algorithm and purged upon receipt. See
			<a href="http://www.schneier.com/blowfish.html" target="_blank">www.schneier.com/blowfish.html</a>
			for more information on the protections provided by this encryption.
			Please be advised that you are ultimately
			responsible for the security of your HigherEdJobs.com user ID and password.
			Please take care to store your
			HigherEdJobs.com user ID separately from your account password, or better yet,
			choose a password that you do not need to write down at all.</p>
	
	<p>The security of your personal information is important to us.  When you enter sensitive information (such as a credit card number)
		on our order forms, we encrypt the transmission of that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL).</p>
	
	<p>We follow generally accepted standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and
		once we receive it.  No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however.
		Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. If you have any questions about security on our Web site, you can
		contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@higheredjobs.com">privacy@higheredjobs.com</a>.</p>
	
	<h2>CHILDREN</h2>
	
	<p>We do not specifically collect information about
	children, nor do we authorize use of this Web Site by children.</p>
	
	<h2>CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY</h2>
	
	<p>If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes to this privacy
			statement, the homepage, and other places we deem appropriate so our users are
			always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what
			circumstances, if any, we disclose it. 
			We will use information in accordance with the privacy policy under
			which the information was collected.</p>
	
	<p>If, however, we are going to
			use users' personally identifiable information in a manner different from that
			stated at the time of collection we will notify users via email prior to the change becoming effective. Users will
			have a choice as to whether or not we use their information in this different
			manner. However, if users have opted
			out of all communication with the site, or deleted/deactivated their account,
			then they will not be contacted, nor will their personally identifiable information be used in
			this new manner. In addition, if we
			make any material changes in our privacy practices that do not affect user
			information already stored in our database, we will post a prominent notice on
			our Web site notifying users of the change. In some cases where we post a
			notice we will also email users, who have opted to receive communications from
			us, notifying them of the changes in our privacy practices.</p>
