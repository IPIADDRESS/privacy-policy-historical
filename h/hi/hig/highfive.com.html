<p><span class="modified">This Privacy Policy was last updated on October 15th, 2015</span></p>
<p>Thanks for visiting Highfive.com. Protecting your privacy is a very important aspect of our trusted relationship with you. This Privacy Policy provides our policies for collecting, using, and disclosing your information and personally identifiable data (“Personal Data”). Users can access the Highfive Service (“Services”) through our website <a href="https://highfive.com">highfive.com</a>, applications on devices, and through Highfive’s video conferencing hardware. A “Device” is any computer, including without limitation, a laptop, tablet, and phone, used to access the Highfive Service. This Privacy Policy governs your access of the Site and Highfive Service, regardless of how you access it.</p>
<p><strong>Information We Collect:</strong></p>
<p>We may collect the following information and Personal Data from you when you use the Services:</p>
<div class="indent">
	<strong>Personal Data That You Provide:</strong><p></p>
<div class="indent">When you register an account, we collect Personal Data, such as your name, email address, billing information, and address. You may also ask us to import data from third party services such as your email contacts. We also collect Personal Data you voluntarily provide such as customer support inquiries and survey responses. By voluntarily providing us with Personal Data, you are consenting to our use of it in accordance with this Privacy Policy. If you provide Personal Data to the Services, you acknowledge and agree that such Personal Data may be transferred from your current location to the offices and servers of Highfive and the authorized third parties located in the United States.<p></p>
<p>By voluntarily providing us with Personal Data, you are consenting to our use of it in accordance with this Privacy Policy. If you provide Personal Data to the Services, you acknowledge and agree that such Personal Data may be transferred from your current location to the offices and servers of Highfive and the authorized third parties located in the United States.</p></div>
<p><strong>Other Information:</strong></p>
<div class="indent push-bottom">
		<strong>Usage and other Non-Identifiable Data:</strong><br>
Usage and other Non-Identifiable Data: When you use the Highfive Services, we receive and store certain personally nonidentifiable information such as the total number of visitors to our Site, the number of visitors to each page of our Site, and the domain names of our visitors’ Internet service providers. We pool and store this information in databases owned and maintained by Highfive affiliates, agents or service providers. We cannot currently use this information to identify you. It is important to note that no Personal Data is available or used in this process. Cookies: In operating the Services, we may use a technology called “cookies.” A cookie is a piece of information that we add to your browser when you access the Services. Our cookies help provide additional functionality to the Services and help us analyze Services usage more accurately. For instance, our Services may set a cookie on your browser that allows you to access the Services without needing to remember and then enter a password more than once during a visit to the Services. In all cases in which we use cookies, we will not collect Personal Data except with your permission. On most web browsers, you will find a “help” section on the toolbar. Please refer to this section for information on how to receive notification when you are receiving a new cookie and how to turn cookies off. We recommend that you leave cookies turned on because they allow you to take advantage of some of the Service features. Aggregated Personal Data: In an ongoing effort to better understand and serve our users, we conduct research on user demographics, interests and behavior based on the Personal Data and other information provided to us. We compile and analyze this research on an aggregate basis, and may share this aggregate data with our partners. This aggregate information does not identify you personally. We may also disclose aggregated user statistics in order to describe our services to current and prospective business partners, and to other third parties for other lawful purposes.<br>
	<strong>Analytics:</strong><br>
We may allow third party service providers to use cookies or similar technologies to collect information about your browsing activities over time and across different websites following your use of the Services. For example, we use Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google, Inc. (“Google”). Google Analytics uses cookies to help the website analyze how users use the Site and enhance your experience when you use the Service. For more information on how Google uses this data, go to <a href="http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/">www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/</a>.
</div>
</div>
<p><strong>How We Use Your Personal Data:</strong></p>
<p>￼We use the Personal Data you provide in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Policy. If you provide Personal Data for a certain reason, we may use the Personal Data in connection with the reason for which it was provided. For instance, if you contact us by email, we will use the Personal Data you provide to answer your question or resolve your problem. Also, if you provide Personal Data in order to obtain access to the Services, we will use your Personal Data to provide you with access to such services and to monitor your use of such services. We, along with our partners, may also use your Personal Data and other personally non–identifiable information collected through the Services to help us improve the content and functionality of the Services. We may use this information to contact you in the future to tell you about services we believe will be of interest to you. If we do so, each marketing communication we send you will contain instructions permitting you to “optout” of receiving future marketing communications. In addition, if at any time you wish not to receive any future marketing communications or you wish to have your name deleted from our mailing lists, please contact us as indicated below. If we ever intend to use any Personal Data in any manner that is not consistent with this Privacy Policy, we will inform you of our intended use prior to, or at the time at which, we collect the Personal Data.</p>
<p><strong>Our Disclosure of Your Personal Data and Other Information:</strong></p>
<p>Let us be clear, we are not in the business of selling your information. We consider this information to be a vital part of our trusted relationship with you. There are, however, the following circumstances in which we may share your Personal Data with certain third parties without further notice to you:</p>
<div class="indent">
<p><strong>Business Transfers:</strong> As we develop our business, we might sell or buy businesses or assets. In the event of a corporate sale, merger, reorganization, dissolution or similar event, Personal Data may be part of the transferred assets.</p>
<p><strong>Related Companies:</strong> We may also share your Personal Data with our Related Companies for purposes consistent with this Privacy Policy. Agents, Consultants and Related Third Parties: We sometimes hire other companies to perform certain business­related functions. A few examples of such functions include maintaining databases and processing payments. When we employ another business to perform a function for us, we only provide them with the information that they need to perform the specific function. Legal Requirements: We may disclose your Personal Data if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to (i) comply with a legal obligation, (ii) protect and defend the rights or property of Highfive, (iii) act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of the Services or the public, or (iv) protect against legal liability.
</p></div>
<p><strong>Your Choices:</strong></p>
<p>You can visit the Site without providing any Personal Data. If you choose not to provide any Personal Data, you may not be able to use certain Services.</p>
<p><strong>Exclusions:</strong></p>
<p>This Privacy Policy does not apply to any Personal Data we collect other than Personal Data collected through the Services. This Privacy Policy does not apply to any unsolicited information you may provide to us through the Services or through any other means. You may, for example, voluntarily post information to social networks or any public areas of the Services, such as blogs and forums.. We consider this unsolicited information to be non­confidential and we may reproduce, use, disclose, and distribute such information to others without limitation or attribution.</p>
<p><strong>Our Policy Toward Children:</strong></p>
<p>We think kids are great! But our Services are not intended for children. We do not knowingly collect Personal Data from children under the age of 13. If you are under the age of 13, please do not submit any Personal Data through the Services. We encourage parents and legal guardians to monitor their children’s Internet usage and to help enforce our Privacy Policy by instructing their children never to provide Personal Data on the Services without their permission. If you have reason to believe that a child under the age of 13 has provided Personal Data to us through the Services, please contact us, and we will make our best effort to delete that information from our databases.</p>
<p><strong>Links to Other Web Sites:</strong></p>
<p>This Privacy Policy applies only to the Services. The Services may contain links to other web sites not operated or controlled by Highfive (the “Third Party Sites”). The policies and procedures we described here do not apply to the Third Party Sites. The links from the Services do not imply that we endorse or have reviewed the Third Party Sites. We suggest contacting those sites directly for information on their privacy policies.</p>
<p><strong>Security:</strong></p>
<p>We take reasonable steps to protect the Personal Data provided via the Services from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. However, no Internet or email transmission is ever fully secure or error free. In particular, email sent to or from the Services may not be secure. Therefore, you should take special care in deciding what information you send to us via email. Please keep this in mind when disclosing any Personal Data to us via the Internet.</p>
<p><strong>Safe Harbor:</strong></p>
<p>Highfive adheres to the principles set forth in the U.S.-EU and U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor Frameworks with respect to its products and services.  Information on both Safe Harbors may be found at <a href="http://www.export.gov/safeharbor/" target="_blank">www.export.gov/safeharbor/</a>.</p>
<p>In compliance with the U.S.-EU and U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor Principles, we commit to resolve complaints about privacy and our collection or use of Personal Data.  Residents of the European Union or Switzerland with inquiries or complaints about privacy should contact Highfive Technologies, Inc. at <a href="mailto:privacy@highfive.com" title="email us" target="">privacy@highfive.com</a>.</p>
<p>In the event of a dispute relating to data protection which cannot be resolved directly with Highfive, we are committed to cooperating with the EU and Swiss Data Protection Authorities and have registered with the U.S. Council for International Business to act as an independent recourse mechanism.</p>
<p><strong>Other Terms:</strong></p>
<p>Your access to and use of the Services is subject to the <a class="termslink" href="/legal">Terms of Service</a>. Your use of our web store is subject to the <a class="termslink" href="/saleterms">Terms of Sale</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Changes to Highfive’s Privacy Policy:</strong></p>
<p>We may change this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make a change to this Privacy Policy that we believe materially reduces your rights, we will provide you with notice (for example, by email). We may provide notice of changes in other circumstances as well. By continuing to use the Service after those changes become effective, you agree to be bound by the revised Privacy Policy.</p>
<p><strong>Contacting Us:</strong></p>
<p>If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@highfive.com">privacy@highfive.com</a> or at 500 Arguello St., Suite 300, Redwood CIty, CA 94063.</p>
