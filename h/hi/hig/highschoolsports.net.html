<h2 class="header">HighSchoolSports.net Privacy Policy</h2>
<p>
HighSchoolSports.net is a FREE athletic information service provided by Schedule Star®.
Since 1964, Schedule Star® has been committed to providing our customers with products and services of outstanding quality, customer service, and value. Our internet privacy policy continues our commitment to serve you, your league, and your school and to protect your privacy online.
</p><p>
We will not collect any personal information from you that you do not volunteer, and we are the sole owner of all information collected on our sites. We do not sell, share, or rent this information to others in any way that we have not mentioned in this statement.
</p><p>
Please read this internet privacy policy carefully so that you understand our online privacy practices regarding: 
</p><p>
Information we collect and how we collect it 
</p><p>
How your information will be used
</p><p>
Student data 
</p><p>
Protection of your data
</p><p>
Passwords 
</p><p>
Our e-mail policies
</p><p>
How to contact us
</p><p>
</p><h3>INFORMATION WE COLLECT AND HOW WE COLLECT IT</h3>
<p></p><p>
The information we gather on our sites falls into two categories: (1) personal or school information you supply when you subscribe, request information, or utilize our on-line Customer Support Service and (2) tracking information collected as you visit our sites. 
</p><p>
When personally identifiable information is collected, you will know because you will have to fill out a form or you have asked us for assistance.
</p><p>
When you visit ScheduleStar.com, HighSchoolSports.net, EligibilityCentral.com, PrepsCentral.com, or any other Schedule Star® web site, we may collect tracking information such as your browser type, the type of operating system you use, and pages you visited on our sites. None of this information identifies you personally; we use this information to make our sites more useable to you, your league and your schools.
</p><p>
We use "cookies" to store user information. A cookie is a small amount of data that is sent to your browser from a web server and stored on your computer's hard drive. A cookie contains a unique number that allows our site to recognize your computer. For example, cookies allow us to keep track of your user name so you don't have to re-enter that information each time you log onto HighSchoolSports.net, Schedule Star®, Eligibility Central, Preps Central, or League Central. The help function on most browsers contains information on how to set your browser to notify you before accepting cookies or to disable cookies entirely. However, if you don't accept cookies, you won't be able to utilize the "Remember Me" option of HighSchoolSports.net, Schedule Star®, Eligibility Central, Preps Central or League Central.
</p><p>
</p><h3>HOW YOUR INFORMATION WILL BE USED</h3>
<p></p><p>
Schedule Star® uses personally identifiable information in a limited number of ways. We use the information to fulfill requests for our services. If you request additional information about HighSchoolSports.net, we will use the information to contact you. We also use the information you provide to send you e-mail and mail regarding Schedule Star® product information, user customer support information and to keep you, your league and your school up to date on the latest information about HighSchoolSports.net and Schedule Star®.
</p><p>
Sharing your personally identifiable information
If you have supplied any personally identifiable information, HighSchoolSports.net and Schedule Star® will not sell, rent, swap, or authorize any third party to use any information that specifically identifies you, without your permission. 

</p><p>
</p><h3>STUDENT DATA</h3>
<p></p><p>
The protection and privacy of your student data is of utmost importance at Schedule Star®.
Schedule Star® does not utilize any student data that you provide to us except to import it into your Schedule Star® or to utilize the SIF Agent interface.
When you send us your student data to be included in your Schedule Star®, we import the data into your Schedule Star® for you; we do not use it in any other way. As with all information collected by Schedule Star®, we will not sell, rent, swap, or authorize any third party to use any student information. 
Only Schedule Star® users for your school have access to your student data. 
Your school’s Athletic Director controls this access.
SSL is implemented within Schedule Star® for student information.
Student information is not displayed on the Internet. The student database sits behind a DMZ and is not accessible via the Internet.
See our section PROTECTION OF YOUR DATA for how we physically secure all of your Schedule Star® data.
Your student data is stored on a partitioned drive that is leased to your school as provided in our Terms of Service agreement, thereby storing your students on your school’s own hardware.
</p><p>
Student Athlete Eligibility information is required by your state in order for athletes to compete in contests. This information is displayed at www.EligibilityCentral.com.
Private student information, such as address and phone number, and all other student information not required by your state is not displayed at www.EligiblityCentral.com. No student data is stored at www.EligibiltyCentral.com.
Only Schedule Star® users and EligibilityCentral.com users have access to the Student Athlete Eligibility information that is required by your state. The public have no access to this information.
</p><p>
Team Rosters and Student Athlete statistical information may be displayed at www.HighSchoolSports.net. This type of data may be called “Preps” and is the same information that your media use when it reports on your athletic contests. No student data is stored at www.HighSchoolSports.net and no information other than rosters and player stats is displayed at www.HighSchoolSports.net. Your school’s Athletic Director controls the display of this information.
</p><p>
Photographs and Videos can be uploaded to the Bleachers at www.HighSchoolSports.net. A specific athletic event for a specific team must be chosen for upload. Captions or other comments are NOT permitted, so no student names can be used or associated with photographs or videos. Schedule Star® personnel look at, listen to, and verify all photographs as appropriate for display.
</p><p>
</p><h3>PROTECTION OF YOUR DATA</h3>
<p></p><p>
The Schedule Star® databases sit behind a DMZ and are not accessible via the Internet. Specifications are confidential and are available upon verified request.
Proprietary security protocols and SSL are implemented for student and personal information. Specifications are confidential and are available upon verified request.
Student information is not displayed on the Internet, except as specified in our STUDENT DATA section. The student database sits behind a DMZ and is not accessible via the Internet. Specifications are confidential and are available upon verified request.
</p><p>
Schedule Star® data are backed up several times through out the day and are stored securely in a fire-proof vault.
</p><p>
Our hardware is housed in a secured, protected facility, requiring a keycard and combination access lock to enter. Specifications are confidential and are available upon verified request.
</p><p>
Passwords are secured in the secure database and are only given after a verification question is answered. Passwords are never verified or divulged via email.
</p><p>
</p><h3>PASSWORDS</h3>
<p></p><p>
The best security for your Schedule Star® data is your password. Choose a password that only you know and do not post it on your monitor. If you forget your password, you must call us so you can answer your security question, usually your mother's maiden name. Then, we will release your password to you. Passwords are never verified or divulged via email.
</p><p>
We urge you to keep your password in a safe place and not to divulge it to anyone. Also remember to sign off your account and close your browser window when you have finished with your visit or use of Schedule Star® services. This ensures that others cannot access your schedules or accounts, especially if you are sharing a computer with someone else or if you are using a computer in your school or in a public place such as a library.
</p><p>
</p><h3>OUR E-MAIL POLICIES</h3>
<p></p><p>
Account related e-mail: We will send you e-mails relating to your account. These may include renewal/expiration notices and billing notifications.
</p><p>
Email newsletters: We will send you an E-Letter newsletter. If you no longer wish to receive the E-Letter, you can either (1) follow the 'unsubscribe' instructions located at the bottom of each newsletter or (2) go to our web site, www.ScheduleStar.com, click on "News", then "Unsubscribe". 
</p><p>
Promotional e-mails: We may also e-mail you messages that we think may be of interest to you, your league, or your school about products and services that may be affiliated with HighSchoolSports.net, Schedule Star®, Eligibility Central, League Central, Preps Central or other types of Schedule Star® products or services. You can choose not to receive additional types of messages in the future by following the 'unsubscribe' instructions located at the bottom of each e-mail.
