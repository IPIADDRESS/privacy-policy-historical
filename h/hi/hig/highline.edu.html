      <p><b>Information Collected and How it is Used</b> </p>
      <p><b>Information collected if you only browse this site.</b>
      
      <br>If you do nothing during your visit to our Web site but browse, read 
		pages, or download information, we will gather and store certain 
		information about your visit. This information does not identify you 
		personally. We automatically collect and store the following information 
		about your visit:</p>
      
      <ol>
      <li>The Internet Protocol Address and domain name used. The Internet 
		Protocol address is a numerical identifier assigned either to your 
		Internet service provider or directly to your computer. We use the 
		Internet Protocol Address to direct Internet traffic to you. This 
		address can be translated to determine the domain name of your service 
		provider (for example, <i>xcompany.com</i> or <i>yourschool.edu</i>); 
		</li>
        <li>        The type of browser and operating system you used;</li>
         <li>The date and time you visited this site; </li>
         <li> The Web pages or services you accessed at this site; and </li> 
        <li>The Web site you visited prior to coming to this Web site. </li> 
        </ol>
        
      <p>The information we automatically collect or store is logged and used by 
		Highline Community College only to improve the content of our Web 
		services and to help us understand how people are using our services. 
		Highline Community College analyzes the Web site logs to determine how 
		our Web site is being used, so that we may continually improve the 
		site's usefulness to the public.</p>
      
      <p><b>What we collect if you volunteer information.<br></b>
      If during your visit to our Web site you participate in a survey, send an 
		e-mail, or perform some other transaction on-line, the following 
		additional information will be collected:</p>
      
      <ul>
        <li>The e-mail address, and contents of e-mail, for those who 
		communicate with us via e-mail. </li> 
        <li>Information volunteered in response to a survey. </li>
        <li>Information volunteered through an on-line form for any other 
		purpose. </li>        
      </ul>
        
      <p>The information collected is not limited to text characters and may 
		include audio, video, and graphic information formats you send us.</p>
      <p>We use your e-mail to respond appropriately. This may be to respond to 
		you, to address issues you may identify, to further improve our Web 
		site, or to forward the e-mail to another agency for appropriate action.</p>
      
      <p>The use of survey information will be described as part of that survey. 
		Information from other on-line forms is used for access to on-line 
		student services, participation in instructional activities (such as 
		on-line quizzes or on-line discussions), searches of library and other 
		databases, and other activities as described in the specific 
		application.<br>

      <p><b>Personal Information and Choice</b></p>
      <p>You may choose whether to provide personal information online.</p>
      <p>Personal information is information about a person that is readily 
		identifiable to that specific individual. Personal information includes 
		such things as an individual's name, address, and phone number. A domain 
		name or Internet Protocol address is not considered personal 
		information. 
      </p>
      <p>We collect no personal information about you unless you voluntarily 
		provide it to us by sending us e-mail, participating in a survey, or 
		completing an on-line form. You may choose not to contact us by e-mail, 
		participate in a survey or to provide any personal information using an 
		online form. Your choice to not participate in these activities will not 
		impair your ability to browse the Highline Community College Web site 
		and read or download most information provided on the site.</p>
      
      <p>Choosing not to participate in these activities may impair your ability 
		to use on-line student services, participate in surveys, and participate 
		in on-line instructional activities. On-line student services may be 
		conducted using Touch-tone registration, mail, or telephone, as 
		described in the section below on that specific service. Information 
		about participating in surveys is available by contacting the office 
		sponsoring the survey (identified on each individual survey), though 
		some surveys will not be available off-line. Information about 
		participating in instructional activities off-line is available by 
		contacting the instructor, though some instructional activities may not 
		be available off-line.</p>
      
      <p>If personal information is requested on the Web site or volunteered by 
		the user, state law and the federal Privacy Act of 1974 may protect it. 
		However, this information is a public record once you provide it, and 
		may be subject to public inspection and copying if not protected by 
		federal or state law.</p>
      
      <p>If you believe that your personal information is being used for a 
		purpose other than what was intended when submitted, you may contact the 
		Public Records Officer as shown in the Contact Information section of 
		this statement.</p>
      
      <p>Highline Community College web site is a general audience site and we 
		do not knowingly collect any personal information from children. Users 
		are cautioned that the collection of personal information requested from 
		or volunteered by children online or by e-mail will be treated the same 
		as information given by an adult, and may be subject to public access.<br>

      <p><b>Public Access to Information</b></p>
      
      <p>In the State Of Washington, laws exist to ensure that government is 
		open and that the public has a right to access appropriate records and 
		information possessed by state government. At the same time, there are 
		exceptions to the public's right to access public records that serve 
		various needs including the privacy of individuals. Exceptions are 
		provided by both state and federal laws. </p>
      
      <p>All of the information collected at this site becomes public records 
		that may be subject to inspection and copying by members of the public, 
		unless an exemption in law exists. Statue RCW 42.17. 260(1) states that: </p>
      
      <blockquote>
        <p>Each agency, in accordance with published rules, shall make available 
		for public inspection and copying all public records, unless the record 
		falls within the specific exemptions of subsection (6) of this section 
		[RCW 42.17.260(6)], RCW 42.17.310, 42.17.315, or other statute which 
		exempts or prohibits disclosure of specific information or records. To 
		the extent required to prevent an unreasonable invasion of personal 
		privacy interests protected by RCW 42.17.310 and 42.17.315, an agency 
		shall delete identifying details in a manner consistent with RCW 
		42.17.310 and 42.17.315 when it makes available or publishes any public 
		record; however, in each case, the justification for the deletion shall 
		be explained fully in writing.</p>
      </blockquote>
      
      <p>In the event of a conflict between this Privacy Notice and the Public 
		Records Act or other law governing the agency’s disclosure of records, 
		the Public Records Act or other applicable law will control.</p>
