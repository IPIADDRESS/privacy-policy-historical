      <p> <font face="Arial" size="2">The
      use of survey information will be described as part of that survey. Information from other online forms is used
      for access to on-line student services, participation in instructional
      activities (such as on-line quizzes or on-line discussions), searches of
      library and other databases, and other activities as described in the

      information is information about a  person that is readily

      in the section below on that specific service. Information about
      participating in surveys is available by contacting the office sponsoring
      the survey (identified on each individual survey), though some surveys
      will not be available off-line. Information about participating in

        the extent required to prevent an unreasonable invasion of personal

        shall delete identifying details in a manner consistent with RCW
