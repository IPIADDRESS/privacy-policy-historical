<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<h2></h2>
<p></p><p>HighBeam™ Research, Inc. ("HighBeam" or “we”) respects the privacy of our users, and we want you to be aware of how we use information that we have collected from and about you. By coming to <a href="http://www.highbeam.com/">www.highbeam.com</a> or <a href="http://www.encyclopedia.com/">www.encyclopedia.com</a> (the HighBeam Websites), you are agreeing to and accepting this Privacy Policy as well as the Terms and Conditions and other end user agreements governing our services. Because the Internet is a rapidly evolving medium, and <font size="1">enhancements to the services</font> we provide may affect the information that we collect and the manner that we use it, the Privacy Policy may change from time to time. If it does, we will post the revised policy on the HighBeam Websites, with an indication of the date of the most recent revisions. </p><p>You should be aware that this Privacy Policy applies only to the HighBeam Websites. Any websites linked to from the HighBeam site, an advertisement or an article displayed on the site are governed by their own privacy policies.</p><h2>What personally identifiable information do I provide to HighBeam, and how does HighBeam use it?</h2><ul><span><li>Personally identifiable information refers to any information that identifies or can be used to identify, contact or locate you. HighBeam collects only the personally identifiable information that you provide to us if you register for membership on the HighBeam site, such as your name, mailing address, telephone number and e-mail address. If you are a Full Member of the HighBeam site, this also includes your credit card and related information.</li><li>HighBeam uses your personally identifiable information to bill you in accordance with the <a href="/about/termsandconditions.hbr">User Agreement </a>and to communicate with you regarding your account. These communications may include, without limitation, notices regarding material changes to HighBeam site policies, service updates, service enhancements, account management procedures and customer service transactional replies. Since these communications are necessary to ensure we provide our members with the highest quality of services, our members are not permitted to opt out from receipt of these communications.</li><li>HighBeam may also use personally identifiable information to e-mail you newsletters or tips about how to use the service, inform you of product updates, or notify you about our own special offers or those of our third-party partners. You may choose at any time to opt out of receiving some or all of these communications by so indicating in the "<a href="/myresearchcenter/account/privacy.aspx">Privacy Preferences</a>" section of the website, by filling out this form (please include your name, address, and e-mail) or by using the unsubscribe link on any e-mail message you receive.</li><li>We may also engage in co-registration programs with our partners in which situations both our partners and we will be able to communicate with you and use demographic data about you. You will have the option to opt out of receiving these messages in the "<a href="/myresearchcenter/account/privacy.aspx">Privacy Preferences</a>" section of the website. </li><li>HighBeam does not associate your personally identifiable information with information about your use of the website. </li></span></ul><h2>What other information is collected about me on the HighBeam site and by whom?</h2><ul class=""><span><li>Like most websites, HighBeam employs cookies to recognize you and your access privileges on the HighBeam site.

Logs include information such as IP address, browser type and version, and computer operating system. HighBeam uses logs mainly for systems administration and diagnostic purposes, and to detect improper use of the site. Logs may also be used to generate aggregate, non-personally identifiable information for advertisers or other third parties.</li><li>HighBeam also contracts with third parties to help us understand how people use our web site and to provide functionalities such as e-mail distribution, ad serving and customer surveys. These companies also use cookies. They may also use other tracking technologies, such as web beacons (also known as clear GIFs, web bugs, tracking pixels or action tags), which are similar in function to cookies, allowing them to determine when users have reached particular web pages on the HighBeam site.</li><li>Cookies and web beacons allow HighBeam and its third-party service providers to collect and analyze aggregate information about how its web site is used, including tracking web site usage categorized by non-personally identifiable information such as user age, profession, or place of residence.</li><li>HighBeam does not use cookies, web beacons, its internal logs or any other technologies to associate your personally identifiable information with information about your use of the site.</li><li>HighBeam is currently using and has contracted with Omniture, a third party, to track and analyze non-personally identifiable usage and volume statistical information from our members and visitors (e.g., percentage of our site’s users who live in particular countries or fall into various age ranges). This helps us administer our web site and constantly improve the quality of the services that we offer you. All data collected by Omniture on behalf of HighBeam is owned and used by HighBeam. HighBeam reserves the right to publish non-personally identifiable, summary information regarding its web site members and visitors for promotional purposes and as a representative audience for advertisers. Please note that this is not personally identifiable information, only summaries of the activities or broad characteristics of our members and visitors. </li><li>Omniture uses cookies and web beacons to help track visitor behavior and sets cookies on behalf of HighBeam which will be listed under the domain 2O7.net. For more information about Omniture's privacy policy, including how to opt out, go to <a href="http://www.omniture.com/policy.html">www.omniture.com/policy.html</a>.</li><li>We sell advertising on our site in order to provide parts of our service for free and at a more affordable price for paying customers.

Most of the advertisements appearing on this web site are delivered to you by 24/7 Real Media, Inc., our web advertising partner.

We also reserve the right to assign, sell, license, or otherwise transfer to a third party your personally identifiable information in connection with an assignment, sale, joint venture, or other transfer of all or substantially all of our assets.</li><li>If you make a purchase by credit card or otherwise provide your credit card information, the relevant data will be securely transmitted to HighBeam's vendor providing such payment processing service. Similarly, if you are using a co-branded site of HighBeam and at least one other third party (indicated by the inclusion of another party's name or product/service name either in the URL or site or by the inclusion of a third party's logos or trademarks in the site), your personally identifiable information may be used by HighBeam pursuant to this Privacy Policy and by the other party pursuant to its privacy policy.

If you provide this information, your personally identifiable information may be provided (either directly from you or by HighBeam) to the advertiser or web site or company making the offer or providing the gift. This Privacy Policy does not cover the privacy and information practices of those advertisers or web sites linked to the HighBeam site.</li><li>HighBeam may use other companies and persons to perform certain functions for us. These functions might include, for example, processing credit card payments, providing customer service, and sending e-mail.
