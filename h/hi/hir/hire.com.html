<p><strong>Cookies</strong> <br>
Cookies are bits of information sent by web sites to your browser that enable web sites to recognize your browser on future visits.

<p><strong>Information Sharing</strong> <br>
Authoria may use personally identifiable information that you provide for marketing statistical and job seeking purposes. However, Authoria never willfully discloses any individually identifiable information about its users to third parties without permission to do so, except as required by law or to protect the rights, property or safety of Authoria, our users, or others. We reserve the right to disclose your personally identifiable information as required by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on our web Site. We do not sell users names or email addresses to other companies so that they can send unsolicited email or written promotional materials. We may employ outside service providers to perform functions on our behalf, such as provide marketing assistance, process credit card payments, or provide customer service, for example, when registering for the Authoria Users Conference. The purpose of such companies’ or individuals’ use of such information is limited to performing their function for Authoria and not for any other purpose. The information these providers make available may be presented in a "framed" format, where the Authoria border will surround the pages 
served by the service provider. In either case, the service provider is prominently identified. Please be aware that any information you provide on those framed pages is provided directly to those service providers for processing; however, Authoria maintains ownership and control of the submitted information. The service provider is prohibited from using the information for any secondary purposes.

<p><strong>Processing on Behalf of a Customer</strong><br>
Authoria conducts its business according to the EU Safe Harbor Principles and the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) issued by the US Department of Commerce on July 21, 2000.  Authoria has appointed a Security Program Office responsible for the internal supervision of Authoria’s privacy policies. Authoria has also appointed a Chief Security Officer who is responsible for data security. Authoria is committed to educating its customers, associates and employees about the issues, guidelines and laws surrounding the protection of personal and/or sensitive information, including the laws surrounding compliance with EU Safe Harbor. </p>

<p><strong>Testimonials</strong><br>
We post customer testimonials on our web site which may contain personally identifiable information such as the customer's name. We do obtain the customer's consent prior to posting the testimonial to post their name along with their testimonial.</p>

<p><strong>Processor on Behalf</strong><br>
Authoria provides On-Demand services designed to help companies manage their human resources data more effectively. In this capacity, Authoria does not own or control any of the information it processes on behalf of its customers. All such information is owned and controlled by the customer; Authoria receives this information merely as a processor on the customer’s behalf.  When Authoria acts as a processor on behalf of its customer, the policies outlined below apply to all data processing operations concerning personal information including that which has been transferred from the EU to the U.S.</p>

<p><strong>Processing Contracts</strong><br>
Before starting any processing on behalf of Authoria's customer, Authoria will enter into a contract with the data controller responsible for the personal information. Where the data controller is in the EU, such contract is intended to include provisions relevant to the applicable EU Member State Data Protection law. Among other things, the processing contract ensures that the data controller will be in compliance with all applicable law, including the Member State Data Protection law. Any data processed by Authoria will not be further disclosed to third parties except where permitted or required by the processing contract, EU Safe Harbor or Member State Data Protection law, as applicable. Any information which Authoria's customer (acting as the data controller) identifies as sensitive will be treated accordingly.  The processing contract will also specify that the processing will be carried out with appropriate data security measures. Authoria has in place measures to protect personal information from loss, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction.</p>

<p><strong>Security</strong><br>
While Authoria actively works to prevent third party access to personally identifiable information, the user acknowledges that internet communications are not always secure. In view of the foregoing, Authoria cannot warrant that the users’ personally identifiable information will not be accessed by unauthorized third parties, and user agrees that Authoria cannot be liable for such disclosure. In addition, the user is responsible for preventing unauthorized access to the users own passwords and computer. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Authoria uses industry standard encryption technology, such as digital IDs to protect its web servers, and secure communications to prevent data theft. All of our data is behind a firewall. Sensitive information, such as information transmitted via the Customer Connection, is encrypted prior to transmission through SSL and hashed for storage. We regularly review and improve our security policies as necessary, and only authorized individuals have access to the information provided by our customers.  In addition, Authoria has in place Data Security Policies to protect personal information from loss, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction. Authoria's Security Program Office is responsible for conducting investigations into any alleged computer or network compromises, incidents or problems and ensuring the proper disciplinary action is taken against those who 
violate Authoria's Data Security Policy. Any security compromises or potential security compromises and any inquiries concerning security should be reported to the Authoria Security Program Office. The Authoria Security Program Office may be contacted by telephone or mail at:</p>
