<h1>Hire.com's Commitment to Confidentiality</h1>

<p>Hire.com has gone to great lengths to respect the privacy of the individuals that visit our powered site. The "Powered By Hire.com" sticker provides you with the knowledge that the information you entrusted with us is confidential. All of the information you provide to us is voluntary. We promote the use of anonymity and confidentiality within the system. This privacy statement discloses how we use the information you choose to provide in your navigation through our site.</p>

<img src="/img/hrule_blue_155.gif" width="155" height="4" alt="horizontal rule" border="0">

<p><strong>TRUSTe Certification</strong><br><a href="https://www.truste.org/validate/4359" target="new"><img src="/company/img/btn_trusteclick.gif" width="91" height="73" align="right" alt="eTrust" border="0"></a>
This confirms that Hire.com is a licensee of the TRUSTe Privacy Program.</p> 

<p>TRUSTe is an independent, non-profit privacy organization whose mission is to build users trust and confidence on the Internet and, in doing so, accelerate growth of the Internet industry. The TRUSTe privacy program-based on a branded online seal, the TRUSTe "trustmark"-bridges the gap between users concerns over privacy and Web sites desire for self-regulated information disclosure standards. When visiting a Web site displaying the TRUSTe trustmark, you can expect to be notified of:
</p><ol><li>What personally identifiable information is collected. 
</li><li>What organization is collecting this information. 
</li><li>How the information may be used. 
</li><li>With whom this information may be shared, if at all. 
</li><li>What choices are available to you regarding collection, use, disclosure and distribution your information. 
</li><li>What kinds of security is in place to protect against the loss, misuse or alteration of your information. 
</li><li>How you can correct any inaccuracies in your information.</li> </ol><p></p>

<p>If you have questions or concerns regarding this statement, you should first contact Hire.com by written request at the address located on our website. If you do not receive acknowledgment of your inquiry or your inquiry has not been satisfactorily addressed, you should then contact TRUSTe. TRUSTe will then serve as a liaison with the Web site to resolve your concerns.</p>

<img src="/img/hrule_blue_155.gif" width="155" height="4" alt="horizontal rule" border="0">

<p><strong>Information Collection</strong><br>
Hire.com's collection policies enable you to choose how much information you provide and how this information is used. A Hire.com goal is to use this information to help further your experience in an environment that is sensitive to confidentiality.</p> 

<img src="/img/hrule_blue_155.gif" width="155" height="4" alt="horizontal rule" border="0">

<p><strong>Our Disclosure of Your Information</strong><br> 
Hire.com will not share, sell or rent any personally identifiable information about you to any third party without your approval. However, aggregate and demographic data, which is not associated with an individual user's personally identifiable information, will be shared to analyze trends and statistics to our web site.</p>

<p>Although Hire.com uses industry standard practices to protect your privacy, you cannot be assured that all of your private communications and other personally identifiable information will never be disclosed in ways not otherwise described in the Privacy Statement. By way of example, should you elect to subscribe to one of our offered services that is provided by a partner to Hire.com, e.g. HireMail is provided through a partner OfficeDomain, your information may be required to be disclosed to third parties for use of the service. While Hire.com takes measures to protect your privacy while on our website, due to the nature of the Internet, Hire.com is not responsible for nor do we control how third party's use a visitor's information when that visitor chooses to subscribe to a third party.</p>

<img src="/img/hrule_blue_155.gif" width="155" height="4" alt="horizontal rule" border="0">

<p><strong>Usage Tracking</strong><br>
Like many sites on the Internet, Hire.com automatically tracks certain information about you as you use our site. This information includes the Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for previously accessed sites, URLs for subsequently accessed sites (whether this URL is our site or not), type of browser, and your IP address. We may use your IP address to help diagnose problems with a server, and to administer our Web site. Generally available information about your machine capabilities are used to allow your experience to be a rewarding one. This includes the use of a user's domain name, browser type, MIME capabilities, and IP address provided by browsers. Hire.com tracks user traffic patterns via the Web server but does not associate this information with an individual user. This says that a user session may be tailored or tracked by browser or origin, but the user will be confidential.</p> 

<img src="/img/hrule_blue_155.gif" width="155" height="4" alt="horizontal rule" border="0">

<p><strong>Cookies</strong><br>
In addition to information provided by your browser, small data files called cookies can be created to help tailor your site visit. Cookies are optional on our site. Should you choose to accept the cookie, the information is stored on your hard disk for later retrieval by us the next time you visit. Cookies, by themselves, cannot be used to identify the individual user. Once you accept the cookie, the information that you volunteer to provide us; email address, name, address, phone number, company information, and site preferences will be tied to the cookie. On your return visit to our site, if you have elected to accept the cookie, we can streamline your login to the site and provide you with the relevant updates for information you have chosen to be informed about.</p>

<p>If you choose to not take advantage of the cookie, acceptance of cookies can be turned off via your browser. Cookies are optional; you do not need cookies turned on to navigate through our site. Session information is only gathered while you are browsing our site. No information will be stored in a cookie on your machine if you choose not to accept cookies.</p>

<img src="/img/hrule_blue_155.gif" width="155" height="4" alt="horizontal rule" border="0">

<p><strong>Demonstration Registration</strong><br>
You can choose to request an on-line demo of our product offering from Hire.com. Information collected will help our team to evaluate the level of demonstration you require and evaluate materials of preparation. This information may be used for future correspondence purposes. You have the option to opt-out of this email communication by contacting us through our website Contact Us web page.</p>

<img src="/img/hrule_blue_155.gif" width="155" height="4" alt="horizontal rule" border="0">

<p><strong>Partnering Registration</strong><br>
If you are a company that wishes to take advantage of our Partner program, we request that you fill out our Partnering registration form. Information collected will help our team to evaluate the level of partnership you requested and evaluate where the best opportunities exist. This information may be used for future correspondence purposes concerning the partnership program. No information gathered outside of this form will be used for evaluating the partnership application. You have the option to opt-out of this email communication by contacting us through our website Contact Us web page.</p> 

<p>General users note: No data collected from the Hire.com site will be passed to our Partners. Listed Partners are referrals based on the relationships that Hire.com has established. These relationships enable companies to take advantage of our total solution service offering.</p>

<img src="/img/hrule_blue_155.gif" width="155" height="4" alt="horizontal rule" border="0">

<p><strong>Career Section Optional Registration</strong><br>
Information that you share with us is used primarily to make your career choices easier to match with opportunities available at our site. This includes information such as desired locations, job experience, salary expectations, areas of certification, or other general desires. Occasionally we will want to inform you of other note worthy facts about us, for which you will be asked to provide an email address for correspondence. Once you have found a job that meets your expectations, we will ask for you to complete a questionnaire and provide your name, address, phone number, and a resume statement. This information is forwarded to the hiring authority for consideration for the job.</p>

<p>One of the unique features of our site is that you have two choices of accessing the system:</p>

<p><strong>1. Anonymous Queries:</strong><br>
</p><ul>At any time, you can choose to anonymously query the information posted on the site. For a more detailed search for jobs, you can choose to register on the site as an Anonymous user. Our site's registration form requires users to give us a contact identifier (an email address; see 3rd party Email Provider below for details), that will be used to access the system. You then have the choice to selectively receive notifications of matching jobs and other related correspondence about our company. We do not gather additional personal information without your active permission and participation.<p></p> 

<p>NOTE: A search engine behind the scenes will match your provided information with the jobs listed on the site. By default an Anonymous registration is not searchable by an individual at the company. Only when you choose to become Searchable will the system allow your information to be visible to a hiring manager or recruiter in the system. Only selected individuals (HR Personnel, hiring managers or recruiters of the company, or our support staff) have the authority to access the information you provide.</p></ul>

<p><strong>2. Personal Login Account:</strong><br>
</p><ul>At any time, you can convert an Anonymous registration to a Personal login account. We use demographic and profile data to tailor your experience at our site, showing you content that we think you might be interested in, and displaying the content according to your preferences. Unique identifiers (like your name), financial information (like a preferred salary range), and demographic information (like a zip code or job experience level) are optionally requested to help refine your Job Search. Users may opt-out of receiving future mailings; see the choice/opt-out section below.<p></p> 

<p>At this point you can opt to form a relationship with us such that we can manually search our database for jobs matching your preferences. Unlike job search and resume storage systems in the past, your information resides in our company database and is not available to a third party or anyone outside of our company. You can rest assured that we acknowledge your interest in our company and want to maintain a lasting relationship with you in the event a perfect job match arises.</p>

<p>While Hire.com has taken steps to protect your privacy, this site contains links to other sites. Hire.com is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such Web sites.</p></ul><p></p>

<img src="/img/hrule_blue_155.gif" width="155" height="4" alt="horizontal rule" border="0">

<p><strong>3rd Party Email Provider</strong><br> 
Hire.com has partnered with an email provider to offer you the opportunity to create a free email address. Hire.com is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content associated on the provider's web site. Once you register for the new email account, their system will return you back to our site to continue your registration process. Your newly created email address and password are initially synchronized between the two systems. At the preferences page, you may provide a new password for our site independent of your email account password.</p> 

<img src="/img/hrule_blue_155.gif" width="155" height="4" alt="horizontal rule" border="0">

<p><strong>Job Submission Process</strong><br>
Once a job match has been identified and you have chosen to return to the system and pursue an application, the system will prompt you through a series of questions. At this time, while it is possible to remain anonymous and not submit a resume at this time, it would be beneficial for you to provide personal contact information (such as your name, phone number or email address) that will allow us to get in touch with you. There is a possibility that you will be asked to fill in a questionnaire for the position. Your contact information and any resume, along with the answers to the questionnaire will be forwarded to the hiring authority. Your profile preferences are not shared with the hiring authority.</p>

<img src="/img/hrule_blue_155.gif" width="155" height="4" alt="horizontal rule" border="0">

<p><strong>"Refer A Friend" service</strong><br>
You can choose to electronically forward a job description to someone else by clicking on the "Refer a Friend" link at the bottom of the job. The user must provide the recipient's email address for which to send the job. This information is used only in the case of transmitting the job information and letting the recipient know who sent the job description. A brief text message provided by the sender is included with the job referral. This information is not stored/ used for any other purpose.</p> 

<img src="/img/hrule_blue_155.gif" width="155" height="4" alt="horizontal rule" border="0">

<p><strong>Security</strong><br>
This site has security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control. During the career section registration process, you have the option to provide a password for your account. General hiring managers use authentication methods to access general searchable data about registrants. Access to the information obtained via registration forms on our site is monitored according to CERT advisories and CERT-recommended pro-active steps are taken to insure the system security.</p>

<img src="/img/hrule_blue_155.gif" width="155" height="4" alt="horizontal rule" border="0">

<p><strong>Choice/Opt-Out</strong><br>
Our site provides users the opportunity to opt-out of receiving communications from us. Users may change this information any time and as often as necessary (<a href="/careers/frameset.htm">http://careers.hire.com/</a>). You may set your career profile to not receive future communications or to no longer receive our service by logging into your account, selecting the preferences option and deselecting the Notification and Correspondence boxes respectively. A confirmation email of your changes will be sent to you. For registration via our online comments or demonstration requests, please contact us for removal from the list through our Contact Us web page.</p>

<img src="/img/hrule_blue_155.gif" width="155" height="4" alt="horizontal rule" border="0">

<p><strong>Correct/Update</strong><br>
Users may correct/update their career site registration profile, preferences and any submitted resume at any time and as often as necessary at (http://careers.hire.com/). A confirmation email of your changes will be sent to you. To remove your information from our system, please send email to careers-service@hire.com and request removal.</p>

<img src="/img/hrule_blue_155.gif" width="155" height="4" alt="horizontal rule" border="0">

<p><strong>Notification of Changes</strong><br>
If we are going to use your personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection we will notify you via email if you have selected to receive correspondence from us. You will have a choice as to whether or not we use your information in this different manner. You may request your information be removed from future use by Contacting Us through our website or updating your profile through the careers section. In addition, if we make any material changes in our privacy practices that do not affect user information already stored in our database, we will post the notice prominently on our web site notifying users of the change. In some cases where we post the notice we will also email users, who have opted to receive communications from us, notifying them of the changes in our privacy practices.</p> 

<img src="/img/hrule_blue_155.gif" width="155" height="4" alt="horizontal rule" border="0">
