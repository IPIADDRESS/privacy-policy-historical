              One of the unique features of our site is that you have two choices 
              of accessing the system:</p>
            <p>1. 
              Anonymous Queries:</p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p>At 
                any time, you can choose to anonymously query the information 
                posted on the site. For a more detailed search for jobs, you can 
                choose to register on the site as an Anonymous user. Our site's 
                registration form requires users to give us a contact identifier 
                (an email address; see 3rd party Email Provider below for details), 
                that will be used to access the system. You then have the choice 
                to selectively receive notifications of matching jobs and other 
                related correspondence about our company. We do not gather additional 
                personal information without your active permission and participation. 
              </p>
              <p>NOTE: 
                A search engine behind the scenes will match your provided information 
                with the jobs listed on the site. By default an Anonymous registration 
                is not searchable by an individual at the company. Only when you 
                choose to become Searchable will the system allow your information 
                to be visible to a hiring manager or recruiter in the system. 
                Only selected individuals (HR Personnel, hiring managers or recruiters 
                of the company, or our support staff) have the authority to access 
                the information you provide.</p>

              Personal Login Account:</p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p>At 
                any time, you can convert an Anonymous registration to a Personal 
                login account. We use demographic and profile data to tailor your 
                experience at our site, showing you content that we think you 
                might be interested in, and displaying the content according to 
                your preferences. Unique identifiers (like your name), financial 
                information (like a preferred salary range), and demographic information 
                (like a zip code or job experience level) are optionally requested 
                to help refine your Job Search. Users may opt-out of receiving 
                future mailings; see the choice/opt-out section below. 
              </p>
              <p>At 
                this point you can opt to form a relationship with us such that 
                we can manually search our database for jobs matching your preferences. 
                Unlike job search and resume storage systems in the past, your 
                information resides in our company database and is not available 
                to a third party or anyone outside of our company. You can rest 
                assured that we acknowledge your interest in our company and want 
                to maintain a lasting relationship with you in the event a perfect 
                job match arises.</p>

              Once a job match has been identified and you have chosen to return 
              to the system and pursue an application, the system will prompt 
              you through a series of questions. At this time, while it is possible 
              to remain anonymous and not submit a resume at this time, it would 
              be beneficial for you to provide personal contact information (such 
              as your name, phone number or email address) that will allow us 
              to get in touch with you. There is a possibility that you will be 
              asked to fill in a questionnaire for the position. Your contact 
              information and any resume, along with the answers to the questionnaire 
              will be forwarded to the hiring authority. Your profile preferences 
              are not shared with the hiring authority.<br>

              the job information and letting the recipient know who sent the
