    <div>
	<br>
        Welcome to the web site (the "Site") of EDN Group Inc. d/b/a HireArt ("HireArt", "we", "us" and/or "our"). This Site is operated by
        HireArt and has been created to provide information about our company and to provide certain employment and recruitment-related services (the
        "HireArt Services") to our Site visitors ("you", "your"). This Privacy Policy sets forth HireArt's policy with respect to information
        including personally identifiable data ("Personal Data") and other information that is collected from Site visitors.

        Information We Collect:
    </div>
    <div>
        When you interact with us through the Site, we may collect Personal Data and other information from you, as further described below:
    </div>
    <div>
	<br>
        Personal Data That You Provide Through the Site: We collect Personal Data from you when you voluntarily provide such information, such as when you
        register with the Site, apply to take a test or for employment, contact us with inquiries, respond to one of our surveys or use certain HireArt
        Services. Wherever HireArt collects Personal Data we make an effort to provide a link to this Privacy Policy. 
    </div>
    <div>
	<br>
        By voluntarily providing us with Personal Data, you are consenting to our use of it in accordance with this Privacy Policy. If you provide Personal
        Data to this Site, you acknowledge and agree that such Personal Data may be transferred from your current location to the offices and servers of HireArt and the authorized third parties referred to herein located in the United States. 
    </div>
    <div>
	<br>
        Other Information:
    </div>
    <div>
        Non-Identifiable Data: When you interact with HireArt through the Site, we receive and store certain personally non-identifiable information.
        Such information, which is collected passively using various technologies, cannot presently be used to specifically identify you. HireArt may
        store such information itself or such information may be included in databases owned and maintained by HireArt affiliates, agents or service
        providers. This Site may use such information and pool it with other information to track and analyze such information. It is important to note that no
        Personal Data is available or used in this process.
    </div>

    <div>
	<br>
        In operating this Site, we may use a technology called "cookies." A cookie is a piece of information that the computer that hosts our Site gives to
        your browser when you access the Site. Our cookies help provide additional functionality to the Site and help us analyze Site usage more accurately.
        For instance, our Site may set a cookie on your browser that allows you to access the Site without needing to remember and then enter a password more
        than once during a visit to the Site. In all cases in which we use cookies, we will not collect Personal Data except with your permission. On most web
        browsers, you will find a "help" section on the toolbar. Please refer to this section for information on how to receive notification when you are
        receiving a new cookie and how to turn cookies off. We recommend that you leave cookies turned on because they allow you to take advantage of some of
        the Site's features. 
    </div>

    <div>
	<br>
        Aggregated Personal Data: In an ongoing effort to better understand and serve the users of the HireArt Services and to otherwise improve the
        HireArt Services, HireArt may conduct research on its user demographics, test answers and results, interests and behavior based on the
        Personal Data and other information provided to us. This research may be compiled and analyzed on an aggregate basis, and HireArt may use and
        share this aggregate data with its affiliates, agents and business partners. This aggregate information does not identify you personally. HireArt may also disclose aggregated user statistics to current and prospective business partners, and to other third parties for other lawful
        purposes.

        HireArt uses the Personal Data you provide in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Policy. If you provide Personal Data for a certain
        reason, we may use the Personal Data in connection with the reason for which it was provided. HireArt and its subsidiaries and affiliates (the
        "HireArt Related Companies") may also use your Personal Data and other personally non-identifiable information collected through the Site to
        help us improve the content and functionality of the Site, to better understand our users and to improve the HireArt Services. HireArt
        and its affiliates may use this information to contact you in the future to tell you about services (including potential job opportunities) we believe
        will be of interest to you. From time to time, we may also make certain Personal Data and other personally non-identifiable information available to
        prospective employers and on publicly accessible portions of the Site. If we do so, we will permit you to "opt-out" of such features. &nbsp;In addition, if
        at any time you wish not to receive any future communications or you wish to have your name deleted from our mailing lists, please contact us as
