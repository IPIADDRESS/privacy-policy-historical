          <strong><br>
          </strong>
          <div><strong>CalOPPA   is the first state law in the nation to require commercial websites and   online services to post a privacy policy.  The law's reach stretches   well beyond California to require any person or company in the United   States (and conceivably the world) that operates websites collecting   Personally Identifiable Information from California consumers to post a   conspicuous privacy policy on its website stating exactly the   information being collected and those individuals or companies with whom   it is being shared. -  See more at:   http://consumercal.org/california-online-privacy-protection-act-caloppa/#sthash.0FdRbT51.dpuf<br>

          </strong>
          <div><strong>The   Fair Information Practices Principles form the backbone of privacy law   in the United States and the concepts they include have played a   significant role in the development of data protection laws around the   globe. Understanding the Fair Information Practice Principles and how   they should be implemented is critical to comply with the various   privacy laws that protect personal information.<br>
            <br>
          </strong></div>
          <div><strong>In order to be in line with Fair Information Practices we will take the following responsive action, should a data breach occur:</strong></div>
          <div><strong>We will notify you via email</strong></div>
          <div><strong>Within 1 business day</strong></div>
          <div><strong><br>
            We   also agree to the Individual Redress Principle which requires that   individuals have the right to legally pursue enforceable rights against   data collectors and processors who fail to adhere to the law. This   principle requires not only that individuals have enforceable rights   against data users, but also that individuals have recourse to courts or   government agencies to investigate and/or prosecute non-compliance by   data processors.</strong></div>
