In these situations, we may also save your payment information and contact information so that you can use them the next time you want to order something from us.</p><p class="Body-copy">&nbsp;</p><p class="Body-copy">If you register or open an account with us, the information we collect may be used to maintain your account, provide you with access to some features of our online environments or offer you the benefits and privileges that typically come along with account registration.</p><p class="Body-copy">&nbsp;</p><p class="Body-copy">We also use the information we collect for other legitimate business purposes, such as to:</p><ul><li class="Body-copy">Send you advertisements, notices and other information regarding our products and services, including notifying you about special promotions;</li><li class="Body-copy">Respond to your inquiries or support requests;</li><li class="Body-copy">Invite you to participate in surveys regarding our products or services;</li><li class="Body-copy">Furnish and maintain our online environments; and</li><li class="Body-copy">Secure our networks and online environments.</li></ul><p class="Body-copy">We may also use the information we collect to offer you customized content, including to:</p><ul><li class="Body-copy">Recognize new or past visitors to our online environments;</li><li class="Body-copy">Remember your personal preferences;</li><li class="Body-copy">Show you more relevant and meaningful advertisements;</li><li class="Body-copy">Better understand the interests of our customers and visitors to our online environments; and</li><li class="Body-copy">Conduct research and analyze the use of our online environments, products, services and advertisements.</li></ul><p class="Body-copy">Some of our applications and mobile-optimized online environments may have location-based features.

Like many companies, we may also utilize third party advertising vendors and other partners to collect this information.</p><p class="Body-copy">&nbsp;</p><p class="Body-copy">One way in which we deliver more meaningful advertisements is through a common form of online advertising known as “<b>retargeting</b>” or “<b>remarketing.</b>” Retargeting works by serving ads on one site based on consumer’s online activities on a different site. For example, if you visit pages on our online environments, you may later see advertisements for Hiscox products and services when you visit third party websites. To do this, Hiscox or our advertising vendors may use a device ID, cookie or similar technology placed by us or the advertising vendor when you visit our online environments or third party websites or apps. The placing of these cookies or other technologies on your device may enable you to be identified across multiple websites and you should consult the privacy policies of our advertising vendors to understand how they collect and use your data.</p><p class="Body-copy">&nbsp;</p><p class="Body-copy">Your ability to control the use of tracking tools, such as cookies, and opt-out of retargeting activities is described in the “<b>CHOICES YOU HAVE ABOUT YOUR INFORMATION</b>” section below.</p><p class="Body-copy">&nbsp;</p><h2 class="call-to-action-red-large" style=" text-align: left;">WHEN WE SHARE YOUR INFORMATION &amp; OUR RELATIONSHIP TO THIRD PARTIES</h2><p class="Body-copy">&nbsp;</p><p class="Body-copy">We may use third parties to perform a variety of functions on our behalf. We may also use third parties to analyze data collected through our online environments. We will not disclose your personally identifying information to anyone other than our employees and those third parties with whom we have a business relationship. If we allow a third party vendor to have access to your personally identifying information, we will not authorize them to take it or use it for any purpose that is not consistent with this privacy statement.</p><p class="Body-copy">&nbsp;</p><p class="Body-copy">We will not sell or disclose any personally identifying information collected from you to an unrelated third party without your express permission, except as explained in this privacy statement.</p><ul><li class="Body-copy"><b>Cookies and Similar Technologies.</b> As discussed above, we may partner with third party advertising vendors to manage our advertising on other websites and apps. Our advertising vendors may use a device ID, cookie or similar technology to collect information about your activities on our online environments to provide you retargeted ads on other websites and apps. If you do not want this information used for the purpose of serving you retargeted ads, you can opt out <a href="http://www.aboutads.info/choices/" target="_blank">here</a> or <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/#completed" target="_blank">here</a>. Please note that opting out of receiving retargeted ads will not prevent you from being served advertisements generally.</li><li class="Body-copy"><b>Vendors and Suppliers.</b> We have relationships with different vendors and suppliers who help us design and maintain our online environments, systems and computer security, respond to consumer inquiries, fulfill orders, analyze our data, create special promotions and engage in any other information uses described in this privacy statement.</li><li class="Body-copy"><b>Legal Requests and Preventing Harm.</b> If we believe that disclosure of information is reasonably necessary to comply with a law, regulation or legal request; to protect the safety, rights, or property of the public, any person, or Hiscox; or to detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues.</li><li class="Body-copy"><b>Change of Ownership or Control.</b> We may engage in a merger, acquisition, bankruptcy, dissolution, reorganization, or similar transaction or proceeding that involves the transfer of the information described in this privacy statement.</li></ul><p class="Body-copy" style=" margin-left: 20.0px;"><b>OTHER IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH THIRD PARTIES</b></p><ul><li class="Body-copy"><b>Links to Other Sites.</b> We may also feature links to websites that we believe you might find useful and informative. Please be aware, however, that we do not endorse or recommend these sites’ content, products or services, and we are not responsible for the privacy practices of these other sites. We encourage you to be aware of and read the privacy policy or statement of each site you visit. Remember, this privacy statement applies solely to information collected or used by Hiscox.</li><li class="Body-copy"><b>Social Media Plugins.</b> Our online environments may use social media plugins (for example, the Facebook, Twitter or LinkedIn buttons) to enable you to visit pages on these social media sites or to easily share information with others. When you visit our online environments, the operator of the social plugin can place a cookie on your device, enabling that operator to recognize individuals who have previously visited our online environments. If you are logged into the social media website (for example, Facebook, Twitter, Google+) while browsing on our online environments, the social plugins allow that social media website to receive information that you have visited our online environments. We do not control any of the content from the social media plugins. For more information about social plugins from other social media websites you should refer to those sites’ privacy and data sharing statements.</li></ul><h2 class="call-to-action-red-large" style=" text-align: left;">CHOICES YOU HAVE ABOUT YOUR INFORMATION</h2><p class="Body-copy">&nbsp;</p><p class="Body-copy">You may always limit the amount and type of information that we collect from you by choosing not to enter or provide any information requested from you on our online environments (for example, quotes and support requests can be made through our call center agents). However, some of our products and services can only be provided to you if you provide us with requested information. Some of the products and services offered through our online environments may ask whether you wish to opt out or opt into our contact lists for offers, promotions and additional products and services that may be of interest to you.</p><p class="Body-copy">&nbsp;</p><p class="Body-copy">You can opt out of marketing emails we may send to you by following the “unsubscribe” instructions provided in such emails. If you opt out of our marketing emails, we may still send you transactional and relationship emails, such as emails about your orders and account.</p><p class="Body-copy">&nbsp;</p><p class="Body-copy">You may also be provided with preference questions or preference boxes allowing you to indicate that you do not want our online environments to use tracking technologies, such as cookies, to “remember” the information collected on return visits, such as user IDs or mailing addresses. In addition, you may be able to control the use of tracking tools and limit retargeting activities as follows:</p><ul><li class="Body-copy"><b>Controlling Tracking Tools.</b> Most web browsers have an option for turning off the cookie feature, which will prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, as well as (depending on the sophistication of your browser software) allowing you to decide on acceptance of each new cookie in a variety of ways. For more information about cookies and how to refuse them, visit <a href="http://www.allaboutcookies.org/" target="_blank">here</a> and <a href="http://www.adobe.com/devnet/security.html" target="_blank">here</a>. To control flash cookies, which we may use on certain online environments from time to time, you can go <a href="http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager07.html" target="_blank">here</a> (note, this separate link is provided because flash cookies cannot be controlled through your browser settings).</li><li class="Body-copy"><b>Opting-Out of Retargeting Activities.</b> The Self-Regulatory Program for Online Behavioral Advertising program provides customers with the ability to opt-out of having their online behavior recorded and used for advertising purposes. To opt out of having your online behavior collected for advertising purposes and receiving behavioral advertisements from our advertising partners, including retargeting advertisements, click <a href="http://www.aboutads.info/choices/" target="_blank">here</a> or <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/#completed" target="_blank">here</a>. Choices you make are both browser and device-specific. Also, certain versions of the iOS operating system permit you to “Limit Ad Tracking” in the system settings, and certain versions of the Android operating system allow you to “Opt out of Interest-Based Ads” in the system settings.</li></ul><p class="Body-copy" style=" margin-left: 20.0px;"><b>DO-NOT-TRACK SIGNALS AND SIMILAR MECHANISMS</b></p><p class="Body-copy">&nbsp;</p><p class="Body-copy">Some web browsers may transmit “do-not-track” signals to websites with which the browser communicates. As of the Effective Date of this privacy statement, an industry standard has not yet been established on how to respond to these signals. Therefore, we do not currently respond to these signals, but we may reassess our response approach once a standard is established.</p><p class="Body-copy">&nbsp;</p><h2 class="call-to-action-red-large" style=" text-align: left;">HOW YOU CAN ACCESS AND CORRECT YOUR INFORMATION</h2><p class="Body-copy">&nbsp;</p><p class="Body-copy">You can access, change or remove information previously provided to us upon request by contacting our Legal Department at <a href="mailto:US_Helpdesk_RFL@Hiscox.com">US_Helpdesk_RFL@Hiscox.com</a> or by writing to us at Hiscox Inc., 520 Madison Avenue, 32nd Floor, New York, NY 10022. For record keeping and compliance purposes, we will retain certain information collected from you in conjunction with commercial transactions.</p><p class="Body-copy">&nbsp;</p><h2 class="call-to-action-red-large" style=" text-align: left;">HOW WE SECURE YOUR INFORMATION</h2><p class="Body-copy">&nbsp;</p><p class="Body-copy">We have instituted physical, technical and procedural safeguards to store and maintain information we collect in a secure environment. For example, when any confidential information is transmitted over public infrastructure it is encrypted. You may also be required to use a password to access certain pages on our online environments where certain types of your information can be changed or deleted. It is therefore important for you to protect against unauthorized access to your password and to your device. You take full responsibility for maintaining the complexity and confidentiality of your password. While we have implemented safeguards, you should be aware that Internet security technology rapidly changes. We cannot guarantee that the safeguards we employ today can protect your information from the threats of tomorrow. You should also be aware that despite our efforts, factors beyond our control may result in disclosure of information. Accordingly, we are not in a position to guarantee that your information will be secure under all circumstances.</p><p class="Body-copy">&nbsp;</p><h2 class="call-to-action-red-large" style=" text-align: left;">OUR POLICY ON CHILDREN’S INFORMATION</h2><p class="Body-copy">&nbsp;</p><p class="Body-copy">We do not knowingly collect or use any information from children (we define “children” as minors younger than 13) on our online environments. We do not knowingly allow children to order our products or services, communicate with us or use any of our online environments. If you are a parent and become aware that your child has provided us with information, please contact us using one of the methods specified below, and we will work with you to address this issue.</p><p class="Body-copy">&nbsp;</p><h2 class="call-to-action-red-large" style=" text-align: left;">YOUR CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS</h2><p class="Body-copy">&nbsp;</p><p class="Body-copy">Information collected from you may be shared among and between the Hiscox affiliates, some of which do not share the Hiscox name, for their own direct marketing purposes.
