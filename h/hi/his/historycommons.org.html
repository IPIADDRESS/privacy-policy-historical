<p>The policies below are applicable  to the website that is accessible by the domain names historycommons.org,  historycommons.net, grassrootsoversight.org, grassrootsoversight.net, historycommons.org, and historycommons.net  (“Website”), produced and maintained by 
the Center for Grassroots Oversight (collectively “the Center”  or “we”, “us”, or “our”). We have established 
this security and privacy policy (“Privacy Policy”) to let you  know the kinds of personal information we may gather during your visit to the 
Website, why we gather your information, what we use your personal information  for, when we might disclose your personal information, and how you can manage 
your personal information.</p>  <p><strong>By visiting our Website, you are accepting the practices 
described in our Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to the terms of this Privacy 
Policy, please do not use the Website and exit immediately. We reserve the  right to modify or amend the terms of our Privacy Policy from time to time 
without notice. Your continued use of our Website following the posting of  changes to these terms will mean you accept those changes. </strong></p>
<p>If you don't find your concern  addressed here, feel free to email us through the <a href="contact.jsp">Contact 
Page</a>.  </p> <h2>What Information Do We Collect?</h2>  <p>The Center strives to ask only for the minimal amount of information
required to provide the Website and Services.  As a result, the answer to this question depends almost entirely on how you choose to
make use of our Website.</p>  <h2>Personal Information</h2>   <p>You can access our Website and most of the Content provided therein without 
providing any information at all. In certain circumstances, the Center may  collect certain information that identifies you, such as your name, address, 
email address or credit card information, as well as other individually-identifiable 
information that you provide to us or that we collect (“Personal Information”). 
The Center collects such Personal Information from you only during (i) new  user registration, (ii) submission of timeline entries, (iii) when you register 
for email mailing lists, and (iv) during donations or purchases, which are  handled through PayPal®, Yahoo! Store, or Groundspring. In order to submit a timeline 
entry or to post in the forum area, registration is required. </p>  <p>Registered users who have the roles of project managers, contenteditors, or copyeditors
will need to submit their names in addition to the other Personal Information requested during registration.  People who volunteer to
assist us with specific projects and tasks, such as managing and tracking projects, must register in the Volunteer section of the
website and provide their name and email address.  Volunteers also have the option of providing their phone number, fax number, address,
and a website address.  </p>  <h2>Anonymous Information</h2> <p>Through your use of the Website, the Center may also gather certain information 
that does not identify you individually (“Anonymous Information”).  Generally, this information is collected through "traffic data" and 
may entail the use of "Cookies," "IP addresses" or other  numeric codes used to identify a computer. We use Cookies to keep our registered 
users logged in to the Website. </p>  <h2>User Names and Contact Information</h2>
<p>User names may be displayed on the website in the following circumstances. Users who have registered on the Website are able to look at special
views of the timelines that display a "history" link above each timeline entry. Clicking on the "history" link
displays a list of past versions of that particular timeline entry.  Next to each version is the user name—i.e., the name that the user submitted when he or she registered on
the Website—of the person who submitted it. </p>  <p>The user names of users who submit events that are approved are displayed on the site home page (index.jsp) and all the project home pages (project.jsp[...])  in the "Recently Added Events" lists. Each of the recently approved submitted events in these lists includes the user name of the user who submitted the event. When that user has a website, the user's user name may be hyperlinked to that site.</p>
<p>In addition, users who post in the Forum area may, at their option, allow for other Forum participants to send a private email message to
them directly.  However, the recipient user's email address will not be visible to the email sender from the Website. </p>
<p>Other features may be added to the site that also display a user's user name.</p>
<h2>Email Updates</h2>  <p>The Center collects email addresses of all users who subscribe 
to our email updates, make donations, or purchase items from historycommonsstore.org. This information is not shared with any third parties 
for any purposes. We may, from time to time, send registered users emails regarding 
upgrades to the Website, announcements about updates to timelines, guidelines  on writing timeline entries, and the like. Anyone who wishes not to receive 
any future emails from us can, at any time, click on the “Unsubscribe” 
link located at the bottom of each email from the Center. </p>  <h2>Policies for Children Under 13</h2>
<p>We do not knowingly collect any information from persons under the age of 13.  If we learn that any persons under the age of 13 have
provided information about themselves, the information will be deleted.  Our Website is designed for adults.  Our Website is not
intentionally targeted to children under the age of 13.  Children under the age of 13 should not use our Website without obtaining
prior parental consent.   </p>  <h2>Use of Cookies</h2>  <p>The Center may use Cookies to provide some of the services on our Website. 
"Cookies" are pieces of information that a website transfers to your  computer's hard disk for record-keeping purposes. "Cookies” make 
web-surfing easier for you by saving your passwords while you're at our Website.  The use of "Cookies" is standard in the Internet industry, and many 
major websites use them to provide useful features for their users. "Cookies" 
in and of themselves do not personally identify users, although they do identify  a user's computer. Our website never uses “Cookies” to retrieve 
information from your computer that was not originally sent in a “Cookie.” 
Except as described in this Privacy Policy, we do not share information transferred 
through “Cookies” with any third parties whatsoever. We do not  use “Cookies” to identify specific individuals. </p>
<h2>How	Do We Use the Information?</h2>  <p>Except as disclosed in this Privacy Policy, we do not use or disclose information 
about your individual visits to our Website or your Personal Information that  you may give us or we may collect to any organization not affiliated with the 
Center. If the Center proposes to permit such use of your Personal Information,  you will be provided an opportunity to instruct the Center not to allow such 
contact. </p>  <h2>Feedback</h2>   <p>The Center may use your Personal Information to track your compliance with 
the Website's rules and regulations, or for editorial and feedback purposes.  </p>
<h2>Use	of Anonymous Information</h2>  <p>Anonymous Information helps us determine how people use 
parts of the Website so we can improve our Website and ensure that it is as  appealing as we can make it for as many people as possible. We may also use 
or share Anonymous Information (or other information, other than Personal Information) 
in any manner that we deem appropriate or necessary. </p>  <h2>Third-Party		Agents &amp; Transactional Partners</h2>
<p>We occasionally have third-party agents perform functions  on our behalf or we partner with another company who provides services within 
our Website, such as credit card processing of donations and purchases made  on the Website. For example, the Center uses PayPal® to process financial 
transactions on the Website, and during those transactions you are transacting  directly with our partner. These entities have access to the Personal Information 
of yours needed to perform their functions, and are contractually obligated  to maintain the confidentiality and security of that Personal Information. 
They are restricted from using or altering this data in any way other than  to provide the requested services to the Website. When you are on our agent's 
or partner's pages, their brands are clearly visible and their terms of service  and privacy policy are posted. We encourage you to read them.</p>
<h2>Emergency Situations</h2> <p>The Center may also disclose Personal Information if required to
do so by law or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary to (a) conform to applicable law or comply with legal
process served on the Center or the Website; (b) protect and defend the rights or property of the Center, the Website or the users of the
Center, and (c) act under emergency circumstances to protect the personal safety of the Center, the users of the Website or the
public.</p> <h2>Links	to Other Websites</h2>  <p>This Privacy Policy applies only to the Center's Website, not to other organizations' 
or companies' websites to which we link. These links include links from sponsors, 
partners, and websites with goals similar to ours and these websites are beyond  our control. These other sites may send their own Cookies to you, collect your 
data or solicit your personal information. Always be aware of where you end  up. We are not responsible for the actions and privacy policies of third parties 
and other websites. We encourage you to read the posted privacy statement and  user terms and conditions whenever interacting with any other website. </p>
<h2>Security	Policy</h2>  <p>We	exercise great care in providing secure transmission of your
information from your PC to our servers. Personal Information collected by the Center is stored in secure operating environments
that are not available to the public.  Only those employees who need access to your Personal Information in order to do their jobs are
allowed access. Any employee who violates our privacy and/or security policies is subject to disciplinary action, including possible
termination and civil and/or criminal prosecution.</p>  <p>While		we make reasonable efforts to safeguard your Personal Information
once we receive it, no transmission of data over the Internet or any other public network can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.  As a
result, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us or information we transmit to you from our
Website, and you do so at your own risk.</p>  <h2>Public		Areas and Forums</h2>  <p>Please
remember that any information you share in public areas, such as the Forums or in timeline submissions, becomes public, and therefore this
Privacy Policy does not apply to any information you choose to make public.  Please be careful about what you disclose and do not post
any Personal Information that you expect to keep private.   </p>  <h2>Governing 	Law/Assignment</h2>
<p>Our Website is published in the United States. U.S. law shall govern in any and all disputes, including privacy or defamation
issues or otherwise.</p> <p>The Center may change its ownership or corporate organization while providing 
the Website and services. As a result, please be aware that the Center may  transfer your information to another organization or company that is affiliated 
with the Center or with which the Center has merged. Any new organization or  company will also follow this Privacy Policy.</p>
<h2>Changes</h2>  <p>As we continue to develop our Website, we may add new services and
features.  In the event that these additions affect our Privacy Policy, this document will be updated appropriately.  We will post
those changes prominently so that you will always know what information we gather, how we might use that information and whether
we will disclose it to anyone.  We do, however, recommend that you read this Privacy Policy each time you use our website in case you
missed our notice of changes to the Privacy Policy.</p>  <h2>Opt-Out 	and Correction Procedures</h2>
<p>You	always may opt-out of receiving future email messages and announcements.  The Center provides you with the opportunity to
opt-out of receiving our communications in every email we send. </p>  <p>To remove your Personal Information from our database, correct 
or update Personal Information that you have previously provided to us, and/or  not to receive future communications, send email through the <a href="contact.jsp">Contact 
Page</a> on the Website indicating the information that you wish to be corrected, 
updated, or removed, or your request not to be sent future communications from  the Center.</p>
<h2>Questions</h2>  <p>Please email us through the <a href="contact.jsp">Contact  Page</a> any questions you have regarding this statement. </p>
<p>To  return to the Web site, please use the "Back" button on	your browser. </p>
