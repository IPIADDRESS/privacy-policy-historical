      <b>Here at Hitsquad we value Your privacy.</b>
      <p>
        <b>Personal Information</b><br>
        Hitsquad collects personal information about our users during
        registration for paid services and some free services, from our use
        of "cookie" technology as you use the service and sometimes during
        entry into a Hitsquad contest or sweepstakes. 
      </p><p>
        Hitsquad uses reasonable precautions to keep any personal information
        disclosed to us secure and we never disclose such information to third
        parties without your express permission.  We only ever use personal
        information for the exact purpose we stated when you gave it to us.
        However, we are not responsible for any breach of security or for any
        actions of any third parties which receive the information. Hitsquad
        also links to a wide variety of other sites. We are not responsible
        for their privacy policies or how they treat information about their
        users.      
      </p><p>
        <b>Aggregated Information</b><br>
        We also collect aggregated tracking information derived mainly by
        tallying page views throughout our sites. Such information enables
        us to better tailor our content to visitors' needs and to help our
        advertisers better understand the demographics of our audience.
        Because Hitsquad derives its revenue mainly from advertising,
        providing such aggregated demographic data is essential to
        keeping our service free to users.
