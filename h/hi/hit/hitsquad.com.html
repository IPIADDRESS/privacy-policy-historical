<b>Hitsquad values Your privacy.</b>
      </p><p>
        <b>Personal Information</b><br>
        Hitsquad collects personal information about our users during
        registration for paid services and some free services, from our use
        of "cookie" technology as you use the service and sometimes during
        entry into a Hitsquad contest or sweepstakes. 
      </p><p>
        Hitsquad uses reasonable precautions to keep any personal information
        disclosed to us secure and we never disclose such information to third
        parties without your express permission.  We only ever use personal
        information for the exact purpose we stated when you gave it to us.
        However, we are not responsible for any breach of security or for any
        actions of any third parties which receive the information. Hitsquad
        also links to a wide variety of other sites. We are not responsible
        for their privacy policies or how they treat information about their
        users.      
      </p><p>
        <b>Hitsquad's Use Of Cookies</b><br>
        Hitsquad primarily only sets 'session cookies' which disappear from your
        browser when you close it down, although we may occasionally set longer
        lasting cookies. Only we can retrieve the cookies we have set in your
        browser - no other web site can see this information.
      </p><p>
        We use cookies to maintain virtual 'sessions' for your web browser so that
        our web server knows which information to display to you when it has to
        make a choice. This might be to decide if you are allowed to view certain
        information (such as our paid Membership service) or it may be to decide
        which sponsor's message or advertisement to show you.
      </p><p>
        <b>Aggregated Information</b><br>
        We also collect aggregated tracking information derived mainly by
        tallying page views throughout our sites. Such information enables
        us to better tailor our content to visitors' needs and to help our
        advertisers better understand the demographics of our audience.
        Because Hitsquad derives its revenue mainly from advertising,
        providing such aggregated demographic data is essential to
        keeping our service free to users.
      </p><p>
        <b>Third Party Advertising</b><br>
        All Hitsquad sites including Shareware Music Machine, GuitarSite.com,
        MP3machine.com, MusiciansBooks.com, MusiciansAvailable.com, and
        Music-Charts.com use the services of third party advertising companies
        to serve advertisements when you visit.
      </p><p>
        These companies may use information (not including your name, address,
        email address or telephone number) about your visits to these and other
        web sites in order to provide advertisements on this site and other sites
        about goods and services that may be of interest to you. If you would
        like more information about this practice and to know your choices about
        not having this information used by these companies, please click here

      </p><p>
        <b>Third Party Cookies</b><br>
        In the course of serving advertisements to this site, our advertisers may
        place or recognize a unique "cookie" on your browser.
      </p><p>
        <b>More Information About Cookies</b><br>
        Cookies are small pieces of information that may be placed into your browser
        by any web server your browser connects to. Cookies can only be retrieved
        by a web server from the same domain name as the one that placed it there.
        You can change the way your browser handles cookies, or disable them completely
        by changing your browser's preferences.  You can do this under the 
        Tools&gt;Internet&nbsp;Options menu in Microsoft Internet Explorer, see your
        Help menu in other browsers for information on how to do this.
