Please note that the principles outlined in this document apply only to Hitwise and do not apply to any websites linked to or from Hitwise.
<br><br>The Statement is broken down into several key areas for your benefit:<br>

<br><a href="privacy.html#10"><b>Contact our Privacy Office</b></a><br><br><a name="1"><b>What personally identifiable information is collected?</b></a>
<br>Hitwise collects information in a fair and lawful manner for a number of purposes. For the purposes of both identification and billing, Hitwise may collect details from subscribers (or clients) that include name, address, e-mail address, fax and telephone numbers. Other demographic information may be collected for the purpose of in-house direct marketing campaigns, in accordance with relevant Australian Legislation.

<br><br><a name="2"><b>Other information routinely gathered by Hitwise</b></a>
<br>Hitwise also collects data from a number of

The data collected includes,  for every domain visited the number of page impressions served, hits, user sessions and average time spent by users of the ISP. Data collected from ISP's does not include any personally identifiable information that can be traced to an individual's internet usage. Information from ISP's, subscribers and clients is only retained by Hitwise if it is necessary for the functioning of its services. Disposal of information occurs when required by law, or when there is no longer a reason to retain it.

A cookie is a piece of text that can be entered into the memory of a computer, and is used to identify a client.
