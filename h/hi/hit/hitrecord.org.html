			<p>      Welcome
			to the hitRECord.org LLC ("hitRECord.org") web site and online services
			(the "hitRECord.org Site").   hitRECord.org values the
			privacy of our members and others who visit and use the hitRECord.org

			your privacy seriously and make it a priority to protect personally
			identifiable information that we obtain from and about individuals both
			online and off-line.</p>

			<p>      This
			Privacy Policy describes what information we gather from you, how we
			use that information, and what we do to protect it.  By using the
			hitRECord.org Site (whether or not you are a registered member), you
			expressly consent to the information handling practices described in
			this Privacy Policy. If you do not want information about you to be
			used in the manner set forth in this Privacy Policy, please do not use
			the hitRECord.org Site.</p>
			<p>      This
			Privacy Policy is incorporated into and is subject to the hitRECord.org
			<b><a href="/terms">Terms of Service</a></b>.  Your use of the hitRECord.org Site and
			any personal information you provide on the hitRECord.org Site are subject

			Collects</b>: </p>
			<ul type="DISC">
			  <li><b>User-provided
			  Information</b>:  You may provide to hitRECord.org what is generally
			  called "personally identifiable" information (such as your name,
			  password, gender, email address, postal mailing address, home/mobile
			  telephone number). From time to time,
			  hitRECord.org may also ask you optionally to provide other information.
			  If you choose to provide such information, during registration or otherwise,
			  you are giving hitRECord.org the permission to use and store it consistent
			  with this Privacy Policy. Therefore, please understand that when you
			  sign in with hitRECord.org, you are not anonymous to us. </li>

			  <li><b>"Cookies"
			  Information</b>:  When you visit the hitRECord.org Site, whether
			  or not you are a registered member, we may send one or more cookies
			  - small text files containing a string of alphanumeric characters
			  - to your computer. Cookies remember information about your activities
			  on a website. hitRECord .org may use both session cookies and persistent
			  cookies.  A session cookie disappears after you close your browser.
			  A persistent cookie remains after you close your browser and may be
			  used by your browser on subsequent visits to the hitRECord.org Site.
			  Persistent cookies can be removed.  Please review your web browser
			  "Help" file to learn the proper way to modify your cookie settings.
			  However, without cookies you will not have access to certain services
			  on the hitRECord.org Site. Third party advertisements displayed in connection
			  with the hitRECord.org Site may also contain cookies set by internet
			  advertisers. We do not control these cookies and users of the hitRECord.org
			  Site should check the privacy policy of the advertiser to see whether
			  and how it uses cookies. </li>
			</ul>
			<p><b>The Way hitRECord.org Uses
			Information</b>: </p>
			<ul type="DISC">
			  <li>hitRECord.org collects
			  personally identifiable information when you register as a member in
			  order to establish and enhance our relationship with you. hitRECord.org
			  generally uses the information you provide or that we collect to operate,
			  maintain, enhance, and provide all of the features and services found
			  on the hitRECord.org Site. We will use your email address, without further
			  consent, for non-marketing or administrative purposes such as notifying
			  you of major site updates.  If you have given hitRECord.org consent,
			  we may use your personally identifiable information to provide you with
			  information about hitRECord.org's features, services and other offerings
			  that may be of interest to you. </li>
			  <li>hitRECord.org uses
			  all of the information that we collect from Users to understand and
			  analyze the usage trends and preferences of our Users, to improve the
			  way the hitRECord.org Site works and looks, and to create new features
			  and functionality. </li>
			  <li>hitRECord.org may
			  use "cookies" information to:  (a) remember your information
			  so that you will not have to re-enter it during your visit or the next
			  time you visit the hitRECord.org Site; (b) monitor aggregate site usage
			  metrics such as total number of visitors and pages viewed; and (c) track
			  your entries, submissions, and status in any promotions or other activities. </li>

			</ul>
			<p><b>When hitRECord.org Discloses
			Information</b>:</p>
			<ul type="DISC">
			  <li>hitRECord.org discloses
			  automatically collected and other aggregate non-personally-identifiable
			  information with interested third parties to assist such parties in
			  understanding the usage, viewing, and demographic patterns for certain
			  programs, content, services, advertisements, promotions, and/or functionality
			  on the hitRECord.org Site.</li>
			  <li>hitRECord.org's
			  employees, agents and contractors must have a legitimate business reason
			  to obtain access to the personally identifiable information you may
			  provide to register as a member of hitRECord.org. We may share your
			  personally identifiable information with companies that provide services
			  to us, including outside contractors or agents who help us manage our
			  information, but they may only use your personally identifiable information
			  to provide us with a specific service and not for any other purpose. </li>
			  <li>hitRECord.org may
			  also disclose User information if required to do so by law or in the
			  good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with state
			  and federal laws (such as U.S. Copyright law) or respond to a court
			  order, judicial or other government subpoena, or warrant.  In some
			  cases, we may make such disclosures without first providing notice to
			  Users. </li>
			  <li>hitRECord.org also
			  reserves the right to disclose User information that we believe, in
			  good faith, is appropriate or necessary
			  to take precautions against liability; protect hitRECord.org from fraudulent,
			  abusive, or unlawful uses; to investigate and defend ourselves against
			  any third-party claims or allegations; to assist government enforcement
			  agencies; to protect the security or integrity of the hitRECord.org
			  Site; or to protect the rights, property, or personal safety of hitRECord.org,
			  our Users, or others.</li>

			  <li>In the event that
			  hitRECord.org is acquired by or merged with a third-party entity, we
			  reserve the right, in any of these circumstances, to transfer or assign
			  the information that we have collected from Users
			  as part of such merger, acquisition, sale, or other change of control.</li>
			</ul>
			<p><b>Your Choices</b>: </p>
			<p>   You may,
			of course, decline to share your personally-identifiable information
			with hitRECord.org, in which case hitRECord.org will not be able to
			provide to you some of the features and functionality found on the hitRECord.org
			Site.  If you register as a member of hitRECord.org, you may update,

			<p><b>Third-Party Advertisers,
			Links to Other Sites: </b></p>

			<p>      The
			hitRECord.org Site may be linked to internet websites operated by other

			logo, even though they are not operated or maintained by us. hitRECord.org
			may also permit other companies, called third-party ad servers or ad
			networks, to serve advertisements within the hitRECord.org Site.
			These third-party ad servers or ad networks may use technology to send,

			appear on the hitRECord.org Site.  These advertisers may automatically
			receive your IP address if this happens.  These advertisers may
			also use other technologies (such as cookies, JavaScript, or Web Beacons)
			to measure the effectiveness of their advertisements and to personalize
			the advertising content. </p>
			<p>   You should
			consult the respective privacy policies of these third-party websites
			and third party ad servers or ad networks.  hitRECord.org's Privacy
			Policy does not apply to, and we cannot control the activities of, such
			other third party advertisers or web sites. Please be aware that hitRECord.org

			<p><b>Our Commitment to Children's
			Privacy:</b></p>
			<p>      Protecting
			the privacy of young children is especially important.  For that
			reason, hitRECord.org does not knowingly collect or maintain personally
			identifiable information on the hitRECord.org Site from persons under
			13 years-of-age. If hitRECord.org learns that personally-identifiable
			information of persons less than 13-years-of-age has been collected
			on hitRECord.org without verifiable parental consent, then hitRECord.org
			will take the appropriate steps to delete this information.  If
			you are a parent or guardian and discover that your child under the
			age of 13 has obtained a hitRECord.org Site account, then you may alert
			hitRECord.org at <script type="text/javascript">eval(decodeURIComponent('%64%6f%63%75%6d%65%6e%74%2e%77%72%69%74%65%28%27%3c%61%20%68%72%65%66%3d%5c%22%6d%61%69%6c%74%6f%3a%73%75%70%70%6f%72%74%40%68%69%74%72%65%63%6f%72%64%2e%6f%72%67%5c%22%3e%73%75%70%70%6f%72%74%40%68%69%74%72%65%63%6f%72%64%2e%6f%72%67%3c%5c%2f%61%3e%27%29%3b'))</script><a href="mailto:support@hitrecord.org">support@hitrecord.org</a>			and request that hitRECord.org delete that child's

			<p>      hitRECord.org
			uses commercially reasonable physical, managerial, and technical safeguards
			to preserve the integrity and security of your personal information.
			We cannot, however, ensure or warrant the security of any information
			you transmit to hitRECord.org, and you do so at your own risk.
			Once we receive your transmission of information, hitRECord.org makes
