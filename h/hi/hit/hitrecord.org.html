The old media tends to call me Joseph Gordon-Levitt, that being my name and all. Here in the new media, I hit that round red REC button on a regular basis.<br><br><a href="http://HITRECORD.ORG" target="_blank">HITRECORD.ORG</a> is a project I started almost five years ago now, and in 2010, we've evolved into a full-fledged professional collaborative production company.<br><br>On new year's day, I released this video called THE NEW DEAL in which I've layed out what I want to do with hitRECord, how we're going to do it, and why. This version here was remixed by Tanja, one of our favorite hitRECorders here.<br><br>In a nutshell: we create and develop art and media collaboratively here on our site; we use my position in the traditional entertainment industry to turn that creativity into money-making productions; and then we share any profits with the contributing artists.<br><br>In a nutter shell, we just have fun making things together. Videos, writing, photography, music, anything -- we call them all RECords. Are you RECording?</p>

			  – small text files containing a string of alphanumeric characters 
			  – to your computer. Cookies remember information about your activities

			<p><b>The Way hitRECord.org Uses 
			Information</b>: </p>
			<ul type="DISC">
			  <li>hitRECord.org collects 
			  personally identifiable information when you register as a member in 
			  order to establish and enhance our relationship with you. hitRECord.org 
			  generally uses the information you provide or that we collect to operate, 
			  maintain, enhance, and provide all of the features and services found 
			  on the hitRECord.org Site. We will use your email address, without further 
			  consent, for non-marketing or administrative purposes such as notifying 
			  you of major site updates.  If you have given hitRECord.org consent, 
			  we may use your personally identifiable information to provide you with 
			  information about hitRECord.org’s features, services and other offerings 
			  that may be of interest to you. </li>
			  <li>hitRECord.org uses 
			  all of the information that we collect from Users to understand and 
			  analyze the usage trends and preferences of our Users, to improve the 
			  way the hitRECord.org Site works and looks, and to create new features 
			  and functionality. </li>
			  <li>hitRECord.org may 
			  use “cookies” information to:  (a) remember your information 
			  so that you will not have to re-enter it during your visit or the next 
			  time you visit the hitRECord.org Site; (b) monitor aggregate site usage 
			  metrics such as total number of visitors and pages viewed; and (c) track 
			  your entries, submissions, and status in any promotions or other activities. </li>

			</ul>
			<p><b>When hitRECord.org Discloses 
			Information</b>:</p>
			<ul type="DISC">
			  <li>hitRECord.org discloses 
			  automatically collected and other aggregate non-personally-identifiable 
			  information with interested third parties to assist such parties in 
			  understanding the usage, viewing, and demographic patterns for certain 
			  programs, content, services, advertisements, promotions, and/or functionality 
			  on the hitRECord.org Site.</li>
			  <li>hitRECord.org’s 
			  employees, agents and contractors must have a legitimate business reason 
			  to obtain access to the personally identifiable information you may 
			  provide to register as a member of hitRECord.org. We may share your 
			  personally identifiable information with companies that provide services 
			  to us, including outside contractors or agents who help us manage our 
			  information, but they may only use your personally identifiable information 
			  to provide us with a specific service and not for any other purpose. </li>
			  <li>hitRECord.org may 
			  also disclose User information if required to do so by law or in the 
			  good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with state 
			  and federal laws (such as U.S. Copyright law) or respond to a court 
			  order, judicial or other government subpoena, or warrant.  In some 
			  cases, we may make such disclosures without first providing notice to 
			  Users. </li>
			  <li>hitRECord.org also 
			  reserves the right to disclose User information that we believe, in 
			  good faith, is appropriate or necessary
			  to take precautions against liability; protect hitRECord.org from fraudulent, 
			  abusive, or unlawful uses; to investigate and defend ourselves against 
			  any third-party claims or allegations; to assist government enforcement 
			  agencies; to protect the security or integrity of the hitRECord.org 
			  Site; or to protect the rights, property, or personal safety of hitRECord.org, 
			  our Users, or others.</li>

			  <li>In the event that 
			  hitRECord.org is acquired by or merged with a third-party entity, we 
			  reserve the right, in any of these circumstances, to transfer or assign 
			  the information that we have collected from Users 
			  as part of such merger, acquisition, sale, or other change of control.</li>
			</ul>
			<p><b>Your Choices</b>: </p>
			<p>   You may, 
			of course, decline to share your personally-identifiable information 
			with hitRECord.org, in which case hitRECord.org will not be able to 
			provide to you some of the features and functionality found on the hitRECord.org 
			Site.  If you register as a member of hitRECord.org, you may update, 
			correct, or delete your profile information and preferences at any time 
			by emailing us at <a href="mailto:support@hitrecord.org">support@hitrecord.org</a>. </p>
			<p>   To 
			protect your privacy and security, we take reasonable steps to verify 
			your identity before granting you account access or making corrections 
			to your information.  You are responsible for maintaining the secrecy 
			of your unique password and account information at all times.  </p>
			<p><b>Third-Party Advertisers, 
			Links to Other Sites: </b></p>

			<p>      The 
			hitRECord.org Site may be linked to internet websites operated by other 
			companies. Some of these websites may be co-branded with our name or 
			logo, even though they are not operated or maintained by us. hitRECord.org 
			may also permit other companies, called third-party ad servers or ad 
			networks, to serve advertisements within the hitRECord.org Site.  
			These third-party ad servers or ad networks may use technology to send, 
			directly to your browser, some of the advertisements and links that 
			appear on the hitRECord.org Site.  These advertisers may automatically 
			receive your IP address if this happens.  These advertisers may 
			also use other technologies (such as cookies, JavaScript, or Web Beacons) 
			to measure the effectiveness of their advertisements and to personalize 
			the advertising content. </p>
			<p>   You should 
			consult the respective privacy policies of these third-party websites 
			and third party ad servers or ad networks.  hitRECord.org’s Privacy 
			Policy does not apply to, and we cannot control the activities of, such 
			other third party advertisers or web sites. Please be aware that hitRECord.org 
			does not warn you when you have chosen to link through to another website 
			from the hitRECord.org Site. <br></p>
			<p><b>Our Commitment to Children’s 
			Privacy:</b></p>
			<p>      Protecting 
			the privacy of young children is especially important.  For that 
			reason, hitRECord.org does not knowingly collect or maintain personally 
			identifiable information on the hitRECord.org Site from persons under 
			13 years-of-age. If hitRECord.org learns that personally-identifiable 
			information of persons less than 13-years-of-age has been collected 
			on hitRECord.org without verifiable parental consent, then hitRECord.org 
			will take the appropriate steps to delete this information.  If 
			you are a parent or guardian and discover that your child under the 
			age of 13 has obtained a hitRECord.org Site account, then you may alert 
			hitRECord.org at <a href="mailto:support@hitrecord.org">support@hitrecord.org</a>			and request that hitRECord.org delete that child’s 
			personal information from its systems. </p>
			<p><b>Our Commitment to Data Security</b>: </p>
			<p>      hitRECord.org 
			uses commercially reasonable physical, managerial, and technical safeguards 
			to preserve the integrity and security of your personal information.  
			We cannot, however, ensure or warrant the security of any information 
			you transmit to hitRECord.org, and you do so at your own risk.  
			Once we receive your transmission of information, hitRECord.org makes 
			commercially reasonable efforts to ensure the security of our systems.  
			However, please note that this is not a guarantee that such information 
			may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any 
			of our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards. </p>

			<p>      If 
			hitRECord.org learns of a security systems breach, then we may attempt 
			to notify you electronically so that you can take appropriate protective 
			steps. hitRECord.org may post a notice on the hitRECord.org Site if 
			a security breach occurs.  Depending on where you live, you may 
			have a legal right to receive notice of a security breach in writing.  </p>
			<p><b>International Visitors</b>:</p>
			<p>      The 
			hitRECord.org Site is hosted in the United States and is intended solely 
			for visitors located within the United States. <i> </i>
			If you nonetheless choose to use the hitRECord.org Site from the European 
			Union or other regions of the world with laws governing data collection 
			and use that may differ from U.S. law, then please note that you are 
			transferring your personally identifiable information outside of those 
			regions to the United States and by providing your personally identifiable 
			information on the hitRECord.org Site you consent to that transfer.</p>
			<p><b>Changes 
			and Updates to this Privacy Policy</b>: </p>
			<p>      This 
			Privacy Policy may be revised periodically without further notice to 
			you and this will be reflected by a “Last Modified” date above.
