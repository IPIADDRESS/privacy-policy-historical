<h4 class="all-caps">3. When Hitrecord.org Discloses Information:</h4>
<div class="panel_wrapper subtle">
<div class="panel">
<div class="panel_bg"></div>
<div class="content strong">
<p>hitRECord.org may share your information, including Personal Information:</p>
<ul>
<li>to our employees, contractors, and advisors;</li>
<li>with third-party service providers;</li>
<li>to comply with legal obligations;</li>
<li>to protect and defend our rights and property or the safety of other Users; and</li>
<li>with your permission.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>
<span class="strong">Internal Disclosures.</span>
hitRECord.org relies upon its employees, directors, and advisors for the operation of the Site.  Those individuals with a need to know for the purposes of providing their services to hitRECord.org may have access to aggregated and Personal Information.  These individuals may only use User information for the purposes of providing services to hitRECord.org and for no other purpose.
</p>
<p>
<span class="strong">Aggregated Information.</span>
hitRECord.org discloses automatically collected and other aggregate, non-personally identifiable information with third parties for understanding the usage, viewing, and demographic patterns for certain programs, content, and services of the Site.  We may use such aggregate information to help us monetize a Production or for other purposes.
</p>
<p>
<span class="strong">We Use Vendors and Service Providers.</span>
We may share any information we receive with vendors and service providers retained in connection with the provision of the Site.  This means that third parties that we rely upon for the operation, maintenance, and improvement of the Site may have access to User information, including Personal Information.  These third parties may only use User information for the purposes of providing services to hitRECord.org and for no other purpose.
</p>
<p>
<span class="strong">Displaying to Other Users.</span>
When you upload content to the Site, including RECords and comments, certain Personal Information about you, such as your user name and identifying photo, may – and likely will be – displayed on the Site. Other more sensitive Personal Information, such as your postal address, e-mail address, phone number, or any taxpayer identification information, will NOT be displayed on the Site.  Other Users of the Site, including Users who come to the Site via a link posted on a third party website, will have access to the publicly displayed information.  We are not responsible for privacy practices of the other Users who will view and use the posted information you choose to make available on or through the Site.  You should therefore be mindful of these types of disclosures when selecting a User name or choosing the photograph to use with your account.
</p>
<p>
<span class="strong">Contributing Artist Profit Pools.</span>
If you are a Contributing Artist and a RECord you have uploaded to the Site is included within a monetized Production, then we will post your hitRECord.org User name, your Contributing Artist’s Share, and the amount of money due you when making disclosures about monetized Productions, whether for the purposes of establishing the Contributing Artists’ Shares in the Contributing Artists Profit Pool or when documenting allocations of the Contributing Artists Profit Pool.  If you do not wish to have your Personal Information disclosed, then you should not contribute a RECord to the Site.
</p>
<p>
<span class="strong">Marketing.</span>
We do not rent, sell, or share your Personal Information with other people or nonaffiliated companies for their direct marketing purposes.  We may, however, allow access to other data collected on or through the Site to enable the delivery of online advertising on and through the Site that may be useful, relevant, valuable or otherwise of interest to you.  For example, we may target communications to you on behalf of third parties based upon your Personal Information without sharing your Personal Information with a third party.  If you respond to such a communication, then the third party may deduce that you meet certain characteristics (e.g., you are a woman between the ages of X and Y).  In all cases, hitRECord.org may market its services to you directly.
</p>
<p>
<span class="strong">As Required By Law and Similar Disclosures.</span>
We may access, preserve, and disclose your Personal Information, other account information, and content if we believe doing so is required or appropriate to: comply with law enforcement requests and legal process, such as a court order or subpoena; respond to your requests; or protect your, our or  others’ rights, property, interests, including with respect to intellectual property or safety.
</p>
<p>
<span class="strong">Merger, Sale, or Other Asset Transfers.</span>
Although we have no present intention to sell hitRECord.org to a third party, take the company public, go into bankruptcy or surrender control of the company, it is always possible that future circumstances may change and result in a change in control, merger, acquisition, financing due diligence, reorganization, bankruptcy, receivership, sale assets, or transition of the Site to another provider. In such an event, your information may be sold or transferred as part of such a transaction as permitted by law and/or contract. The use of your Personal Information following any of the foregoing events should be governed by the provisions of this Privacy Policy in effect at the time such Personal Information was collected.
</p>
<p>
<span class="strong">With Consent.</span>
We may also disclose your Personal Information with your permission.
</p>
<h4 class="all-caps">4. Your Choices:</h4>
<p>
<span class="strong">Abstaining from Disclosing Personal Information.</span>

These advertisers may also use other technologies (such as cookies, JavaScript, or Web Beacons) to measure the effectiveness of their advertisements and to personalize the advertising content.</p>
