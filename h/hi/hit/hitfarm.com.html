As part of this process, we may from time to time, ask you to provide us with certain personal information, for example, your name, date of birth, email address and credit card details. </p>
                            <p class="privacy"> <b>Protecting your privacy</b> <br>
                                <img src="images/spacer.gif" alt="" width="1" height="5" border="0"><br>
        Hitfarm takes all reasonable steps to protect the privacy of our customers and ensure that the personal information we collect is not ordinarily disclosed to third parties without the customer's consent. <br>
        <img src="images/spacer.gif" alt="" width="1" height="5" border="0"><br>
        However, there may be times when Hitfarm may be required to disclose personal information of a customer without their express consent. This may occur where we have reason to believe that disclosing the information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against the customer or another person who may be causing injury to or interference with (either intentionally or unintentionally) the rights or property of Hitfarm or its associates, affiliates, other customers or anyone else that could be harmed by such activities; or required by law. </p>

        Your personal information is used to enable us to deliver our online products and services to you. For example most of our products and services require some form of registration or subscription, while others require a payment to be made via a secure credit card facility. Your contact details may also be required from time to time to notify you of competition prizes you may have won. <br>
        <img src="images/spacer.gif" alt="" width="1" height="5" border="0"><br>
        Some of the information we collect, including that obtained from our customer feedback facilities, is used to help us develop and improve the quality of our products and services, which in turn, provides you with a more satisfying and enjoyable online experience. </p>
                            <p class="privacy"> <b>WHAT WE DO WITH YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION</b> <br>
                                <img src="images/spacer.gif" alt="" width="1" height="5" border="0"><br>
        Your email address and other personal information may be used to enable us to send you marketing or promotional material (such as promotional offers) on other products and services that we consider may be of interest to you. However, you may at any time, notify us that you do not wish to receive this material via an "opt-out" facility contained on our websites. <br>
        <img src="images/spacer.gif" alt="" width="1" height="5" border="0"><br>
        If you no longer wish us to keep a record of your personal information or you need to some of the particulars (for example, your address), you may contact us at the member information page on our websites or by emailing our Customer Support Group at webmaster@Hitfarm.com, so we can correct, update or remove the information you have given us. <br>
        <img src="images/spacer.gif" alt="" width="1" height="5" border="0"><br>

        <img src="images/spacer.gif" alt="" width="1" height="5" border="0"><br>
        Hitfarm also shares collective information about our users (on an anonymous basis) with our advertisers, business partners, sponsors and other third parties. For example, we may disclose the fact that membership to one of our websites is "X" percent male and "Y" percent female. <br>
        <img src="images/spacer.gif" alt="" width="1" height="5" border="0"><br>

        Hitfarm may collect personal information about you and your surfing habits in a number of ways, including: <br>
        <img src="images/spacer.gif" alt="" width="1" height="5" border="0"><br>
        Directly from you, such as when you enter your personal details on our websites to register or subscribe to our services); Indirectly, by keeping a record of our users IP addresses and through the use of "cookies". </p>
                            <p class="privacy"> <b>Use of IP Addresses</b> <br>
                                <img src="images/spacer.gif" alt="" width="1" height="5" border="0"><br>
        An IP address is a number that's automatically assigned to your computer whenever you're surfing the Web. Web servers, (the big computers that "serve up" Web pages) automatically identify your computer by its IP address. <br>
        <img src="images/spacer.gif" alt="" width="1" height="5" border="0"><br>
        We collect IP addresses for the purposes of system administration, to report aggregate information to our advertisers, and to audit the use of our site. When guests request pages from our sites, our servers may log the guests' IP addresses. We do not normally link IP addresses to anything personally identifiable, which means that a user's session will be logged, but the user remains anonymous to us. We can and will use IP addresses to identify a user when we feel it is necessary to enforce compliance with our house rules or terms of service or to protect our service, site, customers or others. <br>
        <img src="images/spacer.gif" alt="" width="1" height="5" border="0"><br>
        Some services provided by Hitfarm, such as certain message boards, may display IP addresses along with the message poster's name and message. Please review each service prior to use and only uses those that disclose information you are comfortable with sharing. </p>
                            <p class="privacy"> <b>Use of Cookies</b> <br>
                                <img src="images/spacer.gif" alt="" width="1" height="5" border="0"><br>
        What are cookies? Cookies are pieces of information that a Web site transfers to an individual's hard drive for record-keeping purposes. Cookies make Web-surfing easier for you by saving your preferences while you're at our site. We never save passwords or credit card information in cookies. The use of cookies is an industry standard and you'll find them at most major Web sites. <br>
        <img src="images/spacer.gif" alt="" width="1" height="5" border="0"><br>
        By showing how and when guests use a site, cookies help us see which areas are popular and which are not. Many improvements and updates to the site are based on such data as total number of visitors and pages viewed. This information is most easily tracked with cookies. We use the information from cookies to provide services better tailored to our users needs. <br>
        <img src="images/spacer.gif" alt="" width="1" height="5" border="0"><br>
        Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies. You can reset your browser to refuse all cookies or indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, note that some parts of the Hitfarm.com service will not function properly or may be considerably slower if you refuse cookies. For example, without cookies, you will not be able to set personalized news preferences or you may have difficulty completing shopping transactions, entering contests, or playing games. <br>
        <img src="images/spacer.gif" alt="" width="1" height="5" border="0"><br>
        You may also get cookies from our sponsors or advertisers websites. Neither Hitfarm, nor our associates or affiliates have any control over this. </p>

        What are web bugs ? A web bug is an electronic tag that is placed on a web page. It can be used to count the number of visitors to our sites and gather information and develop profiles about people who visit our site and/or click on links on our sites. Such devices are also known as 'invisible' or '1-by-1' GIFs due to their incredibly small size which usually cannot be detected. <br>
        <img src="images/spacer.gif" alt="" width="1" height="5" border="0"><br>
        We use web bugs on our websites to track both the source and destination of visitors to our sites. This is required for proper accounting and reporting requirements of our affiliate program as well as to help us to provide our visitors with what they want to see and do online. </p>
