												Christian Web Hosting Specials 
												("Christian Web Hosting Specials", 
												"We" or "Us") and how it treats 
												the information that 
												Christian Web Hosting Specials 
												collects and receives, including 
												information related to your past 
												use of 
												Christian Web Hosting Specials 
												products and services. This 
												policy does not apply to the 
												practices of companies that 
												Christian Web Hosting Specials 
												does not own or control, or to 
												people that 
												Christian Web Hosting Specials 
												does not employ or manage.<br>

												Christian Web Hosting Specials.<br>

												Christian Web Hosting Specials<br>
												3. How information collected by 
												Christian Web Hosting Specials 
												is used.<br>

												Information<br>

												Christian Web Hosting Specials 
												Accounts<br>

												9. Users Must Keep Their 
												Passwords Private<br>
												10. Changes to Our Privacy 
												Statement<br>
												11. Final Statement<br>
												<br>
												1 Information Collected by 
												Christian Web Hosting Specials<br>
												<br>
												We will not knowingly use 
												information collected on this 
												website to others in ways 
												different from what is disclosed 
												in this statement. 
												Christian Web Hosting Specials 
												collects information from our 
												users at several different 
												points on our website.
												For purposes of this Privacy 
												Statement, "Personally 
												Identifiable Information" refers 
												to information that can directly 
												identify an individual; for 
												example, such information may 
												include an individual's name, 
												mailing address, phone number or 
												email address.<br>
												<br>
												1.1 Information that Is 
												Automatically Collected<br>
												<br>
												We use IP addresses, with the 
												help of a business partner, to 
												analyze trends, administer the 
												website, track users' movements, 
												and gather broad demographic 
												information for aggregate use. 
												IP addresses are not linked to 
												Personally Identifiable 
												Information. <br>
												<br>
												1.2 Information that Is 
												Collected by Cookies<br>
												<br>
												A cookie is a piece of data 
												stored on a user's hard drive 
												containing information about 
												that user. By setting a cookie 
												on our website, the user would 
												not have to log in with a 
												password more than once, thereby 
												saving time while on our 
												website. If a user rejects the 
												cookie, they may still use our 
												website. The only drawback to 
												this is that the user will be 
												limited in some areas of our 
												website. Cookies can also enable 
												us to track and target the 
												interests of our users to 
												enhance the experience on our 
												website. Some of our business 
												partners use cookies on our 
												website (for example, 
												advertisers); however, we have 
												no access to or control over 
												these cookies. <br>
												<br>
												1.3 Information that Is Actively 
												Submitted to 
												Christian Web Hosting Specials<br>
												<br>
												Registrations and Orders. In 
												order to register a domain name 
												or order services from this 
												website, a user must create an 
												account and complete a 
												registration process. During the 
												account creation process, a user 
												must provide contact information 
												(such as name and email address) 
												so that we can stay in touch 
												with our users. This information 
												is also used to fulfill order 
												and registration requests. To 
												pay for a domain name 
												registration or for other 
												service ordered, a user must 
												provide contact information 
												(such as name and shipping 
												address) and financial 
												information (such as a credit 
												card number and its expiration 
												date). This information is used 
												for billing purposes, with the 
												help of our business partner, 
												and to fill users' orders. If we 
												have trouble processing an 
												order, this contact information 
												is used to get in touch with the 
												user. <br>
												<br>
												Tell-A-Friend. If a user elects 
												to use our referral service for 
												informing a friend about our 
												website, we ask them for the 
												friend's name and email address. 
												We will automatically send the 
												friend a one-time email inviting 
												them to visit the website. We 
												store this information for the 
												purpose of sending this one-time 
												email. The friend may contact us 
												at support@Christianbibleministryinternational.com 
												or go directly to 
												<a href="support.html">http://www.Christian 
												Web Hosting Specials/support.html</a> 
												to request the removal of this 
												information from this database.
												<br>
												<br>
												1.4 Third Party Advertisers on 
												Christian Web Hosting Special's 
												Website<br>
												<br>
												We use third-party advertising 
												companies to serve ads (using 
												methods that include Pixel Tags 
												and Clear Gifs) when you visit 
												our website. Third-party 
												advertising companies also 
												separately place or recognize a 
												cookie file on your browser in 
												the course of delivering 
												advertisements to this website. 
												These companies may use 
												information (not including your 
												name, address, email address or 
												telephone number) about your 
												visits to this and other 
												websites in order to provide 
												advertisements about goods and 
												services of interest to you. <br>
												<br>
												1.5 Information 
												Christian Web Hosting Specials 
												Obtains from Third Parties<br>
												Supplemental Information 
												Collected. In certain 
												circumstances, in order for our 
												website to properly fulfill its 
												obligation to our users, it is 
												necessary for us to supplement 
												the information we receive with 
												information from third party 
												sources. For example, to 
												determine if our users qualify 
												for a dotPartner account, we use 
												their name and business 
												information to request a credit 
												report. Christian Web Hosting 
												Specials 
												Accounts Created by a Third 
												Party on Your Behalf. If you 
												received your domain name from 
												someone else, without 
												registering for it yourself, 
												your domain name may belong to a 
												"managed domain." In a managed 
												domain, the administrator of a 
												company with whom you have a 
												business relationship (for 
												example, your ISP) can create 
												your domain name for you. You 
												can then use the domain name 
												like any other domain name. The 
												administrator, however, has 
												access to the domain name and 
												can edit your 
												Christian Web Hosting Specials 
												profile, reset your password, 
												and manage the 
												Christian Web Hosting Specials 
												account without your additional 
												consent. In addition to the 
												terms mentioned in this Privacy 
												Statement, an account created by 
												a third party allows any of your 
												Personally Identifiable 
												Information within that account 
												to be available to that third 
												party as if they were you. We 
												have no access to or control 
												over the third party to prevent 
												their disclosure of your 
												information. <br>
												<br>
												2 Communications from 
												Christian Web Hosting Specials<br>
												<br>
												Welcome Emails and General 
												Correspondence. We send a 
												welcoming email to the email 
												address associated with the 
												account a user has created to 
												verify the users password and 
												username. This process is 
												designed to prevent e-mail 
												addresses from being used 
												without permission in the 
												creation of a 
												Christian Web Hosting Specials 
												account. Established users will 
												occasionally receive information 
												on products, services, special 
												deals, and a newsletter. Out of 
												respect for the privacy of our 
												users we present the option to 
												not receive some of these types 
												of communications. Please see 
												our opt-out options below. <br>
												<br>
												Site and Service Updates. We 
												send the user website and 
												service announcement updates. 
												Users are not permitted to 
												unsubscribe from service 
												announcements, which contain 
												important information about the 
												website and/or service. We may 
												communicate with users to 
												provide services that users 
												request or to discuss issues 
												relating to their account. <br>
												<br>
												Surveys &amp; Contests. From 
												time-to-time our website 
												requests information from users 
												via surveys or contests. 
												Participation in these surveys 
												or contests is completely 
												voluntary and, as such, the user 
												has a choice whether or not to 
												disclose this information. 
												Information requested may 
												include contact information 
												(such as name and shipping 
												address), and demographic 
												information (such as zip code, 
												age level). <br>
												<br>
												3 How Information Collected by 
												Christian Web Hosting Specials 
												Is Used<br>
												<br>
												Demographic Information. We will 
												share aggregated demographic 
												information with our partners 
												and advertisers. The aggregated 
												demographic information is not 
												linked to any Personally 
												Identifiable Information that 
												can identify any individual 
												person. <br>
												<br>
												Communicating with Our Users. We 
												use Personally Identifiable 
												Information (such as your name, 
												telephone number or email 
												address) to communicate with our 
												users when they have questions, 
												concerns or comments about their 
												accounts or the services that we 
												provide. If you contact us, we 
												may or may not delete your 
												emails or voicemails to us. <br>
												<br>
												Information Shared With Third 
												Parties. We share information 
												with third parties as required 
												by ICANN and in order to give 
												our customers access to a great 
												variety of services. 
												Specifically, we may do the 
												following: <br>
												·- Submit the name, postal 
												address, e-mail address, and 
												phone numbers associated with 
												the registrant, administrative, 
												technical and billing contacts 
												of a domain name to the 
												appropriate Registry or 
												registration database. This 
												information is included in a 
												publicly available 'Whois' 
												database, in accordance with 
												ICANN rules. This sharing of 
												information is required by ICANN 
												rules.<br>
												·- Use a credit card processing 
												company to bill users for goods 
												and services. These companies do 
												not use Personally Identifiable 
												Information for any use other 
												than credit card processing; 
												however, we will not be 
												responsible or liable for use of 
												the information required by 
												credit card companies in 
												contravention of their policies, 
												contractual obligations or 
												general good business 
												procedures. <br>
												·- Partner with third parties who 
												provide services to our users. 
												When the user signs up for or 
												agrees to receive a specific 
												service provided by the third 
												party (i.e. PostMasterDirect 
												advertisements), we share the 
												information that is needed for 
												the third party to provide the 
												services. <br>
												·- Share the publicly available 
												domain contact information 
												submitted by our users for 
												inclusion in the Whois database 
												with third parties. We do not 
												control the use of this 
												Personally Identifiable 
												Information by third parties.<br>
												·- Share your Personally 
												Identifiable Information with 
												other entities that are owned by 
												Christian Web Hosting Specials, 
												that own 
												Christian Web Hosting Specials, 
												or have some sort of corporate 
												ownership relationship with 
												Christian Web Hosting Specials.
												<br>
												<br>
												Addressing Legal Issues. 
												Further, we provide Personally 
												Identifiable Information to 
												respond to subpoenas, court 
												orders, or legal process, or to 
												establish or exercise our legal 
												rights or defend against legal 
												claims. Further, we believe it 
												is necessary to share Personally 
												Identifiable Information in 
												order to investigate, prevent, 
												or take action regarding illegal 
												activities, suspected fraud, 
												situations involving potential 
												threats to the physical safety 
												of any person, violations of 
												Christian Web Hosting Special's 
												terms of use, or as otherwise 
												required by law.<br>
												<br>
												Sale or Transfer of 
												Christian Web Hosting Specials. 
												If all or a portion of 
												Christian Web Hosting Specials 
												is transferred, sold, merged, 
												ceases operations, goes 
												bankrupt, or is otherwise 
												involved in a transaction where 
												the ownership or management of 
												Christian Web Hosting Specials 
												is changed (individually or 
												collectively, a "Transaction") 
												then your Personally 
												Identifiable Information or 
												other user information may be 
												transferred or assigned to a 
												third party as part of the 
												Transaction. <br>
												<br>
												4 Correction/Updating Personal 
												Information<br>
												<br>
												Users must provide accurate and 
												correct contact information 
												(name, postal address, e-mail 
												address, phone number) for their 
												domain name(s) Registrant, 
												Administrative, Technical and 
												Billing contacts, which will be 
												listed in a publicly accessible 
												'Whois' database, in compliance 
												with ICANN rules. If a user's 
												Personally Identifiable 
												Information changes (such as a 
												zip code), or if a user no 
												longer desires 
												Christian Web Hosting Special's 
												services, we will provide a way 
												to correct, update or remove 
												that user's personal data 
												provided to us. This can usually 
												be done under online account 
												management (on your own) or by 
												emailing our user Support Group 
												for assistance.<br>
												<br>
												5 Opting Out<br>
												<br>
												Users are provided an 
												opportunity to "opt-out" of 
												having their information used 
												for purposes not directly 
												related to the services they 
												request. Users who no longer 
												wish to receive our newsletter 
												or promotional materials from us 
												may opt-out of receiving these 
												communications by replying and 
												typing "unsubscribe" in the 
												subject line in the email or 
												email your request to news@Christian 
												Web Hosting Specials 
												.<br>
												<br>
												6 Terminated 
												Christian Web Hosting Specials 
												Accounts<br>
												<br>
												If your 
												Christian Web Hosting Specials 
												account is terminated or 
												cancelled (regardless of whether 
												it was voluntary), all of your 
												Personally Identifiable 
												Information will remain on our 
												servers. We retain and use your 
												Personally Identifiable 
												Information as necessary to 
												enforce our policies or to 
												address contractual issues, and 
												may contact you for future 
												marketing or promotional 
												purposes. <br>
												<br>
												7 Use of the 
												Christian Web Hosting Specials 
												Website by Persons Under Age 13<br>
												<br>
												This website is not intended for 
												use by anyone under the age of 
												thirteen (13), and any 
												individual under such age should 
												not provide us with Personally 
												Identifiable Information. We do 
												not knowingly contact, market 
												to, solicit, collect or use 
												Personally Identifiable 
												Information from or about any 
												individual under the age of 13. 
												It is possible that by fraud or 
												deception we may receive 
												information pertaining to 
												children under 13. If we are 
												notified of that we have 
												personal information regarding a 
												person under the age of 13, as 
												soon as we reasonably verify the 
												information, we will either 
												obtain parental consent or 
												otherwise delete the information 
												from the account and/or service. 
												However, the information may 
												remain on a log in our servers. 
												If you want to notify us of our 
												receipt of information by 
												children under 13, please do so 
												by emailing us at: abuse@Christian 
												Web Hosting Specials.<br>
												<br>
