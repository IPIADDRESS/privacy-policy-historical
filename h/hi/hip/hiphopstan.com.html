On such occasions, HipHopStan asks for your name, email address, phone number, zip code and personal information concerning your interests, occupation, gender and other demographic information.

If you do not wish to provide such information, you are free not to do so. Your provision of requested information to us through our Website or other means is presumed by us to be voluntary and with your consent to the uses described herein. If after submitting personally identifiable information to us, you wish to "opt-out," please contact us as noted above and we will remove your information from our database as set forth below in the section titled "Managing Your Information." Please know that such a decision will not stop advertising or content that is generated prior to the time when we remove your information.<br></font></font><font size="+0"><font size="1"><br>HipHopStan uses the information you provide to us to customize advertising and content that we present to you, to contact you concerning specials and new products and to enhance our product offerings. HipHopStan will not sell or rent your personally identifiable information to any third party except when:<br><br></font></font><font size="+0"><font size="1">You have been given an opportunity to "opt out" of sharing the information and have declined to exercise that right within the time period provided; <br></font></font><font size="+0"><font size="1"><br>HipHopStan must share the information in order to provide a product or service that you have requested, in which case we will demand that any third party we use to fulfill your order agree that it does not have the right to use the personally identifiable information for any reason other than to fulfill your request; or <br></font></font><font size="+0"><font size="1"><br>HipHopStan, LLC is required to respond to subpoena, court orders or other legal process requiring such disclosure. <br></font></font><font size="+0"><font size="1"><br>In addition, we may share your information with our strategic partners and other third parties with whom we have a written agreement that provides for a cooperative, mutually beneficial commercial relationship. In these cases, we may not give you notice or an opportunity to opt out, but we will obligate that third party to treat your information as confidential, and not to use it for any purposes other than those for which we are authorized to use it.</font></font> <br><font size="+0"><font size="1"><br><strong>Use of Cookies<br></strong></font></font><font size="+0"><font size="1"><br>HipHopStan uses cookies to enhance the interactive nature of your Internet experience and to provide a convenient feature to save you time.

However, the nature of the Internet is such that information may be transmitted over networks without appropriate security measures and may be accessed, deleted, altered, used or disclosed by unauthorized persons.<br></font></font><font size="+0"><font size="1"><br>Because of the international nature of the services and products provided by this Website and the nature of HipHopStan Digital’s business, personal data may, subject to applicable law, be transferred internationally throughout HipHopStan’s worldwide network (details of which are available on request by emailing or calling us as provided above) for the purposes described above.
