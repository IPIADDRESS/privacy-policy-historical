(“Hipmunk” or “we” or “us”), we want to make your travel experience better. As part of that effort, we want you to feel comfortable when you visit or use hipmunk.com, the Hipmunk mobile applications, our related services, and any other services that link to this Policy (the “Service”). We also understand that you may have some important questions for us about what information we collect when you use our Service, why we collect that information, and how we may use it and disclose it to others. We've created this Policy to help answer those questions. Please read this Policy carefully. We may add to or amend this Policy with other notices. We may also post different privacy statements for some Services and when we do so, this Policy does not apply.</p><p>This Policy applies solely to information collected by us through the Services and does not apply to any third-party activities, including third party websites and travel partners linked to from the Services, third party social networking platforms or features we make available through our Services, or third-party ads displayed on our Services. We are not responsible for the privacy practices or content of such third-parties. We encourage you to read the privacy statements of those third parties. </p><h2>What Information Is Collected?</h2><p>We collect information from you in various ways when you use our Service.</p><p><b>Information Provided by You.</b> We collect information you directly provide to us. For example, we collect your email address, name, billing or mailing address, phone number, preference information, payment details, home airport, booking details, the communications you have with our customer support teams, and other information you provide us on our Service. We may also obtain information from other sources and combine that with information we collect on our Service, including information about bookings you make with third-party travel partners to which we refer you. Certain Automatically Collected Information. When you visit or use the Service, some information about your usage and activity on the Service is collected automatically. For example, when you visit our websites, your computer's operating system, Internet Protocol (IP) address, device identifiers, browser type, device type, domain name, access times, duration of visit, interactions with webpages, ads, and content, platform, time stamp and language, and referring web site addresses may be logged automatically. </p><p><b>Information About Your Use of the Service.</b> When you use the Service, and specifically when you do things like enter a search query or book travel, we may collect certain information about you, including the searches you run on the Service, the date and time when you initiated a search, and the location from which you initiated the search. We may collect information about how you use the Service, including information about your clicks and interactions on the Services. We may retain this information and associate it with your profile information. </p><p><b>Third-Party Logins.</b> We allow users with accounts on third-party services, such as Facebook and Google, to log into the Service using functionality that those third parties provide, such as Facebook Connect and Google's OpenID-based authentication mechanism. When you use this Facebook or Google functionality to log into the Service, we will access, collect, and use specific information related to your Facebook or Google account, such as your name and email address, as described in this Policy and associate it with other information we have about you. </p><p><b>Calendar Integration.</b> With your permission, we collect calendar information from your mobile device and use it to provide suggestions (such as for flights, hotels, and cars) based on your meetings and travel plans. We also allow you to integrate various functionalities from other services, such as Microsoft Outlook and Google Calendar, with Hipmunk. If you choose to take advantage of this integration feature, we will ask you to authenticate your account. If you access the Service using our mobile apps, you may not need to provide your login credentials, as your mobile device may allow this integration automatically if you enable those permissions. When providing those credentials or enabling the permissions, we will access, collect, and use this information, including calendar invite information, as described in this Policy and associate it with other information we have about you.</p><p><b>Concur Login Integration.</b> If your employer has enabled you to connect the Concur account you use through your employer with your Hipmunk account, you may be provided with access to employer discounts for purposes of booking business travel. By allowing your Concur account to access your personal Hipmunk account, Concur and your employer will receive certain information about trips you book, such as date of travel, origin, destination, flight, and booking information. By allowing your Hipmunk to access your Concur account, Hipmunk will obtain certain profile and payment information that you store on Concur and combine it with data Hipmunk has about you and enable Hipmunk to update information on your Concur account including booking and itinerary information. You may disconnect your Concur account from your Hipmunk account by visiting the account settings section of the Service. If your account was created using a Concur account, before you leave your employer you will need to update your Hipmunk account email to a personal email account to retain control of your personal Hipmunk account.</p><p><b>Communications.</b> When you communicate with us, for example through our Virtual Travel Agent, whether via hello@hipmunk.com, Skype, Slack, or other communication services we support, we collect your contact information and the contents of the communication.</p><p><b>Tracking Technologies.</b> To automatically collect information about you as described above we may use certain tracking technologies, such as device identifiers, and other information about you or your device ("Tracking Technologies"). These Tracking Technologies work in different ways, for example some may be downloaded to your device and others may set or modify settings on your device. The following are examples of a few of the methods that may be used to collect information (and subsequent technology and methods later developed): </p><ul><li>Location-identifying Technologies. The Service may use global positioning systems (GPS), IP address, and other location-based technologies to locate you, deliver you relevant content based on your location, and set your home airport. Upon downloading our mobile applications, we determine your approximate and/or exact location information to provide location-based services.</li><li>"Cookies" Information: We may automatically collect information using "cookies." Cookies are small data files stored on your hard drive by a web site. Among other things, cookies help us improve our Service and your experience. We use cookies to see which areas and features are popular and to count visits to our Service. If you set your browser not to accept cookies or if you reject a cookie (your help screen or manual should tell you how to do this), it may affect certain features on the Service.</li><li>Web Beacons. We may collect information using web beacons. Web beacons are electronic images that may be used on our Service or in our emails. We use web beacons to deliver cookies, count visits, understand usage and campaign effectiveness and to tell if an email has been opened and acted upon.</li><li>ETag, or entity tag. A feature of the cache in browsers. It is an opaque identifier assigned by a web server to a specific version of a resource found at a URL. If the resource content at that URL ever changes, a new and different ETag is assigned. Used in this manner, ETags are a form of device identifier. ETag tracking may generate unique tracking values even if you have blocked HTTP, Flash, and HTML5 cookies</li></ul><p><b>Booking through Hipmunk.</b> If you book travel with our third-party travel partners, we may collect payment details from you including name on card, card number, billing address, expiration date, security code, and phone number, and provide that information to the travel partner to complete the transaction. You may have the option to let us save your payment details, which we will store for the purpose of enabling future bookings. You may add a payment method or edit or delete your saved payment information at any time in your Hipmunk account settings. Such third-party travel partners may use your information for their own marketing purposes and you should review their privacy statements prior to booking.</p><h2>How Does Hipmunk Use This Information?</h2><p>We use personal information collected through our Service for purposes described in this Policy or disclosed to you on our Service or in connection with our Service. For example, we may use your information to:</p><ul><li>Operate and improve our Service</li><li>Personalize and customize your Service experience, content, marketing, and recommendations, including to target content and services to more closely match your interests or location</li><li>Respond to your comments and questions and provide customer service</li><li>Give you updates on the Service's features and progress (such as new travel-search features or functions that we may add), to provide you with promotional materials and offers (such as discounts on airfare or hotels that may become available, or news about travel destinations), and to provide you with other news about products and services offered by Hipmunk and our selected partners</li><li>Provide and deliver products and to send you related information, including via e-mail or another form of electronic notification, including confirmations, invoices, technical notices and other notices regarding security, privacy, and administrative issues relating to your use of the Service, and support and administrative messages</li><li>Link or combine with other personal information we get from third parties, to help understand your needs and provide you with better service</li><li>Enforce our terms and conditions or protect our business, partners or users</li><li>Protect, investigate, and deter against fraudulent, unauthorized, infringing or illegal activity</li></ul><h2>How Is the Information Shared or Disclosed?</h2><p>We may provide personally identifiable information to third parties for their use in helping us perform our internal business functions. These are things like processing payments for us, or performing maintenance, security, data analysis, e-mail transmission and processing, or data hosting on our behalf. If you book travel with one of our travel partners through Hipmunk, we provide the payment details you give us to the travel partner to process the transaction. If you book travel using Hipmunk through certain third-party partners, we may send a copy of the travel booking confirmation to the partner. The confirmation will include personally identifiable information (such as name, email and phone number, and billing address) and truncated payment card details.</p><p>We also share your information with third parties as follows:</p><ul><li>With your consent</li><li>In an aggregated form that does not directly identify you</li><li>With Concur Technologies, Inc., its affiliates, and your employer if you integrate your Concur account with your Hipmunk account</li><li>With third-party travel partners when you book travel;</li><li>With third party vendors, consultants, and other service providers who are working on our behalf and need access to your information to carry out work for us</li><li>To: (1) satisfy legal obligations or comply with legal process (such as a subpoena) served on Hipmunk; (2) protect Hipmunk and others from fraudulent, abusive, predatory, or unlawful uses or activity; (3) investigate and defend Hipmunk against any legal claims or threats; (4) protect and defend the rights or property of Hipmunk; (5) take action on user complaints, or (6) act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of Hipmunk, the Service, or the public</li><li>In connection with or during negotiation of any merger, financing, acquisition, bankruptcy, dissolution, transaction or proceeding involving sale, transfer, divestiture or disclosure of all or a portion of our business or assets to another company</li></ul><p><b>Non-personally Identifiable Information.</b> In addition, Hipmunk may disclose aggregated, anonymized, or other types of non-personally identifiable information, including "automatically collected" and "cookies" information that is non-personally identifiable, to third parties for various purposes. For example, Hipmunk may disclose non-personally identifiable information to our travel partners or other interested third parties to assist them in understanding the usage, viewing, and demographic patterns and activity on the Service, to assist them in serving your travel needs, to select the advertisements shown to you on our Service or on other websites and services, or to enhance your ability to conduct efficient and accurate searches.</p><p><b>Third Party Advertisements.</b> We and our third-party partners may use information collected using third-party cookies and web beacons on our Service, in our emails, and on other websites to deliver ads about our Service displayed to you on third-party websites and applications. We also may use cookie information and other methods to know when you return to our Service after visiting these third-party websites and applications. We use this and other information about you to try to understand your interests and show you relevant advertising about products and services that may interest you. Our third-party partners may also use this information for third party advertising as described above. We may use third parties to serve ads in our Service. These third parties may also automatically collect information about your use of the Service, your IP address, your ISP, or the browser you use to visit our Service using cookies, web beacons, or other technologies. Information collected may be used, among other things, to deliver advertising targeted to your interests and to better understand the usage and visitation of our Service and the other sites tracked by these third parties. This Policy does not apply to, and we are not responsible for, cookies or clear gifs in third party ads, and we encourage you to check the privacy policies of advertisers and/or ad services to learn about their use of cookies and other technology.

You can update certain profile information associated with your account at any time through your account preferences page on the Service.

However, Hipmunk may decline requests that are unreasonable, prohibited by law, or are not required to be honored by applicable law.</p><p><b>Cookies.</b> Many Web browsers are set to accept cookies by default. If you prefer, you can usually choose to set your browser to remove cookies and to reject cookies. If you choose to remove cookies or reject cookies, this could affect certain features or services of our site including certain opt-out cookies.</p><p><b>Do Not Track.</b> We may collect personally identifiable information about your online activities over time and across different web sites when you use the Service. We may not recognize or respond to every type of “do not track” signal or other mechanisms that provide consumers the ability to exercise choice regarding the collection of personally identifiable information about an individual consumer’s online activities over time and across third-party websites or online services, but we give you certain choices about how we collect personally identifiable information as described in this Policy.</p><p><b>Email Choices.</b> You can manage your email preferences by updating your profile settings. You can also unsubscribe from promotional emails by: (1) following the unsubscribe instructions in our emails; or (2) emailing us at <a href="mailto:privacy@hipmunk.com">privacy@hipmunk.com</a>. You may update your email preferences from time to time. Please note that even if you unsubscribe from promotional email messages, we may still need to contact you with important transactional information related to your account and your use of the Service. For example, even if you have unsubscribed from our email messages, we will still send you emails confirming emails relating directly to an itinerary or travel profile created through the Service confirming registration.</p><p><b>Concur Integration.</b> As described above, you may unlink your personal Hipmunk account from your Concur account from the account settings portion of the Services. However, any information shared previously with your employer is governed by the terms between Concur and your employer, and you will need to contact your employer regarding use and retention of that data.</p><p><b>Analytics and Advertisements.</b> We encourage you to review the privacy policies of our third party advertisers and analytics service providers to learn about your choices about information they collect from you. The Network Advertising Initiative offers information about some of the Internet advertising companies we may use, including how to opt-out of interest based advertising they deliver.

You may mail any such request to: <a href="mailto:privacy@hipmunk.com">privacy@hipmunk.com</a>. Please note that we are required to respond to one request per California resident each year, and we are not required to respond to requests made by means other than through this e-mail address.</p><h2>The Security Of Your Information</h2><p>We maintain data handling and storage practices and procedures that are designed to promote the integrity and confidentiality of the personally identifiable information. No method of transmission over the Internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure, however. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information in an effort to prevent loss, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p><h2>Where We Operate</h2><p>Use of the Services may result in the transfer, use, processing, or storage of your information in the United States or any other country where Hipmunk operates or maintains facilities or call centers, including jurisdictions that may not have data privacy laws that provide protections equivalent to those provided in your home country.
