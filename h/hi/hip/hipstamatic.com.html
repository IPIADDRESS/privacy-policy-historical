      <h3>Information Collection and Use</h3>
      <h4>General</h4>
      <p>Hipstamatic.com does not require that you register in order to view its products or, in most cases, User comments or submissions. Registration is required to use certain interactive features such as submitting photos to the contest and managing prints and placing orders. We currently use Facebook Connect and Twitter for voting and commenting.

      <p>We use other third parties such as a shipping company to fulfill orders, a credit card processing company to bill you for goods sold on our Website, and an email service provider to send out emails on our behalf. When you make a purchase on our Website or sign up for our email list, we will share the amount of Personally Identifiable Information as necessary for the third party to provide that service, including your name, address, credit card information and email address.

      <p>We reserve the right to disclose your Personally Identifiable Information as required by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or comply with a judicial proceeding, or legal process served on our Website.</p>
      <p>We may share Personally Identifiable Information if we believe it is necessary in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of our Terms of Use, or as otherwise required by law.</p>
