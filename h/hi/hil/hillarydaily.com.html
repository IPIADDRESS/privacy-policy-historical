            [NOTE: PLEASE SEE SECTION II OF THIS POLICY FOR A DESCRIPTION OF HOW 
            WE DEAL WITH INFORMATION COLLECTED FROM CHILDREN UNDER THE AGE OF 
            13.]<br>
            <br>
            I. This notice is to inform you about the policies for collection 
            and use of personally identifiable information at EMAZING.com. Sites 
            which are linked to our site may have different policies; please review 
            the privacy policy notices on those sites for details.<br>
            <br>
            We do not collect personally identifiable information about you on 
            this site without your knowledge, and all such information is collected 
            directly from you. For example, we may ask you to provide your email 
            address, name, mailing address, or other information about yourself 
            in order to participate in contests, to be added to the list to receive 
            tips, reminders, greeting cards, and other services via email. You 
            are not required to provide us with this information, but if you choose 
            not to, you may not be able to participate in some of the activities 
            on this site.<br>
            <br>
            We use the information we collect from you to allow you to participate 
            in the site activities for which the information is collected. For 
            example, when you give us your email address in order to receive tips, 
            that address is added to the email list for tip. On each email you 
            receive, you are given the opportunity to unsubscribe; when you unsubscribe, 
            we remove your email address from that mailing list.<br>
            <br>
            To participate in contests on this site, you must be at least 18 years 
            old. For contests conducted on this site, we use the personal information 
            you provide only for the purpose of contacting you if you win a prize 
            and sending the prize to you. We do not use contact information contained 
            in contest entries to create mailing lists or for any other purpose. 
            For further information about how we handle entries to a particular 
            contest, please consult the contest rules.<br>
            <br>
            We do not share personal information provided by site visitors with 
            anyone outside EMAZING, INC., except to the extent necessary to allow 
            you to participate in site activities (for example, to send you a 
            prize that you have won in a contest on the site). In particular, 
            we do not rent or sell mailing lists of site visitors to any third 
            party.<br>
            <br>
            We try to keep the information we collect from you as current as possible, 
            and we take steps to maintain the security of your personal information 
            and to prevent unauthorized access to it by those who do not have 
            a legitimate need for it. We will never post your email address or 
            other identifying information you have provided on our site without 
            your consent.<br>
            <br>
            II. INFORMATION PRACTICES WITH REGARD TO CHILDREN<br>
            If you are under 13 years of age, you should not provide any personally 
            identifiable information on this site without the knowledge and permission 
            of your parent or guardian. You should not enter any contest on this 
            site, as you must be at least 18 years old to be eligible. If we learn 
            that you are under 13 years of age, we will not maintain or use any 
            personally identifiable information about you without the verifiable 
            consent of your parent or guardian, except as allowed by law. This 
            may mean that you will be unable to participate in some activities 
            on the site without that verifiable consent.<br>
            <br>
            We collect personally identifiable information directly from visitors 
            on this site who may be under the age of 13. We do not collect this 
            information without the knowledge of the visitor.<br>
            <br>
            Our activities on this site are carried out in compliance with the 
            Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998. Under that Act, 
            we may not ask a child to provide more personal information than is 
            reasonably necessary in order to participate in an activity on this 
            site. We comply with this requirement, and any personally identifiable 
            information collected from a visitor on this site is used only for 
            the purpose of enabling the visitor's participation in activities 
            on this site.<br>
            <br>
            For example, we ask visitors who wish to be placed on a specific mailing 
            list for a tip to provide an email address. This information is used 
            to send the visitor the tip requested. We also ask visitors who wish 
            to receive a free promotional item (such as a CD, t-shirt, etc.) to 
            provide name, mailing address, and email address. The name and mailing 
            address are used to send the visitor the promotional item. The email 
            address is used only if we need to contact the visitor to verify name 
            and mailing address. We do not retain this information after the item 
            has been delivered, and we do not use it for any other purpose.<br>
            <br>
            For contests that are held on this site, we ask each contestant to 
            provide their email address. If we learn that a contestant is not 
            at least 18 years, we will not allow them to participate in the contest, 
            and the information submitted is deleted. Information submitted in 
            order to participate in a contest is not used for any other purpose.<br>
            <br>
            [We do not collect personally identifiable information from visitors 
            who wish to participate in our email chat service known as the Grapevine. 
            We ask visitors who wish to participate in the Grapevine for email 
            address. This email address is used only to protect the security and 
            integrity of the site, such as to take action against visitors who 
            post<br>
            inappropriate material or harass other visitors.] It is never revealed 
            publicly.<br>
            <br>
            In some circumstances, we also ask visitors to this site to provide 
            us with contact information on their parent or guardian. We use this 
            information only for the purpose of contacting the parent or guardian 
            to notify them of our information practices with respect to children, 
            to notify that person of a child's participation on this site, and/or 
            to seek the consent of the parent or guardian to such participation.<br>
            <br>
            The parent or guardian of any person under the age of 13 whose personal 
            information we have collected on this site may ask to review that 
            personal information, to have it deleted, and to forbid further collection 
            of the information. For more information on how to do this, please 
            contact [the contact person listed below].<br>
            <br>
            No personal information collected on this site is shared with third 
            parties other than a parent or guardian of a site visitor, except 
            that information may be shared with those with whom we contract to 
            carry out the internal operations of the site (for example, to send 
            you a promotional item that you have requested on the site.). These 
            contractors have agreed with us to use personal information of site 
            visitors only for the purposes of carrying out these operations. In 
            particular, we do not rent or sell mailing lists of site visitors 
            to any third party.<br>
            <br>
            The operator of this site is EMAZING, INC., 620 South Third Street,
