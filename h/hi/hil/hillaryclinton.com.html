               <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
                <p>At  Friends of Hillary, we are putting forth every effort to ensure the privacy and  security of information that you share with us online. We urge you to take  steps also to protect the privacy of your personal information, such as  safeguarding your passwords and logging off of the website after submitting  personal information. If you have broadband access to the Internet, we strongly  advise you to use a firewall.<br>
        Our  privacy policy explains the information practices we use at HillaryClinton.com:</p>
                <ul type="disc">
                  <li>How we protect your       information </li>

                  <li>How we use your       information </li>
                  <li>How to contact us about       privacy </li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>How do we protect your information?</strong><br>
                  Our  website has a number of security measures in place to protect against the loss,  misuse or alteration of the information under our control. Our computer systems  have restricted access limited only to those persons and organizations  necessary to its proper functioning. This access applies to all electronic and  physical security measures. Highly sensitive data including credit card information  is additionally secured through the use of encryption, such as the Secure  Socket Layer (SSL) protocol. Our servers are located in a locked, secure  environment.<br>
          <strong>How do we use the information you provide? </strong><br>

                  We  are required by federal law to collect and report to the Federal Election  Commission the name, mailing address, occupation and employer of individuals  whose contributions exceed $200 in an election cycle. These records are  available to the public. However, they cannot be used by other organizations for  fundraising. We also make a note of your telephone number and email address,  which helps us to contact you quickly if follow-up on your contribution is  necessary under Federal election law. For additional information, visit the FEC  website at http://www.fec.gov. <br>
		  
		          We may also use the information that you provide online to contact you for other purposes or to solicit you for contributions.  When you register or sign-up online, we may share your contact information with successor organizations and other like-minded Democratic candidates and organizations, and they may contact you.  When you make a contribution to us, we may also exchange your contributor information with successor organizations and other like-minded Democratic candidates and organizations, and they may solicit you (see below for additional information regarding your contributor information).  However, we will not sell or exchange your credit card information to any other third party under any circumstances.<br>
          <em>Cookies</em> <br>
                  A  cookie is a tiny text file that is stored on your computer by  HillaryClinton.com. We use cookies to tailor your experience on our site  according to the preferences you have specified. When you visit  HillaryClinton.com, we only access the cookie file that we have stored on your  computer. We cannot and do not access any information stored in a cookie by  other websites. Our cookies do not contain any personal identifiable  information.<br>
          <em>IP  Addresses and Log File Data</em> <br>
                  We  log your IP address, which is the location of your computer or network on the  Internet, for systems administration and troubleshooting purposes. We also use  page hits in the aggregate to track the popularity of pages that people visit  in order to improve the quality of the site. There is no personal identifiable  information collected in our log files.<br>

          <em>Information  on Children</em> <br>
                  Because  we care about the safety and privacy of children online, we comply with the  Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 (COPPA). COPPA and its  accompanying FTC regulations establish United States federal law that protects  the privacy of children using the Internet. We do not knowingly contact or  collect personal information from children under 13, without express and  verifiable parental consent. Our site is not intended to solicit information of  any kind from children under 13, and we have designed our sites to block our  knowing acceptance of information from children under 13 whenever age-related  information is requested. <br>
                  Parents  with questions may e-mail us at accountingdepartment@hillaryclinton.com.<br>
