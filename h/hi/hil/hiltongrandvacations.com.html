<b>The Hilton Family of Companies Internet Privacy Policy</b>
<br><br>
We strive to deliver outstanding products, services, and experiences across the Hilton Family of Companies -- and at every touch-point and guest interaction. We value your business and, most importantly, your loyalty. We recognize that privacy is an important issue. This Internet Privacy Policy demonstrates Hilton's commitment to assuring a strong and meaningful customer relationship, and addresses questions about the type of personal information we collect on our websites, the third parties with whom we might share such information, and how you can review or change the personal information you provide to us when creating "profiles" on our websites.
<br><br>
On our websites we collect information that you voluntarily provide in order for us to provide services and products, process reservations and other transactions you request, and provide customer service. We may also use the personal information we collect for other business purposes such as to better understand customer needs, enhance relationships, make appropriate offers, or facilitate third party offers we feel will be of interest to you.
<br><br>
More detail about the personal information we collect and the collection of information through web technologies such as "cookies," is described below in the section called "Categories of Information We Collect." More information about the third parties with whom we may share your personal information is described below in the section called "Sharing Personal Information Collected on our Websites."
<br><br>
Additional information about the terms of use of our websites is available in our Site Usage Agreement. If you are a member of Hilton HHonors, you should also refer to the HHonors Terms and Conditions at Hiltonhhonors.com for more information. As used in this Policy, the term "Hilton" means Hilton Hotels Corporation and the terms "Hilton Family of Companies", "we", "our" and "us" include Hilton Hotels Corporation, Hilton Grand Vacations Company, Hilton Reservations Worldwide, and Hilton HHonors Worldwide. Hilton HHonors Worldwide and Hilton Reservations Worldwide are jointly owned with Hilton International Co., a Delaware corporation that is wholly-owned by Hilton Group, PLC.

<b>Collection of Information Through Web Technologies</b>
<br><br>
We may automatically track and collect your IP address, domain server, the type of computer and type of web browser you are using and use "cookies" to (i) customize content specific to your interests, (ii) ensure that you do not see the same advertisement repeatedly, and (iii) store your password so you do not have to re-enter it each time you use the sites. Some of the websites operated on our behalf are hosted and managed by other companies who may track and collect this information.
<br><br>
<b>What are Cookies?</b>
<br><br>
"Cookies" are pieces of electronic information (specifically, a string of text) that your browser and your operating system store on your hard drive for record-keeping purposes.
Cookies can store a user's ID and password, personalize home pages, identify which parts of a site have been visited or keep track of previous selections or purchases.
Cookies can enhance the user's visit.
The use of cookies is an industry standard-you'll find they are used by most major commercial websites.
<br><br>
<b>How We Issue and Use Cookies.</b>
<br><br>
We issue and use cookies to enhance your visit and the services we offer on the sites. The sites consist of thousands of pages of content. We want you to be able to find the information and offers that interest you, as quickly and easily as possible. The use of cookie technology helps us to achieve that objective.
We issue and use cookies to keep track of the areas of the sites which interest our visitors most. In doing so, we can determine areas of the sites that are most popular and those that are not. Many improvements and updates to the sites are based on such data as total number of visitors and pages viewed. This information is most easily tracked with cookies.
Visitors to the sites who accept cookies may be presented with targeted messages, offers and ads on the site and via email that we believe would be of value, based on observed preferences.
If you have registered as a member of the sites and accept cookies, we can tailor your use to your personal preferences, and it is easier and faster to take advantage of the sites' benefits.
If you have submitted your email address, you may receive targeted messages we believe you will find of value. Remember, you may request to be removed from your email subscription lists.
<br><br>
<b>Your Choice to Accept or Deny Cookies</b>
<br><br>
You can choose whether to accept or deny cookies; your browser on your computer is often initially set to accept cookies. However, you can choose to deny cookies and continue browsing the sites.
<br><br>
Keep in mind that your choice to accept or deny a cookie is different from your choice to accept/deny email messages.
<br><br>
<b>Sharing Personal Information Collected on our Websites</b>
<br><br>
We may share personal information among the Hilton Family of Companies, owners and operators of our franchised and managed hotels, and Hilton International Co. We may also share information with select third parties who offer goods or services we think may be of interest to you. From time to time we may partner with other companies to provide co-sponsored or co-branded promotions, products and services and may share your information with our co-sponsor. For example, we may co-sponsor some sweepstakes or contests on our site with other companies or we may provide prizes for sweepstakes and contests sponsored by other companies. If you enter one of these sweepstakes or contests, we may share your information with our co-sponsor or the third party sponsor. When you use a credit card to purchase goods or services, we may share your information with the credit card company. We also may share your information with the banks that issue our Hilton HHonors co-branded credit cards. Use of shared information is subject to third parties' policies.
<br><br>
We rely on service providers to help us deliver products and services, such as administering the HHonors, Hilton Grand Vacation Club, and Hilton Club programs, offering products and services, providing services in connection with our websites including airline and rental car packages, communicating news and delivering promotional materials via email and direct mail, processing credit card transactions, and administering sweepstakes and surveys.
<br><br>
During the course of our business, we may also share aggregated demographic and statistical information that is not personally identifiable.
<br><br>
<b>Business Transfers</b>
<br><br>
In the event that Hilton, or part of the Hilton Family of Companies, merges with or is acquired by another legal entity, the personal information collected by Hilton may be transferred to that other legal entity as an asset.
<br><br>
<b>Legal Requirements</b>
<br><br>
The Hilton Family of Companies will disclose personally identifiable information without your permission when we believe in good faith that such disclosure is required by law, or is necessary or desirable to investigate or protect against harmful activities to guests, visitors, employees, or others, or to property (including this site).
<br><br>
<b>Third Party Websites</b>
<br><br>
We do not control and shall not be responsible for the collection of personal information by third party websites, including websites owned or controlled by franchises, third party owners or managers of hotel properties, Hilton International Co., hotel room distributors, or websites not controlled or authorized by Hilton. Third party websites that are accessed through links on our websites have separate privacy practices. We have no responsibility or liability for the practices and policies implemented by third parties on their websites. Third party websites may have received permission from Hilton to use Hilton logos or trademarks but will not offer a link to this Internet Privacy Policy. You may contact them directly to ask questions about their privacy practices and policies.
<br><br>
If you enter or choose to leave our websites via links to other non-Hilton sites (including those of our advertisers, content providers, vendors, independent hotels, affiliates and partners), your visits to those sites are not covered by this Internet Privacy Policy.
<br><br>
<b>Internet Privacy Policy Changes</b>
<br><br>
In the future, we may make changes to this Internet Privacy Policy. The revised Internet Privacy Policy will be displayed via a link on this website so that you will know what types of information we gather and the categories of third parties with whom we may share the information.
