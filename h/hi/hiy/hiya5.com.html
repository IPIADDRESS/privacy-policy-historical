			  <h2><strong> Privacy Policy Overview</strong></h2>
			  <p> This Privacy Policy covers hiya5's treatment of personal information   that   is recorded when you register for membership and submit comments and/or   news   content for inclusion in our database.</p>
			  <p>Our privacy policy does not apply to the practices of other companies   advertised,   or otherwise listed, on the hiya5 web site, nor does it extend to   people that   hiya5 does not employ or manage.</p>
			  <h2><strong>Information Collection and Use</strong></h2>
			  <p> Anyone can visit hiya5 and browse the news content and comments   without having to   provide personal information. We do, however, gather information from   individuals who   wish to submit news, ratings and comments. This information is collected   both directly   and through the use of "cookies".</p>
			  <p>Direct collection of information is limited to the details requested   of you at the  time of registration such as your email address, gender, date of birth,   location and   a password.</p>
			  <p>We ask for your email address so that we can inform you of updates or   changes to   hiya5 or of additions to, or announcements regarding, the Jayde   Online Network   of web sites. You may remove yourself from any or all of our notice and   announcement mailings at   anytime using the unsubscribe methods provided in those mailings. Any   mailing received   from our company is clearly identified and includes a valid email   address and unsubscribe   link which you can use to remove yourself from future mailings. Should   you encounter   problems in this regard, contact <a href="mailto:support@dropjack.com">support@hiya5.com</a>.     Our turnaround time for responding to unsubscribe requests is generally   24 hours.</p>
			  <p>The other way we collect information is through the use of cookies.   When you register with   hiya5, a "cookie" may be placed on your computer. Cookies are bits of   information that   a web site places on your computer's hard drive for record-keeping and   activity-tracking   purposes. Cookies cannot be used to learn your identity unless you have   previously provided   that information to that web site or your web browser automatically   provides that information. </p>
			  <p>In conjunction with the registration information you provide, cookies   help us recognize you   when you return to the site, and they let you avoid having to log-in   each time you visit.   Moreover, cookies may be helpful in helping us determine the direction   of future upgrades  and enable us to better personalize our service to match your interests. </p>
			  <p>The only other information collected is the data recorded on our   server log files.   Typically this information includes IP address, browser type, domain   name, referral URL,   country of origin, pages visited, entry points, and exit points, but   this data   is NOT correlated in any fashion to personally identifying information.</p>
			  <h2><strong>Protecting Your Privacy on hiya5</strong></h2>
			  <p>As a registered user you are able to not just submit and rate news,   you are also   able to post comments. Please be aware that your posted comments are   publicly   accessible. Caution should be exercised in disclosing any personal   details.   Although it is not uncommon for email addresses to be included in   comment posts,  it is not required. The same is true of any personal information.</p>
			  <h2><strong>Security</strong></h2>
			  <p> Any information you provide, other than information you chose to provide   and   make publicly available in your posts, is maintained and accessible only   by   hiya5 staff, and only by those of our staff with a need to have   access   to such information in the performance of their duties. hiya5 has   implemented   commercially reasonable security measures to protect the loss, misuse   and alteration   of the information under our control or in our possession.</p>
			  <p>Notwithstanding the above, we do not and cannot warrant the security   of the information   that you provide. Accordingly, you agree that you are providing such   information at   your own risk.</p>
			  <h2><strong>Special Cases</strong></h2>
			  <p> hiya5's policy is not to use or share personal information about   visitors or members in   ways unrelated to the ones described above without also providing you an   opportunity to opt   out or otherwise prohibit such unrelated uses. Notwithstanding anything   in this policy to   the contrary, hiya5 may, however, disclose personal information   about visitors or members, or information regarding your use of the   Services or Web sites   accessible through our Services, for any reason if, in our sole   discretion, we believe that   it is reasonable to do so, including: to satisfy laws, such as the   Electronic Communications   Privacy Act, regulations, or governmental or legal requests for such   information; to disclose   information that is necessary to identify, contact, or bring legal   action against someone who   may be violating our Terms and Conditions or other user policies; to   operate the Services   properly; or to protect hiya5.com and our Members.</p>
			  <h2><strong>Opting Out of Ad Network Cookies</strong></h2>
			  <p>Hiya5 respects our users’ wish for privacy, and understands some   users may wish to opt-out and/or manage the cookies set on their   computers by these ad networks. To understand how these networks allow   you to manage cookies set by them, you will need to visit their   respective websites. Ad networks generally provide an opt-out on their   websites.</p>
			  <p>Currently, Hiya5 has relationships with the following ad networks   and other third parties:</p>
			  <p>DoubleClick (a Google Company) – http://www.doubleclick.com/<br>
			    Google Ad Sense – https://www.google.com/adsense/</p>
			  <h2><strong>Changes to this Privacy Policy</strong></h2>
			  <p> hiya5 may amend this policy from time to time. If significant changes   are made in the way your   personal information is used, you will be notified by email or a   prominent announcement will be posted   on our site notifying you of the change.</p>
			  <h2><strong>Questions or Comments</strong></h2>
			  <p> Questions or comments may be sent to: <a href="mailto:webmaster@dropjack.com">webmaster@hiya5.com</a> </p>
