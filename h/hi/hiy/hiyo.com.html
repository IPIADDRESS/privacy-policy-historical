            IncrediMail currently contracts with several online partners to help manage and optimize its Internet business and communications.

Although IncrediMail's marketing company manages the information coming from the Site on behalf of IncrediMail, IncrediMail controls how that data may and may not be used. 
            We may use an outside advertising company to display advertisements on the Site and Service. These ads may contain cookies. The advertisement company may collect cookies received with outside ad banners. We do not have access to information that would confirm the use of cookies by the advertising company.

        </p>
        <p>

        </p> 
        <p>
            CONSENT TO PROCESSING<br>

        </p> 
        <p>
