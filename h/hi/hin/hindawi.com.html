We use appropriate technological and operational security measures to protect your information against any unauthorised access or unlawful use, such as:</p><ul><li>ensuring the physical security of our offices or other sites;</li><li>ensuring the physical and digital security of our equipment and devices by using appropriate password protection and encryption;</li><li>maintaining a data protection policy for, and delivering data protection training to, our employees; and</li><li>limiting access to your personal information to those in our company who need to use it in the course of their work.</li></ul><p>We will retain your information for as long as is necessary to provide you with the services that you have requested from us or long as we reasonably require to retain the information for our lawful business purposes, such as for the purposes of exercising our legal rights or where we are permitted to do. We operate a data retention policy and look to find ways to reduce the amount of information we hold about you and the length of time that we need to keep it. For example,</p><ul><li>we archive our email and paper correspondence regularly and destroy information no longer required for our legitimate purposes;</li><li>we retain information relating to job applicants for a period of 6 months from an application decision;</li><li>we retain certain information relating to your MTS Account (including Conflicts of Interest information) indefinitely for Research Integrity purposes and use appropriate safeguards to ensure the security of such information; and</li><li>we maintain a suppression list of email addresses of individuals who no longer wish to be contacted by us.
