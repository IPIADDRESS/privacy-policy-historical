Hinge is all about friends of friends, and so we need to know who your friends are to get you plugged in!</span></p><p class="c1 c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c2">Are you going to post on my wall?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">No, Hinge does not post on your wall. We do, however, publish to your stream - which may show up on news feeds or in the ticker. This is how we tell your friends about Hinge - and when they join, you’ll have a better experience!</span></p><p class="c1 c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c2">Are my ratings private?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Your ratings are totally anonymous and private. No one will ever know what you rated them. However, if you’re playing to “Get Matched” and you rate some highly, and they rate you highly, you’ll be sent an introduction.</span></p><p class="c1 c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c2">What do you do with my information?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">All information provided to Hinge through Facebook (including your photos and email address) are never sold or distributed to any third parties. Hinge uses this information exclusively to make your experience on Hinge better. You can disconnect Hinge from your Facebook account at any time, and Hinge will immediately delete all of your personal information.</span></p><p class="c1 c0"><span class="c4 c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c2">Why do you ask for access to my email address?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Well, to send you emails! We sign you up for our awesome </span><span class="c2 c6">ThursDater</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;newsletter and alert you when important things happen on Hinge that are relevant to you. You can unsubscribe from either form of communication at any time. The one exception is the email we send to introduce you to a mutual interest; we ALWAYS send these. If you don’t want them, then don’t play Hinge in “get matched” mode!</span></p><p class="c1 c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c2">Why do you ask for access to my pictures?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Don’t worry, we’re not posting them! We allow you to choose your profile picture; beyond that we are using your pictures to understand who your closest friends are - again making sure you have the best experience possible.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2 c4">What about the rest of my info?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Your work history, education history, likes etc. are used when we introduce you to someone new. The more information we have, the better introduction we can make, and the easier it is to get the conversation started.</span></p><p class="c1 c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c2">It looks like I can rate people who aren’t on Hinge. Can people opt out of this?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Of course! Just send a link to your Facebook profile in an email to hello@hinge.co with the subject line “OPT OUT”.</span></p><p class="c1 c0"><span class="c4 c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c2">OFFICIAL PRIVACY POLICY</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6 c2">Last revised January 1, 2013</span></p><p class="c1 c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c2">Introduction</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">PURPOSE OF POLICY: </span><span class="c2">This Policy describes how Cleod9, Inc.

We may use your personal information to verify your identity, to check your qualifications, or to follow up with transactions initiated on the Site. We may also use your contact information to inform you of any changes to the Site, or to send you additional information about Hinge.</span></p><p class="c1 c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">ANONYMOUS INFORMATION:</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;We use anonymous information to analyze our Site traffic, but we do not examine this information for individually identifying information. In addition, we may use anonymous IP addresses to help diagnose problems with our server, to administer our site, or to display the content according to your preferences. Traffic and transaction information may also be shared with business partners and advertisers on an aggregate and anonymous basis.</span></p><p class="c1 c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">USE OF COOKIES:</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;We may use cookies to deliver content specific to your interests, to save your password so you don’t have to re-enter it each time you visit our site, or for other purposes. Promotions or advertisements displayed on our site may contain cookies. We do not have access to or control over information collected by outside advertisers on our site.</span></p><p class="c1 c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">SOCIAL NETWORK SHARING:</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Some of the features of the Site are social by design and allow you to publicly share information about yourself and your activities such as your level of activity and participation with the Site; activities performed or rankings, rewards, recognition and virtual items earned or received as a gift from other Site users; and comments, posts and invitations to people within your social network. We will also share some of your information with social networks you are a member of or on which the Site is hosted on and we are not responsible for their use of your information. You should review the applicable privacy policies for these third-party social network providers.</span></p><p class="c1 c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">SALE OF INFORMATION:</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;In order to accommodate changes in our business, we may sell or buy portions of our company or other companies or assets, including the information collected through this Site.
