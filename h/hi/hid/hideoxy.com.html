			<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
	
    		<p>Our online services and websites are designed to be used anonymously and we are not 
			interested in names, addresses, or other information providing insight into the identities 
			of our visitors. We create statistics about visitors that browse our websites and therefor 
			we log some details that come from your browser, such as the user agent you use, the ip 
			address, the operating system, etc. As far as we use this information, it is handled 
			anonymously.</p>

    		<h3 class="alt1">What information is logged on your websites ?</h3>
			
    		<p>As most web servers do, also our web servers may log all the HTTP requests made to our websites. The data recorded includes information provided by 
			your browser (user agent and referring page) as well as the requested URI, the time 
			and date and your IP address. The data recorded in these logs may be used for 
			detecting, preventing and reporting abuse, but also for statistical purposes.</p>
   
            <h3 class="alt1">In which event the logged data will be disclosed ?</h3>
			
            <p>Any violations of our terms of use may result in the disclosure of the data recorded 
			in our logs, including your IP address, to an appropriate third party, which may include 
			your Internet Service Provider (ISP) or local authorities. We may also be required, 
			by law, to provide logs of our service and if requested, such data may be disclosed. We offer 
			a free and legit service, do not abuse it. Depending from the gravity of the violation or abuse, 
			we may also take legal actions in certain cases.</p>
   
    		<h3 class="alt1">Do you use cookies or web beacons on your websites ?</h3>
			
    		<p>Our websites may store a cookie on your computer, if allowed by your browser's 
			privacy settings (for more information on configuring your browser, see 
			<a href="http://www.aboutcookies.org/Default.aspx?page=1">AboutCookies.org</a> or 
			the documentation for your browser). The cookie used by our websites uniquely 
			identifies you to the server and allows our websites to remember your preferences 
			and recommend you useful web pages, products or links.</p>
   
    		<h3 class="alt1">Do you use third-party advertisers on your websites ?</h3>
			
    		<p>Yes, our websites may also use third-party advertising partners, such as 
			<a href="https://www.google.com/adsense/localized-terms" target="_blank">Google Adsense</a> or 
			<a href="https://buysellads.com/" target="_blank">BuySellAds</a>. 
			Advertisers may send you cookies or use web beacons. Obviously we have no control over 
			cookies, web beacons or the information collected by our advertisers. You should consult the 
			third-party advertiser's privacy policy for more information on their practices. We may also 
			advertise other websites and services with banners or text-links hosted in our server.</p>

			<h3 class="alt1">Do you use web analytics software in your websites?</h3>
			
			<p>Yes, our websites may use Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google, 
			Inc. ("Google"). Google Analytics uses "cookies", which are text files placed on 
			your computer, to help the website analyze how users use the site. The information 
			generated by the cookie about your use of the website (including your IP address) 
			will be transmitted to and stored by Google on servers in the United States. Google 
			will use this information for the purpose of evaluating your use of the website, 
			compiling reports on website activity for website operators and providing other 
			services relating to website activity and internet usage. Read the 
			<a href="http://www.google.com/analytics/terms/us.html" target="_blank">Google Analytics TOS</a>.</p>
			
    		<h3 class="alt1">Do you log the proxy activity on web proxy services ?</h3>
    		
			<p>The service provided by the web-based proxy allows access to external, 
			third-party websites. The web proxy may deny access to bank-related websites to prevent 
			users from doing illicit actions. We may record your IP address and the websites you visit. 
			The logs are used primarily for monitoring requests and obviously also for ensuring no 
			illegal activity is undertaken by users. Remember, you are the sole responsible when using our 
			web proxies, use them ethically please.</p>
