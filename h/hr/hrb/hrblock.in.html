<h1>H&amp;R Block Online Privacy Practices and Principles</h1> 

<p>H &amp; R Block (India) Private Limited ("H&amp;R Block") offers a wide range of tax services, including tax preparation, tax planning, and business services in India. Because we offer a variety of services both online (via the Internet) and throughout H&amp;R Block's nationwide network of offices, H&amp;R Block's privacy practices may vary depending on how you interact with H&amp;R Block. The following guidelines set forth general privacy principles that apply to information collected on the www.hrblock.in web site, independent of any particular business relationship you enter into with H&amp;R Block. If you enter into a business relationship with H&amp;R Block as our customer (such as when you are utilizing our tax preparation or other software or online tax preparation tools), we will make you aware of the privacy practices that apply to that particular business or relationship.</p>
<p>These practices do not apply to our physical offices you may visit for services, and these practices do not apply to other affiliates of H&amp;R Block. Those H&amp;R Block affiliates will provide you with their privacy notices when you enter into a business relationship with them. If you are a customer at our physical offices then you will be provided with a privacy policy at our physical office. </p>

<h2>Information We Collect</h2>
<p>When you visit www.hrblock.in, we may collect information about you from the following categories and sources: </p>
<p>Information we receive when you request services or information from us or companies with whom we have business relationships, enter contests or sweepstakes, or complete surveys or polls, submit rebate forms, such as your name, address, e-mail address and payment or billing information. Information we may collect in connection with transactions including, for example, your name, address, account passwords, financial information including debit and credit account numbers, balances and payment history, income and assets</p>
<p>Information to prepare your tax return or for other financial products and services such as your name, address and certain other data such as your Permanent Account Number ("PAN"), income and deductions data, expenses data, vouchers, bank statements, and other personal information about you and your dependents that we need to prepare your tax return. The collection of this information is governed by the specific privacy policy for the H&amp;R Block business providing these services to you.</p>
<p>Information you provide when you apply for employment with H&amp;R Block or any of its affiliates.</p>
<p>Information we may collect from the tax authorities, our franchisees, our affiliates, and certain non-affiliated third parties such as credit reporting agencies.</p>
<p>Web technologies. We may collect information through the following Web technologies: We utilize a software technology called "cookies". Internet cookies allow us to customize our Website for you by placing small files on your computer as you visit various components of www.hrblock.in. Through the use of cookies, we can display only those items that may be of interest to you on a particular site, or make it easier for you to access your account information. In most cases, however, information we collect through Internet cookies does not identify you personally.</p>
<p>We allow third-party companies to serve ads and/or collect certain anonymous information when you visit our web site. These companies may use non-personally identifiable information (e.g., click stream information, browser type, time and date, subject of advertisements clicked or scrolled over) during your visits to this and other Web sites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services likely to be of greater interest to you. These companies typically use a cookie or third party web beacon to collect this information. To opt-out of this type of advertising, please complete the form at http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp</p>
<p>Like most standard Web site servers, H&amp;R Block uses log files. Information collected in log files may include internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, and number of clicks. We utilize this information to analyze trends, administer the site, track user's movement in the aggregate, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. This information is not personally identifiable. When you use certain online tax services, IP addresses are tied to personally identifiable information to enable users to file or transmit tax returns to the tax authorities.</p>
<p>When you use calculators and other tools on our Web sites that do not require registration, H&amp;R Block may collect non-identifiable data from such tools, such as the number of people that use a certain tool. H&amp;R Block may also set cookies or clear gifs based upon your use of tools and calculators to help us customize offers and tools to your particular interests. H&amp;R Block will not record or track any data you enter into standalone tools and calculators in any way that identifies you personally, unless we specifically inform you that we are doing so at the time you provide such data.</p>
<p>When you use our office locator service, we may collect data such as address or zip code information you provide so that we can better assess the level of interest in our services in a particular area, and the effectiveness of the locator tool at helping clients actually use our services.</p>

<h2>How We May Disclose Your Information </h2>
<p>Tax return information that H&amp;R Block collects from you is controlled by the Information Technology Act, 2000, certain other laws, and H&amp;R Block policies. Any information that is collected from you as part of your customer relationship(s) with H&amp;R Block, either online or through a retail office will be governed by the privacy notice that will be provided to you when you become a customer of the specific H&amp;R Block business.</p>
<p>For information collected on www.hrblock.in (as described above), H&amp;R Block may use and disclose such information to the following categories of persons unless you expressly in writing request H&amp;R Block not to do so:</p>
<p><strong>Uses and Disclosures by H&amp;R Block</strong>. Where permitted by law, H&amp;R Block may use the information collected on this website to make you aware of products and services offered by H&amp;R Block and its affiliated companies.</p>
<p><strong>Third Parties.</strong> We do not share your personal information with non-affiliated third parties for marketing purposes except as permitted by applicable law or with your consent. We do not sell or rent your personal information to third party direct marketers.</p>
<p><strong>Affiliates.</strong> H&amp;R Block may provide information it collects to its affiliates as permitted by law. For example, we disclose information to our affiliates in order to respond to your requests for information or services, or to help limit your receipt of marketing materials you have requested not to receive.</p>
<p><strong>Service Providers.</strong> Where permitted by applicable law, we may disclose your personal information to service providers who perform business functions on our behalf. We require H&amp;R Block service providers to have written contracts that specify appropriate use of your personal information, require them to safeguard your personal information, and prohibit them from making unauthorized or unlawful use of your personal information.</p>
<p><strong>Joint Marketing Arrangements.</strong> Where permitted by law, H&amp;R Block may provide information it collects to joint marketers with whom H&amp;R Block has a marketing arrangement. For example, H&amp;R Block may enter into agreements with airlines or credit card companies to provide you with "miles" or "points" for visiting the H&amp;R Block Web site or purchasing certain products or services from H&amp;R Block. In such case, H&amp;R Block would provide identifying information about you to the company in order to credit your account with such "miles" or "points". We require all joint marketers to have written contracts with us that specify appropriate use of your personal information, require them to safeguard your personal information, and prohibit them from making unauthorized or unlawful use of your personal information.</p>
<p><strong>Persons Who Acquire Our Assets or Business.</strong> If H&amp;R Block sells or transfers any of its business or assets, certain information about our clients may be a part of that sale or transfer. In the event of such a sale or transfer, H&amp;R Block will notify you. The notification procedure will be the same as the procedure we use to notify you of a change in our privacy statement as described below.</p>
<p><strong>Persons Who Request Information for Legal Purposes.</strong> We may disclose your information to affiliates or non-affiliated third parties when we have a good faith belief that such disclosure is required by law. This may occur in connection with a court order, legal process, or other judicial, administrative or investigative proceeding that produces a request for information from H&amp;R Block.</p>
<p>We may also disclose aggregate information compiled using your personal information that does not identify you individually or personally. This may include, for example, the total number of visitors to our Web site from a particular state, or the average age of a user of our Web sites. </p>

<h2>Links to Other Web sites and Offers for Third Party Products</h2>
<p>H&amp;R Block's Web site may contain links to third party Web sites or offers for services from third parties. For any such third party products or services, you should carefully read the privacy policies of the third parties providing such products or services and any terms and conditions applicable to such products or services. </p>
<p>H&amp;R Block may also have business relationships with third parties that provide products or services on the H&amp;R Block site. These companies are clearly indicated on our Web sites. This privacy policy does not apply to products or services offered by a third party. When you request products or services from such companies, you give H&amp;R Block permission to provide these third parties with personal information about you necessary to fulfill or process your request. </p>
<p>As an example, we may have special offers for dial-up or broadband internet service on our Web site through a third party provider. If you click on a link promoting such services you may be linked directly to the third party site or H&amp;R Block may collect and provide information about you to such third party to fulfill your request for such internet services.</p>

<h2>Changes to Our Privacy Statement</h2>

However, it is your sole responsibility to keep yourself duly updated about such changes in our privacy practices and principles from time to time. By entering the website and using its content it will be implied that you have accepted our privacy practices and principles and that you are bound by it. In no case will H&amp;R Block be responsible for any loss/ harm to you on account of you not being updated with any changes in our privacy practices and principles.</p>

All H&amp;R employees follow a network-wide security policy. Only authorised H&amp;R Block personnel are provided access to personally identifiable information and these employees have agreed to ensure confidentiality of this information. H&amp;R's policy is to use secure socket layer technology for the protection of your information provided to us through the web or otherwise.  Fulfillment agents of  H&amp;R Block are also required to comply with this policy.</p>
