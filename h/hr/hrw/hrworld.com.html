			<p class="MsoNormal"><b>What we collect:</b></p>
			
			<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Part 1- '<i>Personal Information'</i></b></p>
			
			<p class="MsoNormal">Personal Information generally means information which might

			</span></span>Otherwise communicate with us. </p>
			
			<p class="MsoNormal">Several of the services that we offer require registration
			as a condition of use. We may also receive personal information about you from
			other sources and add it to the information you have provided to us.</p>
			
			<p class="MsoNormal">Please note that Ziff Davis is not responsible for the
			information you volunteer about yourself in the discussions in our forums, chat
			rooms, or other publicly accessible interaction, or information that you choose
			to make public in your member profile. You can change your publicly available
			information at any time via your profile page.</p>
			
			<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Part 2-</b> <b><i>Other Information We Collect:</i></b></p>
			
			<p class="MsoNormal"><i>Web Beacons</i> are electronic files that allow a web
			site to count users who have visited that page or to access certain cookies.
			When you receive newsletters or promotional e-mail from us, we may use web
			beacons, customized links or similar technologies to determine whether the
			e-mail has been opened and which links you click in order to provide you more
			focused e-mail communications or other information.</p>
			
			<p class="MsoNormal"><i>Cookies</i> are small text files that are placed on your
			hard disk by a Web page server. Cookies contain information that can later be
			read by a Web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you. Cookies
			cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Like many
			other web sites, Ziff Davis sites use cookies to enable you to sign in to our
			services and to help personalize your online experience. We may use a cookie to
			identify members so they do not have to re-enter a user ID and password when
			they wish to download a utility, post to a discussion, or sign into an account.
			As another example, cookies can be used to control the number of times you see
			advertisements, like pop-ups. By allowing us to better understand how users
			interact with the site over time, cookies can also help us improve your
			experience and deliver more relevant content to you. Cookies may be created
			directly by our sites for these purposes, or by third-party companies operating
			on our behalf.</p>
			
			<p class="MsoNormal"><i>Pixel Tags,</i> also known as clear gifs, beacons,
			spotlight tags or web bugs, are a method for passing information from the
			user's computer to a third party Web site. Used in conjunction with cookies,
			Ziff Davis may use pixel tags to improve our understanding of site traffic,
			visitor behavior, and response to promotional campaigns. Pixel tags are also
			used as a supplement to our server logs and other methods of traffic and
			response measurement, and are sometimes used in conjunction with small
			Javascript-based applications. We may also implement pixel tags provided by
			other companies for the same purpose.</p>
			
			<p class="MsoNormal">You need not have cookies turned on to visit all of our
			sites, though cookies may be required in order for you to participate in
			certain areas. If you choose to become a member of a Ziff Davis web site, you
			must have cookies enabled to access any member related pages (i.e., Discussion
			Boards, Member Profile pages, Search for a Member).</p>
			
			<p class="MsoNormal"><b>What We Provide to Third Parties:</b></p>
			
			<p class="MsoNormal"><i>Statistical Reports and Mailing Lists </i>The aggregate
			statistics that describe our online audience, which are often based on the
			information you provide when you subscribe, register, or browse our sites, help
			us sell advertising and otherwise publicize Ziff Davis and our brands. In
			addition, we make certain information such as the name of our users, their
			mailing address, phone number, email addresses, and - in certain circumstances
			- their employer's name, company size and other industry data (when
			voluntarily submitted by the user) available on a rental or other basis (e.g.
			sale) to third party providers of goods and services. To learn how you can make
			choices about how this information is used or shared, please visit the <i>How
			You Can Change or Control what is Collected</i> section below.</p>
			
			<p class="MsoNormal"><i>Email Deployment, Data Analysis E-Commerce and Other
			Services </i>We provide customer lists,&nbsp; email addresses and other
			information to third party companies and contractors who provide us with
			specialized services, such as email message deployment, merge-purge
			(identifying and removing duplicate addresses), subscription fulfillment, and
			customer support and service, research, statistical analysis, data and website hosting
			and other data and transaction processing. These companies work on our behalf
			and we do not provide our lists or other data to them for their own, permanent
			use. Those service providers will be permitted to obtain only the personal
			information they need to deliver the service. They should also maintain the
			confidentiality of the information and are prohibited from using it for any
			other purpose.</p>
			
			<p class="MsoNormal">Please note that we engage third party service providers for
			the purpose of processing sales of subscriptions, to fulfill your orders for
			product purchases, to honor your request to be removed from promotional
			mailings, or other services. These service providers have access to or are
			provided with certain personal information (including credit card information)
			in order to provide us with the applicable service.</p>
			
			<p class="MsoNormal"><i>Webcasts </i>At times we produce and host sponsored
			webcasts for a variety of companies ("Sponsors"). Data collected during the
			registration process and the actual event may be shared with those Sponsors and
			others, and is governed by our policy and the third party's privacy policy and
			may be used by the Sponsor for follow-up purposes.</p>
			
			<p class="MsoNormal"><i>Contests/Sweepstakes </i>Data collected during the
			registration for contests and sweepstakes may be shared with sponsors. Please read
			the contest rules carefully before you submit your data.</p>
			
			<p class="MsoNormal"><i>Co-Branded Sites and Services </i>When you use a
			co-branded service (a service operated with a service or site partner of Ziff
			Davis) within our network of sites, or register or otherwise provide information
			on a co-branded site, you grant us permission to pass the information collected
			back to that service or site partner. Use of your information by such partners
			is subject to their privacy policies as well as ours.</p>
			
			<p class="MsoNormal"><i>White Papers/Other Sponsored Downloads </i>Ziff Davis
			hosts product listings and offers informational downloads for a variety of
			third party vendors. When registration is required in order to receive or view
			the download, all data collected during product registration and/or Ziff Davis
			web site registration will be shared with the vendor (and other third parties) and
			their use of this data is governed by their privacy policy.</p>
			
			<p class="MsoNormal"><i>Ecommerce</i> When shopping on certain of our sites or
			pages, our users will need to provide personally identifiable information
			necessary to fulfill an online order, including name, billing address, shipping
			address, telephone number, email address, credit card number (with expiration
			date), and any of the above information needed to send a package to a gift
			recipient. If a user creates an account, the credit card information above will
			not be stored under their account. When placing an order, credit card
			information may be either temporarily stored on a Ziff Davis server and then
			immediately transferred to a secure server of a PCI compliant third party or
			will be immediately entered onto a secure server of a PCI compliant third party.
			We partner with a number of third parties to process and fulfill orders, send
			transactional emails, and ensure delivery of packages. While these third
			parties may have access to personal information in order to perform their
			duties, they are not permitted to use it for other purposes.</p>
			
			<p class="MsoNormal"><b>What Third parties May Collect:</b></p>
			
			<p class="MsoNormal"><i>Online Ad Serving. </i>Ziff Davis and some of our
			advertisers use third-party advertising service companies to serve
			advertisements when you visit our sites. Often, these third-party advertising
			companies employ cookie, pixel tag and other technologies to measure the
			effectiveness of Web and e-mail advertisement and to create a record of interaction
			with our site content that they use in conjunction with their advertising which
			appears on other sites, or for reporting web site traffic, statistics,
			advertisement data and/or other activities on our sites. We will also engage
			third party providers to assist with the segmentation of this data.&nbsp; <b>The
			specific providers we use are subject to change.&nbsp; </b>As of the date of
			the posting of this policy, some of<b> </b>the current providers include<b> </b>DoubleClick,
			Omniture SiteCatalyst and Google Analytics (for information about how to opt
			out of tracking methods for these entities and others <a href="http://www.aboutads.info"><b>click here</b></a>), and Demdex (to opt out <a href="http://info.betteradvertising.com/companies/demdex"><b>click here</b></a>)</p>
			
			<p class="MsoNormal"><b>What Ziff Davis does with the Information it Collects</b></p>
			
			<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Personal Information. </b>How we use personal information
			is described in the Section <i><u>What We Provide to Third Parties</u>. </i></p>
			
			<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Other Information: Ad Serving and Ziff Davis. </b>At
			times we display ads both on our network of owned and operated web sites and on
			non-Ziff Davis web sites. When you visit one of our web sites or view ads that
			we serve off of our network elsewhere on the Internet, you may see multiple
			kinds of ads, such as text ads next to search results and graphical ads shown on
			web pages. Sometimes these ads are based on the content of the page on which
			they appear. Other times these ads are generated by matching the ad to your
			interests as inferred from your browsing activities collected online. Either
			way, Ziff Davis tries to show you relevant ads, and to do so, we may use
			information we know or receive about you like your gender, location or
			interests.</p>
			
			<p class="MsoNormal"><i>Interest-based Ads:</i> We use cookies, Javascript, pixel
			tags and other technology to collect information about your visit to our sites
			and other third party partner websites that we do not own or operate but with
			whom we have agreements.&nbsp; We analyze what pages you visit on&nbsp;our
			sites and the third party sites, what products or services you view, and
			whether you view or click on ads that are shown to you. All such data is
			collected anonymously, and is aggregated with other data we collect and/or
			similar data collected by partners to create segments, groups of users and
			certain general interest categories or segments that we have inferred based on
			(a) demographic or interest data, and a general geographic location derived
			from your IP address, (b) the pages you view and links you click when using our
			sites and services and those of our partners, and/or (c) the search terms you
			enter when using certain search services. We use this information to get a more
			accurate picture of audience interests in order to serve ads we believe are
			more relevant to your interests. </p>
			
			<p class="MsoNormal">We store page views, clicks and search terms used for ad
			personalization targeting separately from your contact information or other
			data that directly identifies you (such as your name, e-mail address) which we
			obtained as described above under <i>Personal Information </i>and we do not
			combine the two sets of data.</p>
			
			<p class="MsoNormal">We will engage third party providers to assist with the
			collection, storage and segmentation of this data; and the providers are
			required to maintain the confidentiality of this information. These efforts do
			not result in the collection of personally identifiable information such as
			name or address; and we do not intentionally collect data that we consider to
			be sensitive such as health or medical information. This data is not sold or
			transferred to any third party. Except as may be set forth elsewhere in this
			policy, this data is retained for not more than 180 days after which it shall
			expire except in certain situations when the same user subsequently visits one
			of our sites or a partner's site in which event the 180 day period will
			commence again.</p>
			
			<p class="MsoNormal"><b><i>How You Can Change or Control what is Collected:</i></b></p>
			
			<p class="MsoNormal"><i>Cookies.</i> Most web browsers automatically accept
			cookies but allow you to modify security settings so you can approve or reject
			cookies on a case-by-case basis.&nbsp; You may stop or restrict cookies on your
			computer or purge them from your browser by adjusting your web browser
			preferences. If you would prefer that we not collect anonymous data that may be
			used to help determine which advertisements to serve you, opt out by clicking
			this icon AdChoice <img border="0" width="14" height="18" id="_bapw-icon" src="images/betrad.png" alt="Description: Ad Choices"><br>
			<br>
			However, if you 'turn off,' purge or disable cookies, although you may still
			use our websites, you may not be able to use all of the features, functions or
			services available on our websites. Please <a href="http://www.aboutads.info">click
			here</a> to learn more about the use of cookies, your opt out choices, and
			more.</p>
			
			<p class="MsoNormal">Ziff Davis supports the Self-Regulatory Principles for
			Online Behavioral Advertising of the Digital Advertising Alliance (for more
			information <a href="http://www.aboutads.info">click here</a>), and has Evidon
			Inc.'s assurance platform to comply with these Principles. As part of this
			service, online ads that we place using behavioral data we collect are expected
			to be delivered with the Advertising Option Icon (also referred to as the <i>Forward
			i</i>) or similar icon that helps consumers understand how their data is being
			used and provides choices for consumers who want more control. Online
			advertisements on our sites targeted to you based on previously collected
			online data about you by third parties should also have the Advertising Option
			Icon.&nbsp; This icon is also at the bottom of each of our web pages. The
			Advertising Option icon provides information (and links to other information)
			on online behavioral ads, who is collecting and using your online data, how you
			can opt out and more.</p>
			
			<p class="MsoNormal"><i>Pixel Tags.</i> You can disable pixel tags by changing
			your browser settings to omit images and disable Javascript; or there are
			commercial software packages available that can omit pixel tags and most
			advertisements.</p>
			
			<p class="MsoNormal"><i>Updating Your Registration Information. </i>You can
			correct or change the information collected during site registration at any
			time at the profile page links shown below or by sending email to the addresses
			shown below. Please allow five to ten business days for corrections or changes
			to be publicly displayed or implemented throughout our systems.</p>
			
			<p class="MsoNormal"><i>Your Newsletter Subscriptions. </i>You can opt-in to
			newsletter mailing lists, or remove yourself at any time through the <a href="http://www.pcmag.com/newsletter_manage">newsletter subscription
			management page</a> (this page will display all of your newsletter
			subscriptions) or by following the instructions at the end of the newsletters
			you receive. Please allow five to ten business days for changes to take effect.</p>
			
			<p class="MsoNormal"><i>Your Subscription Information. </i>You can correct or
			change your PC Magazine Digital Edition subscription information and your
			preferences as to our ability to provide your information to third parties for
			their own marketing purposes click <a href="http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,1329747,00.asp">here</a>.&nbsp;
			Please allow two to four weeks for changes to take effect (if you are a new
			subscriber, your information may not be immediately available at this URL --
			please allow up to four weeks from placing your subscription order for
			processing).</p>
			
			<p class="MsoNormal"><i>Stop Sharing of Lists.&nbsp; </i>Many customers
			appreciate the offerings they receive from the third party providers of goods
			and services to whom we provide lists of our customers, but here is what to do
