                    giving any personal information about yourself. There are 
                    times, however, when we or our partners may need information 
                    from you.<br>
                    You may choose to give us personal information in a variety 
                    of situations. For example, you may want to give us information, 
                    such as your name and address or e-mail id, to correspond 
                    with you, to process an order, or to provide you with a subscription. 
                    You may give us your credit card details to buy something 
                    from us or a description of your education and work experience 
                    in connection with a job opening at Hitachi Global Storage

                    to let you know how we will use such information before we 
                    collect it from you; if you tell us that you do not want us 
                    to use this information to make further contact with you beyond 
                    fulfilling your requests, we will respect your wishes. If 
                    you give us personal information about somebody else, such 
                    as a spouse or work colleague, we will assume that you have

                    Global Storage Technologies Web site you are visiting, one 
                    or more of the paragraphs may apply. For example, if you order

                    site, your information will be handled as described in such

                  <p class="subtitle"> Other Hitachi Global Storage Technologies Web Site Notices	
                  </p>
                  <p>In some cases, specific Hitachi Global Storage Technologies 
                    Web sites may contain other notices about their use and the 
                    information practices applicable to those sites.</p>
                  <p class="subtitle"> Our Worldwide Practices </p>
                  <p>Hitachi Global Storage Technologies is a global organization, 
                    with legal entities, business processes, management structures, 
                    and technical systems that cross borders.<br>
                    Our privacy practices are designed to provide protection for 
                    your personal information, all over the world.<br>
                    We may share your personal information within Hitachi Global 
                    Storage Technologies and transfer it to countries in the world 
                    where we do business.<br>
                    Some countries may provide less legal protection for your 
                    information. In such countries Hitachi Global Storage Technologies 
                    will still handle information in the manner we describe here.</p>
                  <p class="subtitle"> Information Security and Quality </p>
                  <p>We intend to protect your personal information and to maintain 
                    its quality. We implement appropriate measures and processes, 
                    such as using encryption when transmitting certain sensitive 
                    information, to help us to keep your information secure and 
                    to maintain its quality.</p>
                  <p class="subtitle"> Supplementing Information </p>
                  <p>From time to time we may supplement information you give 
                    us via an Hitachi Global Storage Technologies Web site with 
                    information from other sources, such as information validating 
                    your address or other available information about businesses. 
                    This is to help us maintain the accuracy of the information 
                    we collect and to help us provide a better service.</p>
                  <p class="subtitle"> Use of Suppliers </p>
                  <p>In some cases Hitachi Global Storage Technologies uses suppliers 
                    to collect, use, analyze and otherwise process information 
                    on its behalf. It is Hitachi Global Storage Technologies' 
                    practice to require such suppliers to handle information in 
                    a manner consistent with Hitachi Global Storage Technologies' 
                    policies.</p>
                  <p class="subtitle"> Mergers and Acquisitions </p>
                  <p>Circumstances may arise where, whether for strategic or other 
                    business reasons, Hitachi Global Storage Technologies decides 
                    to sell, buy, merge or otherwise reorganize businesses in 
                    some countries. Such a transaction may involve the disclosure 
                    of personal information to prospective or actual purchasers, 
                    or receiving it from sellers. It is Hitachi Global Storage 
                    Technologies’practice to seek appropriate protection 
                    for information in these types of transactions.</p>
                  <p class="subtitle"> Cookies, Web Beacons and Other Technologies </p>
                  <p>We sometimes collect non-identifiable information from visits 
                    to our Web sites to help us provide better customer service. 
                    For example, we keep track of the domains from which people 
                    visit, and we also measure visitor activity on Hitachi Global 
                    Storage Technologies Web sites, but we do so in ways that 
                    keep the information non-identifiable. This information is 
                    sometimes known as "clickstream data." Hitachi Global 
                    Storage Technologies or others on Hitachi Global Storage Technologies' 
                    behalf may use this data to analyze trends and statistics 
                    and to help us provide better customer service.<br>
                    Also, when we collect personal data from you in a transaction, 
                    we may extract some information about that transaction in 
                    an non-identifiable format and combine it with other non-identifiable 
                    information such as clickstream data. This information is 
                    used and analyzed to help us understand trends and patterns. 
                    If you do not want your transaction details used in this manner 
                    you can disable your cookies.<br>
                    We collect the information we mentioned in the previous paragraphs 
                    through the use of various technologies, including one called 
                    "cookies". A cookie is a piece of data that a Web 
                    site can send to your browser, which may then be stored on 
                    your computer as an anonymous tag that identifies your computer 
                    but not you. Some Hitachi Global Storage Technologies pages 
                    use cookies, sent by Hitachi Global Storage Technologies or 
                    its third party vendors, or other technologies to better serve 
                    you when you return to the Web site. You can set your browser 
                    to notify you before you receive a cookie, giving you the 
                    chance to decide whether to accept it. You can also set your 
                    browser to turn off cookies. If you do so, however, some Web 
                    sites may not work properly.<br>
                    Some Hitachi Global Storage Technologies Web sites also use 
                    Web beacon or other technologies to better tailor those sites 
                    to provide better customer service. These technologies may 
                    be in use on a number of pages across Hitachi Global Storage 
                    Technologies Web sites. When a visitor accesses these pages, 
                    a non-identifiable notice of that visit is generated which 
                    may be processed by us or by our suppliers. These Web beacons 
                    usually work in conjunction with cookies. If you don't want 
                    your cookie information to be associated with your visits 
                    to these pages, you can set your browser to turn off cookies.<br>
                    If you turn off cookies, Web beacon and other technologies 
                    will still detect visits to these pages, but the notices they 
                    generate cannot be associated with other non-identifiable 
                    cookie information and are disregarded.</p>

                    <span class="subtitle">Service Quality Monitoring </span></p>
                  <p>Certain Web transactions may also involve you calling us 
                    or our calling you. Please be aware that it is Hitachi Global 
                    Storage Technologies general practice to monitor and in some 
                    cases record such calls for staff training or quality assurance 
                    purposes.</p>
                  <p class="subtitle"> Online Advertising </p>
                  <p>Certain companies help us deliver interactive on-line advertising 
                    such as banner ads. These companies may collect and use information 
                    about customers to help us better understand the offers, promotions, 
                    and types of advertising that are most appealing to our customers. 
                    After it is collected the information is aggregated so it 
                    is not identifiable to a specific individual. If, however, 
                    you would prefer that these companies not collect such information, 
                    please visit www.networkadvertising.org and follow the "opt-out" 
                    instructions.</p>
                  <p class="subtitle"> Personalized URL Link </p>
                  <p>On occasion, we may personalize and customize Web sites for 
                    certain visitors. If you visit one of these sites, you may 
                    find it customized with references to products and/or services

                    information you have provided to us. While you are visiting 
                    these Web sites, we may collect information about your visit 
                    to better tailor the site to your interests. An invitation 
                    to visit one of these Web sites is usually presented as a 
                    personalized URL in an e-mail, a notice on a Web site registration 
                    page, or as a response to you logging on to a certain Web

                    about you and your relationship with Hitachi Global Storage 
                    Technologies. If you do not wish your information to be used 
                    in this way, do not accept the invitation to visit these sites.<br>
                    Disclosures Required By Law Please be aware that in certain 
                    circumstances, it is possible that personal information may
