                        <p><strong>Last Updated: May 2018</strong></p>
                        <p><strong>Effective Date: May 25, 2018</strong></p>
                        <p>This privacy statement ("Statement") applies to Hilton Grand Vacations Inc. its subsidiaries and all of the resorts within the Hilton Grand Vacations collection of resorts (collectively, "HGV," "we," or "us"). At HGV, we strive to deliver outstanding products, services, and experiences around the world. We value your business and, more importantly, your loyalty. We recognize that privacy is an important issue. We have developed this Statement to explain our practices regarding the personal information we collect from you or about you on this site or via our apps, through written or verbal communications with us, when you visit one of our properties, or from other sources. While this Statement broadly describes the practices we have adopted across HGV globally, local laws vary and some jurisdictions may place restrictions on our processing activities (e.g., certain jurisdictions may require an express consent to send marketing messages). Therefore, our practices in such jurisdictions may be more limited than those described herein in order to enable us to comply with local requirements.</p>
                        <p><strong><strong>By using any of our products or services and/or by agreeing to this Statement (e.g. in the context of registering for any of our products or services) you agree to the collection and use of personal information as described in this Statement.</strong></strong></p>
                        <p>Please note that this Statement does not apply to our processing of personal information on behalf of and subject to the instructions of third parties such as airlines, car rental companies and other service providers, companies that organize or offer packaged travel arrangements, marketing partners, or corporate customers.</p>

                            <h2>Use of Personal Information Collected About You</h2>
                            <p>We use your personal information in a number of ways, including to provide and personalize the services you request and expect from HGV, to offer you the expected level of hospitality in-room and throughout our properties, conduct direct marketing and sales promotions and as set forth below in more detail:</p>
                            <ul>
                              <li><em>Hilton Honors/Membership Programs:</em> If you are member of one of our Membership Programs, we use your information to administer the Membership Programs, to personalize your experience across our services and applications, and in connection with our Membership Program Apps. We also use your information to communicate news, promotional, and transactional materials across different HGV services and to personalize advertising and content delivered to you through online, email, mobile, and display advertising, as well as on our website and applications and through our customer service call center.</li>
                              <li><em>Service Administration:</em> We use your personal information to administer programs in which you participate, including providing you with access to your account information, and offers for which you are eligible; to fulfill services that are part of such program; to enable direct communication between properties within the HGV collection of resorts; and between the HGV collection of resorts and you; and to facilitate collections.</li>
                              <li><em>Meeting and Event Planning:</em> We may use your personal information to provide you with information about meeting and event planning.</li>
                              <li><em>Marketing and Communications:</em> We may use your personal information to provide or offer you newsletters, promotions and featured specials, as well as other marketing messages.

We also use user-generated content (such as photos) from social media services to deliver display advertising on our website and apps.</li>
                              <li><em>Payment Card Marketing:</em> We may also collect information from your payment card, which can be appended to personal information and used by HGV or its business partners to recognize what type of card you have, such as whether or not it is a Hilton co-branded card and/or the bank or network of the card, and present and/or send you targeted marketing messages based on your payment method. We may also partner with third parties to learn whether a visitor to our site has a cash-back offer associated with their payment card and to deliver the visitor advertising and information that explains how to take advantage of that offer through a stay at a resort within the HGV collection of resorts.</li>
                              <li><em>Service Improvements:</em> We may use your personal information to improve HGV's services and to ensure that our site, products, and services are of interest to you.

                        <h2>Personal Information We Share</h2>
                        <p>In order to offer you the expected level of hospitality and to provide you with the best level of service, we may share your personal information among members of the HGV collection of resorts, our service providers, third parties and others as set forth in detail below:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><em>HGV Collection of Resorts:</em> We may share personal information within the HGV collection of resorts, as well as with owners and operators of resorts that we manage or are affiliated with but do not own, resorts that may individually or jointly use the personal information to provide you with services, personalization, and for the purposes described above.

                            <li><em>Electronic Billing Program:</em> If you receive an eFolio by email (as discussed above), a summary detailing the goods and services provided to you during your stay will be shared with the payment card provider and, if you participate in a corporate billing program and use a corporate payment card, the payment card provider may share that summary with your employer.</li>
                            <li><em>Group Events or Meetings:</em> If you visit HGV as part of a group event or meeting, information collected for meeting and event planning may be shared with the organizers of those meetings and events, and, where appropriate, guests who organize or participate in the meeting or event.</li>

We may also work with third parties, such as our airline, cruise and car rental partners, to allow us and our partners to deliver advertisements to our shared customers. Our partners may be able to provide more relevant offers to you based upon anonymous information that we share about your experiences at our properties. Additionally, we may allow third-party partners to recognize you when you visit that partner's website or app, or to recognize you as one of their customers when you visit HGV websites or apps so that they may provide more relevant offers to you. We may share your email address with third parties using available security measures that may match it with their own email addresses so that they can send online and email advertisements to you on our behalf.</li>
                            <li><em>Co-Sponsors of Promotions:</em> We co-sponsor promotions, sweepstakes, prize draws, competitions or contests with other companies, and we provide prizes for sweepstakes and contests sponsored by other companies.
