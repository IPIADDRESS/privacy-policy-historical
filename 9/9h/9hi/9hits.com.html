</ul>
<h2><span>Legal Basis for Processing Personal Data under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)</span></h2>
<p>If you are from the European Economic Area (EEA), 9Hits legal basis for collecting and using the personal information described in this Privacy Policy depends on the Personal Data we collect and the specific context in which we collect it.</p>
<p>9Hits may process your Personal Data because:</p>

<strong>
Google Analytics
</strong>
</p>
<p>Google Analytics is a web analytics service offered by Google that tracks and reports website traffic. Google uses the data collected to track and monitor the use of our Service.

<p>You can opt-out of having made your activity on the Service available to Google Analytics by installing the Google Analytics opt-out browser add-on.

<h3>Payments</h3>
<p>We may provide paid products and/or services within the Service. In that case, we use third-party services for payment processing (e.g. payment processors).</p>
<p>We will not store or collect your payment card details. That information is provided directly to our third-party payment processors whose use of your personal information is governed by their Privacy Policy. These payment processors adhere to the standards set by PCI-DSS as managed by the PCI Security Standards Council, which is a joint effort of brands like Visa, MasterCard, American Express and Discover. PCI-DSS requirements help ensure the secure handling of payment information.</p>
