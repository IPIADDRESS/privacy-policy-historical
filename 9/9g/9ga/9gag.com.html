              <p>9GAG Team takes the private nature of your personal information very seriously. This Privacy Policy (which we adapted from a policy originally provided by <a href="http://www.automattic.com">Automattic</a> (<a href="http://www.wordpress.com">WordPress.com</a>)) describes how we treat the information we collect when you visit and use the website available at 9gag.com (the “Website”) and is made available under the Creative Commons Sharealike license. Please read this notice very carefully. (Last modified: 30 June 2008)

                <div class="static_block_content">
                  <p>Like most website operators, 9GAG collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. 9GAG’s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how 9GAG’s visitors use its Website. From time to time, 9GAG may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its Website.</p>
                  <p>9GAG also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. 9GAG does not use such information to identify its visitors, however, and does not disclose such information, other than under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information, as described below.

				<h4>Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</h4>
                </div><!--end static_block_head-->
                <div class="static_block_content">
                  <p>Certain visitors to the Website choose to interact with 9GAG in ways that require 9GAG to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that 9GAG gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up for an account at 9gag.com to provide a username and email address. In each case, 9GAG collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor’s interaction with 9GAG. 9GAG does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.</p>
                  <p>9GAG does not collect personally identifiable information from children under the age of 13. If you believe that a child has provided 9GAG with personally identifiable information without the consent of his or her parent or guardian, please contact us at <a href="mailto:support@9gag.com">support@9gag.com</a>. If 9GAG becomes aware that a child under age 13 has provided us with personally identifiable information, we will delete such information.

                <div class="static_block_content">
                  <p>9GAG discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on 9GAG’s behalf or to provide services available at the Website, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using the Website, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. In addition, in some cases we may choose to buy or sell assets. In these types of transactions, user information is typically one of the business assets that is transferred. Moreover, if 9GAG or substantially all of its assets were acquired, or in the unlikely event that 9GAG goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of 9GAG may continue to use your personal and non-personal information only as set forth in this policy. Otherwise, 9GAG will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone.</p>
                  <p>Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations or as described above, 9GAG discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only when required to do so by law, or when 9GAG believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of 9GAG, third parties or the public at large. If you are a registered user of the 9GAG Website and have supplied your email address, 9GAG may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what’s going on with 9GAG and our products. We primarily use our various product blogs to communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. 9GAG takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.
</p>
<p>You should also be aware that if you submit information to “chat rooms,” “forums” or “message boards” such information becomes public information, meaning that you lose any privacy rights you might have with regards to that information. Such disclosures may also increase your chances of receiving unwanted communications.
</p>
<p>For users outside Hong Kong, please note that any personally-identifiable information you enter into the Website will be transferred out of your country and into Hong Kong. You consent to such transfer through your use of the Website. You also warrant that you have the right to transfer such information outside your country and into Hong Kong.
