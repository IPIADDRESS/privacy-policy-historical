<p>Dear 9flats user,</p>
<p>We know that General Terms and Conditions of Business are long and often seen as being commonly dull. All the same, it’s really important that you read them the following provisions carefully. The general terms and conditions of business firstly describe the specific contractual relationship that exists between you and 9flats (i.e. the respective rights and obligations of you and 9flats) and secondly outline the fundamental obligations that concern the relationship between the guest and host.</p>

<p>General services of 9flats<br>
(Functions of the platform, entry into force of contracts between the users, payment modalities)</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph_body">
<span class="number">3.1</span>
<p>9flats offers an online platform to registered users. On this platform, a user can firstly offer other users the usage of apartments, rooms or another kind of accommodation (hereinafter referred to as: accommodation) for a fee. Secondly, a user can also look for suitable accommodation on this online platform and make a booking query via the online platform. 9flats therefore provides the users with a marketplace on which guest and host can find each other.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph_body">
<span class="number">3.2</span>
<p>The provider of accommodation is hereinafter referred to as the host; the person searching for accommodation is referred to as the guest. The term “user” applies to both the host and the guest.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph_body">
<span class="number">3.3</span>
<p>One explicitly makes reference to the fact that 9flats does not offer any accommodation and is not a contracting partner to contracts which have solely been concluded between the users (guest and host). During the course of contract negotiations between guest and host, 9flats does not submit any declarations of intent.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph_body">
<span class="number">3.4</span>
<p>9flats undertakes to provide services in a reliable and straightforward manner pursuant to Clause 8 (and/or 9) of this contract; 9flats acquires the claim from the host for the accommodation price directly after its incurrence and asserts this claim in its own name and for its own account towards the guest (cf. Clause 8).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph_body">
<span class="number">3.5</span>
<p>9flats offers each user the option of using the online platform both as a host and as a guest.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph_body">
<span class="number">3.6</span>
<p>9flats offers users the technical possibility for them to publish content in word and images on the website themselves (descriptions of accommodation, ratings, etc., cf. Clause 3.13 and 4.1).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph_body">
<span class="number">3.7</span>
<p>9flats communicates binding booking enquiries via the online platform from guests to the hosts.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph_body">
<span class="number">3.8</span>
<p>9flats communicates the acceptance of a binding booking enquiry from the host to the guest; subsequently the guest and host have concluded a valid contract with one another regarding the usage of the accommodation. In this case, 9flats sends an e-mail to host and guest in which the information provided by the contracting partners such as type of accommodation, length of stay and the prices are once again listed. It is not until this e-mail that further contact details of the contracting partners stored on the online platform are exchanged between the host and guest.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph_body">
<span class="number">3.9</span>
<p>9flats offers some hosts the option of receiving direct bookings from guests. In this case, the booking of the accommodation is already legally binding with the receipt of the binding booking enquiry by the host. Direct bookings are clearly marked as such.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph_body">
<span class="number">3.10</span>
<p>9flats offers the users the option of creating a comprehensive personal profile. This, however, is not necessary. The online platform can be used solely under one first name in the public area. Pursuant to Clause 3.9, (other) personal data are only exchanged between guest and host of 9flats only if a binding booking has been concluded between these parties.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph_body">
<span class="number">3.11</span>
<p>In addition, 9flats offers the user a “credit account” which can be topped up with so called “credits” resulting from certain activities such as suggested friends registering, writing of a first rating for an accommodation or similar actions. These credits cannot be paid out, but they can be used for platform-internal payments of a booking via 9flats. The precise conditions how and for what value the credit account can be topped up, which are part of these General Terms and Conditions of Business, can be found <a href="http://www.9flats.com/credits">here</a> .</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph_body">
<span class="number">3.12</span>
<p>In addition, 9flats offers users within the online platform a messaging system where they can communicate with one another like for instance in order to clarify any uncertainties in the run-up to booking queries, without being able to exchange the real contact details.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph_body">
<span class="number">3.13</span>
<p>9flats also offers users a rating system on the online platform with which the users can rate each other. The provisions for the usage of this rating system are outlined under Clauses 11 and 12.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph_body">
<span class="number">3.14</span>
<p>9flats offers hosts and guests an insurance. The 9flats.com insurance refers to the obligation pursuant to certain conditions to provide compensation for damage caused to the inventory of the rented accommodation. Detailed information can be found <a href="http://media.9flats.com/about/terms-and-conditions-insurance_EN.pdf">here</a> .</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph_body">
<span class="number">3.15</span>
<p>The services of 9flats will be offered to the users subject to particular conditions. 9flats will make every effort to ensure that the services are accessible at all times. The usage options can be restricted or temporarily interrupted through maintenance work, further development or disruptions. As far as possible 9flats will inform users in good time of disruptions as those referred to as above.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph_head">
<span class="number">4</span>
<p>Special services provided to the host by 9flats<br>
(listing of accommodation, cancellation policies, processing transactions, optional insurance cover)</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph_body">
<span class="number">4.1</span>
<p>9flats offers hosts the opportunity to place their accommodation on the online platform with a description, photos, videos, price(s), availability calendar and a personal user profile (accommodation profile).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph_body">
<span class="number">4.2</span>
<p>9flats offers hosts the option of entering the accommodation at different prices (currently referred to as “General price” or “Seasonal price”) for certain periods and to indicate and charge additional fees such as, for instance, cleaning charges, fees for the use of a washing machine, etc.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph_body">
<span class="number">4.3</span>
<p>9flats offers the host the option of setting cancellation conditions for their guests. The host may agree upon the cancellation policy with guests individually. However, 9flats also provides three different cancellation policies for guests (flexible, semi-flexible, strict) that hosts may elect to offer their guests. These “Cancellation Policies for Guests” can be consulted <a href="http://about.9flats.com/cancellation-policies">here</a>. Apart from that the agreement reached between the guest and host can only be rescinded if both parties agree to this rescission and the consent is declared at least in text form by corresponding e-mails.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph_body">
<span class="number">4.4</span>
<p>The listing of accommodation by the host does not constitute a legally binding offer. It merely gives guests the opportunity for them to make a legally binding offer. Only after an offer has been accepted by the host has a contract been concluded. This also applies to <a href="https://nineflats.zendesk.com/hc/en-gb/sections/200135387-Handling-instant-bookings">‘instant bookings’</a>.</p>
<p>All booking requests (binding offers) made by the guest are forwarded to the host by 9flats. However, booking requests will be automatically deleted from the host’s system in the event another host accepts a guest’s booking request beforehand. Once a host accepts a guest’s booking request, all other booking requests are deemed invalid. In this respect the booking request is only insofar as binding until one of the requested hosts accepts.</p>
<p>Booking requests that are not accepted by a host within 24 working hours shall be declined automatically by the system.  The host has to reply to a booking request within 24 hours or else it is automatically rejected by the system. When a host accepts a booking request, both the guest and the host each receive a confirmation-email.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph_body">
<span class="number">4.5</span>
<p>9flats also allows the host to cancel the booking; the details of this are regulated in the following paragraphs.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph_body">
<span class="number">4.5.1</span>
<p>When a Host cancel a confirmed booking, 9flats may apply penalties or consequences to him or his listing, including publishing an automated review on his listing indicating that a reservation was cancelled, keeping the calendar for the listing unavailable or blocked for the dates of the cancelled booking. A cancellation fee is always imposed. In case the fee will be not paid as requested, it will be withheld from host future payouts.<br>
The cancellation is possible by way of the “Cancel booking” button.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph_body">
<span class="number">4.5.2</span>
<p>A prompt detailing the consequences of the cancellation appears and the host has to declare that he agrees with the cancellation conditions by opting in.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph_body">
<span class="number">4.5.3</span>
<p>By clicking the button “Cancel now”, the cancellation is effected.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph_body">
<span class="number">4.5.4</span>
<p>The host has to pay a cancellation fee of 15% of the total price, but no less than <span class="caps">EUR</span> 50.00, to 9flats for every cancellation. The host will be explicitly reminded of this cancellation fee during the cancellation process.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph_body">
<span class="number">4.5.5</span>
<p>The duty of the host to fulfill any potential claims for damages from guests is not affected.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph_body">
<span class="number">4.5.6</span>
<p>In particular, the host undertakes to cover the price difference in case the guest cannot find accommodation of acceptable value for the booking period and has to switch to a more expensive accommodation or a hotel room. If the price of the alternative accommodation or the hotel room exceeds the total price of the cancelled accommodation by more than 25%, the guest needs to furnish prima facie evidence that a stay at a less expensive alternative was impossible.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph_body">
<span class="number">4.5.7</span>
<p>The host cannot claim an asking price as stipulated in paragraph 8.3.1 for the cancelled booking.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph_body">
<span class="number">4.5.8</span>
<p>9flats will lock the calendar of the accommodation for the period of the cancelled booking to prevent booking requests and possible further cancellations resulting from it.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph_body">
<span class="number">4.5.9</span>
<p>If the guest does not encounter the host on the day of arrival at the agreed upon time and place and the host cannot be reached within an acceptable period of time, this shall also be deemed a cancellation by the host.</p>

<p>Payment handling (remuneration, purchase of accounts receivable, payment flow)</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph_body">
<span class="number">8.1</span>
<p>With the acceptance of the binding booking enquiry or in the event of a direct booking with the receipt of the booking by the host, an effective contract is concluded between the host and guest regarding the host’s obligation to make an accommodation available for the guest’s use for a certain period of time and the guest’s obligation to pay a certain fee to the host for this. The payable amount results from the price agreed between the host and guest for the usage of the accommodation (accommodation price), and any other remuneration agreed such as cleaning fees or fees for washing machines, which is indicated in the accommodation profile.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph_body">
<span class="number">8.2</span>
<p>With the conclusion of the binding contract, the host is entitled to claim the accommodation price from the guest (receivable); the receivable becomes due immediately.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph_body">
<span class="number">8.3</span>
<p>Host and 9flats agree that the host in pursuant to 8.1 and 8.2 sells the created receivable following its conclusion to 9flats and by means of assignment transfers it to the latter.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph_body">
<span class="number">8.3.1</span>
<p>9flats undertakes to pay to the host as the purchase price for the receivable the amount of the accommodation price minus a commission (receivable price). The commission is normally 15% of the accommodation price; 9flats, however, reserves the right to change this commission at times in favour of the host as part of special promotions and discounts. The host will be informed about possible aforementioned discounts and special promotions on the online platform via the user account and where necessary, also informed by e-mail.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph_body">
<span class="number">8.3.2</span>
<p>The parties are in agreement that the receivable will not become due until 24 hours after the first working day after the guest has checked into the accommodation. For bookings of more than 10 days 9flats is entitled to pay the receivable price in reasonable instalments.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph_body">
<span class="number">8.4</span>
<p>The guest undertakes to immediately settle the due receivable with 9flats or to make it possible for 9flats to collect the receivable.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph_body">
<span class="number">8.5</span>
<p>9flats shall collect the receivable in its own name and for its own account.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph_body">
<span class="number">8.6</span>
<p>9flats shall bears the risk of the uncollectibility of the receivable from the guest. 9flats must in case of doubt commence legal proceedings to enforce the claim against the guest.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph_body">
<span class="number">8.7</span>
<p>If, however, it is recognised in the court proceedings between 9flats and the guest that the assigned receivable (accommodation price) did not exist with regard to its merits or amount, 9flats can also claim the difference between the original amount of the receivable and the amount of the receivable recognised in court from the host as damages, as well as the court and lawyer costs necessary to gain the right in this case. Ultimately, it is the responsibility of the host to ensure that the assigned receivable exists in the scope envisaged pursuant to the original contract for the purchase of receivables pursuant to Clause 8.3.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph_body">
<span class="number">8.8</span>
<p>The host undertakes to truthfully and completely provide 9flats with all required information that is necessary to commence legal proceedings in order to make a claim against the guest. 9flats reserves the right to involve the host in the legal proceedings within the scope of possibilities offered by  the Code of Civil Procedure.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph_body">
<span class="number">8.9</span>
<p>In the event of a non-redemption or objection of a direct debit, the user (guest or host) irrevocably gives permission to the bank to release their full name and address at the request of 9flats <span class="caps">PTE</span>. Ltd.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph_body">
<span class="number">8.9.1</span>
<p>In case a bank transfer is returned which the guest is at fault for or a respective failed credit card booking (because of a lack of sufficient funds) then 9flats will burden the guest with the costs for the charge back in form of the actually calculated fees of the respective financial institute. The guest is though free to prove that 9flats has suffered no or a much smaller damage. As long as no complete payment has been received within 10 days after receipt of the booking confirmation then 9flats is in no way obliged to maintain the existing booking, meaning that the booking will be cancelled according to the cancellation policies at the expense of the guest. In any case the guest is obliged to pay the agreed amounts for the booked services. Part payments are not permitted.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph_body">
<span class="number">8.10</span>
<p>9flats reserves the right to additionally bill the guest for an appropriate extent for any administrative costs which might be incurred if the guest chooses the payment options credit card, debit card or PayPal.

All other payment options offered by 9flats are free of charge for the guest.</p>

<p>Payment handling in the event of cancellation and complaint</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph_body">
<span class="number">9.1</span>
<p>In the event of a cancellation, the guest and host have rescinded the agreement regarding the accommodation. Depending on the beforehand agreed cancellation conditions this means that the host’s entitlement to payment of the accommodation price has lapsed in part or completely.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph_body">
<span class="number">9.1.1</span>
<p>The guest is also able to exercise this objection against 9flats as new creditor of the claim. 9flats is subsequently obliged to reimburse the guest the respective cancellation amount pursuant to the cancellation conditions agreed upon between the guest and host.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph_body">
<span class="number">9.1.2</span>
<p>As a consequence of the cancellation the entitlement to the receivable assigned to 9flats (paid booking sum on conclusion of the booking) does not exist in the scope as had been presumed under the original receivable purchase contract pursuant to Clause 8.3. In any case a processing fee pursuant to Clause 9.1.3 which amounts to 15% is due for the cancellation and subsequently retained by 9flats. The refund for the guest (minus the stated processing fee) and the payment amount to the host depends on the cancellation conditions that apply to the booking.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph_body">
<span class="number">9.1.3</span>
<p>Pursuant to the cancellation conditions for every type of cancellation made by a guest a processing fee amounting to 15% of the originally agreed accommodation price has to be paid by them.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph_body">
<span class="number">9.1.4</span>
<p>Should the host want to cancel a confirmed booking and 9flats after due diligence come to the conclusion that this booking is objectively impossible and the host is responsible for the impossibility then 9flats will accept the host’s cancellation. Pursuant to the cancellation conditions the guest is fully refunded all incurred costs. For hosts specific provisions apply which can be viewed in the cancellation conditions. In this case both guest and host declare this contract to be dissolved.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph_body">
<span class="number">9.2</span>
<p>In case of a cancellation by the host, the full amount agreed upon for the booking and paid in advance is reimbursed. For the host, paragraph 4.5 applies.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph_body">
<span class="number">9.3</span>
<p>If the guest should submit a complaint to 9flats pursuant to Clause 5.3 at least in text form within 24 hours after check-in claiming that there are defects in the accommodation then 9flats will check these objections. 9flats will attempt to bring about an amicable solution.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph_body">
<span class="number">9.3.1</span>
<p>The parties are in agreement that with an amicable solution pursuant to Clause 5.4 the price of the accommodation can be subsequently reduced.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph_body">
<span class="number">9.3.2</span>
<p>The parties are in agreement that with an amicable price reduction the assigned receivable is regarded as not existing in its full amount as it had been initially.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph_body">
<span class="number">9.3.3</span>
<p>The parties are in agreement that, in the event of an amicable solution and price reduction, 9flats will pay the guest the difference between the original accommodation price and the subsequent determined price by the guest and host from the resulting established defect.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph_body">
<span class="number">9.3.4</span>
<p>The parties are in agreement that the host will pay the part of the claim that has expired as a result of the amicable reduction in price (difference amount pursuant to Clause 9.2.3) as compensation to 9flats.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph_body">
<span class="number">9.3.5</span>
<p>If no amicable solution can be found within two weeks after the guest has checked out, 9flats commence legal proceedings in order to claim the full amount. The host’s obligation to co-operate pursuant to Clause 8.8 applies accordingly.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph_body">
<span class="number">9.4</span>
<p>Should it not be possible to find an amicable solution within 14 days then 9flats takes a decision based on the information that is available to them. 9flats is obliged to equally consider the interests of both parties. The parties undertake to accept this decision.</p>

<p>Cases of suspected fraud</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph_body">
<span class="number">10.1</span>
<p>9flats reserves the right to evaluate exchanged messages between the guest and host to the effect whether the host and guest are collusively cooperating to the detriment of 9flats by jointly concluding contracts for the use of accommodation without actually having any intention to use the accommodation but more to fraudulently act against 9flats or to possibly commit a criminal offence in accordance with the criminal code. Should this suspicion be substantiated through the evaluation then the entire communication of the concerned guest or host will be analysed. In this respect the guest and host consent to the use of the personal data for the stated purposes. In both cases the evaluations are only used to prevent fraud as well as if necessary for criminal prosecution and with the ending of the purpose immediately deleted. Furthermore all parties of this contract agree that the sold receivable does not exist until then and the agreed purchase price (accommodation price on conclusion of the booking minus commission) subsequently not paid to the host until the guest and/or host has been exonerated in respect to the suspicion of fraud.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph_body">
<span class="number">10.2</span>
<p>In cases of substantiated suspicion, 9flats reserves the right to report the suspected persons to the police or the state prosecutor.</p>

<span class="number">10.4</span>
<p>In cases of bookings paid with stolen credit card, 9flats reserves the right to cancel the booking at anytime before the supposed check-in.

<p class="paragraph_head">2. Scope of the data collection and storage</p>
<p class="paragraph_body">As a fundamental principle, it is not necessary for you to enter personal details to use our online platform 9flats.com<br>
If you, however, would like to use our service, you have to register with us and at least provide the following personal details:<br>
- your first and last name,<br>
- your e-mail address,<br>
- your town or city (place of the accommodation that you are offering)<br>
Please read our further information under Clause 6 if you register with the Facebook sign-up.<br>
If you actively use our platform by entering accommodation on it, we require the following additional data from you to handle the transaction:<br>
- your PayPal account number or your bank details (account holder, account no. and sort code),<br>
- your complete invoice address including any <span class="caps">VAT</span> ID no. in order to be able to involve you for our service.<br>
If you actively use our platform by booking accommodation on it, we require the following additional data from you to handle the transaction:<br>
- your credit card details or your bank account information if you cannot or do not want to pay by PayPal.<br>
The aforementioned information, with the exception of your first name, is not all made public on the platform. The contact details (e-mail address and if applicable telephone number) of you as a guest and/or host are not exchanged between guest and host until after conclusion of a binding booking or if the guest and host have networked with each other via the 9flats.com friendship function. Beforehand, you can communicate with the guest and/or host via the platform-internal messaging system.<br>
9flats.com reserves the right to randomly evaluate exchanged messages between the guest and host to the effect whether the host and guest are collusively cooperating to the detriment of 9flats.com by jointly concluding contracts for the use of accommodation without actually having any intention to use the accommodation but more to fraudulently act against 9flats.com or to possibly commit a criminal offence in accordance with the criminal code. Should this suspicion be substantiated through the random evaluation then the entire communication of the concerned guest or host will be analyzed. In this respect the guest and host consent to the use of the personal data for the stated purposes. In both cases the evaluations are only used to prevent fraud as well as if necessary for criminal prosecution and with the ending of the purpose immediately deleted.<br>
Your bank, credit or PayPal data are not of course forwarded to the guest or the host.<br>
In addition, you can supplement your profile with further personal details such as your telephone number, your professional situation, your Twitter account, your Facebook account, your date of birth and a few key words about yourself and a photo of yourself. You provide these data on a voluntary basis so that your guests or hosts can get a better picture of you, but you do not have to provide them. The only mandatory information that must be made public at all times is your first name.<br>
In addition, you can use our platform by making friends with other users, for instance. We also save these connection data to enable us to assess the usage and success rates of our features. We would be pleased to also publish these connections but we will only do so if you explicitly consent to this.<br>

We would also be pleased to publish your thus visible Facebook links or your other publicly accessible data (such as e.g. your hobbies or the university that you attended) in order to make 9flats.com more interactive and more communicative for you. However, we will only publish these data if you give us your explicit consent to do so.</p>

At any time you are able to object to the mailing of such emails by clicking on the unsubscribe button within the email or via the settings in your member account. Your personal data is not passed on to third parties without express consent as far as it is not necessary in order to render services or perform contractual obligations. Furthermore, the transmission to authorized state institutions only is done within the scope of statutory duty of disclosure or if a judgment obliges a disclosure.</p>
<p class="paragraph_head">3.1 Server log files</p>
<p class="paragraph_body">The website provider automatically collects and stores information that your browser automatically transmits to us in “server log files”. These are:<br>
Browser type and browser version Operating system used<br>
Referrer <span class="caps">URL</span><br>
Host name of the accessing computer Time of the server request<br>
IP address<br>
These data will not be combined with data from other sources.<br>
The basis for data processing is Art. 6 (1) (f) <span class="caps">GDPR</span>, which allows the processing of data to fulfill a contract or for measures preliminary to a contract.<br>
Contact form<br>
Should you send us questions via the contact form, we will collect the data entered on the form, including the contact details you provide, to answer your question and any follow-up questions. We do not share this information without your permission.<br>
We will, therefore, process any data you enter onto the contact form only with your consent per Art. 6 (1)(a) <span class="caps">GDPR</span>. You may revoke your consent at any time. An informal email making this request is sufficient. The data processed before we receive your request may still be legally processed.<br>
We will retain the data you provide on the contact form until you request its deletion, revoke your consent for its storage, or the purpose for its storage no longer pertains (e.g. after fulfilling your request). Any mandatory statutory provisions, especially those regarding mandatory data retention periods, remain unaffected by this provision.</p>
<p class="paragraph_head">3.2 Leaving comments on this website</p>
<p class="paragraph_body">If you use the comment function on this site, the time at which you created the comment and your email address will be stored along with your comment, as well as your username, unless you are posting anonymously.<br>

Legal basis<br>
The comments are stored based on your consent per Art. 6 (1) (a) <span class="caps">GDPR</span>. You may revoke your consent at any time with future effect. An informal email making this request is sufficient. The data processed before we receive your request may still be legally processed.</p>
<p class="paragraph_head">4. Cookies, usage profiles</p>
<p class="paragraph_body">In addition, we also use cookies. Cookies are small text files that can store a website such as ours on the computer of a website visitor, i.e. locally. With the help of this text file, the web server can save, for instance, preferences and settings on the user’s computer which are then automatically restored on the next visit. Or to put it another way, the cookies are used, among other things, to make the use of the site more user-friendly so that, for instance, you do not have to complete the full log-in mask when you visit again.<br>
We use both persistent cookies and session cookies. Whereas persistent cookies remain on your computer for a longer period of time, session cookies are automatically deleted when the browser window is closed.<br>
Using cookies, data are also collected and saved on this website from which pseudonymized usage profiles are created. The data is data such as the IP address, the browser type, the software used, that website previously called up by you (referrer <span class="caps">URL</span>), time and duration of the visit to a website. Incidentally, the IP address is immediately made unrecognizable by us; we can then still compare whether different users have the same IP address (we need this information to be able to prevent any misuse and fraud) but can no longer discern the origins of the address.<br>
These usage profiles are used to analyze visitor behavior and are analyzed to design and improve the offering in line with requirements. The pseudonymized usage profiles are not merged with the personal data via the carrier of the pseudonym without the express consent of the person affected which must be given separately.<br>
Cookies are also used to enable us to carry out our Premium partner program. Further information on the Premium Partner program can be found here; information on the tracking in this regard and on cookies can be found in particular in Clause 4.4.<br>
You can prevent the installation of the cookies by preventing the installation of the cookies with a corresponding setting in your browser software ("private mode – can be found under Settings with most browsers); however, it should be pointed out that in this case you may not be able to use all functions of this website.<br>
In addition, you can delete cookies that have already been set (also to be found under “Settings” in the browser).</p>
<p class="paragraph_head">5. Google Analytics</p>
<p class="paragraph_body">We also use Google Analytics, a web analysis service of Google Inc. (in future: Google) on this website. Google Analytics is a web analysis tool with the help of which we analyse the interaction of the visitors with our website and thus are able to improve our website for you further. Google Analytics also uses cookies, as they were in principle described in more detail under Clause 4. The information generated by the cookie regarding your use of this website are usually transferred to a server belonging to Google in the US and stored there. Google Analytics cookies are stored based on Art. 6 (1) (f) <span class="caps">GDPR</span>. The website operator has a legitimate interest in analyzing user behavior to optimize both its website and its advertising. The information saved by the cookies includes, for instance, the time of the website visit, the frequency with which the visitor has called up the website, and from where the visitor has accessed the website. To determine the latter value, Google initially records the IP address of the user. However, we have activated the IP anonymisation on our website. Based on this, your IP address within Member States of the European Union or in other signatory states of the Treaty on the European Economic Area is shortened by Google before transmission to the US. Only in exceptional cases is the full IP address transferred to a server belonging to Google in the US and shortened there. On behalf of 9flats.com, Google will use the aforementioned information to analyse your usage of the website, to compile reports on the website activities and to provide further services associated with the usage of the website and the Internet towards the website operator. The IP address communicated under Google Analytics by your browser is not merged with other data of Google.<br>
You can prevent the saving of the cookies by Google Analytics by a corresponding setting in your browser software; however, reference should again be made to the fact that in this case you may not be able to use all functions of this website.<br>
In addition, you can prevent the recording of the data generated by the cookie and relating to your usage of the website (incl. your IP address) to Google and the processing of these data by Google, by downloading and installing the browser plug-in available under the following link: <a href="http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=de">http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=de</a>]<br>
Further information on data protection with regard to Google Analytics can be found directly here at Google.</p>
<p class="paragraph_head">6. Facebook</p>
<p class="paragraph_body">Our website uses the sign-up and log-in function and social plug-ins of the social network facebook.com, which is operated by Facebook Inc., 1 Hacker Way, Menlo Park, California 94025, <span class="caps">USA</span>.  If you have your normal place of residence in the European Union, the Facebook services are offered to you by Facebook Ireland Limited, Hanover Reach, 5-7 Hanover Quay, Dublin 2 Ireland. The social plug-ins are discernible by the Facebook logos (white “f” on blue background or the characteristic Facebook thumb) or marked by the addition “Facebook Social Plug-In”; all Facebook plug-ins can be viewed here. The sign-up and/or log-in of Facebook is also easy to recognize by the characteristic white script on a blue background.</p>
<p class="paragraph_head">6.1 Social Plug-ins</p>
<p class="paragraph_body">When you call up a website of ours on which a social plug-in (like button) is implemented, your browser will then establish a direct link to Facebook and will then transmit the following data to Facebook directly:<br>
1. date and time of your visit,<br>
2. the Internet address/<span class="caps">URL</span> of the site that you are currently visiting,<br>
3. your IP address,<br>
4. your browser,<br>
5. your operating system,<br>
6. your user code if you are a registered user of Facebook and if applicable your surname and first name and<br>
7. if you click on the plug-in, of course the information that you have used this specific plug-in.<br>
8. the data can only be transmitted to the Facebook profile when the user is logged in to Facebook<br>
9. logging out of Facebook prevents the transmission of these data to the Facebook profile<br>
Facebook saves these data for a period of 90 days. Facebook then removes the name and all other personal information from the data; a pseudonymized usage profile remains.<br>
We explicitly make reference to the fact that we ourselves do not have any influence on the scope of the data which Facebook collects with the help of the plug-in and that with regard to data protection we have to rely on the data usage guideline of Facebook, on which our aforementioned information is based. Please inform yourself further on Facebook specifically about the purpose and scope of the data collection and your rights in this regard and the setting options to protect your privacy using the data usage guidelines.<br>
However, it is of course possible to prevent the placing of cookies by settings in your browser. In addition, it is also possible to block the social plug-ins of Facebook with add-ons for your browser. For instance with the “Facebook Blocker”</p>
<p class="paragraph_head">7. Newsletter</p>
<p class="paragraph_head">Newsletter data</p>
<p class="paragraph_body">If you would like to receive our newsletter, we require a valid email address as well as information that allows us to verify that you are the owner of the specified email address and that you agree to receive this newsletter. No additional data is collected or is only collected on a voluntary basis. We only use this data to send the requested information and do not pass it on to third parties.<br>
We will, therefore, process any data you enter onto the contact form only with your consent per Art. 6 (1) (a) <span class="caps">GDPR</span>. You can revoke consent to the storage of your data and email address as well as their use for sending the newsletter at any time, e.g. through the “unsubscribe” link in the newsletter. The data processed before we receive your request may still be legally processed.<br>
The data provided when registering for the newsletter will be used to distribute the newsletter until you cancel your subscription when said data will be deleted. Data we have stored for other purposes (e.g. email addresses for the members area) remain unaffected.</p>
