		<h3 id="privacy">Privacy Policy - Effective February 2007</h3>

		<p>9rules values your privacy and this document will help you understand the information that is collected when you use 9rules and make informed decisions when using the site.</p>

		<h3>The Information We Collect</h3>

		<p>When you browse 9rules, a cookie is placed on your computer unless you have this feature disabled in your browser. A cookie is a small data file that sites write to your hard drive when you visit them. A cookie file can contain information such as a user ID that grants you access to areas of the site, but the only personal information a cookie can contain is information you supply yourself. A cookie can't read data off your hard disk or read cookie files created by other sites. 9rules uses cookies to track user traffic patterns and to allow you to access areas of the 9rules site that require login information.</p>

		<p>While browsing 9rules the following general non-identifying information is collected automatically (this happens when you visit any site): your IP address, the browser you are using, the pages you viewed, the date you viewed them and possibly the referrer (if you visit the 9rules site by clicking on a link from another site, like Google, this information is called referrer information. The site you previously visited).</p>

		<h3>How We Use The Information</h3>

		<p>We use non-identifying and aggregate information to better design our site and to share with advertisers. For example, we may tell an advertiser that X number of individuals visited a certain area on our site, or that Y number of men and Z number of women filled out our registration form, but 9rules will not disclose anything that could be used to identify those individuals.</p>

		<p>We never use or share the personally identifiable information provided to us online in ways unrelated to the ones described above without also providing you an opportunity to opt-out or otherwise prohibit such unrelated uses.</p>

		<h3>Security</h3>

		<p>To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the correct use of information, we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online.</p>

		<h3>Accessing or Correcting Information</h3>

		<p>You can access all your personally identifiable information that you submitted to us via your my.9rules profile page. In this area you can view and edit this information at any time.</p>
