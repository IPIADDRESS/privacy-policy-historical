<h4 id="information-security">9.	How does dunnhumby keep my information secure?</h4>
<br>

<p>9.1	We use appropriate technical and organisational measures to protect the information that we collect and process about you.  The measures we use are designed to provide a level of security appropriate to the risk of processing your information.  Access to your personal information is restricted to prevent unauthorised access, modification or misuse and is only permitted among our employees on a need-to-know basis.</p>

<h4 id="international-data-transfers">10.	International data transfers</h4>
<br>
<p>10.1	Our servers are located in the United States and our group companies and third party service providers and partners operate around the world.  </p>
<p>10.2	As a result, your information may be transferred to, and processed in, countries other than the country in which you are resident.  These countries may have data protection and privacy laws that are different to the laws of your country and, in some cases, may not be as protective.</p>
<p>10.3	However, we have taken appropriate safeguards to require that your information will remain protected in accordance with this Privacy Notice. These include implementing the European Commission's Standard Contractual Clauses for transfers of information between our group companies, which require all group companies to protect information they process from the EEA in accordance with European Union data protection and privacy law.  </p>
<p>10.4	Our Standard Contractual Clauses can be provided on request.  We have implemented similar appropriate safeguards with our third party service providers and partners and further details can be provided upon request.</p>

<h4 id="data-retention">11.	Data retention</h4>
<br>
<p>11.1	We normally retain the information we collect from you until you cease your membership of the BzzAgent community. We will also redact your information if you have not logged into your account for two years.</p>
<p>11.2	We may however keep your information for longer if we have an ongoing legitimate business need to do so (for example, to comply with applicable legal, tax or accounting requirements).  When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your information, we will either delete or anonymise it or, if this is not possible (for example, because your information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.</p>

<h4 id="children">12.	Children</h4>
<br>

<p>12.1	We do not knowingly collect personal information about children under 18 years of age without permission from their parent or legal guardian.
