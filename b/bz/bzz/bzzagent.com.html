<p>The short, understandable version is this:</p> 

<ul class="bullet">
	<li>BzzAgent will not sell or share your information with any party at any time without your direct approval.</li>
	<li>By signing up to be a BzzAgent, you are opting-in to receive information about new BzzCampaigns and feedback about your activities from us via e-mail. We won't send you a lot of e-mail, don't worry.</li>
	<li>If you choose to opt-in to a campaign, you are allowing us to share the results of your actions with our clients. (Just so you know, our clients are interested in the Bzz you create, not your "personal information").</li>
	<li>You need to be at least 13 years old if you want to register to use this site.</li>
</ul>

<div id="legal" class="boxed ui-tabs-panel ui-tabs-hide">

<p>Here's That Long, Legal Version:</p>

<h3>BzzAgent Privacy Policy</h3>

<p>We will closely guard any personally identifiable information you disclose to us during registration or at any other point during your BzzAgent experience. Information will only be shared with a third party if a member requests for that information to be shared, by participating in an offer/program/opt-in/opt-out. A member may request that this information be shared, by opting-in to programs or newsletters that may require information such as, but not be limited to, first name, last name, occupation, e-mail address, mailing address, phone number, selected interests or date of birth. Not all offers/programs/opt-ins/opt-outs specify exactly which pieces of information will be shared. By joining BzzAgent, you are able to opt-in to receive mail from BzzAgent. </p>

<h3>Information Collection &amp; Use</h3>

<p>When you visit BzzAgent, you provide us with two types of information: personally identifiable information, which you choose to disclose that is collected by us ("PII"), and non personal information, which you either submit as content to the site and use information collected by us as you interact with our website. We will not sell, share, or rent any information to others in ways different from what is disclosed in this statement without your permission. BzzAgent, Inc. collects information from our users at several different points on our website. BzzAgent may use cookies (as described below) and similar tools to customize the content you receive based on the information you have provided. BzzAgent, Inc. may share non- personally identifiable information with its clients and business partners, but no such information can be linked directly to you or your account. Furthermore, we may need to disclose PII when required by law.</p>

<p>BzzAgent employees, and contractors must have a business reason to obtain access to your PII. We may share your PII with those who help us manage or provide our services (for example, order fulfillment, statistical analyses, data processing and to comply with unsubscribed lists), or with outside contractors, agents or clients who help us with the administration of such services. These third parties may temporarily store some information on their servers, but they may only use your PII for the specific purpose and no other. We may also provide your PII to a third party in those instances where you have chosen to receive certain information and have been notified that the fulfillment of such a request requires the sharing of your PII. </p>

<p>You and other users may post Submitted Content (as defined in the BzzAgent Terms of Use) and view the Submitted Content of others. You consent to such viewing of your Submitted Content and agree that any Submitted Content posted by you on the website is at your own risk. Although in certain areas we allow you to set privacy options that limit access to your pages, please be aware that no security measures are perfect or impenetrable. We cannot control the actions of other users with whom you may choose to share your pages and information. Therefore, we cannot and do not guarantee that the Submitted Content will not be viewed by unauthorized persons. We are not responsible for circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures contained on the website. You understand and acknowledge that, even after removal, copies of Submitted Content may remain viewable in cached and archived pages or if other users have copied or stored your Submitted Content. Any improper collection or misuse of information provided on the website is a violation of the BzzAgent Terms of Use and should be reported by e-mail to <a href="mailto:abuse@bzzagent.com">abuse@bzzagent.com</a></p>

<p>If you choose to tell someone about our website through tools provided on the site, we will ask you for information needed to send the invitation, such as that person's email address. We will send the invitee an email or instant message in your name inviting him or her to visit the site, and may send follow-on reminders to them. BzzAgent stores this information to send invitations and reminders, to register a third party connection if your invitation is accepted, to allow you to see invitations you have sent, and to track the success of our referral program. Your invitee may contact us through the form on our help page to request that we remove this information from our database.</p>

<h3>Registration</h3>

<p>In order to use this website, a user must first complete the registration form. During registration a user is required to give their contact information (such as name, e-mail address, and postal address), additional psychographic information, and information needed for shipping campaign materials. This information is used to notify the user about new campaigns, specific campaign directives and changes in point offerings. Users are also required to provide and verify a valid e-mail address before the account creation process can be completed. In addition, we ask a user to provide legitimate proof of address. Proof of address is required in order to guard BzzAgent, Inc. from fraudulent activities. This information is also used for shipping purposes. If we have trouble processing any item to be shipped to you, this contact information may be utilized to contact a user.</p>

<h3>Account</h3>

<p>Once you become a member of BzzAgent, Inc., you will receive a password and an account. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your password and account. Furthermore, you are entirely responsible for any and all activities that occur under your account. You agree to immediately notify BzzAgent, Inc. of any unauthorized use of your account or any other breach of security known to the member.</p>

<h3>Our Cookies</h3>

<p>A cookie is a piece of data we store for each user session that gives you a unique ID number for that session. We use cookies to allow us to personalize your experience on the BzzAgent website. Usage of a cookie is not linked to any personally identifiable information while on our site. Once you end your session, the cookie simply terminates. We use cookies on our site so that you can move from page to page while staying logged into your account. If a user rejects the cookie, they may still use our site, and we will set each link to contain the user's unique id number for your current session.</p>

<h3>Log Files</h3>

<p>We do track certain information such as type of browser and log on time for our own use. We use this information only to track where our users may be coming from and what type of software they are using. We keep this information so we can continuously improve our users' online experience and improve the BzzAgent website. None of this information can ever be traced back to any specific person and is useful only to BzzAgent, Inc.</p>

<h3>Security</h3>

<p>We work to protect your information by using Secure Socket Layers (SSL) software to encrypt your information when it is being transmitted to us. Access to data is limited through the use of internal firewalls and strictly enforced. When users submit information via the website, your information is protected both online and off-line. While we use both passwords and usernames to protect information online, we also do everything in our power to protect users' information off-line. All of our users' information is restricted in our offices. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job are granted access to personally identifiable information. Finally, the servers that we store personally identifiable information on are kept in a secure environment and professionally maintained. You are solely responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your passwords and/or any account information. Please be careful and responsible whenever you're online.</p>

<h3>Special Offers &amp; E-mail</h3>

<p>We send all new members a welcoming e-mail to verify password and username. Established members will occasionally receive e-mails containing information regarding new campaigns, updates, and directives from BzzAgent, Inc. if they have opted-in. "Opted-in" means the user has approved certain e-mails to be sent to them from BzzAgent, Inc.</p>

<h3>Other Sites</h3>

<p>Our website may include links to websites operated by other companies. We may also run campaigns or provide offers from other companies. BzzAgent is not responsible for the privacy practices of websites or other services operated by third parties that are linked to or integrated with our services or for the privacy practices of any third party. Once you leave our website via such a link, access a third party application (such as widgets) or click on a third party offer, you should check the applicable privacy policy of the third party or advertiser site to determine, among other things, how they will handle any PII they collect from you.</p>


<h3>Site &amp; Service Announcements</h3>

<p>Under rare circumstances BzzAgent, Inc. may need to contact specific or all users in order to make an important announcement about the BzzAgent site or service changes. Members are not able to unsubscribe, or "opt-in/opt-out" of these announcements because they may contain very important information regarding their accounts. Before these measures are taken, however, BzzAgent, Inc. will post information regarding changes directly on the website. BzzAgent, Inc. reserves the right to contact users to correct account errors or to supply important information BzzAgent deems relevant.</p>

<h3>Correction/Updating Personal Information</h3>

<p>You may change certain personal or profile information at any time. The fastest way to change personal information is to log on and simply click on "My Profile".</p>

<h3>Age/Residency Requirements</h3>

<p>Effective April 21, 2000, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) mandated that all websites must be in compliance with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA). While the BzzAgent site is not directed at children under the age thirteen (13), you must be at least 13 years old, be a United States or Canadian resident, and have a valid e-mail address to enroll in the BzzAgent, Inc. Program ("Program"). Enrollment and participation in the Program is open to individuals only (no corporations or other legal entities). Each individual who enrolls in the Program is responsible for providing this information requested herein and for updating any such information to insure its accuracy. Receipt of inaccurate or misleading information will adversely affect the ability of BzzAgent, Inc. to operate the Program and provide services to clients required by members and participants. In this regard, BzzAgent, Inc. reserves the right to terminate a member's membership in the Program if misleading or intentionally incorrect personal information is provided. BzzAgent, Inc. reserves the right to modify or discontinue the Program with or without notice to members. BzzAgent, Inc. will not be liable to any member or any third party should BzzAgent, Inc. exercise its right to modify or discontinue the Program.</p>

<h3>Termination</h3>
<p>Either the member or BzzAgent, Inc. may terminate the service with or without cause at any time and effective immediately. In such case, we will honor that request while retaining any record of your PII that is necessary to comply with applicable federal, state or local law. BzzAgent will not be liable to the member or any third party for termination of service.</p>
