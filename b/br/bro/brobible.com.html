<p><strong>Updated as of September 24, 2008</strong></p>

<p>
The BroBible Privacy Policy describes how BroBible and its subsidiaries treat personal
information when you use Google services, including information provided when you use
BroBible.
</p>


<h3>Personal Information</h3>

<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Account-Related  Activity.</strong>
        We ask for some personal information when you create a BroBible Account, including
        your email address, password and birthday, which is used to protect your account
        from unauthorized access.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Usage Information.</strong>
        We may record information about your usage, such as
        when you use BroBible,  the LockerRooms you join, the contacts you communicate with, the
        content you view, and the frequency and size of data transfers, as well as information
        you display or click on in BroBible (including UI elements, settings, and other information).
        If you are logged in, we may associate that information with your account.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Content Uploaded to Site.</strong>
        Any personal information or content that you voluntarily disclose online (to the
        Brommunity, in messages and LockerRooms, within Brofile pages, etc.) becomes publicly
        available and can be collected and used by others.
    </li>
</ul>


<h3>Uses</h3>

<ul>
    <li>
        If you submit personally identifiable information to us through the BroBible Website, we use
        your personal information to operate,  maintain, and provide to you the general and
        personalized features and functionality of the BroBible Site, and to process any flagging
        activity or correspondence you send to us.
    </li>
    <li>
        Your Bro Alias (not your email address) is displayed to other Users when  you upload content
        or send messages through the BroBible Site and other Users can contact you through messages
        and comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        We do not use your email address or other personally identifiable information to send
        commercial or marketing messages without your consent or except as part of a specific
        program or feature for which you will have the ability to opt-in or opt-out. We may, however,
        use your email address without further consent for non-marketing or administrative purposes
        (such as notifying you of major BroBible Website changes or for customer service purposes).
    </li>
    <li>
        We use both your personally identifiable information and certain non-personally-identifiable
        information (such as anonymous user  usage data, cookies, IP addresses, browser type,
        clickstream data,  etc.) to improve the quality and design of the BroBible Website and
        to create new features, promotions, functionality, and services by  storing, tracking,
        analyzing, and processing user preferences and trends, as well as user activity and
        communications.
    </li>
    <li>
        We use cookies, clear gifs, and log file information to: (a) store  information so that
        you will not have to re-enter it during your visit or the next time you visit the
        BroBible Site; (b) provide  custom, personalized content and information; (c) monitor the
        effectiveness of our marketing campaigns; (d) monitor aggregate  metrics such as total number
        of visitors, pages viewed, etc.; and (e) track your entries, submissions, and status in
        promotions,  sweepstakes, and contests.
    </li>
</ul>


<h3>Information That is Publicly Available</h3>

<ul>
    <li>
        When you create an account on the site, some information about your  account and your account
        activity will be provided to other Users of the site. This may include the date you opened
        your account, the date you last logged into your account, your age (if you choose to  make
        it public), your location and any other information you wish to make public to other Users.
    </li>
    <li>
        Your Bro Alias (not your email address) is displayed to other Users when  you engage in
        certain activity on the site, such as you upload  content or send messages through the
        BroBible Site. Other Users can  contact you through messages and comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        You may also choose to add personal information that will be visible to other Users on
        your Brofile (which is the public facing page for your account on the site). This may
        include a profile picture,  alias, answers to optional questions or other details.
    </li>
    <li>
        If you choose to add certain features to your Brofile, then these features and your
        activity associated with these features will be displayed to other Users and may be
        aggregated and shared with other Users. Such shared activity may include what content
        you favorite,  what content you rated and what content you have uploaded.
    </li>
</ul>


<h3>Your Choices</h3>

<ul>
    <li>
        You may update or correct your personal profile information and email preferences at any
        time by visiting your Brofile page.
    </li>
    <li>
        You may set privacy settings to determine the types of Users that will  be allowed to view
        your Brofile and uploaded content.
    </li>
    <li>
        You may control the information that is available to other Users by  editing your account
        and the features that are included on your  Brofile.
    </li>
</ul>


<h3>Third-party Advertisers, Links to Other Sites</h3>

<p>
    BroBible allows other companies, called third-party ad servers or ad networks, to serve
    advertisements within the BroBible Sites. These third-party ad servers or ad networks use
    technology to send, directly to your browser, the advertisements and links that appear on
    the BroBible Sites. They automatically receive your IP address when this happens. They may
    also use other technologies (such as cookies, JavaScript, or Web Beacons) to measure the
    effectiveness of their advertisements and to personalize the advertising content you see.
</p>
<p>
    We may provide information to service providers to help us bring you the services we offer.
    Specifically, we may use third parties to facilitate our business, such as to host the
    service at a co-location facility for servers, to send out email updates about BroBible,
    to remove repetitive information from our user lists, to process payments for products
    or services, to offer an online job application process, or to provide search results or
    links (including sponsored links). In connection with these offerings and business
    operations, our service providers may have access to your personal information for use for
    a limited time in connection with these business activities. Where we utilize third parties
    for the processing of any personal information, we implement reasonable contractual and
    technical protections limiting the use of that information to the BroBible-specified purposes.
</p>
<p>
    We may be required to disclose user information pursuant to lawful requests, such as subpoenas
    or court orders, or in compliance with applicable laws. We do not reveal information until
    we have a good faith belief that an information request by law enforcement or private
    litigants meets applicable legal standards. Additionally, we may share account or other
    information when we believe it is necessary to comply with law, to protect our interests
    or property, to prevent fraud or other illegal activity perpetrated through the BroBible
    service or using the BroBible name, or to prevent imminent bodily harm. This may include
    sharing information with other companies, lawyers, agents or government agencies.
</p>
<p>
    We may offer stores or provide services jointly with other companies on BroBible. You can
    tell when another company is involved in any store or service provided on BroBible, and
    we may share customer information with that company in connection with your use of that
    store or service.
</p>
<p>
    If the ownership of all or substantially all of the BroBible business, or individual business
    units owned by BroBible, Inc., were to change, your user information may be transferred to
    the new owner so the service can continue operations. In any such transfer of information,
    your user information would remain subject to the promises made in any pre-existing Privacy
    Policy.
</p>
<p>
    When you use BroBible, certain information you post or share with third parties (e.g., a
    Bronecction in your network), such as personal information, comments, messages, photos,
    videos, or other information, may be shared with other users in accordance with the privacy
    settings you select. All such sharing of information is done at your own risk. Please keep
    in mind that if you disclose personal information in your profile or when posting comments,
    messages, photos, videos, or other items, this information may become publicly available.
</p>


<h3>Security</h3>

<p>
    BroBible takes appropriate precautions to protect our users' information. Your account
    information is located on a secured server behind a firewall. When you enter sensitive
    information (such as credit card number or your password), we encrypt that information
    using secure socket layer technology (SSL). (To learn more about SSL, go to
    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Sockets_Layer" target="_blank">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Sockets_Layer</a>).
    Because email and instant messaging are not recognized as secure communications, we
    request that you not send private information to us by email or instant messaging
    services. If you have any questions about the security of BroBible Web Site, please
    <a href="http://www.brobible.com/ContactUs">Contact Us</a>.
</p>


<h3>More Information</h3>

<p>
    BroBible adheres to the US Safe Harbor privacy principles. For more information about the
    Safe Harbor framework or our registration, see the
