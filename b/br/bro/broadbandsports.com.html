      <p><b>WHAT INFORMATION DOES BROADBAND SPORTS COLLECT? </b></p>
      <p><b>Personal Information</b></p>
      <p>You may visit and use many features on the Broadband Sports Network without 
        completing any registration at all. However, in order to order products, 
        complete surveys, enter contests and sweepstakes, participate in polls, 
        online chats and forums, or enter other enhanced, member areas of the 
        Broadband Sports Network, we may require you to provide us with certain 
        contact and/or demographic information and/or to become a registered member 
        of certain divisions of the Broadband Sports Network.&nbsp; When you become 
        a registered member, we require you to provide us with your contact information 
        (including your name and email address), date of birth, gender and zip 
        code, as well as to create a password.&nbsp; As our goal is to make your experience 
        as easy and enjoyable as possible throughout the entire Broadband Sports 
        Network, this contact information is shared among the various divisions 
        of the Broadband Sports Network, although at this time separate registration 
        may be necessary.</p>
      <p><b>Credit Card Information</b></p>
      <p>If you purchase any products on the site, you will additionally need 
        to provide us with your credit card and shipping information.</p>
      <p><b>IP Address</b></p>
      <p>An IP address is a number that’s automatically assigned to your computer 
        whenever you’re surfing the Web.&nbsp; We retain your IP address in order to 
        help us diagnose problems with our servers, to administer our sites, to 
        help identify you and your shopping cart, to gather broad anonymous demographic 
        information (such as the number of visitors from a geographic area), to 
        enforce compliance with the Broadband Sports Network terms and conditions 
        or otherwise in order to protect our services, sites, customers, or others.</p>
      <p><b>Cookies </b></p>
      <p>Cookies are small bits of electronic information that a web site can 
        transfer to a visitor’s hard drive to help tailor and keep records of 
        his or her visit to the site.&nbsp; The use of cookies is standard on the Internet 
        and many web sites use them.&nbsp; Cookies allow web site operators to better 
        customize visits to the site to the visitor’s individual preferences.&nbsp; 
        For example, we use cookies to keep track of your shopping cart and to 
        provide you with a better surfing experience and maximize your enjoyment 
        of the Broadband Sports Network. However, we do not save any password 
        information in cookies. We may additionally use “web bugs” or other similar 
        data collection programs to collect information to provide you with a 
        more enjoyable and easier experience on the Broadband Sports Network. 
        In addition, banner advertisements displayed on our site may contain cookies.&nbsp; 
        The companies who serve our banner advertisements transfer cookies independent 
        of us, and, as such, we do not control the use of such cookies and in 
        many instances have no access to the information collected by them. </p>
      <p>Although most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, you can usually 
        change your browser to prevent that or to notify you when you are sent 
        a cookie.&nbsp; This gives you the chance to decide whether or not to accept 
        the cookie.&nbsp; Even without accepting a cookie, you can still access many 
        of the features on the Broadband Sports Network. However, some parts of 
        the Broadband Sports services will not function properly or may be considerably 
        slower if you refuse cookies. &nbsp;For example, without cookies, you may experience 
        delays and may have difficulty completing shopping transactions, entering 
        contests, or playing games. If you would like more information about cookies, 
        we suggest you visit <a href="http://www.cookiecentral.com">http://www.cookiecentral.com</a>.</p>
      <p><b>HOW DOES BROADBAND SPORTS USE THE INFORMATION IT COLLECTS? </b></p>
      <p><b>Personal Information</b></p>
      <p>We use the information we collect to tailor your experience in the Broadband 
        Sports Network by displaying content according to your interests and preferences, 
        providing a faster method for you to submit information to us and receive 
        back the information or products you desire, sending you information about 
        our company and promotional material from some of our partners, and allowing 
        us to contact you, if necessary. If at any time you would rather not receive 
        information from us, or would like to opt-out of any other service we 
        provide, simply follow the steps in the section entitled "How do 
        you opt out? How do you change the information we have for you?" 
        Notwithstanding the manner in which Broadband Sports uses such information, 
        we will not provide any such personally identifiable information to any 
        third parties without your express written consent.</p>
      <p><b>Credit Card Information</b></p>
      <p>All credit card related information you provide to us when ordering any 
        products or services from the Broadband Sports Network is maintained by 
        us as highly confidential, and we will not share such credit card related 
        information with any third parties that are not involved in fulfilling 
        your order.</p>
      <p><b>E-mail Notification</b></p>
      <p>We may use the information we collect to occasionally notify you about 
        new services on the Broadband Sports Network, special offers we think 
        you’ll find valuable and important functionality changes to the web site. 
        If you would rather not receive this information, or would like to opt-out 
        of any other information request or distribution, simply submit such a 
        request to us at <a href="mailto:support@broadbandsports.com">support@broadbandsports.com</a>.&nbsp; 
        Members may also receive electronic newsletters from one or more divisions 
        of the Broadband Sports Network.&nbsp; If you would rather not receive any 
        of these newsletters, you may click on the link at the end of the newsletter, 
        or notify us at <a href="mailto:newsletter@broadbandsports.com">newsletter@broadbandsports.com</a>.&nbsp; 
      </p>
      <p><b>Disclosure to Third Parties</b></p>
      <p>Subject to your express opt-in approval, we may share your personally 
        identifiable information with third parties, including telemarketers and 
        e-commerce partners, who assist Broadband Sports by providing services 
        to users of the Broadband Sports Network. We also may share your personally 
        identifiable information at any time if compelled to do so in order to 
        comply with any applicable law or valid legal process.</p>
      <p>Should you change your mind about the information you’ve provided to 
        us or should your information change, we have provided a way for you to 
        correct, update or remove the personal information you gave us. You can 
        do this simply by contacting us in any of the simple ways set forth below 
        in the section entitled “ How do you opt out? How do you change the information 
        we have for you?”&nbsp; </p>
      <p><b>HOW DO WE PROTECT CUSTOMER INFORMATION?</b></p>
      <p>We implement a variety of security measures to ensure the security of 
        your personal information on our systems. Member personal information 
        is contained behind secured networks and is only accessible by a limited 
        number of employees who have special access rights to such systems. Any 
        sensitive/credit information you supply us is transmitted and protected 
        via Secure Socket Layer technology and HTTPS protocol and then encrypted 
        into our databases to be accessed only as stated above.</p>
      <p>To ensure compliance with updated security technology, we recommend using 
        one of the following browsers, each of which can be downloaded free of 
        charge: Netscape Navigator (<a href="http://www.netscape.com" target="_blank">http://www.netscape.com</a>), or Microsoft Internet Explorer (<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/ie" target="_blank">http://www.microsoft.com/ie</a>).&nbsp; 
        To ensure the highest level of security available today, we suggest that 
        you choose the 128-bit encryption version from the download options.&nbsp; 
        If you do not have access to a browser that supports at least 48-bit encryption, 
        your information may not be processed by our servers, or may not be securely 
        transferred through your web browser to our servers.</p>
      <p>Unfortunately, when you submit information to us (or to any other web 
        site) over the Internet, the information may travel over many networks 
        and systems that are not under our control and, during such time, can 
        be intercepted.&nbsp; As a result, while we strive to protect your personal 
        information, Broadband Sports can’t ensure or warrant the security of 
        any information you transmit to us and you do so at your own risk.&nbsp; Further, 
        anything you voluntarily provide in any public area of the Internet, including 
        on the Broadband Sports Network, will be publicly available to other visitors 
        on that web site and potentially to other third parties, and you should 
        always exercise caution when deciding to publicly disclose any of your 
        personal information.</p>
      <p><b>HOW DO YOU OPT OUT? HOW DO YOU CHANGE THE INFORMATION WE HAVE FOR 
        YOU?</b></p>
      <p>We give you the opportunity to opt out of receiving communications from 
        the Broadband Sports Network.&nbsp; To request that your information be removed 
        from our database or that certain information previously provided to us 
        be updated or modified, or that we not send you any future communications, 
        simply contact us in any of the following manners: </p>

      <p><b>HOW DO YOU COLLECT AND USE INFORMATION FROM CHILDREN UNDER&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 13 
        YEARS OF AGE??</b> </p>
      <p>Pursuant to the provisions of the Federal Children’s Online Privacy Protection 
        Act (COPPA), we do not collect personal identifiable information from 
        children under thirteen years of age without the consent of a parent or 
        legal guardian.&nbsp; Thus, when a guest under 13 years of age registers, he/she 
        is required to provide the email address of his/her parent (or legal guardian).&nbsp; 
        We then contact the parent (or legal guardian) and alert them to the child’s 
        registration.&nbsp; We require the parent or guardian to validate the account 
        in order for the potential member to become a registered member.&nbsp; However, 
        even after an account has been validated, no personally identifiable information 
        collected from guests under the age of thirteen will ever be sold or provided 
        to any third parties, or used for any marketing or promotional purposes.<b>&nbsp; 
        </b>In addition, parents may request to review the personally identifiable 
        information collected from their child, may ask to have that information 
        deleted, and may refuse to allow further collection or use of their child’s 
        personally identifiable information at any time. To request such review 
        or to give instructions regarding the personally identifiable information 
        we have collected about a child, parents/legal guardians should contact 
        us in one of the ways mentioned above in the section entitled “How do 
        you opt out? How do you change the information we have for you?” or in 
        the section below entitled "Questions? Contact Us." </p>
