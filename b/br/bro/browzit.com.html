<h2>PRIVACY POLICY FOR WEBSITE</h2>
<h3>OVERVIEW</h3>
<p>We value your privacy and are committed to protecting your personal information.&nbsp;</p>

In addition, individuals or organizations can use our Services to set up Events for Consumers (those who use our Services to provide a service to Consumers are referred to as “Clients”). Relatedly, our Clients (including agents of our Clients) may provide us personal information about consumers who have registered for an Event being operated by our Client or who the Client wants us to contact or otherwise provide Services to on behalf of the Client.</p>
<h3>Information We Collect Directly From You.&nbsp;</h3>

<ul>

In some of our email messages, we use a “click-through URL” linked to content on the website.
