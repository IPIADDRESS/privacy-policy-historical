<h2>Privacy Statement</h2>
<p>
  CrackerJackAgent.com, LLC (we, us or CrackerJackAgent) has provided this Privacy 
Policy to assist you in understanding how we collect and use the personal information 
that you provide to us and to assist you in making informed decisions when using 
the CrackerJackAgent web site located at www.CrackerJackAgent.com (the Web Site).
</p><p><b>The information we collect</b><br>
When you visit the Web Site you may provide us with two types of information: 
  personal information you knowingly choose to disclose that is collected by us 
  and Web Site use information collected by us as you browse our Web Site.</p>
<p>When you register on the Web Site, you create your own profile and privacy 
  settings. Your profile includes various types of personal information, such 
  as your personal interests, gender, age, education, and occupation. Your profile 
  information, as well as your username and photo, may be displayed to other users 
  of the Web Site. If you post personally identifiable information in areas of 
  the site accessible to other users, you should be aware that such information 
  can be read, collected, or used by other users, and could be used improperly 
  (including for example to send you unsolicited messages). We are not responsible 
  for the personally identifiable information you choose to submit in these forums 
  or for others’ misuse of such information.</p>
<p>When you enter our Web Site, we collect the user’s browser type and IP 
  address. This information is gathered for all users of the Web Site and is used 
  for administrative and analytical purposes, including diagnosing problems with 
  our servers. In addition, when you enter our Web Site, we store certain information 
  from your browser using “cookies.” A cookie is a piece of data stored 
  on the user’s computer tied to information about the user. We use session 
  cookies containing encrypted information to allow the system to uniquely identify 
  you while you are logged in. This information allows us to process your online 
  requests and preferences. We also use persistent cookies, that only we can read 
  and use, for purposes of personal identification. We are careful about the security 
  and confidentiality of the information stored in persistent cookies. For example, 
  we do not store account numbers or passwords in persistent cookies. You can 
  remove or block this cookie using the settings in your browser if you want to 
  disable this convenience feature.</p>
<p><b>Use of information obtained by CrackerJackAgent</b><br>
  We use personal information to provide the services we offer. Your profile, 
  pictures and user name are displayed in order to facilitate user interaction 
  and for purposes of our matching services. With the exception of inviting friends 
  and certain notifications, a user’s email address is not shared or displayed. 
  Users may communicate using various CrackerJackAgent messaging services, including 
  a form of instant messenger, without disclosing their email addresses. To facilitate 
  searching and finding friends and acquaintances on the service, CrackerJackAgent 
  allows users to search for other members using certain profile matching systems 
  and/or specific user names. Please remember that any information that is disclosed 
  in the course of using the service provided by CrackerJackAgent and/or participating 
  in any of the public forums available via the Web Site becomes public information; 
  accordingly, you should exercise caution when deciding to disclose your personal 
  information.</p>
<p>From time to time, CrackerJackAgent or a partner, may sponsor a promotion or 
  contest on the Web Site. Users may be asked to provide personal information 
  including name, email address or home address or to answer questions in order 
  to participate. We may transfer personal information to certain ad partners 
  that you have explicitly requested to receive information from. It will be clear 
  at the point of collection who is collecting the personal information and whose 
  privacy statement will apply.</p>
<p>In cases of suspected abuse or service problems, CrackerJackAgent may use an 
  IP address in conjunction with other personally identifiable information to 
  enforce our Terms of Service and/or to protect or troubleshoot this Web Site, 
  its users or others who may be affected.</p>
<p>CrackerJackAgent may archive information, including personal information, you 
  provide in the course of using our services and any other aspects of the CrackerJackAgent 
  Web site. We store that information on servers that are controlled by us or 
  by third parties who have agreed to comply with our commitments made under this 
  Privacy Policy and with whom we have a contractual relationship. Archived information 
  will not ordinarily be erased unless and until your entire account with CrackerJackAgent 
  is deleted, and even then we may retain some or all of your information on back-up 
  files; provided, however, we assume no obligation or guarantee to archive any 
  information and do not warrant that any archived information will later be made 
  available to you.</p>
<p>We may use personal information for auditing, research and analysis to operate 
  and improve the services we offer.</p>
<p><b>Sharing your information with third parties</b><br>
  We may share demographic information with third parties, including companies 
  with which we have a relationship. For example and without limitation:</p>
<p>We may provide information to service providers to help us bring you the services 
  we offer. Specifically, we may use third parties to facilitate our business, 
  such as directing and displaying specific advertisements on the Web Site. In 
  connection with these offerings and business operations, our service providers 
  may have access to your personal information for use in connection with these 
  business activities.</p>
<p>We may be required to disclose customer information pursuant to lawful requests, 
  such as subpoenas or court orders, or in compliance with applicable laws. Additionally, 
  we may share account or other information when we believe it is necessary to 
  comply with law or to protect our interests or property. This may include sharing 
  information with other companies, lawyers, agents or government agencies.</p>
<p>If the ownership of all or substantially all of the CrackerJackAgent business 
  or assets were to change, your user information would likely be transferred 
  to the new owner(s).</p>
<p>We may share with, or disclose or sell to third parties aggregated information. 
</p>
<p>If you do not want to receive promotional email from CrackerJackAgent and/or 
  do not want us to share your information with third parties for marketing purposes, 
  please submit a request by emailing us using the contact link at the bottom 
  of any of our web pages. We will make reasonable efforts to implement any choice 
  you make as soon as possible; provided, however, CrackerJackAgent reserves the 
  right to send you certain communications relating to the CrackerJackAgent service, 
  such as service announcements and administrative messages without offering you 
  the opportunity to opt out of receiving them.</p>
<p><b>Links</b><br>
  This site may contain links to other websites. CrackerJackAgent is not responsible 
  for the privacy practices of other web sites. We encourage our users to be aware 
  when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every 
  web site that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy statement 
  applies solely to this Web Site.</p>
<p><b>Third party advertising</b><br>
  Advertisements that appear on the Web Site are delivered to users by our advertising 
  partners. Our advertising partners may download cookies to your computer. Doing 
  this allows the advertising network to recognize your computer each time they 
  send you an advertisement. In this way, they may compile information about where 
  you, or others who are using your computer, saw their advertisements and determine 
  which advertisements are clicked. This information allows an advertising network 
  to deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest 
  to you. CrackerJackAgent does not have access to or control of the cookies that 
  may be placed by the third party advertisers. This privacy statement covers 
  the use of cookies by CrackerJackAgent and does not cover the use of cookies 
  by any of its advertisers.</p>
<p><b>Changing or removing information</b><br>
  CrackerJackAgent users may modify or remove any of their personal information 
  at any time by logging into their account. For technical reasons, any modifications 
  or deletions which you request may take a short period of time to take effect.</p>
<p>If you change or delete any of your personal information, CrackerJackAgent 
  will remove the old or deleted information from public view; however, as noted 
  in Section 3 above, we may keep such information archived indefinitely.</p>
<p><b>Security</b><br>
  CrackerJackAgent takes appropriate precautions to protect our users’ information. 
  Your account information is located on a secured server behind a firewall. Because 
  email is not recognized as a secure medium of communication, we request that 
  you do not send private information to us by email. In addition, as all security 
  measures are subject to possible circumvention, we cannot and do not provide 
  any guarantees regarding the effectiveness of the security we employ or our 
  ability to prevent third parties, acting unlawfully, from obtaining information 
  that you provide to us. If you have any questions about the security of the 
  CrackerJackAgent Web Site, please contact us.</p>
<p>CrackerJackAgent encourages all users to maintain a pseudonymous identity when 
  using the services provided by CrackerJackAgent or any other public aspects 
  of the Web Site. CrackerJackAgent cannot ensure that your identity, telephone 
  number, work or home address and other personal identifying or contact information 
  will not be discovered by other users of the Web Site. This is particularly 
  true because your location (for example, within a radius of approximately five 
  miles) will be revealed. It is, of course, more likely that your true identity 
  will be discovered if you post photographs or share other unique identifying 
  information about yourself on public areas of the Web Site.</p>
<p><b>Changes in our privacy policy</b><br>
  We reserve the right to change our privacy policy at any time. If we do this, 
  we will post the changes to this policy on this page and will indicate at the 
  top of this page the policy’s effective date. We therefore encourage you 
  to refer to this policy on an ongoing basis so that you understand our current 
  privacy policy.</p>

  of CrackerJackAgent’s Terms of Service Agreement. Use of CrackerJackAgent’s 
  services is subject to your compliance with those terms and conditions, which
