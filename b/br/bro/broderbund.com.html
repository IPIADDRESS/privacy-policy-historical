<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
		    <p></p>
		    
			<p>Last Updated: June 3, 2009</p>
            
			<p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This privacy policy is an agreement between Encore Software, Inc. ("Encore" or "we") and the user of this website ("you"). 
            Among other things, it tells you what information we collect from you, how we might use or share it, 
            how you can review or change the personal information you provided to us, how we may change this policy, 
            and the steps we take to ensure that your personal information is protected. 
            </p>

            <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All of your activities on this website are voluntary. 
            You are not required to provide any personal information to us unless you choose to access features on this site that require the information. 
            By using this website, you signify that you agree to the terms of this privacy policy.  
            If you do not agree with the terms of this privacy policy then you should discontinue using the site.  
			</p>

			
			<p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This privacy policy is effective as of June 3, 2009 and will remain in effect until updated.  
            We reserve the right to change our privacy policy at any time.  
            Any changes will become effective immediately when posted on the website.  
            Your continued use of the site after we post any such modifications will constitute your acknowledgment of the modified policy 
            and your agreement to abide and be bound by the modified policy.  
            </p>
			
			<p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The privacy policy does not extend to anything that is inherent in the operation of the Internet and therefore beyond Encore's control, 
            and is not to be applied in any manner contrary to applicable law or governmental regulation. 
            This privacy policy only applies to information collected through this site, and not through sites you link to from this site. 
            </p>
            
            <p>TYPES OF INFORMATION WE COLLECT</p>

            <h2>When you visit:</h2>
            <p>

            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our website may collect "general information" such as your computer's Internet Protocol (IP) address, 
            your server address and domain name ("click stream data") whenever you visit.  
            Our server recognizes your domain name but not your email address.  
            Some analytics companies will monitor their own customers on our sites, but we do not collect any personally identifiable information as you browse.  
            We do gather aggregate information on what pages our visitors access.  
            This data helps us identify what content is most relevant to customer needs, to improve the design and layout of our store, 
            and to determine which features of our site are most effective or useful.  
            We collect this information with "cookies."  
            A cookie is a small string of information that the website you visit transfers to your computer's hard drive for identification purposes.  
            The cookie stores a unique "Session ID" and is necessary to enable you to buy items and engage in transactions on our website.  
            The Session ID enables us to provide continuity to your website experience; for instance, it helps us to store items in your shopping cart while you remain on our website.  
            Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you have the ability to reject cookies by changing your browser settings.  
            However, if you reject cookies, you may no longer be able to access all features of the website.  
            </p>

            
            <h2>When you register on the website, or purchase or register a product:</h2> 
            <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will ask you for "personal information," which may include, 
            but is not limited to, your name, e-mail address, street address, or telephone number.  
            We will also ask you how we may use your contact information.  
            You may change your preferences on encoreusa.com by repeating the <a href="javascript:popAWin('http://www.encore.com/register/', 970, 620, 'encoreWin', 'yes', 'yes', 'yes', 'yes', 'yes', 'yes');">registration process</a> and specifying your new preferences.  
            </p>
            
            <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We provide some of our services through contractual arrangements with affiliates, services providers, 
            partners and other third parties (collectively, "third party partners"). 
            Encore may be contractually required by its third party partners to provide registered user information.  
            Once you have registered, some partners may offer you additional information about their products and services, through email or otherwise.   
            If you do not want to receive these offers, you may inform the relevant partner that you do not wish to receive their marketing materials. 
            </p>

            
            <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you choose not to provide requested personal information, 
            you may not be able to access or use the features of the site where such information is requested.  
            </p>
            
            <p>HOW WE USE YOUR INFORMATION</p>
            <h2>What We Use It For</h2> 
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We primarily use your personal and general information to provide products and services to you, including, but not limited to, the following: 
               </p><ul>
                   <li>To fill an order, administer a promotion or provide you with relevant products or services (for example, to deliver a prize you may have won in a contest)</li>

                   <li>To analyze visits to the website, to learn about your interests and better understand your interests and needs (both on an aggregate and personal level), so we can improve our products and services and deliver to you the type of content, features and promotions that you are most interested in</li>
               </ul>

            <p></p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We may also use your information to send you materials via e-mail about products, offers, and news we think might interest you. 
            This information may relate to Encore's products, offers, and news or that of a third party partner.  
            We will not send you any such information unless you have opted in to receive emails from Encore and/or its third party partners.  
            These notices will generally be delivered by e-mail, but may also arrive by postal mail.  
            If you do not wish to receive these offers, you may select the option stating that you do not wish to receive marketing materials from third parties when you register.  
            If you wish to modify your e-mail options on encoreusa.com, repeat the <a href="javascript:popAWin('http://www.encore.com/register/', 970, 620, 'encoreWin', 'yes', 'yes', 'yes', 'yes', 'yes', 'yes');">registration process</a> and specify your new preferences.
            </p>
            
            <h2>When Information is Shared with Third Parties</h2> 
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our third party partners consist primarily of service vendors and marketing partners.  
            Service vendors use your personal information to operate our sites and to deliver services.  
            For example, your data may be transferred to website hosting partners and other parties who assist us in designing and operating our websites, 
            sending e-mail offers, cleaning errors from our e-mail lists, processing credit card transactions, or helping us analyze collected data.  
            Service vendors are contractually obligated to protect and maintain your personal data as confidential.  
            Marketing partners may use your personal information to provide you with special offers, products or services.  
            We encourage our marketing partners to adopt and post privacy policies. 
            However, the use of your personal information by our marketing partners is governed by their privacy policies and is not subject to our control. 
            </p>

            
            <h2>Links to Third Parties</h2> 
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For your convenience and to improve the usage of the website we may insert links to third parties on this site. 
            This privacy policy does not apply to such third party websites. These links take you outside our service and off Encore's site and are beyond our control.  
            These third party sites have their own individual privacy policies and Encore is not liable for the content and activities of those sites. 
            Your visits and access to such websites are at your own risk. 
            </p>

            
            <h2>Legal Compliance</h2> 
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We may release your account or other information when we believe, 
            in good faith, that such release is reasonably necessary to (i) comply with applicable laws and regulations or judicial orders, 
            (ii) enforce or apply the terms of any of our user agreements or (iii) protect the rights, property or safety of Encore, our users, or others. 
            These situations include exchanging information with other companies and organizations to protect against fraud and credit risks. 
            We will release personal or general information without your consent for security purposes, when required by law, or to prevent imminent harm to any person or entity. 
            We will disclose personal or general information upon receipt of a court order or subpoena, or to cooperate with a law enforcement investigation, 
            which may include responding to requests and court orders from jurisdictions outside the United States. 
            We fully cooperate with law enforcement agencies in identifying those who use our services for illegal activities. 
            We reserve the right to report to law enforcement agencies any activities that we in good faith believe to be unlawful, as determined in our sole discretion. 
            Release of your personal data for such purposes to any person or entity shall be based on a determination made by us, 
            exercising our own discretion, permission for which is expressly granted by you in accordance with this policy.
            </p>
            
            <p>HOW WE PROTECT YOUR INFORMATION</p> 
            <h2>Security Measures</h2> 
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to protect both your personal and general information, we have implemented various security measures, including firewalls on all our servers.  
            Please keep in mind, however, that whenever you give out personal information online there is a risk that unauthorized third parties may intercept and use that information. 
            While we strive to protect your privacy, we cannot guarantee the security of any information you disclose online.  
            By using this site, you expressly acknowledge and agree that we do not guarantee the security of any data provided to or received by us through this site 
            and that you expressly assume all risk of providing any personal information, general information, or other data or information through this site.
