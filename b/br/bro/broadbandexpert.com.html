	<h2>BROADBAND EXPERT PRIVACY POLICY</h2>
<p>RichWeb Media LLC (“RWM”, “we” or “us”) operates the web site located at www.broadbandexpert.com. (the “Site”). This serves as RWM’s Privacy Policy for the Site.</p>
<p>RWM makes the Site available to those individuals (“Users”) who access the Site for availability and price comparisons of internet providers, satellite, cable and mobile broadband providers (“Broadband Services”). Users communicate with us through the Site, respond to surveys about the usefulness and value of the Site and its contents, choose the right service for their needs, and receive other information about products and services, subject to this Privacy Policy (the “Policy”). This Policy explains what information RWM collects about its Users, how RWM uses and/or shares this information, and how such information is maintained. By visiting the Site, you accept the terms of this Policy.</p>
<p>Note that this Policy applies only with respect to the information collected by RWM through the Site, and not any information collected or obtained through other methods or sources.</p>
<p><strong>Collection of Personally Identifiable Information</strong></p>
<p>RWM collects Users’ personally-identifiable information (“PII”) that is volunteered by Users at the Site who conduct surveys or inquire about the products or services offered on the Site. Examples of PII that may be requested and/or collected include: first and last name, address, zip code, email address, telephone number, facsimile number, company or business identity and Broadband Services that interests the User or for which the User has subscribed. From time to time, RWM may also present opportunities for Users to voluntarily provide additional information about themselves.</p>
<p><strong>Use and Sharing of PII</strong></p>
<p>RWM will use User PII: to provide the User with information about RWM products or services, Broadband Services to which the User has requested, newsletters, or other materials about Broadband Services, or to compile information in response to RWM surveys. Other than the uses set forth in this Privacy Policy, RWM does not share User PII with any third party. Please note, however, that RWM may change this Policy at any time (See “Changes to this Policy,” below), and that RWM may in the future use User PII for additional purposes not currently included in this Policy.</p>
<p>User PII collected by us may be added to our databases and used for future marketing purposes, including but not limited to, e-mail and direct marketing. RWM may also allow carefully selected third parties to contact Users occasionally about products and services which may be of interest to Users. They may contact you by mail, telephone or fax, as well as by e-mail. By using the Site, you agree that you may be contacted in any manner contemplated in this section even if your number is found on a do not call registry, in-house list or similar registry.</p>
<p>RWM may also disclose User PII in order to: (1) comply with applicable laws (including, without limitation, the CAN-SPAM Act); (2) respond to governmental inquiries; (3) comply with valid legal process; (4) protect the rights or property of RWM, including without limitation, filing copyright applications with the Library of Congress, Copyright Office, or (5) protect the health and personal safety of any individual.</p>
<p>If you do not wish us to share your PII with our dealers or other third parties for marketing purposes, please submit your request in writing to:</p>

<p><strong>Non-Personally Identifiable Information</strong></p>
<p>RWM also collects certain non-personally identifiable information, including the non-personally identifiable information more fully described below.</p>
<p><em>Cookies</em>. RWM may use “cookies” on the Site. Cookies are small pieces of information that RWM’s server places on an individual’s computer hard drive to enable the individual to more easily communicate and interact with the Site. For example, RWM may place a cookie on a User’s computer when he/she initially registers at the Site. The next time that User visits the Site, RWM’s server will recognize the cookie (and the User) and allow the User to perform certain actions immediately without signing in.</p>
<p>While some Web browsers allow a User to automatically reject all cookies or be notified when a cookie is about to be placed on the User’s computer, disabling this feature may compromise the efficiency and added services that cookies provide.</p>
<p><em>IP Address</em>. RWM collects your IP (Internet Protocol) address to help diagnose problems with its server, and to administer the Site and RWM’s email messages to Site Users. An IP address is a number that is assigned to your computer when you use the Internet. Your IP address is also used to help identify you during a particular session and to gather broad demographic data.</p>
<p>Although the information collected through the foregoing methods does not itself contain any PII, RWM may analyze and match such information with other information that you provide (including PII) as well as information that RWM may obtain elsewhere, and RWM may share all or some of such information with actual or prospective distributors, dealers, or other third parties.</p>
<p>RWM may also disclose non-PII in order to (1) comply with applicable laws, (2) respond to governmental inquiries, or (3) comply with valid legal process, or (4) protect the rights or property of RWM or Users of the Site. <strong>Access to Information</strong> If you want to review, correct or change your User information, please contact us at the address listed below.</p>
<p><strong>Third Party Services</strong></p>
<p>The Site may contain links from the Site to the websites of other providers of products and services. When you click on the icon of such an entity, you will leave the Site and be connected to the website of such entity. RWM does not have any control over the information handling practices of these other entities, and is not responsible for any failure of such entities to adhere to this Policy. You should familiarize yourself with the privacy policies of such other entities before you share any PII with those entities.</p>
<p><strong>Links from Email</strong></p>
<p>RWM email communications with you may provide links to the websites of other third parties providing products and services that may be of interest to you. If you link to any of these third party websites, this Policy will not apply to your use of, and activities on, those websites. We encourage you to read the legal notices posted on these sites, including their privacy policies. RWM shall have no responsibility or liability for your visitation to, and the data collection and use policies and practices of, these other websites.</p>
<p><strong>Note Concerning Individuals 18 Years of Age And Younger</strong></p>
<p>The Site, RWM emails and the content available in connection therewith, are neither intended for, nor directed to, children under the age of 18. You must be at least 18 years old to have our permission to use our Site and to provide your PII to RWM. If RWM learns that a person who is a User is under the age of 18, RWM will promptly delete the individual’s PII from RWM’s records. RWM will NOT knowingly distribute such information to third parties.</p>
<p><strong>Security</strong></p>
<p>While RWM takes reasonable precautions to safeguard information transmitted between RWM and Users of the Site, RWM may be unable to prevent unauthorized access to such information by third parties or inadvertent disclosure of such information. Users acknowledge this risk when communicating with RWM.</p>
<p><strong>Consent to Processing</strong></p>
<p>By providing PII and other information to RWM, Users of the Site fully understand and unambiguously consent to the collection and processing of such information in, and the transfer of such information to, the United States and other countries or territories, in accordance with the terms of this Policy.</p>
<p><strong>Transfer in Certain Circumstances </strong></p>
<p>In its sole discretion, RWM may transfer, sell or assign information collected on or about Users of the Site, including without limitation, PII and other User provided information, to one or more third parties, as a result of the sale, merger, consolidation, change in control, transfer of substantial assets, reorganization or liquidation of RWM.</p>
<p><strong>Changes to This Policy </strong></p>
<p>RWM may, from time to time, amend this Policy, in whole or part, in its sole discretion. Any changes to this Policy will be effective immediately upon the posting of the revised policy. By continuing to use the Site following any changes, you will be deemed to have agreed to such changes.</p></div>
