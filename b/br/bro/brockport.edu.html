      <h3>Access to and Correction of <i>Personal Information</i> Collected Through 
        Our Web Site</h3>
      <p>Any <i>user</i> may submit a request to our privacy compliance officer

        has been collected through our Web site.&nbsp; Any such request shall be made 
        in writing and must be accompanied by reasonable proof of identity of 
        the <i>user</i>.&nbsp; Reasonable proof of identity may include verification

        </i>browser on the hard drive of the <i>user’s</i> computer.&nbsp; At present, 
        we use cookies as tokens to identify a <i>user</i> during the <i>user’s</i> 
        visit to our Campus Information System (Banner) and to the Angel course 
        management system to help ensure only authorized access is made to the 
        <i>personal information</i> located therein.&nbsp; Use of the Campus Information 
        System is a great convenience to our <i>users</i>, but is not required 
        for ordinary interaction with us.&nbsp; Use of Angel may be required of our 
        students for some courses.</p>
