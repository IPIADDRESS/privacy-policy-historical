    <h2>Broadly, Inc. Privacy Policy</h2>
    <h3>Date of Last Revision: October 30, 2013</h3>

    <p>Broadly, Inc. (“Broadly”, “we”, “us” and/or “our”) is committed to
    protecting your privacy.  Wherever possible, we want to communicate openly and
    directly with each and every user of our automated marketing and customer
    engagement service for businesses (the “Services”).</p>

    <p>This Privacy Policy sets forth Broadly’s policy with respect to personally
    identifiable data (“Personal Data”) and other information that is collected
    from three groups of users: individuals or businesses that register to use the
    Services (“Subscribers”), Subscribers’ actual or prospective customers
    (“Consumers”) and visitors to our corporate website (“Visitors”).</p>

    <h3>Confidentiality of Your Consumer Information as a Subscriber</h3>

    <p>We understand the importance and proprietary nature of our Subscribers’
    customer lists (your list of actual and prospective Consumers), and we will
    not share Personal Data about your Consumers with your competitors or other
    Subscribers. Only anonymous and/or aggregated (non-personally identifiable)
    information about your Consumers may be shared to other Subscribers as part of
    the Services, in a manner consistent with this Privacy Policy.</p>

    <h3>Collection and Use of Your Information, as a Subscriber, Consumer or
      Visitor</h3>

    <p>When you interact with us through the Services, we may collect Personal
    Data and other information from you, and use such information, as further
    described below:</p>

    <p><strong>Personal Data That You Provide Through the Services:</strong> We
    collect Personal Data from you when you voluntarily provide such information,
    such as when you contact us with inquiries, respond to one of our surveys,
    register for access to the Services or use certain Services. Wherever Broadly
    collects Personal Data from you, we make an effort to provide a link to this
    Privacy Policy. Broadly uses the Personal Data you provide in a manner that is
    consistent with this Privacy Policy. If you provide Personal Data for a
    certain reason, we may use the Personal Data in connection with the reason for
    which it was provided. For instance, if you contact us by email, we will use
    the Personal Data you provide to answer your question or resolve your problem.
    Also, if you provide Personal Data in order to obtain access to the Services,
    we will use your Personal Data to provide you with access to such services and
    to monitor your use of such services.</p>

    <p class="notice">By voluntarily providing us with Personal Data, you are
    consenting to our use of it in accordance with this Privacy Policy. If you
    provide Personal Data to us, you acknowledge and agree that such Personal Data
    may be transferred from your current location to the offices and servers of
    Broadly and the authorized third parties referred to herein located in the
    United States.</p>

    <p>Other Information:</p>

    <p><strong>Non-Identifiable Data:</strong> When you interact with Broadly
    through the Services, we receive and store certain personally non-identifiable
    information. Such information, which is collected passively using various
    technologies, cannot presently be used to specifically identify you. Broadly
    may store such information itself or such information may be included in
    databases owned and maintained by Broadly affiliates, agents or service
    providers. The Services may use such information and pool it with other
    information to track, for example, the total number of visitors to our Site,
    the number of visitors to each page of our Site, and the domain names of our
    visitors' Internet service providers. It is important to note that no Personal
    Data is available or used in this process.</p>

    <p>In operating the Services, we may use a technology called "cookies." A
    cookie is a piece of information that the computer that hosts our Services
    gives to your browser when you access the Services. Our cookies help provide
    additional functionality to the Services and help us analyze Services usage
    more accurately. For instance, our Site may set a cookie on your browser that
    allows you to access the Services without needing to remember and then enter a
    password more than once during a visit to the Site. In all cases in which we
    use cookies, we will not collect Personal Data except with your permission. If
    any information collected through the use of cookies is associated with
    Personal Data, we will treat it as Personal Data.  On most web browsers, you
    will find a “help” section on the toolbar. Please refer to this section for
    information on how to receive notification when you are receiving a new cookie
    and how to turn cookies off. We recommend that you leave cookies turned on
    because they allow you to take advantage of some of the Service features.</p>

    <p>In operating the Services, we may also use web beacons or similar
    technologies. Web beacons are small, invisible graphic images that may be used
    on the Service or in emails relating to the Service to collect certain
    personally non-identifiable information and monitor user activity on the
    Services, such as to count visits, understand usage effectiveness and to tell
    if an email has been opened and acted upon.  As with our use of cookies, if
    any information collected through the use of web beacons is associated with
    Personal Data, we will treat it as Personal Data.</p>

    <p><strong>Data from Third-Party Sources:</strong> In order to improve the
    Services, we may obtain from third parties certain Personal Data and other
    non-personally identifiable information about Consumers, and this information
    is treated in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Policy.</p><p>

    </p><h3>Collection and Use of Your Information as a Consumer</h3>

    <p>The Services use and provide to our Subscribers certain Personal Data and
    other non-personally identifiable information about their Consumers and those
    Consumers' interactions with our Subscribers’ products and services. Broadly
    obtains this information as a result of information being sent to our servers
    by the tracking agent (the “Agent”), using various technologies, as embedded
    by or on our Subscribers’ behalf, on our Subscribers’ websites and in emails
    sent to our Subscribers’ Consumers.  Broadly uses this data to create reports
    for our Subscribers to analyze how their Consumers interact with their
    products and services and to create reports and/or metrics against which they
    can compare their user base.  In addition, we provide our Subscribers with
    aggregated and anonymous benchmark data that includes their Consumer data and
    our other Subscribers' Consumer data.</p>

    <h3>Aggregated Personal Data</h3>

    <p>In an ongoing effort to better understand and serve the users of the
    Services, Broadly often conducts research on its Subscribers and their
    Consumers’ demographics, interests and behavior based on the Personal Data and
    other information provided to us. This research may be compiled and analyzed
    on an aggregate basis, and Broadly may share this aggregate data with its
    affiliates, agents and business partners. This aggregate information does not
    identify you personally.  Broadly may also disclose aggregated statistics and
    other anonymized (personally non-identifiable) information about its
    Subscribers and their Consumers, in order to describe our services to current
    and prospective business partners, and to other third parties for other lawful
    purposes.</p>

    <h3>Other Uses of Your Personal Data and Other Information</h3>

    <p>Broadly and its affiliates may use Personal Data collected through the
    Service to contact you in the future about services we believe will be of
    interest.  If we do so, each marketing communication we send will contain
    instructions permitting the recipient to "opt-out" of receiving future
    marketing communications. In addition, if at any time you wish not to receive
    any future marketing communications or wish to have your name deleted from our
    mailing lists, please contact us as indicated below.</p>

    <p>Broadly and its subsidiaries and affiliates (the “Related Companies”) may
    also use Personal Data and other personally non-identifiable information
    collected through the Services to help us improve the content and
    functionality of the Services, to better understand our users and to improve
    the Services.</p>

    <p>If Broadly intends on using any Personal Data in any manner that is not
    consistent with this Privacy Policy, you will be informed of such anticipated
    use prior to or at the time at which the Personal Data is collected.</p>

    <h3>Our Disclosure of Your Personal Data and Other Information</h3>

    <p>Broadly is not in the business of selling your information. We consider this
    information to be a vital part of our relationship with you. There are, however,
    certain circumstances in which we may share your Personal Data with certain
    third parties without further notice to you, as set forth above in this Privacy
    Policy, and as follows:</p>

    <p><strong>Business Transfers:</strong> As we develop our business, we might
    sell or buy businesses or assets. In the event of a corporate sale, merger,
    reorganization, dissolution or similar event, Personal Data may be part of the
    transferred assets.</p>

    <p><strong>Related Companies:</strong> We may also share Personal Data with
    our Related Companies for purposes consistent with this Privacy Policy.</p>

    <p><strong>Agents, Consultants and Related Third Parties:</strong> Broadly,
    like many businesses, sometimes hires other companies to perform certain
    business-related functions. Examples of such functions include mailing
    information, maintaining databases and processing payments. When we employ
    another entity to perform a function of this nature, we only provide them with
    the information that they need to perform their specific function.</p>

    <p><strong>Legal Requirements:</strong> Broadly may disclose Personal Data if
    required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is
    necessary to (i) comply with a legal obligation, (ii) protect and defend the
    rights or property of Broadly, (iii) act in urgent circumstances to protect
    the personal safety of users of the Services or the public, or (iv) protect
    against legal liability.</p>

    <h3>Consumers’ Opt Out Rights</h3>

    <p>Our Subscribers’ Consumers can opt out of tracking by Broadly on a
    per-Subscriber basis by contacting us at <a href="mailto:privacy@broadly.com">privacy@broadly.com</a> or by clicking an
    unsubscribe link, preferences link, or opt out link as provided in our
    communications, messages, or sites. Consumers also may be able to easily opt
    out of tracking by Broadly directly from within the settings of their browser
    or device.</p>

    <p>As a Subscriber, you must plainly and conspicuously notify your Consumers
    that when they use your website or service, information about their activities
    online is being collected by a service that collects information about their
    activities across different websites, and describe the above opt-out
    procedures, in a privacy agreement or policy with your Consumers.</p>

    <p>Broadly is not responsible for any use by its Subscribers of any data
    regarding their Consumers. Those Consumers should review the policies of the
    applicable Subscriber(s) to understand their use of such data.</p>

    <h3>Your Choices</h3>

    <p>You can visit the Site without providing any Personal Data. If you choose
    not to provide any Personal Data, you may not be able to use certain
    Services.</p>

    <h3>Exclusions</h3>

    <p>This Privacy Policy does not apply to any Personal Data collected by
    Broadly other than Personal Data collected through the Services. This Privacy
    Policy shall not apply to any unsolicited information you provide to Broadly
    through the Services or through any other means. This includes, but is not
    limited to, information posted to any public areas of the Services, such as
    forums, any ideas for new products or modifications to existing products, and
    other unsolicited submissions (collectively, “Unsolicited Information”). All
    Unsolicited Information shall be deemed to be non-confidential and Broadly
    shall be free to reproduce, use, disclose, and distribute such Unsolicited
    Information to others without limitation or attribution.</p>

    <h3>Children</h3>

    <p>Broadly does not knowingly collect Personal Data from children under the
    age of 13. If you are under the age of 13, please do not submit any Personal
    Data through the Services. If you have reason to believe that a child under
    the age of 13 has provided Personal Data to Broadly through the Services,
    please contact us, and we will endeavor to delete that information from our
    databases.</p>

    <p>You may not use the Services: a) in connection with any product, service,
    or advertisement directed towards children or b) to collect any Personal Data
    of children.</p>

    <h3>Links to Other Web Sites</h3>

    <p>This Privacy Policy applies only to the Services. The Services may contain
    links to other web sites not operated or controlled by Broadly (the “Third
    Party Sites”). The policies and procedures we described here do not apply to
    the Third Party Sites. The links from the Services do not imply that Broadly
    endorses or has reviewed the Third Party Sites. We suggest contacting those
    sites directly for information on their privacy policies.</p>

    <h3>Security</h3>

    <p>Broadly takes reasonable steps to protect the Personal Data provided via
    the Services from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure,
    alteration, or destruction. However, no Internet or email transmission is ever
    fully secure or error free. In particular, email sent to or from the Services
    may not be secure.  Therefore, you should take special care in deciding what
    information you send to us via email.  Please keep this in mind when
    disclosing any Personal Data to Broadly via the Internet.</p>

    <h3>Changes to Broadly’s Privacy Policy</h3>

    <p>The Services and our business may change from time to time. As a result, at
    times it may be necessary for Broadly to make changes to this Privacy Policy.
    Broadly reserves the right to update or modify this Privacy Policy at any time
    and from time to time without prior notice. Please review this policy
    periodically, and especially before you provide any Personal Data. This
    Privacy Policy was last updated on the date indicated above. Your continued
    use of the Services after any changes or revisions to this Privacy Policy
    shall indicate your agreement with the terms of such revised Privacy
    Policy.</p>

    <h3>Access to Information; Contacting Broadly</h3>

    <p>To keep your Personal Data accurate, current, and complete, please contact
    us as specified below.  We will take reasonable steps to update or correct
    Personal Data in our possession that you have previously submitted via the
    Services.</p>

    <p>Please also feel free to contact us if you have any questions about
    Broadly’s Privacy Policy or the information practices of the Services.</p>
