								<p class="text">&nbsp;</p>
								<p class="text">This policy does not apply to the practices of companies that   Brookshire does not own or control or to people that Brookshire does not employ   or manage.

								<p class="text">We store information that we collect through cookies, log files,   clear gifs, and other tools to create a “profile” of your preferences.

								<p class="text">&nbsp;</p>
								<p class="text"><u>Aggregate Information (non-personally   identifiable)</u></p>
								<p class="text">We collect, store and use aggregate data that does not contain   personally identifiable information, including demographic or statistical   information. We may share aggregated demographic information about our user base   with our partners and advertisers to help us serve and understand our customers   better.

								<p class="text">&nbsp;</p>
								<p class="text"><u>Legal Disclaimer</u></p>
								<p class="text">We reserve the right to disclose your personally identifiable   information as required by law and when we believe it is necessary to share   information in order to protect the security of the Site, to investigate,   prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud,   situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person,   violations of Brookshire Grocery Company terms of use, or as otherwise required   by law (including a subpoena, interrogatory, or discovery request).</p>
								<p class="text">&nbsp;</p>
								<p class="text"><u>Choice/Opt-out</u></p>
								<p class="text">We provide you the opportunity to ‘opt-out’ of having your   personally identifiable information used for certain purposes, when we ask for   this information.

								<p class="text">&nbsp;</p>
								<p class="text"><u>Log Files</u></p>

								<p class="text">We use this information, which does not identify individual users,   to analyze trends, to administer the Site, to track users’ movements around the   Site, optimize the Site and to gather demographic information about our user   base as a whole. </p>
								<p class="text">&nbsp;</p>
								<p class="text">We use a third-party tracking service (e.g.SurfStats, Web Trends,   etc) that may use cookies to track non-personally identifiable information about   visitors to the Site in the aggregate that we used to improve the experience of   the Site. </p>
								<p class="text">&nbsp;</p>
								<p class="text"><u>Cookies</u></p>
								<p class="text">"Cookies" are small pieces of information sent by a web server to   a web browser, which enables the server to collect information from the browser.   The Site uses cookies for a number of purposes. For example: to enable   simplification of the logging on process for registered users, to help ensure   the security and authenticity of registered users, to provide the mechanisms for   online shopping and to enable traffic monitoring.</p>
								<p class="text">&nbsp;</p>
								<p class="text">We use both session ID cookies and/or persistent cookies. We use   session cookies to make it easier for you to navigate our Site. A session ID   cookie expires when you close you browser. A persistent cookie remains on your   hard drive for an extended period of time. You can remove persistent cookies by   following directions provided in your Internet browser's “help” file. Persistent   cookies also enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance   the experience on our Site.</p>
								<p class="text">Most browsers allow you to turn off the cookie function. If you   want to know how to do this please look at the help menu on your browser. As   described above, this will restrict the online services you can use.</p>
								<p class="text">&nbsp;</p>
								<p class="text"><u>Clear Gifs (Web Beacons)</u></p>
								<p class="text">We use clear gifs on the Site from Google Analytics and other 3rd   party vendors. This enables us to gauge the effectiveness of our services and   marketing programs.</p>
								<p class="text">&nbsp;</p>
								<p class="text"><u>Links to Other Sites</u></p>
								<p class="text">This website contains links to other sites that are not owned or   controlled by Brookshire. Please be aware that we are not responsible for the   privacy or security policies or practices of such other sites. Any personal   information that you provide when accessing a third-party website is subject to   the third-party’s security and privacy policies. Brookshire is not responsible   for any information that you provide to a third party.</p>
								<p class="text">We encourage you to be aware when you leave our site and to read   the privacy policy of each and every website that collects personally   identifiable information.</p>
								<p class="text">&nbsp;</p>
								<p class="text">This Privacy Policy applies only to information collected by this   website. </p>
								<p class="text">&nbsp;</p>
								<p class="text"><u>Security</u></p>
								<p class="text">The security of your personal information is very important to us.   When you enter sensitive information (such as a credit card number) on our order   forms, we encrypt that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL).   Once we received the data it is immediately re-encrypted prior to storage. By   default, payment card data is permanently destroyed within 91 days of   submission. </p>
								<p class="text">We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the   personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we   receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic   storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, while we strive to protect your   personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>
								<p class="text">&nbsp;</p>
								<p class="text"><u>Children</u></p>
								<p class="text">Parent should always supervise their children while online.   Brookshire’s website is not designed nor intended to collect personal   information from children under the age of thirteen. So that we may comply with   the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act, we ask that children under the age   of thirteen not provide any personal information on this website.</p>
								<p class="text">&nbsp;</p>
								<p class="text"><u>Changes in this Privacy Policy</u></p>
								<p class="text">We reserve the right to modify this Privacy Policy at any time, so   please review it frequently. If we make material changes to this policy, we will   notify you here or by means of a notice on our home page. </p>
