The renowned schools. The panoramic beauty and proximity to Manhattan. That\u2019s why I\u2019m here, too. I know Brooklyn Heights, Cobble Hill, and Carroll Gardens intimately because I was born here and have made finding your home in the Heights my business for more than 30 years.\r\n\r\nI am an independent real-estate broker, and I\u2019ve made that independence the hallmark of my 30-year career. I don\u2019t join the open-house parade or display dozens of properties on our site in the hope that one might suit you. I open the door to a select group of distinctive homes that meet your family\u2019s needs and aspirations.\r\n\r\nMy long-time clients depend on my knowledge and experience in Brooklyn real estate to find the one home that meets their needs and aspirations. On behalf of those clients, I have successfully sold many of the finest homes and apartments in Brooklyn Heights and Brownstone Brooklyn.\r\n\r\nI was born and raised in Brooklyn Heights, and my business is built on the loyalty, friendships and trust I have earned over the years. My clients, public personalities or neighborhood friends, depend on my discretion and my respect for their privacy. I have had the good fortune to forge relationships with many families over the decades, now with children following their parents as my clients. Because I have found a place in the lives of the families who are the heart of Brownstone Brooklyn, I have led the market in home sales for decades.\r\n\r\nAs an independent broker, I can follow my instincts in a range of real-estate opportunities. For example, I have consulted with and represented many Brooklyn institutions buying and selling real estate, including Brooklyn Law School, Poly Technical, Grace Church, Brooklyn Catholic Diocese and Trinity Church. I have also sold commercial property in the Heights and surrounding neighborhoods. I successfully represent the grand mansions that periodically come available as well as the quality condo and co-op market, and occasional finer rentals.

Unless they\u2019ve worked with Imma Giocoli. Enthusiastic. Intelligent. Creative thinker. Problem solver. These are just a few of the accolades Imma has received from former clients\u2014praise that is hard earned and well deserved.\r\n\r\nA born and bred New Yorker, Imma began her career in real estate 15 years ago out of a passion to help others. For her, success is not the amount of money in the bank, but the amount of people she\u2019s able to assist in making their dreams come true, or maximizing their investments. Whether her clients are outgrowing a small apartment, looking to downsize from a large house, or searching for an investment property or commercial space, Imma guides them through the process with professionalism, transparency, and an unerring eye for detail.\r\n\r\nImma\u2019s wide-ranging background has served her well in a competitive market. Before becoming a broker, she spent 20 years in the travel industry, consistently meeting the exacting standards of corporate and celebrity clients. Her tenure at three top real estate firms\u2014The Corcoran Group, Douglas Elliman, and Fillmore\u2014gave her extensive knowledge of Brooklyn as well as all five boroughs and surrounding areas of New York City, from Hell\u2019s Kitchen to the Hampton Bays. Along the way Imma built a network of professional and personal connections she\u2019s able to call on to this day.\r\n\r\n\"I never allowed any one neighborhood to define me, I am a Real Estate Expert regardless of where the Real Estate is\". Imma says.\r\n\r\nThe quality that truly sets Imma apart is something that cannot be taught\u2014an intuition that has helped her sense when one neighborhood is peaking while another is on the rise. This sensitivity to market trends inspired Imma to establish her own company\u2014Tyler Vincent Real Estate\u2014in 2016, with the vision of transforming the very business model used in real estate.\r\n\r\nIn stark contrast to the gleaming, impersonal interiors of many firms, Tyler Vincent\u2019s \u201coffice\u201d is the welcoming parlor floor of a Carroll Gardens townhouse. In this intimate setting, clients enjoy greater privacy, unsurpassed customer service, and maybe even a cup of tea. Imma's vison for the Industry is to up level the service and the transparency to clients. A conference space on the garden level below allows Imma to conduct seminars and group chats for new brokers just starting out in the field or for those looking for a different approach. It is a personally rewarding way for Imma to share practical advice about the process of buying and selling real estate while staying true to a deep desire to strengthen communication and cooperation among her colleagues.

A resident of this great city for over 20 years, Jeff uses his vast market knowledge, discerning eye for value and expert management skills honed over his successful career in film and television to streamline his clients' real estate experiences. \r\n\r\nA former casting director, Jeff works extremely well with people of all kinds and is highly adept at reading individuals' own unique needs. He also has a great vision and sense of style that enable him to see potential in any property, combined with experience of having renovated his own homes. \r\n\r\nJeff wants to help you find your dream home as well. He will scour the many housing options available and pare it down to the select few that meet your needs so as not to waste your time. He'd like to believe that everyone could be as happy and fortunate as he and his wife were when they found their first apartment and their first home, each on the first day of searching!

                            <span><p>Your privacy is important to us at Brownstoner LLC. (“Brownstoner”, “we”, or “our”). Accordingly, we have established and implemented information handling practices for brownstoner.com (the “Site”) that we believe are consistent with the highest standards and best practices of organizations doing business on the Internet. This Privacy Policy describes the practices that apply to the Site, including, specifically, the information we collect about you, when and how we collect that information and what may happen to that information. We have prepared this detailed Privacy Policy because we believe you should know as much as possible about our practices so that you can make informed decisions about how you use the Site. Capitalized terms in this Privacy Policy have the meaning ascribed to them in the Terms of Use <a href="http://brownstoner.com/terms-of-use/">http://brownstoner.com/terms-of-use/</a>.</p>
<p><strong>When You Visit The Site </strong></p>
<p>You can always visit the Site without revealing who you are or providing any personal information. When you visit the Site we do collect usage information, but it is anonymous and is not linked to you as an individual. We may use this data to better understand, for example, how the Site is navigated, how many visitors arrive at specific pages, the length and frequency of stays at the Site, the types of browsers and computer operating systems used by our visitors and the Internet Protocol addresses from which our visitors connect to the Site. We may use this information to improve the Site’s Content and ease of use.</p>
<p><strong>When You Become a User </strong></p>
<p>When you sign up as a User, you provide us with information such as your name, email address, zip code and other contact information. We may use the information you provide on or through the Site to improve the Site’s Content and ease of use, or as you otherwise consent in advance. We will take all reasonable efforts to protect this information, and we will not share it with third parties such as direct marketers without your request or consent. However, <em>you acknowledge and agree that we may provide your personal information (a) to third-party providers of services to the Site, such as computer programmers and technicians, provided that they are under obligation to us to protect this information, and (b) to other third parties when compelled by a court order or other legal process. </em></p>
<p><strong>Security</strong></p>
<p>The Site has security measures in place to protect against the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control. We safeguard the security of the data you send us with physical, electronic, and other procedures. However, it is not possible to guarantee the security or integrity of information disclosed online. Because no data transmission over the Internet is completely secure, we urge you to take every precaution to protect your personal data when you are on the Internet, including when you are using the Site.</p>
<p><strong>When You Post Content </strong></p>
<p>Users may post or upload User Content to the Site. As between Brownstoner LLC. and you and between other Users and you, you are the owner of all User Content that you upload, email or post to or within the Site. You grant us permission to use all such User Content on and in connection with the Site. For more information, see the Terms of Use <a href="http://brownstoner.com/terms-of-use/">http://brownstoner.com/terms-of-use/</a> for the Site. When You Submit Feedback to Us In order to submit comments or questions to the site, you will have to register for a user account, a process that involves, among other disclosures, the provision of your email address. We will not disclose your email address or other personal information to third parties, except as expressly set forth in this Privacy Policy. We may contact you via the email address you provide to answer your question(s), clarify the information you have submitted and send you emails, from time to time, as part of our Email List. (For additional information, see the Email List section of the Terms of Use <a href="http://brownstoner.com/terms-of-use/">http://brownstoner.com/terms-of-use/</a>.)</p>
<p><strong>Cookies and Pixel Tags </strong></p>
<p>We, or a third-party advertiser acting on our behalf, may place a “cookie” or “pixel tag” on your personal computer when you come to the Site or visit a site on which we advertise. These devices are small computer files that our computer sends to your computer and that your computer sends back to us each time you visit the Site. We may use these devices to collect data to help us personalize and improve your experiences on the Site. Most Internet browsers automatically accept cookies. However, you can instruct your browser, by editing its options, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the sites you visit. If you decide not to accept our cookies, your ability to use some features on the Site may be impaired.</p>
<p><strong>Third-Party Advertisers </strong></p>
<p>We allow third-party companies to serve ads and/or collect certain anonymous information when you visit our web site. These companies may use non-personally identifiable information (e.g., click stream information, browser type, time and date, subject of advertisements clicked or scrolled over) during your visits to this and other Web sites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services likely to be of greater interest to you. These companies typically use a cookie or third party web beacon to collect this information. To learn more about this behavioral advertising practice or to opt-out of this type of advertising, you can visit <a href="http://networkadvertising.org" target="_blank">networkadvertising.org</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Links to Third-Party Websites </strong></p>
<p>The Site may contain links to other websites. Please be aware that we are not responsible for the privacy practices of other websites. We encourage you to be aware when you leave the Site and to read the privacy statements of every website that collects personally identifiable information. Our Privacy Policy applies solely to information collected by the Site and does not cover information collected elsewhere.</p>
<p><strong>California Privacy Rights </strong></p>
<p>Pursuant to California Civil Code § 1798.83, a California resident who has provided personal information to a business with which he/she has established a business relationship has the right to request from that business information about whether the business has disclosed personal information to any third parties for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes. In general, if the business has made such a disclosure of personal information, the business is required to provide a list of all third parties to whom such personal information was disclosed in the preceding calendar year, as well as a list of the categories of personal information that were disclosed, upon receipt of a request by a California resident. However, under the law, a business is not required to provide the above-described lists if the business adopts and discloses to the public (in its privacy policy) a policy of not disclosing personal information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes unless the customer first affirmatively agrees to the disclosure, as long as the business maintains and discloses this policy. Rather, the business may comply with the law by notifying the customer of his or her right to prevent disclosure of personal information and providing a cost free means to exercise that right. As noted above, we do not disclose such personal information to third parties for direct marketing purposes unless you affirmatively agree to such disclosure.</p>
<p><strong>Modifications to this Privacy Policy </strong></p>
<p>Brownstoner LLC. reserves the right to change the terms, conditions, and notices in this Privacy Policy at any time for any reason. If you have questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact us at <a href="mailto:brownstoner@brownstoner.com">brownstoner@brownstoner.com</a>.</p>
