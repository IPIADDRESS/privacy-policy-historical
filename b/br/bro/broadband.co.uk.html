<h3>Information we collect and how we collect it</h3>
<p>When you use our website or any of our other services we may collect personal information about you. The type of personal information we collect will vary depending on the services you are using.</p>
<p>In many instances, we ask for your consent to process this information (for example, when you register to receive our email newsletters); in other instances the lawful basis under which we collect and use your personal information may be that it is necessary for the performance of a contract or pre-contractual steps. In all other instances the legal basis under which we collect and use your personal information is that it is necessary for our legitimate business interests (for example, for monitoring and improving our services or to make sure that our marketing communications are relevant to you).</p>
<p>You have a right to object to this processing and the section <em>"How to get your information corrected or request we stop using it"</em> explains how you can do this.</p>
<p>We may collect:</p>
<ul>
    <li>your postcode if you provide these when performing a broadband availability lookup or speed test, or when leaving a review or registering to receive email newsletters;</li>
    <li>your landline phone number if you choose to enter this to improve the accuracy of a broadband availability lookup;</li>

    <li>your current broadband supplier should you enter this while testing your broadband speed or while leaving a review;</li>
    <li>the results of your broadband lookups and tests performed using our tools, stored against your IP address and other details of your broadband line;</li>
    <li>your phone number if you call a supplier's call centre to place an order, or contact our phone desk for broadband advice;</li>

    <li>details of the pages you visit, the links you click, and the personalisation you choose to save to your browser through the use of cookies</li>
</ul>
<p>In all instances where we collect your personal information, we act as a data controller.</p>
<p>The next sections explain how we use your personal information.</p>
<h4>Postcode, phone number and IP address collection for broadband availability and testing</h4>
<p>We may ask for your postcode and optionally your landline telephone number when offering our broadband comparison and testing services or offering help with technical problems. Unless you have asked for extra investigation, this information is used only to look up the availability of broadband products and services in your area. It will not be used to contact you. We use trusted third party API services to look up broadband availability information for the postcode and/or phone number you supplied to us.</p>
<p>Speed tests will record your detected IP address, your tested speed and any other information you entered on the form during this or previous visits within the last 30 days. Your saved information is held in a cookie and will be displayed on the form, you may click a link to change (forget) this data if you wish. We use a trusted third party reporting supplier to record the details of speed tests. We may also optionally request your postcode during speed tests in order to supply you with useful comparative information about the broadband speed estimates, products and services available in your area, as above.</p>
<p>Neither we nor our service providers will use the information collected to identify or contact you, unless you have specifically asked for this, for example through our web forms such as when requesting that we investigate a technical problem you have experienced.</p>
<p>Postcodes, phone numbers and other information from logs may from time to time be used for testing purposes when ensuring that our website continues to give high quality accurate results for a range of real world geographical and phone line details.</p>
<h4>The results of broadband lookups and tests performed using our tools</h4>
<p>We may record the results of tools you make use of, such as broadband availability or speed test results. These may be used for research purposes or to personalise your experience to continue to display relevant offers and information on other site pages, or when you return on subsequent visits.</p>
<p>If you have requested to receive our email newsletter, these results may be recorded alongside your email address and detected IP address in order to allow us to send you the most relevant and useful email content.</p>
<p>We use cookies to store the history of your broadband speed tests on a particular device and web browser for up to two years. If you log in with your Facebook account, we will also associate your speed test history with your Facebook identity, allowing you to view a combined history of test results from different devices and browsers. We do not store this information on Facebook’s servers.</p>
<p>We may aggregate and collate the data we record from availability lookups and speed tests in order to publish research on the state of broadband in the UK. These reports may be derived from details recorded from your form data, your detected IP address or geographical information derived from your postcode. These reports may report on trends in broadband nationally, across specific broadband providers, specific types of broadband or specific broad geographical areas etc. They will not identify individual site users.</p>
<h4>Email address, phone number and personal information collection when you request for us to contact you</h4>
<p>If you request that we email you a copy of your checker results, your email address and the name you gave us will be used to send you a copy of your broadband availability including any postcode and phone number you entered. Details of emails sent are stored by our server. We will not contact you further unless you have requested that we do so. In future we may offer emailed copies of other results or confirmations</p>
<p>Our email newsletter is an opt in service, you may subscribe directly through sign up forms or by an opt in tick box on other forms, in all cases you will be sent a confirmation email link which you must accept before your free subscription is completed. If you have requested that we do so, our agents may also subscribe you to the list directly, in this case a confirmation will still be required.</p>
<p>While you are subscribed to the newsletter, we may contact you to provide you with details of broadband offers and promotions, including related services, we may also contact you about news stories related to broadband and about changes to the content and features of our website.</p>
<p>We may request that you also give us your postcode and/or phone number when you subscribe to our mailing list, as outlined above, these are only used for broadband availability lookups, so we may provide you with more relevant information about products and offers available in your postcode area or to your phone line, or to inform you of changes in the availability of broadband where you live. If you signed up for the newsletter through our speed test, we may record this information and whether your tested speed was slower than expected, and use this to offer more relevant emails.</p>
<p>By subscribing to our newsletter you are agreeing to be contacted by email and to have your details stored by our mailing list supplier, including supplementary information used to offer you more relevant emails. Our mailing list services are provided using a trusted third party service, MailChimp, who will store your details and track the links that you have clicked in emails to allow us to monitor the success of our campaigns. Our emails may contain promotional, sponsored or advertising content, and we will make every effort to ensure that this is accurate, useful and relevant to you. We and our service provider comply with the Privacy and Electronic Communication Regulations 2003 and other UK legislation relating to marketing emails. You can manage your subscription to our mailing list, including amending your details or leaving the list entirely, by use of the MailChimp website, by clicking the unsubscribe link at the bottom of our emails or by emailing us to request that we remove you from the list. <a href="http://mailchimp.com/legal/privacy/">MailChimp's privacy policy can be viewed here</a>.</p>

By phoning our helpline or by entering your details into the Call Back booking form you are agreeing to be contacted by SimplifyDigital. Your information may be passed between Broadband.co.uk and SimplifyDigital and passed on to broadband suppliers to whom you have agreed to be referred or subscribed. <a href="http://www.simplifydigital.co.uk/corporate/privacy-policy/">SimplifyDigital's privacy policy can be viewed here</a>.</p>
<p>From time to time we may offer competitions in partnership with trusted third parties such as broadband providers, if so your details may be passed to those third parties. We or our partner will only record the information necessary to administer the competition and will only ask for further details, such as those needed to send you your prize, if you are drawn as a winner. Terms and conditions of the competition will be supplied before you enter.</p>
<h4>Personal information collected when you leave us reviews or testimonials, or contact us to give feedback or ask for advice</h4>
<p>If you contact us through a web form or via our Ask The Expert email service or other email addresses, the details that you sent are stored on both our web server and on our email server. We may use parts of the messages you send us to help answer questions from other users of our services, or to produce frequently asked questions or other web, email or downloadable materials designed to help other visitors to our site. All identifying details will be removed and your message entirely anonymised before it is published, or if not we will seek your express permission.</p>
<p>When helping to solve technical problems with your broadband, we may ask for further information such as your street address, your broadband provider, your tested broadband speed, when you began your contract, or details of how your home broadband setup is configured. Street address information will only be used for broadband availability and status lookups when a postcode or phone number is not adequate. We will not ask for any unnecessary information, nor will we pass your contact details on to others without your permission.</p>
<p>If you send us positive feedback, we may ask your permission to use this feedback as a testimonial to be published on our site, in marketing emails or other promotional materials. All testimonials published on our site had the express permission of our users, or of the users of the third party service provider involved.</p>
<p>Our web contact forms and live chat services are run by trusted third party service providers, as is our email server. These service providers will not contact you for any purpose unless you or we have requested that they do so on our behalf. We and our service providers keep logs of messages sent through forms including the name and message you entered, the URL you were visiting from, your IP address and the web browser you used.</p>
<p>Reviews that you submit to us are stored on our website and vetted by a moderator. Approved reviews will be displayed publicly on the website under the name and location you gave and will indicate the broadband provider you reviewed. We reserve the right to edit reviews for length or to remove identifying, libellous or inappropriate content, or to refuse reviews for any reason. Reviews containing links will not be displayed. We may opt to make your review a feature review and give it additional prominence on our site or include it in the content of our email newsletter or other promotional materials.</p>
<p>We may contact you by the email address that you entered if there is a problem with your review or if we wish to use your review for any other purpose than those outlined here. We will not contact you further unless you have requested that we do so.</p>
<p>During the speed test or while leaving a review of your provider you may optionally rate the quality, reliability, customer service and speed of your broadband service. This information is collated and used to provide star ratings to help other visitors to our site make better comparisons between broadband suppliers. Ratings recorded during speed tests will not be displayed to other site users except as part of an average score. Ratings entered during a review will be displayed alongside your review.</p>

<h3>Where we transfer your information</h3>
<p>Some of the personal information we collect may be transferred to, and stored at, a destination outside the European Union (EU). It may also be processed by staff operating outside the EU who work for us or for one of our suppliers.</p>
<p>The only country outside the EU to which we transfer your personal information is the United States (US).

Many of the companies we use are certified by the Privacy Shield framework, which ensures an adequate level of protection for your personal information and respect for your rights. If US companies are not part of the Privacy Shield framework, then we engage with them using Model Contract Clauses approved by the European Commission. These contracts ensure those companies provide you with appropriate safeguards and enforceable legal rights.</p>
<p>Additionally, we have written agreements with all the companies based in the US to ensure they cannot process your personal information for any other purposes or share it with any other companies without our express permission.</p>
<p>By submitting your personal information to us, you agree to this transfer, storing or processing.</p>
