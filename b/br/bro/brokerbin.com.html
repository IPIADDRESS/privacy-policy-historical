        </h1>
        <br>
        <h2 class="subtitle is-2"><strong>Last Revised: May 24th, 2018</strong></h2>
        <p>We at BrokerBin respect Your privacy. The Privacy Policy describes the types of personal information
            We collect, how We use the information, with whom We share it, and the rights of and choices available to
            individuals regarding Our use of their information. We also describe the measures We take to protect the
            security of the information and how You can contact us about Our privacy practices and to exercise Your rights.
        </p><br>

        <!--<h2 class="subtitle is-2">EU-US and Swiss-US Privacy Shield Notice</h2>
        <p>We may receive Personal Data from individuals in the European
            Economic Area and/or Switzerland. We adhere to the EU-US and the Swiss-US Privacy Shield Principles (Privacy Shield
            Principles), with respect to the collection, use, and retention of Personal Data from the European Economic Area and
            Switzerland.  If there is any conflict between the terms in this Privacy Statement and the Privacy Shield
            Principles, with respect to the processing of Personal Data from the European Economic Area and/or Switzerland, the
            Privacy Shield Principles shall govern.  For more information about the Privacy Shield Framework, and to view
            BrokerBin’s certification, go to https://www.privacyshield.gov/.</p><br/>
        <p>In compliance with the Privacy Shield Principles, We are committed to resolving complaints about Our collection or
            use of Your Personal Data.  European Union and Swiss individuals with inquiries or complaints regarding Our
            compliance with the Privacy Shield Principles should first contact us as discussed below in the “How to Contact Us”
            section.  In certain circumstances, it may be possible for You to invoke binding arbitration.  BrokerBin is subject
            to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the United Stated Federal Trade Commission, with respect to its
            adherence to the Privacy Shield Principles.</p><br/>
        <p>We are further committed to cooperate
            with European Union and Swiss data protection authorities (DPAs) with respect to any unresolved Privacy Shield
            complaints concerning Your Personal Data, in the context of the employment relationship.  If You do not receive
            timely acknowledgement of Your complaint from us, or if We have not addressed Your complaint to Your satisfaction,
            please contact the European Union and/or Swiss DPAs for more information or to file a complaint.  The services of
            the European Union and Swiss DPAs are provided at no cost to You.</p><br/>
        <p>As discussed below in the “Information We Share” section, We may share Your Personal Data with Our service providers
            who are bound by law and/or contract to protect Your Personal Data and may only use Your Personal Data in accordance
            with Our instructions.  Under certain circumstances, BrokerBin may remain liable for the acts of these third
            parties, if they subsequently process the data in a manner that is inconsistent with the Privacy Shield Principles.
        </p><br/>
        <p>Also as discussed below in the “Information We Share” section, We may disclose Your Personal Data when requested
            under legal process or as otherwise required by law, such as in response to a subpoena, including to meet national
            security and/or law enforcement requirements in the United States and other countries where We operate.</p><br/>-->

        <h2 class="subtitle is-2">Information We Collect</h2>
        <p>We collect personal information about You in various ways, such as through this site and social media channels; at
            Our events and through phone and fax; and in connection with Our interactions with clients and vendors. We may
            collect the following types of personal information (as permitted under local law): contact information (such as
            name, postal address, email address and telephone number); username and password when You register on this site;
            geolocation data in connection with certain features of this site; information You provide about friends or other
            people You would like us to contact; and other information You may provide to us, such as in surveys or through the
            “Contact Us” feature on this site.</p><br>

        <h2 class="subtitle is-2">Information Collected By Automated Means</h2>
        <p>When You visit this site, We may collect certain information by automated means, such as cookies, web beacons and web
            server logs. The information We may collect in this manner includes IP address, unique device identifier, browser
            characteristics, device characteristics, operating system, language preferences, referring URLs, information on actions
            taken on this site, dates and times of visits to this site and other usage statistics. A 'cookie' is a file that websites
            send to a visitor's computer or other Internet-connected device to uniquely identify the visitor's browser or to store
            information or settings in the browser. A 'web beacon', also known as an Internet tag, pixel tag or clear GIF, links web
            pages to web servers and their cookies and is used to transmit information collected through cookies back to a web server.
            Through these automated collection methods, We may obtain 'clickstream data', which is a log of the links and other content
            on which a visitor clicks while browsing a website. As the visitor clicks through the website, a record of the action may be
            collected and stored. We link certain data elements We have collected through automated means, such as Your browser information,
            with other information We have obtained about You to let us know, for example, whether You have opened an email We sent to You.
            Your browser may tell You how to be notified when You receive certain types of cookies or how to restrict or disable certain
            types of cookies. Please note, however, that without cookies You may not be able to use all of the features of this site. To the
            extent required by applicable law, We will obtain Your consent before collecting personal information using cookies or similar
            automated means.
        </p><br>
        <p>The providers of third-party apps, tools, widgets and plug-ins on this site, such as social media sharing tools, also may use
            automated means to collect information regarding Your interactions with these features. This information is collected directly
            by the providers of the features and is subject to the privacy policies or notices of these providers. Subject to applicable law,
            BrokerBin is not responsible for these providers' information practices.
        </p><br>

        <h2 class="subtitle is-2">How We Use the Information We Collect</h2>
        <p>We use the information described above to perform the following activities (as permitted under local law): creating
            and managing online accounts; managing Our client and vendor relationships; sending promotional materials, alerts
            regarding available positions and other communications; communicating about, and administering participation in,
            special events, promotions, programs, offers, surveys, contests and market research; responding to individuals’
            inquiries; operating, evaluating and improving Our business (including developing, enhancing, analyzing and
            improving Our services; managing Our communications; performing data analytics; and performing accounting, auditing
            and other internal functions); protecting against, identifying and seeking to prevent fraud and other unlawful
            activity, claims and other liabilities; and complying with and enforcing applicable legal requirements, relevant
            industry standards, contractual obligations and Our policies.</p><br>
        <p>We also may use the information in other ways for which We provide specific notice at or prior to the time of
            collection.</p><br>
        <p>In addition, We use information collected through cookies, web beacons, pixels, web server logs and other automated
            means for purposes such as customizing Our users’ use of this site; delivering content tailored to Our users’
            interests and the manner in which Our users use this site; and managing this site and other aspects of Our business.
            To the extent required by applicable law, We will obtain Your consent before collecting information using cookies or
            similar automated means.
        </p><br>
        <p>We also use third-party analytics services on this site, such as those of Google Analytics. The analytics providers
            that administer these services use technologies such as cookies, web server logs and web beacons to help us analyze
            Your use of Our Sites. The information collected through these means (including IP address) may be disclosed to
            these analytics providers and other relevant third parties who use the information, for example, to evaluate use of
            the Sites. To learn more about these analytics services and how to opt out, please visit the following sites and any
            sites contained in the country-specific addenda:

        <h2 class="subtitle is-2">Job Applicants</h2>
        <p>If You have applied for employment with BrokerBin, the Personal Data submitted with Your job application will be used
            to process and consider Your job application. We will not sell the data on Your application to unaffiliated
            third-parties for their marketing purposes. We may share the data on Your applications with recruiters, consultants,
            attorneys, background services and Our affiliates. The data on Your application may also be used for certain
            regulatory, compliance and legal purposes, consistent with this Privacy Statement.
        </p><br>
        <p>To the extent the Personal Data You provide contains details of Your: racial or ethnic origin; political opinions or

            sexual life; commission (or alleged commission) of an offence or related proceedings; job evaluations or educational

            the other purposes described herein.
        </p><br>
        <p>By submitting data to us online, You are sending it to the United States, where it will be subject to the protections
            afforded under US laws that may be different from the laws in Your country and which Your country may consider not
            to provide adequate privacy protections. If You do not agree that Your submission of Your application data will be
            governed solely by United States law, BrokerBin will not accept Your application.
        </p><br>

        <h2 class="subtitle is-2">Interest-Based Advertising</h2>
        <p>On this site, We may collect information about Your online activities to provide You with advertising about products
            and services tailored to Your individual interests. We also may obtain information for this purpose from third-party
            websites on which Our ads are served. This section of Our Global Privacy Policy provides details and explains how to
            exercise Your choices.
        </p><br>

        <h2 class="subtitle is-2">Information We Share</h2>
        <p>We share the personal information We collect from You with vendors who perform services on Our behalf based on Our
            instructions. We do not authorize these vendors to use or disclose the information except as necessary to perform
            services on Our behalf or comply with legal requirements.
        </p><br>
        <p>In addition, We may disclose information about You if We are required to do so by law or legal process; to law
            enforcement authorities or other government officials based on a lawful disclosure request; and when We believe
            disclosure is necessary or appropriate to prevent physical harm or financial loss, or in connection with an
            investigation of suspected or actual fraudulent or illegal activity. We also reserve the right to transfer personal
            information We have about You in the event We sell or transfer all or a portion of Our business or assets
            (including in the event of a reorganization, dissolution or liquidation).
        </p><br>
        <p>Information collected through third-party plug-ins and widgets on this site (such as information relating to Your use
            of a social media sharing tool) is collected directly by the providers of the plug-ins and widgets. This information
            is subject to the privacy policies of the providers of the plug-ins and widgets, and [Company Name] is not
            responsible for those providers’ information practices.
        </p><br>

        <h2 class="subtitle is-2">Your Rights And Choices</h2>
        <p>We offer You certain choices in connection with the personal information We collect about You and how We communicate
            with You. To update Your preferences, ask us to remove Your information from Our mailing lists, exercise Your rights
            or submit a request, please contact us as indicated in the “How to Contact Us” section of this Privacy Policy. To

            legitimate grounds to the processing of Your personal information, and We will apply Your preferences going forward.
        </p><br>

        <h2 class="subtitle is-2">Data Transfers</h2>
        <p>We may transfer the personal information We collect about You to countries outside of the country in which the
            information originally was collected. Those countries may not have the same data protection laws as the country in
            which You initially provided the information. When We transfer Your information to other countries, We will protect
            that information as described in this Privacy Policy.
        </p><br>

        <h2 class="subtitle is-2">How We Protect Personal Information</h2>

            sites, apps or services.
        </p><br>
