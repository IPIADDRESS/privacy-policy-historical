    <p>This policy (together with our terms of use and any other
documents referred to on it) sets out the basis on which any
personal data we collect from you, or that you provide to us, will
be processed by us. Please read this Privacy Policy carefully to

    <p>We take your privacy and the security of your personal
information very seriously. We comply with the Data Protection Act
1998 and we are registered with the Information Commissioner's
Office (ICO Registration No. Z932912X). If you have any queries

    <h2>The information we collect</h2>
    <p>We may collect and process personal information about you, which
you give to us when you use our Website. The type of personal
information we collect will vary depending on the services you are
using on our Website:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>details of your visits to our Website including, but not
limited to, traffic data, location data, weblogs and other
communication data and the resources that you access (<a href="/cookie-policy" title="Cookie Policy">please see our
Cookie policy for more information</a>);</li>
      <li>your name, email address, current broadband supplier and other
personal information if you register with us to access one of our
tools (for example our Speedtester) or to receive our email
newsletters;</li>
      <li>your postcode if you perform an availability check for
broadband suppliers available in your area;</li>
      <li>more detailed personal information if you place an order for
home phone services through our sister website
homephonechoices.co.uk; and</li>
      <li>if you contact us (for example our Online Help Desk), we may
keep a record of your email address and that correspondence and any
information that you provide by filling in forms on our
Website.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The provision of some of our services may also require us to
store some personal information. We will periodically review your
personal information to ensure that we do not keep it for longer
than is necessary.</p>
    <h2>Purposes for which we use your personal information</h2>
    <p>We may use your personal information:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>to monitor and improve the performance of our Website and
services;</li>
      <li>to carry out research and analysis of the broadband, phone or
digital TV marketplace;</li>
      <li>to provide you with emails and newsletters and special offers
if you register with us;</li>
      <li>to provide an availability check of specific broadband, home
phone or TV services in your area;</li>
      <li>to fulfil our obligations if you enter a prize draw or
competition;</li>
      <li>to process a transaction between you and a third party which
you have requested;</li>
      <li>to respond to an enquiry you have made;</li>
      <li>to prevent fraud and defend our legal rights; and</li>
      <li>as more fully detailed, below.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The data that we collect from you may be transferred to, and
stored at, a destination outside the European Economic Area
("EEA"). It may also be processed by staff operating outside the
EEA who work for us or for one of our suppliers. By submitting your
personal data, you agree to this transfer, storing or processing.
We will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your
data is treated securely and in accordance with this Privacy
Policy.</p>
    <h2>Improving our services</h2>
    <p>So that we can continually improve our Website and services, we
may use your data to perform statistical analysis to help
understand how people are using our services. On occasions we may
ask you for feedback on your experience of using the Website.
Unless otherwise stated, this information is only used internally
and will not be published on the Website.</p>
    <h2>Research and analysis</h2>
    <p>We may use your data to perform research and analysis to better
understand the geographic coverage and use of broadband, phone or
digital TV services in the UK.  Some of the results of this
research may appear in articles and features on our Website and
other media but it will not include your personal information in
any such results and we will not disclose any user's email address
or any level of personal information that would enable any third
party to contact or identify a particular individual (for example a
full name and full area of residency).</p>
    <h2>Informing you of special offers and services which may be of
interest when you register with us</h2>
    <div>
      <p>We would like to keep you updated, by email or text, of other
products and services which we feel you may benefit from or which
you have specifically indicated that you have an interest in
through our registration process.</p>
    </div>
    <p>We engage a third party email technology partner to help us
coordinate and manage our email newsletters. They may process and
store your personal information on our behalf in their systems
subject to strict compliance with the Data Protection Act 1998.
They will not contact you directly or share your personal
information with any third parties.</p>
    <p>We may obtain additional personal information from third parties
to enable us to improve the relevance of our communications to
you.</p>
    <p>You can easily unsubscribe from our emails at any time, either
by clicking the "unsubscribe" link at the bottom of any electronic
correspondence (may take up to 7 days to take effect); or by
emailing us at <a href="mailto:dpo@broadbandchoices.co.uk" title="Email link for Data Protection Officer">dpo@broadbandchoices.co.uk</a>.</p>
    <h2>Broadband and home phone availability check</h2>
    <p>If you carry out an availability check on our Website, we use
your postcode for the purpose of carrying out that check.</p>
    <p>Different providers supply services to different parts of the
country and this is determined by postcode. The postcode check is
essential to find out which providers and home phone and broadband
services are available in your postcode area.</p>
    <h2>Testimonials, case studies, prize draws and surveys</h2>
    <p>We may republish comments and testimonials sent to us by our
users when they provide information by way of Case Study
application forms and survey responses. These comments and
testimonials may appear in articles and features on our Website and
other media. We will not disclose any user's email address or any
level of personal information that would enable any third party to
contact or identify a particular individual (for example a full
name and full area of residency). If you do not want us to
republish any comments or testimonials then this should be clearly
indicated and we will comply with your request.</p>
    <div>
      <h2>Fulfilling an order you have placed</h2>
      <p>If you place an order for a service with a third party on our
Website (for example a broadband order) then we will collect your
personal information and provide this only to that third party to
facilitate the transaction you have requested.</p>
      <div>
        <h2>Online Help Desk and Ask our Expert enquiries</h2>
        <p>We may republish extracts of emails sent to our Online Help Desk
or Ask our Expert service in articles and features on our Website
and in other media. We will not disclose any user's email address
or any level of personal information that would enable any third
party to contact or identify a particular individual (for example a
full name and full area of residency). If you do not want us to
republish any extracts from correspondence then this should be
indicated in the body text of the email and we will comply with
your request.</p>
        <div>
          <h2>Disclosure of your Information</h2>
          <p>We may disclose your personal information to any member of our
group, which means our subsidiaries, our ultimate holding company
and its subsidiaries, as defined in section 1159 of the UK
Companies Act 2006.</p>
          <p>We may disclose your personal information to third parties:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>in the event that we sell or buy any business or assets, in
which case we may disclose your personal data to the prospective
seller or buyer of such business or assets;</li>
            <li>if DTL or substantially all of its assets are acquired by a
third party, in which case personal data held by it about its
customers will be one of the transferred assets;</li>
            <li>if we are under a duty to disclose or share your personal data
in order to comply with any legal obligation, or in order to
enforce or apply our terms of use and other agreements; or to
protect the rights, property, or safety of DTL, our customers, or
others. This includes exchanging information with other companies
and organisations for the purposes of fraud protection and credit
risk reduction.</li>
          </ul>
          <div>
            <h2>Security</h2>
            <p>Any financial transactions are secured by SSL encryption to
offer secure communications of sensitive data to and from the
Website.</p>
            <p>However, no data transmission over the Internet can be
guaranteed to be totally secure. Although we will do our best to
protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee the security of
your data transmitted to our Website; any transmission is at your
own risk. Once we have received your information, we will use
strict procedures and security features to try to prevent
unauthorised access.</p>
