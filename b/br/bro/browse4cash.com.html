	                	The management of the web site www.browse4cash.com (“B4C”), values the privacy and security of the information that you share with us through the B4C site (the “Web Site”). It is important that you understand how we collect, use, and maintain your information. This Privacy Statement explains our online information practices, the choices you may make about how we collect and use your information at this Web Site, and the ways you may contact us.

We may change this Privacy Statement from time to time. Changes to this Privacy Statement are effective upon posting. Please check back periodically for updates. If at any point we decide to use Personal Information in a manner that is materially different from that stated at the time it was collected, we will notify users by way of an email. Users will have a choice as to whether or not we use their information in this new manner.

The amount, type, and use of information we collect depends on how you use this Web Site. This Privacy Statement applies only to the practices of B4C&nbsp;and its employees. B4C&nbsp;will not apply the provisions of this Privacy Statement to Business Contact Information or Aggregated Information
