													<br>
													PRIVACY STATEMENT
												</p>
												<p class="reportitle">Overview</p>
<p class="med">Brother International Corporation (“Brother” or “we”) is headquartered in Bridgewater, New Jersey (U.S.A) and knows that the privacy of personal information is an important concern to our customers and business associates (“you”, “users”, or “your”). </p>
<p class="med">This privacy policy addresses personally identifiable information that is collected: <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a) through all communications you may have with Brother; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b) at our websites (collectively, the “Site”); and, <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c) through offline product and support services </p>
<p class="med">(all such personally identifiable information are referred to herein collectively as “personal information”). This policy does not cover information other than personal information as it is described above. </p>
<p class="med">Please note that this policy is intended to supply you with information concerning Brother’s collection of personal information and, set forth the commitments Brother is making concerning personal information that Brother collects from you under this policy. </p>
<p class="med">By using the Site or providing your personal information to Brother, you agree to the terms and conditions of this privacy policy. If you do not agree to the terms and conditions of this privacy policy, please do not use the Site or provide your personal information to Brother.</p>
<p class="reportitle">Collection of Personal Information</p>
<p class="med">Brother collects information from our users in a variety of ways, including through telephone, mail, e-mail and any other forms of communication. The information may be collected from registration and warranty forms, parties dealing with customer service issues, several different points on Brother’s websites, and, at times, from third parties, both at the request of Brother and through referrals to Brother. </p>
<p class="med">At times, Brother may collect your personal information, such as your name, e-mail address, home or work address or telephone number, account information and any other personal information. If you choose to make a purchase from us, you will need to provide additional information, such as your credit card number and billing address that is used to create your billing account. </p>
<p class="med">Several areas of the Site, for example, where you may request services offered by Brother or where Brother asks you to provide feedback, require you to provide certain personal information. Collecting necessary, as well as certain optional, information will aid Brother in fulfilling these requests. Likewise, your on-line experience is enhanced by information collected by Brother because the gathering of certain information regarding Site activity and visits is analyzed through log files. Information collected includes anonymous data like IP addresses, browser types, referring pages, pages visited and time spent on the Site. This information is used in aggregate to analyze and improve the sites. IP addresses, etc. are not linked to personally identifiable information. Please note that while IP addresses can be tied to personally identifiable information, this is not a practice Brother utilizes at this time. Brother uses Web Trends software to analyze Site activity but not to capture personal information. (More information on Web Trends can be obtained from its website: http://www.webtrends.com).</p>
<p class="med">In addition, when you use the Site, information collected through cookies, log files, clear gifs and other similar means may be stored to create a profile of our users. A profile is stored information that Brother keeps relating to you that details our users' viewing preferences. Consequently, collected information is tied to your personally identifiable information to provide offers and improve the content of the Site for you. This profile may be used to tailor your visit to the Site and to direct pertinent marketing promotions to you.. See "<b>Sharing</b>" below. For more information on cookies, please see “<b>Use of Cookies</b>” below. </p>
<p class="med">If you receive newsletters or promotional e-mails from Brother, we may collect additional information about you through the use of customized links or similar technologies to determine whether the e-mail was opened and which links were utilized by you in order to provide you more focused e-mail communications or other information.</p>
<p class="reportitle">Use of Your Personal Information</p>
<p class="med">Brother uses your personal information to deliver services, fulfill your requests, provide customer service, operate and improve its sites and operations, and other generally accepted business related purposes. Brother uses personal information collected to better understand your preferences, respond to your needs and enhance your overall experience with Brother and its business associates. Brother may communicate with you on a regular basis to provide requested services and in regards to issues relating to your business transactions with Brother. The personal information Brother may request from you will be used to fulfill your requests for information and assistance regarding Brother products and services, and other generally accepted business related purposes. Brother usually replies to inquiries and requests via email, US mail or phone. If you prefer a certain method of communication for Brother’s reply, please indicate your preference when making the request.</p>
<p class="med">If you indicate an interest in receiving e-mail communications, Brother may periodically send you information about other Brother products and services that Brother feels may be of interest to you. Established users will occasionally receive information on products, services, special deals and/or newsletters. Out of respect for the privacy of our users, Brother presents you with the option to advise Brother of certain types of communications you do not want to receive. See “<b>Your Control Options</b>” below.</p>
<p class="med">Occasionally we may invite you to participate in surveys or contests. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and the user therefore has a choice whether or not to disclose personal information. The requested personal information typically includes contact information (such as name and shipping address), and demographic information (such as zip code), but the specific personal information collected in any survey may vary. Personal information will be used by the contest or survey sponsors to notify the winners and award prizes and as otherwise provided in the applicable contest rules. Personal information may also be used for purposes of monitoring or improving the use and satisfaction of Brother products, services and websites and for other generally accepted business related purposes. Though Brother may use a service provider to conduct these surveys or contests, Brother will impose reasonable restrictions upon such service providers to require them not use users' personally identifiable information for any purpose other than providing services to Brother. You should carefully review the rules of each survey or contest in which you participate, as they may contain additional important information about Brother's or a sponsor's use of your personal information. To the extent that the terms and conditions of such rules concerning the treatment of your personal information conflict with this privacy policy, the terms and conditions of such rules shall control.</p>
<p class="med">On rare occasions it is necessary to send out a strictly service related announcement. For instance, if Brother’s service is temporarily suspended for maintenance, a mailing or e-mail announcement may be sent to you. Generally, if you have provided your e-mail address to Brother, you may not opt-out of these types of communications. Note that these communications are not promotional in nature and you may always opt-out of promotional communications. See “<b>Your Control Options</b>” below.</p>
<p class="reportitle">Sharing </p>
<p class="med">Except as described in this privacy policy, Brother does not disclose your personal information to third parties outside of Brother without your consent. In addition, Brother does not share your personal information with third parties for third party marketing purposes. </p>
<p class="med">In specific instances where your request requires action by a Brother staff member, or Brother service providers, or affiliates Brother may forward or provide access to your personal information. For example, if you inquire about a product or request a quotation, Brother may forward relevant personal information such as contact information, intent to purchase (time, quantity, models, etc.) as well as any special requests, to a dealer. Your information, once transferred, is not subject to the policies of Brother. </p>
<p class="med">To fulfill certain requests or in furtherance of generally accepted business related purposes, certain personal information will be disclosed to third party service providers. In many cases, general services require certain personal information be used to provide services to you, such as your name and mailing address, in order to deliver a product that you purchased or other applicable personal information when processing payment from you for the products you purchase. If your specific request requires assistance from one of our service providers, Brother may pass your personal information to them for follow-up. Brother will not sell or rent your personal information to other companies for the purpose of the third parties' marketing purposes without your consent. Brother may also receive personal information from a third party; however, Brother is not committing to handle such information as if we received it directly from you. </p>
<p class="med">Brother shares aggregated demographic information with its business associates and advertisers. For example Brother may, on a periodic basis, present information such as the number of users, areas of interest, relationship to Brother, etc. This is not linked to any personal information. </p>
<p class="med">When sharing your personal information with third party service providers or business associates, we take reasonable measures to protect the information.</p>
<p class="reportitle">Confidentiality and Security </p>
<p class="med">When you provide Brother with personal information, your information is protected whether Brother receives it online or offline. We have security measures and tools in place to help protect against the loss, misuse, and alteration of the information under our control. When Brother receives personal information (such as name address, phone, e-mail, etc.), on-line, the information is transferred to us by your browser in an encrypted format using industry standard, Secure Socket Layer (SSL) encryption. While on a secure page, such as the order form, the lock icon on the bottom of Web browsers such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to un-locked, or open, when you are just 'surfing'.</p>
<p class="med">Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, although we strive to protect your personal information, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us through or in connection with the Site. No method of transmitting or storing data is completely secure. If you have reason to believe that your interaction with us is no longer secure (for example, if you feel that the security of any account you might have with us has been compromised), you must immediately notify us of the problem by contacting us in accordance with the "<b>Contact Information</b>", section below (note that physical mail notification will delay the time it takes for us to respond to the problem).</p>
<p class="med">Brother reserves the right to disclose information about you and your interaction with us when we believe such disclosure is reasonable and/or appropriate. Though Brother works to preserve user privacy, Brother may need to disclose personal information when required by law, to cooperate with governmental or internal investigations, during judicial proceedings, in response to a court order or legal process served on Brother or its affiliates or to enforce Brother’s rights.</p>
<p class="reportitle">Collection and Use of Children’s Personal Information</p>
<p class="med">The Site and other Brother on-line materials, although intended for general audiences, are not directed to individuals under the age of 13 and Brother does not knowingly collect personal information from such individuals. We request that individuals under the age of 13 not provide personal information on the Site. If a user identifies himself/herself as under the age of 13, Brother’s on-line services will block such users from providing personal information. We encourage parents to monitor and participate in their children’s activities on the Internet.</p>
<p class="reportitle">Your Control Options* </p>
<p class="med">Choice of Opt-in / Opt-out. During the times you provide information to Brother on-line on this Site, you are given the opportunity to opt-in to have your information used for other purposes at the point where Brother asks for the information. For example, this Site has an opt-in feature, so that if you want to access certain areas of the Site and receive selected information, but not receive other materials, you can prevent receipt of certain materials by not choosing an Opt-in for those materials. In addition, if you later no longer wish to receive Brother’s e-mail communications, you may opt-out of receiving these by following the instructions included with each e-mail. In certain other materials, such as product registration cards, for example, Brother allows you to select certain preferences for receiving information from Brother. Brother also offers an opt-out mechanism for all communications while registering a product online, or you may contact us at 1-877-276-8437 to opt-out. </p>
<p class="med"><font color="maroon">*These features apply only to the Site administered by Brother International Corporation.</font></p><font color="maroon">
<p class="reportitle">Use of Cookies </p>
<p class="med">Your on-line experience with the Site provides additional information to Brother of which you may not be aware. A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's computer tied to information about the user. Brother uses both session ID cookies and persistent cookies.
