<br>
If you’ve found something you’d like to purchase, select your size (if you need a little extra guidance peruse the ‘Size &amp; fit’ on the product page) and then click ‘Add To Bag’.<br>
<br>
Now you can decide whether it’s time to give your credit card more of a workout or go directly to your ‘<a href="https://www.brownsfashion.com/commerce/bag">Bag</a>’ to review and complete your order.<br>
<br>
New customers will be required to <u><a href="https://www.brownsfashion.com/account/myaccount">create an account</a></u> with Browns before their order can be processed (returning customers, you know the drill), and always do a final check on your order before payment.<br>
<br>
Once the order has been placed, we will email may you shortly after to confirm receipt of the order before we initiate our validation process.<br>
<br>
Finally, if everything checks out you’ll have your new things in no time.<br>
<br>
If you have any problems, please contact our Customer Care team at <u><a href="mailto:customercare@brownsfashion.com">customercare@brownsfashion.com</a></u> or call +44 (0) 203 750 1241 between 9:00am - 6:00pm GMT or&nbsp;+1 (404) 793&nbsp;0378 between&nbsp;9am - 6pm (PST)&nbsp;Monday&nbsp;to&nbsp;Friday.</p>

<p>Then it’s just business as usual, we will proceed with payment to complete the order and you can expect an email from us to confirm when the order is ready for pick up (usually 1-2 days). Finally, if you have ordered multiple items there’s a chance they might arrive at your chosen boutique at different times, but don’t worry – we will always keep you updated.</p>

<p dir="ltr">When you just can’t wait to get your hands on some newness, Browns has you covered with same day delivery in specific areas of London, Monday to&nbsp;Saturday (excluding bank holidays, because even the postman needs a holiday too you know). Orders received and processed before 11am&nbsp;will arrive that very day to have you kitted out! And don’t worry, if you miss the 11am deadline we will swiftly deliver the following business day.</p>

<p dir="ltr">FYI: If you were trigger happy and purchased a few different items, you may encounter two deliveries as our items can come from two separate warehouses.</p>

<p dir="ltr">The delivery window for Same Day Delivery orders is usuallly between 4pm - 6pm. If you need to make changes to your shipping address or delivery time please <u><a href="mailto:customercare@brownsfashion.com">click here</a></u>; likewise should the carrier be unable to deliver your order, the package will be returned to Browns and a refund will be issued.&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr">&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr"><strong>Collect from our London Boutiques</strong></p>

<p>What’s better than the convenience of picking up your order in store at one of our <u><a href="/boutiques">boutiques</a></u>? Well… it’s free! Now that’s always good news.</p>

<p>From the time when our team receive your order we anticipate it will usually take around 1-2 days for your order to be ready for pick up in the selected boutique – but we manage this by keeping you up to date via email, so keep an eye out!</p>

<p>Always bring along a photo ID and the confirmation email so we can be sure your order is going to the right person. If we don’t see you within 5 days, we’ll send you a little reminder to your inbox, and if we don’t see you in 7 days we will arrange a refund as unfortunately we can’t hold onto order for too long…</p>

<p dir="ltr"><strong>UK Delivery</strong></p>

<p dir="ltr">Orders shipping to the United Kingdom will be coming to a postbox near you via DHL express post&nbsp;within 2-4 days.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Shipping times can vary, but we will always work hard to get your parcel to you ASAP. Deliveries will be made from Monday to&nbsp;Friday between 9:00am - 5:00pm.</p>

<p dir="ltr">&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr"><strong>EU Delivery</strong></p>

<p dir="ltr">The Europeans love to stay ahead of the fashion game, so Browns will be pushing out those packages in 1-4 working days after your order has been processed. Deliveries will be made between Monday to Friday between 9:00am - 5:00pm, but just to let know you know - sometimes there are some delays due to customs clearance which Browns cannot be held accountable for, so please forgive us if you have to wait a few days longer.</p>

<p dir="ltr">&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr"><strong>International (Non EU) Delivery</strong></p>

<p dir="ltr">The international deliveries have a little further to travel, so it’s only natural to expect a few extra days to receive your new things (usually delivering within 3-7 working days). Deliveries will be made between Monday to Friday between 9:00am - 5:00pm, but once again please be mindful of delays via customs clearance.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Please see delivery costs below. If you can't find your country, please contact<a href="/customer-service">&nbsp; </a><u><a href="/customer-service">customer care&nbsp;</a></u>for more information on delivery costs.&nbsp;</p>

All products are sold by the international sizing schemes used by the designer (and we will always make sure we tell you if an item runs small or large to size).

                                            <p><strong>GENERAL</strong></p>

<ol>
	<li>These terms and conditions (the ‘Standard Terms’), together with the terms and conditions that are specific to any Browns Competition (as defined below) (the individual 'Competition Terms'), are known as the 'Rules'. Capitalised words used in the Competition Terms shall have the same meaning as given to them in these Standard Terms. In the event of any conflict between the Competition Terms and these Standard Terms, the Competition Terms shall prevail.</li>
	<li>The Rules apply to any competition that is promoted on the Browns website (www.brownsfashion.com) or any Browns official social media page (@brownsfashion and @brownsmens) and is promoted by Browns (South Molton Street) Limited (‘Browns’), (a 'Competition').</li>
	<li>By entering a Competition, you agree to be bound by the Rules.</li>
	<li>Browns reserves the right to cancel or amend all or any part of a Competition and/or the Rules without notice for any event that is outside of Brown’s reasonable control. Any changes to the Rules, or cancellation of a Competition, will be posted on the Browns website (www.Browns.com). It is the responsibility of entrants to keep themselves informed of any changes to the Rules.</li>
	<li>In the event of any dispute regarding: (a) the Rules, (b) the conduct or results of the Competition, and/or (c) any other matter relating to a Competition (including the terms on which Browns and/or the judges award or have awarded a Prize), then the: (i) decision of Browns and/or the judges (as applicable) shall be final and unchallengeable, and (ii) no correspondence or discussion shall be entered into, comment issued, or reason given in respect of any decision made by Browns.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>COMPETITION ENTRANTS</strong></p>

<ol start="6">
	<li>By entering the Competition, you hereby warrant that all information and imagery submitted by you in your entry is yours, and is true, accurate and complete in every respect. Browns reserves the right to verify any information contained in your entry and/or your eligibility to enter the Competition.</li>
	<li>The Competition is only open to persons who are aged 18 or older on the date of launch of the Competition.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Entrants may be required to provide proof of identity and age.</li>
	<li>Where a Competition is open to persons who are residing outside of the United Kingdom, no person may enter the Competition if the Competition breaches any law or regulation of the jurisdiction in which they are resident.</li>
	<li>Browns reserves the right in its absolute discretion to disqualify any entrant if it has reasonable grounds to believe that an entrant has breached any of the Rules, any applicable law (including copyright law) or has otherwise infringed the intellectual property of any other person. Each entrant acknowledges and agrees that any failure to comply with the Rules could lead to Browns disqualifying that person, without Browns giving any reason for such disqualification or granting any opportunity for challenge.</li>
	<li>Any person that is: (a) an employee of any company involved in the Competition (including Browns); or (b) a family member of such employee, is not eligible to enter the Competition. &nbsp;Browns reserves the right to disqualify any person that it knows is, or has reasonable grounds to believe is, ineligible for the Competition as a result of this Rule.</li>
	<li>In the event that a Prize-winner is disqualified from the Competition, Browns will, unless otherwise stated in the Competition Terms, select an alternative Prize-winner in the same manner as the original Prize-winner and such selection will be subject to the Rules.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>COMPETITION ENTRIES</strong></p>

<ol start="13">
	<li>Entries must be made by the closing date of a Competition and in the manner set out in the Competition Terms. Failure to do so will result in disqualification.</li>
	<li>There is no requirement to make any purchase in order to enter the Competition.</li>
	<li>Unless otherwise stated in the Competition Terms, only one entry per person is permitted. In the event that Browns discovers or has reasonable grounds to believe that the same person has made multiple Entries, such person and any Entries made by them shall be disqualified and, if such Entrant has already been selected as a Prize-winner, an alternative Prize-winner will be selected in accordance with Rule 10 above.</li>
	<li>Browns accepts no responsibility for the return of any entries.</li>
	<li>Browns will be able (in its sole discretion) to re-gram (on Instagram) or use on any of the Browns social media pages any Competition entries without notice, and you accept this use and that such use will be archived after the closing date of the Competition. &nbsp;</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>PRIZE-WINNERS</strong></p>

<ol start="18">
	<li>Prizes for winners (on the terms of these Standard Terms and Conditions) of a Competition will be set out in the Rules for each Competition (‘Prizes’).&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Prize-winners will be selected and notified either in the manner set out in the Competition Terms, or through direct message on their Instagram or Twitter (or other social media used to enter the Competition) page. No prize will be awarded where any entrant has committed any form of misconduct (as determined by Browns in its sole discretion).</li>
	<li>Where entries are judged on artistic or other subjective criteria, Browns reserves the right to set and/or amend the criteria used to judge entries.</li>
	<li>Prizes are non-transferable and there is no cash alternative. In the event of a Prize being unavailable for any reason Browns reserves the right to substitute prizes of equal or greater value at any time.</li>
	<li>Prizes must be accepted by a Prize-winner. In the event that any Prize notification is returned as undeliverable or any Prize-winner fails to validly reply to a Prize notification within 14 days, Browns reserves the right to disqualify the Prize-winner and select an alternative Prize-winner in accordance with Rule 10 above.</li>
	<li>The value of a Prize may be taxable as income. The receipt by any winner of any of the Prize components of a Competition is conditioned upon compliance with any and all local, federal and state rules and regulations. The winner is solely responsible for all insurance and any and all applicable federal, state and local taxes that become due with respect to the prize.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>LIABILITY</strong></p>

<ol start="24">
	<li>Browns accepts no responsibility for any damage, loss, injury (other than our liability for personal injury or death as a result of our negligence) or disappointment of any kind suffered by any entrant in entering the Competition, including as a result of any entrant winning or not winning any prize.</li>
	<li>Browns accepts no responsibility for entries lost, damaged or delayed in the post, or due to computer error in transit. Entries made online using methods generated by a computer, script, macro or the use of automated devices to enter any Competition will be void.</li>
	<li>You are responsible for determining if entering into this Competition is lawful in your jurisdiction. To the extent that it is determined to be unlawful then Browns may void any such entry into the Competition and reserves the right to void any agreement which may be deemed to have been entered into between you and Browns by the action of law.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS AND DATA PROTECTION</strong></p>

<ol start="27">
	<li>You agree that Browns (and any third party authorised by Browns) may use your entry (whether or not it wins the Competition) for any promotional purpose (for example, placing it on the Browns website or on any poster, leaflet or other advertising media). You confirm that your entry is original that you own and have the right to license to Browns the copyright and other intellectual property rights in the Entry for the purposes referred to in these Rules. You will retain ownership of copyright in your entry but you give Browns (and any third party authorised by Browns) your irrevocable permission to use, reproduce, publish, display, transmit, copy, amend, store, sell and sub-licence your entry worldwide for such promotional purposes and for the purposes of the Competition.</li>
	<li>Browns will use any personal information that you provide with your entry for the purposes of the Competition and, where you have given your consent, for marketing purposes. Any personal information relating to entrants will be used solely by us in accordance with applicable data protection legislation.</li>
	<li>All Prize-winners unconditionally agree (as a condition of accepting any prize) to: (a) the use of their name, one or more photographs of themselves and disclosure of their country of residence (if such Prize-winner is resident outside the UK); and (b) co-operate with or participate in any other reasonable post-Competition publicity.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>GOVERNING LAW AND JURISDICTION</strong></p>

<ol start="30">

	<li>The Courts of England shall have exclusive jurisdiction in relation to any dispute or claim arising out of or in connection with the Rules or their subject matter, existence, negotiation, validity, termination or enforceability (including non-contractual disputes or claims).</li>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Ordering &amp; Availability</strong></p>

<p>Products may be ordered by clicking on the items you wish to purchase and then following the prompts that will appear on-screen. You may check and correct any input errors in your order up until the point at which you submit your order to us by clicking the "Pay Now" button on the checkout page.</p>

<p>After placing an order, you will receive an email from us acknowledging that we have received your order and giving you an order reference number. Please note that this does not mean that your order has been accepted. Your order constitutes an offer to us to buy a Product. All orders are subject to acceptance by us. We are not obliged to accept your order and may, at our discretion, decline to accept any order. You do, however, acknowledge that by clicking on the "Pay Now" button, you enter into an obligation to pay for the Product(s). Where we accept your order, we will confirm such acceptance to you by sending you an email that confirms that the Product has been despatched (<strong>Despatch Confirmation</strong>). The contract between you and us in relation to the Product(s) ordered (<strong>Contract</strong>) will only be formed when we send you the Despatch Confirmation. After entering into the Contract, we will be under a legal duty to supply you with goods that are in conformity with the Contract.</p>

<p>The Contract will relate only to the Product(s) whose despatch we have confirmed in the Despatch Confirmation. We will not be obliged to supply any other Product(s) which may have been part of your order until the despatch of such Product(s) has been confirmed in a separate Despatch Confirmation.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Delivery</strong></p>

<p>Your order will be fulfilled by the delivery date set out in the Despatch Confirmation or, if no delivery date is specified, then within 30 days after the date of the Despatch Confirmation, unless there are exceptional circumstances.</p>

<p>Your order will be delivered to the delivery address you specify when placing your order.</p>

<p>If your delivery address is geographically remote, for example certain outlying islands or other isolated locations, it is possible that we may not be able to deliver there. If that is the case, we will notify you before we accept your order. We reserve the right not to deliver to any country that is prohibited by applicable export laws. Orders cannot be delivered to PO Box or similar addresses.</p>

<p>Products comprised within the same order cannot be delivered to different addresses.</p>

<p>Deliveries are made by our trusted courier and take place on Monday to Saturday (or other normal working week days in countries that do not follow a Western pattern of working week), excluding bank and public holidays, usually within the hours of 8am and 5pm. It is not possible to specify a precise time at which a delivery will take place. Please note that the courier may require deliveries to be signed for.</p>

<p>If you order Product(s) for international delivery, they may be opened and inspected by customs authorities and may be subject to import duties and taxes which are levied when the delivery reaches the specified destination. You will be responsible for payment of any such import duties and taxes. Please note that we have no control over these charges and cannot predict their amount. Please contact your local customs office for further information before placing your order. In the event that you return an item, the import duties will be refunded if they were originally included in the purchase price. If they were not included then you will responsible for reclaiming duty directly from your local customs office.</p>

<p>Please also note that you must comply with all applicable laws and regulations of the country for which the Product(s) are destined. We will not be liable for any breach by you of any such laws.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Risk &amp;&nbsp;Ownership</strong></p>

<p>The Product(s) ordered will be at your risk from the time of delivery or collection (as the case may be). Ownership of the Product(s) ordered will also pass to you on delivery or collection (as the case may be), provided full payment of all sums due in respect of the Product(s), including any delivery charges, has been received.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Price &amp; Payment</strong></p>

<p>The price of Products is as quoted on the Site from time to time.</p>

<p>Prices include VAT but exclude delivery costs, which will be automatically added (at the cost shown) to the total amount due when you view the items in your shopping basket, and have selected your chosen different delivery method.</p>

<p>Prices and delivery costs are liable to change at any time, but changes will not affect orders in respect of which we have already sent you a Despatch Confirmation.</p>

<p>The Site contains a large number of Products and it is always possible that, despite our best efforts, some of the Products listed on the Site may be incorrectly priced. We will normally verify prices as part of our despatch procedures so that, where a Product's correct price is less than our stated price, we will charge you the lower amount. If a Product’s correct price is higher than the price stated on the Site, we will normally, at our discretion, either contact you for instructions before despatching the Product, or reject your order and notify you of such rejection.</p>

<p>Payment for all orders must be made by credit or debit card on the checkout page. We accept payment by most major credit and debit cards.</p>

<p>You should be aware that online payment transactions are subject to validation checks by your card issuer and we are not responsible if your card issuer declines to authorise payment for any reason. We also carry out a standard pre-authorisation check on your payment card, and Products will not be despatched until this pre-authorisation check has been completed. Please note, it is possible that your card issuer may charge you an online handling fee or processing fee. We are not responsible for this.</p>

<p>From time to time we may run promotions where we issue discount codes. These can be used in part-payment of the price of Product(s) ordered online, subject to the Terms &amp; Conditions under which they were issued (as indicated in our relevant promotion from which you got the code). Discount codes can only be used once, and only during the period of validity stated and only in respect of the relevant Product(s) stated. Discount codes cannot be redeemed for cash.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Returns Policy </strong></p>

<p>Returned Products must conform to our returns policy below.</p>

<p>You have a legal obligation to take reasonable care of the products while they are in your possession, and you must return them in the same condition in which you receive them (except to the extent reasonably necessary to examine them). This includes the following guidelines:</p>

<ul style="list-style-type:disc" type="disc">
	<li>Products should be returned unworn (other than to try them on), unwashed, undamaged and unused with their original tags;</li>
	<li>footwear and accessories should be returned in the original boxes provided and inside a protective shipping box;</li>
	<li>if the Product comes with a security tag this should be left on;</li>
	<li>hosiery should only be returned if it is unopened and is in its original package; and</li>
	<li>lingerie and swimwear must only be tried on over your own lingerie garments.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you fail to comply with the above obligations (including the conditions of return), we may deduct from the refund an amount to reflect the diminished value of the Product(s) up to the full price of the Product(s).</p>

<p>You cannot cancel a contract for the supply of any of the following Products:</p>

<ul style="list-style-type:disc" type="disc">
	<li>any Products that have been personalised or made to your own bespoke specifications unless such Products were damaged or faulty when delivered to you or have been incorrectly delivered (see <u>Returns and refunds for customised Products below for more information</u>); and</li>
	<li>any garments or cosmetics Products that have had a hygiene label or seal removed or broken.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Returns and refunds for customised products</em></p>

<p>Due to the nature of personalised and monogrammed Products, returns, changes or cancellations are at our discretion. In exercising this discretion, we will have regard to the level of customisation and personalisation and also reserve the right to offer a store credit rather than a monetary refund. Store credit is valid for 6 months from the date of issue. This does not affect your statutory rights. Please note, that personalised and/or customised Products may have a long lead in time before shipping, but payment will be taken at the time of or shortly after you submit your order and in advance of shipping.</p>

<p><em>Returns Process</em></p>

<p>We recommend that you return Products in their original packaging to ensure the necessary protection when in transit. Instructions for the return of the Product(s) will be included with the delivery package. When cancelling a purchase and returning Products to us you have two options available to you:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ol start="1" style="list-style-type:lower-roman" type="i">
	<li>Depending on where you live, exercise your right to cancel under the <u>Consumer Contracts (Information, Cancellation and Additional Charges) Regulations 2013 (<strong>CCRs</strong>)</u>. If you choose this option you will be refunded the full price for the Product(s) (subject to our Returns Policy) and the cost of standard delivery but will be liable for the organisation and cost of returning the Product(s) to us.</li>
	<li>Use our Free Returns service. If you choose this option you can return the Products(s) for free and will be refunded the full price for the Product(s) (subject to our Returns Policy) but not the delivery charges.</li>
</ol>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>We describe these two options in more detail below.</p>

<p><u>(i) Your cancellation right under the Consumer Contracts (Information, Cancellation and Additional Charges) Regulations 2013 (<strong>CCRs</strong>)</u></p>

<p>Except in relation to certain types of Products (as set out <u>above</u>), you may cancel a contract at any time before your order is delivered and up to 14 days afterwards, beginning on the day after you received the Products ("cooling-off period").</p>

<p>To cancel a Contract, you must clearly inform us, preferably:</p>

<ul style="list-style-type:disc" type="disc">
	<li>by email at customercare@brownsfashion.com or by telephone on <strong>+44 (0)203 962 1241 </strong>giving us your name, address and order reference; or</li>
	<li>by completing and returning the cancellation form [insert link] and sending it to the address set out in the form.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you cancel an order (or part of an order) during the cooling off period, you must return the Product(s) within 14 days after the day on which you notify us of the cancellation and comply with the Returns Policy.</p>

<p>If you cancel a Contract between us within the 14 day cooling-off period (see above), we will process the refund due to you as soon as possible and, in any case within 14 days after the day on which we receive the Product(s) back or (ii) if earlier, the day on which we receive evidence that you have returned the Product(s) to our returns address.</p>

<p>We will refund the price of the Product(s) in full (subject to any deduction we are entitled to make due to your use of or damage to the Product(s)), including the cost of standard delivery.

	<p><strong>SECURITY</strong></p>

	<p>Keeping you and your personal information secure is very important to us. We take a number of reasonable steps to try to protect the personal information that you provide, including: • using a Secure Socket Layer (“SSL”) to encrypt the personal data that you send us during the order process (including any financial information such as credit or debit card details);</p>

	<ul>
		<li>
		<p>requiring you to establish a password to access your account on our Website;</p>

		<p>not keeping details of your credit or debit card that would enable any third party to transact using that credit or debit card (such as your CCV number); and</p>

		<p>regularly monitoring our servers and IT systems for possible vulnerabilities and attacks. Unfortunately, despite this, the transmission of information via the Internet is not completely secure. We cannot guarantee the security of your personal data transmitted to or through our Website, and any such transmission is at your own risk. In particular, please keep in mind that if you voluntarily disclose personal information through other means of communication than the Website in a non-protected environment (such as through email, sms, online messages) then that information can be collected and used by others outside of our or your control.</p>

	<p><strong>HOW LONG WILL YOU USE MY INFORMATION FOR?</strong></p>

	<p>We retain the data you provide to us for as long as you have your account with us and thereafter for such period as you may have questions or a claim in relation to our services, notwithstanding any superior retention period that we may be obliged to observe in accordance with legal requirements applicable to us.</p>

	<p>In some circumstances you can ask us to delete your data as set out below.</p>

	<p>After you have terminated your use of our services, we may store your information in an aggregated and anonymised format.</p>

	<p><strong>WHAT ARE MY PRIVACY RIGHTS?</strong></p>

	<p>You have certain rights in relation to the personal data we hold about you, which we detail below. Some of these only apply in certain circumstances as set out in more detail below. We also set out how to exercise those rights. Please note that we will require you to verify your identity before responding to any requests to exercise your rights and that can include asking a set of security questions to ensure it is you. When you have appointed someone else to do the request on your behalf, that person and/or organization needs to show a valid power of attorney issued by you. We must respond to a request by you to exercise those rights without undue delay and at least within one month (although this may be extended by a further two months in certain circumstances). To exercise any of your rights, please contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@brownsfashion.com" style="text-decoration: underline;">privacy@brownsfashion.com</a> or by writing to Data Protection Officer, at The Bower, 4th Floor, 211 Old Street, London EC1V 9NR.</p>

	<ul>
		<li>
		<p><strong><u>Access</u>.</strong></p>

		<p>You have the right to know whether we process personal data about you, and if we do, to access data we hold about you and certain information about how we use it and who we share it with (including the categories of personal data we share with businesses for their direct marketing uses and the names and addresses of those businesses). Please note that in “My Account” dashboards, you can see information about you, namely your account details (such as name, email, phone number, date of birth), the addresses you use for billing and shipping, your order history and shopping preferences.</p>

		<p>You can also request a copy of your information. If you require more than one copy of the data we hold about you, we may charge a reasonable administration fee.</p>

		<p>We may not provide you with certain personal data if providing it would interfere with another’s rights (e.g. where providing the personal data we hold about you would reveal information about another person) or where another exemption applies.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
		<p><strong><u>Portability</u>.</strong></p>

		<p>You have the right to receive a subset of the personal data we collect from you in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format and a right to request that we transfer such personal data to another party. The relevant subset of personal data is data that you provide us with your consent or for the purposes of performing our contract with you.</p>

		<p>If you wish for us to transfer the personal data to another party, please ensure you detail that party and note that we can only do so where it is technically feasible. We are not responsible for the security of the personal data or its processing once received by the third party. We also may not provide you with certain data if providing it would interfere with another’s rights (e.g. where providing the personal data we hold about you would reveal information about another person or our trade secrets or intellectual property).</p>
		</li>
		<li>
		<p><strong><u>Correction</u>.</strong></p>

		<p>You have the right to correct any personal data held about you that is inaccurate. You can edit your personal information in “My Account” settings. You can also request the correction by emailing us. Please note that in some cases we can ask you to explain in detail why you believe the personal data we hold about you to be inaccurate or incomplete so that we can assess whether a correction is required. Please note that whilst we assess whether the personal data we hold about you is inaccurate or incomplete, you may exercise your right to restrict our processing of the applicable data as described below.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
		<p><strong><u>Erasure</u>.</strong></p>

		<p>You may request that we erase the personal data we hold about you in the certain circumstances. Please scroll below to know what those are:</p>

			<p>you believe that it is no longer necessary for us to hold the personal data we hold about you;</p>
			</li>
			<li>
			<p>we are processing the personal data we hold about you on the basis of your consent, and you wish to withdraw your consent and there is no other ground under which we can process the personal data;</p>
			</li>
			<li>
			<p>we are processing the personal data we hold about you on the basis of our legitimate interest and you object to such processing. Please provide us with detail as to your reasoning so that we can assess whether there is an overriding interest for us to retain such personal data;</p>
			</li>
			<li>
			<p>you no longer wish us to use the personal data we hold about you in order to send you promotions and special offers;</p>
			</li>
			<li>
			<p>you believe the personal data we hold about you is being unlawfully processed by us.</p>
			</li>
		</ul>

		<p>Also note that you may exercise your right to restrict our processing the data whilst we consider your request as described below.</p>

		<p>Please provide as much detail as possible on your reasons for the request to assist us in determining whether you have a valid basis for erasure. Please note, however, that we may retain the personal data if there are valid grounds under law for us to do so (e.g., for the defence of legal claims or freedom of expression) but we will let you know if that is the case.</p>

		<p>Where you have requested that we erase data that we have made public and there are grounds for erasure, we will use reasonable steps try to tell others that are displaying the data or providing links to the data to erase the data too.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
		<p><strong><u>Restriction of Processing to Storage Only</u>.</strong></p>

		<p>You have a right to require us to stop processing the personal data we hold about you other than for storage purposes in certain circumstances. Please note, however, that if we stop processing the personal data, we may use it again if there are valid grounds under data protection law for us to do so (e.g. for the defence of legal claims or for another’s protection)</p>

		<p>Please scroll below to know the cases where you may request we stop processing and just store the personal data we hold about you.</p>

		<ul>
			<li>
			<p>you believe the personal data is not accurate for the period it takes for us to verify your claim;</p>
			</li>
			<li>
			<p>we wish to erase the personal data as the processing we are doing is unlawful but you want us to retain the personal data for storage but not further process it;</p>
			</li>
			<li>
			<p>we wish to erase the personal data as it is no longer necessary for our purposes but you require it to be stored for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims; or</p>
			</li>
			<li>
			<p>you have objected to us processing personal data we hold about you on the basis of our legitimate interest and you wish us to stop processing the personal data whilst we determine whether there is an overriding interest in us retaining such personal data.</p>
			</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
		<li>
		<p><strong><u>Objection</u>.</strong></p>

			<li>
			<p>we are processing the data we hold about you (including where the processing is profiling) on the basis of our or a third party’s legitimate interest and you object to such processing. Please provide us with detail as to your reasoning so that we can assess whether there is a compelling overriding interest in us continuing to process such data or we need to process it in relation to legal claims. Also note that you may exercise your right to request that we stop processing the data whilst we make the assessment on an overriding interest;</p>
			</li>
		</ul>

		<p><strong>Withdrawal of Consent:</strong> You can withdraw your consent at any time by changing your marketing preferences in “My Account” or by unsubscribing at the bottom of each email received or by writing emailing us as set out below.</p>

	<p><strong>WHO DO YOU SHARE MY INFORMATION WITH?</strong></p>

	<p>To provide the Website and our services, we work with a number of carefully selected third parties. To do this, we may share your information with these third parties in the following limited circumstances:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>
		<p><strong>Group companies for business purposes:</strong> Browns (South Molton Street) Limited is part of a larger family of companies in different parts of the world. Our group of companies, which means our subsidiaries, our ultimate holding company, and that company’s subsidiaries as defined in section 1159 of the UK Companies Act 2006, includes Browns (South Molton Street) Limited, Fashion Concierge UK Limited, Farfetch Portugal – Unipessoal, Lda., Farfetch.com Limited, Farfetch.com US LLC., Farfetch.com Brasil Servicos LTDA, Farfetch Japan Co Ltd and Farfetch (Shanghai) E-Commerce Co. Ltd (the “Farfetch Group”). We may share your personal information in order to operate our business and provide the Website and services. Rest assured, their use of information is consistent with this Privacy Policy;</p>
		</li>
		<li>
		<p><strong>Third party service providers for business purposes:</strong> We have subcontracted the operation of certain aspects of the Site to Black &amp; White, a trading division of Farfetch UK Limited (company number 06400760, VAT number GB 204 0769 35). Services provided or procured by Farfetch include, but are not limited to, payment processing, customer service, hosting and delivery logistics</p>
		</li>
		<li>
		<p><strong>advertisers for marketing purposes:</strong> we can provide your information to our advertising and social media partners (including Facebook and Twitter, where you choose) where they require the data to select and serve relevant adverts about our products and services to you and others;</p>
		</li>
		<li>
		<p><strong>third parties where we are considering a corporate transaction:</strong> the Farfetch Group is always looking for new opportunities and directions in which to grow, and that may take into account Browns. This means sometimes we may consider corporate transactions such as merger, acquisitions, reorganisations, asset sale, or similar. In these instances, we may transfer your information to enable the assessment and undertaking of that transaction. If we buy or sell any business or assets, your personal information may be one of the assets that are transferred;</p>
		</li>
		<li>
		<p><strong>to comply with legal requests:</strong> on occasion we may be required to liaise with various regulators and law enforcement agencies in a number of different countries, whether as a result of law, a court order, or another legal process. Although we dispute requests wherever suitable, in some cases we may have to share your information with the regulators or law enforcement agencies. Where we consider it appropriate, and provided we are not prohibited from doing so by law or court order, we will attempt to notify you of these legal demands; and</p>
		</li>
		<li>
		<p><strong>aggregated information with third parties:</strong> we may aggregate your information with the information of other customers, creating a dataset of information about the usage of our Website, purchase of products, and other general, grouped information about our customers on the basis of our legitimate interest to understand the usage of our service and demand for our product. Although this dataset is aggregated and anonymised, meaning it cannot identify you as an individual, it provides a valuable insight into the use of our Website and we may therefore share it with select third parties. These parties may include providers of plugins or similar technologies to help measure traffic, our partner boutiques and other providers to allow them to better stock products, and our investors. Please note that we do not share your information with any third party advertisers or networks for the provision of third party advertising on our Website.</p>

This includes the following guidelines:</p>\n\n<ul style=\"list-style-type:disc\" type=\"disc\">\n\t<li>Products should be returned unworn (other than to try them on), unwashed, undamaged and unused with their original tags;</li>\n\t<li>footwear and accessories should be returned in the original boxes provided and inside a protective shipping box;</li>\n\t<li>if the Product comes with a security tag this should be left on;</li>\n\t<li>hosiery should only be returned if it is unopened and is in its original package; and</li>\n\t<li>lingerie and swimwear must only be tried on over your own lingerie garments.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>If you fail to comply with the above obligations (including the conditions of return), we may deduct from the refund an amount to reflect the diminished value of the Product(s) up to the full price of the Product(s).</p>\n\n<p>You cannot cancel a contract for the supply of any of the following Products:</p>\n\n<ul style=\"list-style-type:disc\" type=\"disc\">\n\t<li>any Products that have been personalised or made to your own bespoke specifications unless such Products were damaged or faulty when delivered to you or have been incorrectly delivered (see <u>Returns and refunds for customised Products below for more information</u>); and</li>\n\t<li>any garments or cosmetics Products that have had a hygiene label or seal removed or broken.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><em>Returns and refunds for customised products</em></p>\n\n<p>Due to the nature of personalised and monogrammed Products, returns, changes or cancellations are at our discretion. In exercising this discretion, we will have regard to the level of customisation and personalisation and also reserve the right to offer a store credit rather than a monetary refund. Store credit is valid for 6 months from the date of issue. This does not affect your statutory rights. Please note, that personalised and/or customised Products may have a long lead in time before shipping, but payment will be taken at the time of or shortly after you submit your order and in advance of shipping.</p>\n\n<p><em>Returns Process</em></p>\n\n<p>We recommend that you return Products in their original packaging to ensure the necessary protection when in transit.

To do this, we may share your information with these third parties in the following limited circumstances:</p>\n\n\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>\n\t\t<p><strong>Group companies for business purposes:</strong> Browns (South Molton Street) Limited is part of a larger family of companies in different parts of the world. Our group of companies, which means our subsidiaries, our ultimate holding company, and that company’s subsidiaries as defined in section 1159 of the UK Companies Act 2006, includes Farfetch UK Limited, Fashion Concierge UK Limited, Farfetch Portugal – Unipessoal, Lda., Farfetch.com Limited, Farfetch.com US LLC., Farfetch.com Brasil Servicos LTDA, Farfetch Japan Co Ltd and Farfetch (Shanghai) E-Commerce Co. Ltd (the “Farfetch Group”). We may share your personal information in order to operate our business and provide the Website and services. Rest assured, their use of information is consistent with this Privacy Policy;</p>\n\t\t</li>\n\t\t<li>\n\t\t<p><strong>Third party service providers for business purposes:</strong> We have subcontracted the operation of certain aspects of the Site to Black & White, a trading division of Farfetch UK Limited (company number 06400760, VAT number GB 204 0769 35). Services provided or procured by Farfetch include, but are not limited to, payment processing, customer service, hosting and delivery logistics</p>\n\t\t</li>\n\t\t<li>\n\t\t<p><strong>advertisers for marketing purposes:</strong> we can provide your information to our advertising and social media partners (including Facebook and Twitter, where you choose) where they require the data to select and serve relevant adverts about our products and services to you and others;</p>\n\t\t</li>\n\t\t<li>\n\t\t<p><strong>third parties where we are considering a corporate transaction:</strong> the Farfetch Group is always looking for new opportunities and directions in which to grow, and that may take into account Browns. This means sometimes we may consider corporate transactions such as merger, acquisitions, reorganisations, asset sale, or similar. In these instances, we may transfer your information to enable the assessment and undertaking of that transaction. If we buy or sell any business or assets, your personal information may be one of the assets that are transferred;</p>\n\t\t</li>\n\t\t<li>\n\t\t<p><strong>to comply with legal requests:</strong> on occasion we may be required to liaise with various regulators and law enforcement agencies in a number of different countries, whether as a result of law, a court order, or another legal process. Although we dispute requests wherever suitable, in some cases we may have to share your information with the regulators or law enforcement agencies. Where we consider it appropriate, and provided we are not prohibited from doing so by law or court order, we will attempt to notify you of these legal demands; and</p>\n\t\t</li>\n\t\t<li>\n\t\t<p><strong>aggregated information with third parties:</strong> we may aggregate your information with the information of other customers, creating a dataset of information about the usage of our Website, purchase of products, and other general, grouped information about our customers on the basis of our legitimate interest to understand the usage of our service and demand for our product. Although this dataset is aggregated and anonymised, meaning it cannot identify you as an individual, it provides a valuable insight into the use of our Website and we may therefore share it with select third parties. These parties may include providers of plugins or similar technologies to help measure traffic, our partner boutiques and other providers to allow them to better stock products, and our investors. Please note that we do not share your information with any third party advertisers or networks for the provision of third party advertising on our Website.</p>\n\t\t</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><strong>TRANSFERS OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA</strong></p>\n\n\t<p>To provide our Website and our services, in accordance with the purposes set out above, we or Farfetch UK Limited may transfer and store the personal information that we collect from you to a destination outside of the European Economic Area (“EEA”), mostly to the United States. When doing so, we rely on different adequacy measures, as stated below:</p>\n\n\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>\n\t\t<p><strong>Adequacy Decision:</strong> We transfer the personal data that we collect from you to conduct fraud checks to Israel, which was found to have an adequate level of protection for personal data under Commission Decision 2011/61/EU of 31 January 2011.</p>\n\t\t</li>\n\t\t<li>\n\t\t<p><strong>Privacy Shield:</strong> Some third party providers based in the US, where we transfer your information to, comply with the US Department of Commerce's EU-US Privacy Shield and have certified that adhere to the EU-US Privacy Shield Principles of Notice, Choice, Accountability for Onward Transfer, Security, Data Integrity and Purpose Limitation, Access, and Recourse, Enforcement and Liability. For more information about the EU-US Privacy Shield Framework, visit the U.S. Department of Commerce's Privacy Shield website.</p>\n\t\t</li>\n\t\t<li>\n\t\t<p><strong>Model Clauses:</strong> We rely in the Commission’s model contracts for the transfer of personal data to third countries (i.e. the standard contractual clauses) pursuant to Decision 2010/87/EU when transferring your information to US service providers who do not adhere to the US Department of Commerce's EU-US Privacy Shield.</p>\n\t\t</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p><strong>COOKIES</strong></p>\n\n\t<p>We use technology such as \"cookies\" to collect information and store your online preferences.

Please note that we will require you to verify your identity before responding to any requests to exercise your rights and that can include asking a set of security questions to ensure it is you. When you have appointed someone else to do the request on your behalf, that person and/or organization needs to show a valid power of attorney issued by you. We must respond to a request by you to exercise those rights without undue delay and at least within one month (although this may be extended by a further two months in certain circumstances).

To do this, we may share your information with these third parties in the following limited circumstances:</p>\n\n\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>\n\t\t<p><strong>Group companies for business purposes:</strong> Browns (South Molton Street) Limited is part of a larger family of companies in different parts of the world. Our group of companies, which means our subsidiaries, our ultimate holding company, and that company’s subsidiaries as defined in section 1159 of the UK Companies Act 2006, includes Browns (South Molton Street) Limited, Fashion Concierge UK Limited, Farfetch Portugal – Unipessoal, Lda., Farfetch.com Limited, Farfetch.com US LLC., Farfetch.com Brasil Servicos LTDA, Farfetch Japan Co Ltd and Farfetch (Shanghai) E-Commerce Co.

Services provided or procured by Farfetch include, but are not limited to, payment processing, customer service, hosting and delivery logistics</p>\n\t\t</li>\n\t\t<li>\n\t\t<p><strong>advertisers for marketing purposes:</strong> we can provide your information to our advertising and social media partners (including Facebook and Twitter, where you choose) where they require the data to select and serve relevant adverts about our products and services to you and others;</p>\n\t\t</li>\n\t\t<li>\n\t\t<p><strong>third parties where we are considering a corporate transaction:</strong> the Farfetch Group is always looking for new opportunities and directions in which to grow, and that may take into account Browns. This means sometimes we may consider corporate transactions such as merger, acquisitions, reorganisations, asset sale, or similar. In these instances, we may transfer your information to enable the assessment and undertaking of that transaction. If we buy or sell any business or assets, your personal information may be one of the assets that are transferred;</p>\n\t\t</li>\n\t\t<li>\n\t\t<p><strong>to comply with legal requests:</strong> on occasion we may be required to liaise with various regulators and law enforcement agencies in a number of different countries, whether as a result of law, a court order, or another legal process. Although we dispute requests wherever suitable, in some cases we may have to share your information with the regulators or law enforcement agencies. Where we consider it appropriate, and provided we are not prohibited from doing so by law or court order, we will attempt to notify you of these legal demands; and</p>\n\t\t</li>\n\t\t<li>\n\t\t<p><strong>aggregated information with third parties:</strong> we may aggregate your information with the information of other customers, creating a dataset of information about the usage of our Website, purchase of products, and other general, grouped information about our customers on the basis of our legitimate interest to understand the usage of our service and demand for our product. Although this dataset is aggregated and anonymised, meaning it cannot identify you as an individual, it provides a valuable insight into the use of our Website and we may therefore share it with select third parties. These parties may include providers of plugins or similar technologies to help measure traffic, our partner boutiques and other providers to allow them to better stock products, and our investors. Please note that we do not share your information with any third party advertisers or networks for the provision of third party advertising on our Website.</p>\n\t\t</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p><strong>3.
