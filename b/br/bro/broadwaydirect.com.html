        <em>Cookies and Web Beacons</em>
        <p>
            <a href="http://www.broadwaydirect.com">www.broadwaydirect.com</a> does use cookies to store information about visitors
            preferences, record user-specific information on which pages the user access or visit, customize Web page content
            based on visitors browser type or other information that the visitor sends via their browser. A cookie is a small
            amount of data (often including a unique identifier), that is sent to your browser from a web site's computers
            and stored on your computer's hard drive. Some of our cookies may be local shared objects, also known as Flash

            Please be aware that when you disclose PII through the comment feature on the Site, the information may become public
            and accessible to all or a part of the Site community, so it is important for you to exercise discretion and
            appropriate caution when deciding to reveal PII in these areas. In addition, when you choose to make a posting,
            certain PII may be available for other users to view. We urge you to exercise discretion and caution when deciding

            our name and that of another entity. There may be a specific privacy policy on any such co-branded page. Any
            personal information that you provide when signing up at any co-branded page may be collected by, or shared with,

        <em>Delivery of Advertising and Other Content</em>
        <p>In addition to ads and content that we may serve you directly, we use third-party advertising companies and marketing
            services companies to serve ads and other content when you visit our Broadway Direct and elsewhere on the internet
            and in other media. Both we and these companies may use information about your visits to this Broadway Direct
            and elsewhere to serve ads and other content to you. In the course of doing so, a unique third-party cookie may
            be placed or recognized on your browser by such companies. In addition, we and these companies may use Web beacons
            to help manage our online advertising and content. These Web beacons enable us and the third-party companies
            to recognize a browser's cookie when a browser visits this site and to learn which banner ads bring users to

            Both Broadway Direct and these companies may use information obtained from your visits to Broadway Direct or
            other websites, and information received from you offline in order to provide advertisements about goods and
            services and other content of interest to you across the internet and in other media. If you would like more
            information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used in this manner
            by our third party advertising companies, please visit http://www.networkadvertising.org/optout_nonppii.asp.
            The collection of information via certain ads served to users in Canada may be managed by visiting youradchoices.ca,
            and via certain ads served to users in Europe may be managed at youronlinechoices.com. You may also visit alc-opt-out.com
            to find out how our marketing services companies operate.</p>
        <p>In addition, we may provide Personally Identifiable Information and Anonymous Information to marketing services companies.
            This may include information we received from you offline or online. These companies may combine information
            we provide (including Personally Identifiable Information and Anonymous Information) with personal and anonymous
            information they may have about you, using cookies they place or that we place on their behalf, as described
            in the section regarding “Cookies and Beacons”. We require these companies to delete the Personally
            Identifiable Information we provide them. These companies may use the resulting non-personal information and
            such cookies for their own marketing purposes, and they may provide the same to their customers for their customer's
            marketing purposes. If you would like to know your choices about not having this information used by such companies,
            please visit: alc-opt-out.com.</p>
        <p>Some of our emails may contain tags that allow us and our advertisers and other partners to determine the types of
            content that may be of interest to you. Those tags may contain Personally Identifiable Information and may be
            shared with others to the same extent indicated in the section regarding “Cookies and Beacons”. Those
            tags may not be deleted but you can opt out of receiving the emails.</p>
        <h3>Use of This Site by Children</h3>
        <p> The Site is not directed to individuals under the age of thirteen (13), and we request that such individuals do not
            provide personal information through the Site. If a parent or guardian becomes aware that his or her child has
            provided us with personally identifiable information without the parent or guardian’s consent by, for example,
            misrepresenting his or her age, that parent or guardian should contact us at
            <a href="mailto:customerservice@nederlander.com">customerservice@nederlander.com</a>.
            If Broadway Direct determines that it has collected personal information of children under the age of 13, Broadway
            Direct will immediately delete such information and any accounts believed to be held by children under 13.
        </p>
        <h3>Security of Your Personal Information</h3>
        <p> Broadway Direct employs reasonable security measures consistent with standard industry practice, for personal information
