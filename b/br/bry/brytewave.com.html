<div id="FAQ_text">
	<p>
        </p><p><b><u>For U.S. Residents- U.S. Privacy Policy</u></b></p><p>We at <b>FOLLETT</b> respect your privacy and value the relationship we have with you.  This Privacy Policy is designed to show you what information about you Follett collects and how Follett uses and shares that information.   This Privacy Policy applies to information collected by Follett Higher Education Group, offline or online, including through efollett.com and all other web sites, features, applications, store kiosks, widgets or online services that are owned or controlled by Follett Higher Education Group and that post a link to this Privacy Policy (collectively, the "Services"). The Services include the online bookstores operated by Follett Higher Education Group on behalf of universities, colleges and other higher education institutions and any information collected by Follett Higher Education Group at an on-campus store.  Please review this Privacy Policy carefully. Please note that certain features or services referenced in this Privacy Policy may not be offered on all Services or through all features at all times.</p><p>The Services are intended for general audiences and are not intended for individuals younger than the age of 13.  We do not knowingly collect personal information from individuals younger than the age of 13.</p><p><b>Information We Collect About You</b></p><p>You may provide Follett with "Personal Information" (which is information that can be used to contact or specifically identify an individual, such as your full name, mailing address, mobile number, and email address), account information (such as a password or other information that helps us confirm that it is you accessing your account) and demographic or other information (such as your gender, age or birthdate, zip code and information about your interests and preferences). We will also collect payment information (typically, credit card account information) if you choose to purchase products or services through the Services.  And, when you make a purchase or otherwise transact with Follett, whether online or offline, we will retain information regarding those purchases and transactions, such as products purchased, location of purchase,  how frequently you buy, games you play, offers you redeem and rewards you earn and redeem.  Any information combined with Personal Information will be treated as Personal Information.</p> <p><b>Community Forums and User Content</b></p> <p>Follett provides the opportunity to participate and post content publicly in forums, through interactive features and through other communication functionality ("Community Forums").  You may choose, through such features or otherwise, to submit or post reviews, photographs, videos, questions, comments, suggestions or other content, (collectively, "User Content").  Please note that certain information, such as your name, may be publicly displayed on the Services along with your User Content.</p> <p><b>Information the Services Automatically Collect or Processes</b></p> <p>We and our third party service providers, including analytics providers and third party content providers, may automatically collect certain information whenever you access and use the Community ("Usage Information"). Usage Information may include the type of device you are using to access the Community, the areas of the Community that you access or use, and the time of day you used the Community, among other information. If you are in a store and interacting with Follett Higher Education Group, we may process data about you through a camera or similar technologies and we may make offers to you based on that data.  In addition, we automatically collect your IP address or other unique identifier ("Device Identifier") for any mobile phone, tablet or other device you may use to access the Services. A Device Identifier is a number that is automatically assigned or connected to the device you use to access the Community, and our servers identify your device by its Device Identifier.   Some mobile service providers may also provide us or our third party service providers with information regarding the physical location of the device used to access the Community. Usage Information is generally non-identifying, but if we associate it with you as a specific and identifiable person, we treat it as Personal Information.</p> <br> <p>The methods used to collect Usage Information may include the following:</p> <p id="cookies"><b><i>Cookies.</i></b> A cookie is a data file, which we place on a device when it is used to visit the Community or otherwise access our online content. Cookies may be used for many purposes, including, without limitation, remembering you and your preferences, tracking your visits to our web pages, and for displaying offers related to your prior activity on the Community. We may also use technologies such as cookies to provide you with enhanced online display advertising tailored to your interests.  To opt out of advertising provided by Follet, click <a href="http://dtmc.bkstr.com/adinfo/adchoices.html?cid=2554&amp;cname=Follett&amp;cmagic=8c59fd&amp;clogo=efollett_and_skyo.png&amp;purl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.efollett.com%2Fwebapp%2Fwcs%2Fstores%2Fservlet%2FHelpPrivacyPolicyView%3FlangId%3D-1%26catalogId%3D10001%26storeId%3D10051%26demoKey%3Dd">here</a>. A Flash cookie is a data file placed on a device via the Adobe Flash plugin that may be built-in to or downloaded by you to your device.  Flash cookies may be used for various purposes, including, without limitation, enabling a Flash feature and remembering your preferences. For more information about Flash and the privacy choices Adobe offers, visit <a href="  http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager.html">http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager.html</a>.  If you choose to disable cookies or to adjust your Flash privacy settings on your device, some features of the Services may not function properly.</p> <p id="webbeacons"><b><i>Web Beacons.</i></b> Small graphic images or other web programming code called web beacons (also known as "1x1 GIFs" or "clear GIFs") may be included in our web pages and e-mail messages. Web beacons may be invisible to you, but any electronic image or other web programming code inserted into a web page or e-mail can act as a web beacon. Web beacons or similar technologies may be used for a number of purposes, including, without limitation, to count visitors to the Community, to monitor how users navigate the Community, to count how many e-mails that were sent were actually opened or to count how many particular articles or links were actually viewed.</p> <p><b><i>Embedded Scripts.</i></b> An embedded script is programming code that is designed to collect information about your interactions with the Community, such as the links you click on. The code is temporarily downloaded onto your device from our web server or a third party service provider, is active only while you are connected to the Community, and is deactivated or deleted thereafter.</p> <p>In addition, we may use a variety of other technologies that collect similar information for security and fraud detection purposes.</p> <p><b>Information Third Parties Provide About You</b></p> <p>We may receive information about you from third parties. For example, your school may provide us with information about you, such as classes you are taking and Personal Information, so that we may provide services to you, such as selling you the required books for a class or offering you other products or services.  We may supplement and combine the information we collect with information provided by third parties for a variety of reasons, including to provide you with information, services or products you have requested, to enhance our ability to serve you, to tailor content and to offer you opportunities to purchase products or services that we believe may be of interest to you. In those cases, we will apply this Privacy Policy to the combined information.</p> <p><b>Social Features</b></p> <p>Functionality on the Services may permit interactions that you initiate between the Services and a third party web site or service ("Social Features").  Examples of Social Features include enabling you to "like" or "share" content from the Services to other web sites or services or to "like" or "share" our page on a third party service; to log-in using your username and password for a third party site or service; and to otherwise connect the Services to a third party web site or service . If you choose to share content or to otherwise post information through the Services to a third party site or service, or vice versa, that information may be publicly displayed.  Similarly, if you post information on a third party platform that references a Follett product (e.g., by using a Twitter hashtag associated with a Follett Brand product in your tweet), your post may be published on our Services. Also, both Follett and the third party may have access to certain information about you and your use of the Services and the third party site or service.  In addition, we may receive information about you if other users of a third party web site give us access to their profiles and you are one of their "connections" or information about you is otherwise accessible through your "connections" web page, profile page, or similar page on a social networking or other third party web site or interactive service.</p> <p>The information we collect in connection with Social Features is subject to this Privacy Policy. The information collected and stored by the third party remains subject to the third party's privacy practices, including whether the third party continues to share information with us, the types of information shared, and your choices with regard to what is visible to others on that third party web site or service.</p> <p><b>How Follett Uses Your Information</b></p> <p>Any information you provide or that is collected by Follett Higher Education Group may be combined with any other information you provide to us or that we collect through the Services or otherwise.  Follett Higher Education Group may use the information it collects or receives, including Personal Information and Usage Information: </p><p></p><ul><li>To allow you to participate in features we offer or to provide related customer service including, without limitation, to respond to your questions, complaints or comments;</li><li>To tailor content, recommendations and offers we display or otherwise provide to you;</li><li>To confirm or fulfill an order you have made or authorize or complete a transaction you have requested;</li><li>To provide you with information, products or services that you have requested or agreed to receive or that we otherwise believe will interest you, either on behalf of Follett Higher Education Group or third parties, and which may include advertisements or special offers;</li><li>To provide you with location features and services (e.g., allowing you to "check in" at a store or telling you about local deals and events)</li><li>To process your registration, including verifying that information you provide is active and valid;</li><li>To improve the Services and our products and for internal business purposes, analyzing usage of our Services and purchase of our products;</li><li>To contact you with regard to your use of the Services and, in our discretion, changes to our policies for the Services;</li><li>To enforce applicable agreements and policies for the Services; and</li><li>As otherwise described in this Privacy Policy and for purposes disclosed at the time you provide your information or with your consent.</li></ul><p></p><p><b>How Follett Shares Your Information</b></p> <p>Follett may share your Information in the following cases:</p> <p> </p><ul> <li><u>With Affiliates and Third-Party Service Providers</u>: Follett may disclose your Information to our affiliates and third-party service providers.   Third party service providers are not authorized by Follett to use or disclose your Information except as necessary to perform services on Follett's behalf or comply with legal requirements.</li> <li><u>With Your Consent</u>: Follett may share your Information with other third parties with your consent.</li> <li><u>As Required by Law</u>: Follett may disclose any Information we deem necessary, in Follett's sole discretion, to comply with any applicable law, regulation, legal process or governmental request and to provide information to a claimed  owner of intellectual property, and/or defend any applicable Terms of Use or other policies applicable to the Services, or to protect the personal safety, rights, property or security of any organization or individual.
