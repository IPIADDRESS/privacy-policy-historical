                        <li><a href="newsItem.php?ItemId=227" target="_self">The regional office of Zoomlion in Koforidua has begun an exercise to collect all refuse within the New Juaben Municipality at the various dumping sites across the regional capital, this morning.The exercise has become necessary following the continue outcry of the residents within the Koforidua township for the fear of any eventuality of cholera outbreak within the municipality as the raining season has started.Koforidua has been inundated with refuse for the past three weeks, with the only refuse-collection company in the regional capital, Zoomlion, refusing to clear them due to the government’s indebtedness to them.This morning around, staffs from Zoomlion with their trucks and other heavy equipment were deployed to some of the dumping sites to cart the refuse to the proper dumping site, provided by the Municipal Assembly.The Zoomlion did not only cart the over three weeks refuse dumping site at the various places but also spray the site to kill any bacterial so as not to bring any health hazard to the people staying close to the dumping site.Ms. Faustina Shadey from the Zoomlion office in Koforidua, called for an attitudinal change towards sanitation, saying ensuring hygiene is both personal and a shared responsibility.“We have to try to manage ourselves. There are some responsibilities for individuals that would not lead to the situation in the capital,” she said.Ms. Faustina Shadey said by the close of&nbsp;Monday, the heaps of refuse at the various communities within the municipality will all be clear.&nbsp;Date | July 11, 2015Source | &nbsp;Brytfmonline.com</a></li><li><a href="newsItem.php?ItemId=228" target="_self">&nbsp;Two prisoners, serving various sentences at the Amanfrom Camp Prisons, near Kumasi, in the Ashanti region, reportedly escaped&nbsp;on Friday.The two prisoners, names immediately not available, allegedly escaped whilst they were working with their colleagues on the farm in the afternoon.There were initial reports that the prisoners broke through the strong walls of the Amanfrom Prisons to their freedom.But prison officers stated categorically that no prison break had taken place at the camp as was being spread.“Initial reports that there has been a prison break at the Amanfrom Camp Prisons is not true,” Lance Corporal George Owusu, Assistant Regional Prisons PRO, said.According to him, “It is indeed true that two prisoners could not be located on the farm, but they did not break from the prisons as reported.”L/Cpl Owusu said on Otec FM that the two prisoners, whose identities he did not give, escaped whilst working on the farm.“One of the prisoners was working in the vegetable farm whilst the other was working at the piggery when they escaped,” he explained.The PRO noted that his outfit was doing everything possible to re-arrest the hoodlums from their hideouts.“Our men are conducting a thorough search in vehicles that ply the road leading to the Amanfrom Prisons and the nearby towns.“We are doing that in order to prevent the escapees from fleeing the area with the aid of a vehicle,” L/Cpl Owusu pointed out.He added that other officers were seriously combing Amanfrom and the adjoining towns in an attempt to recapture the runaway prisoners.He urged the public not to panic, stressing that the prison officers were determined to re-arrest the escapees to face the law.Owusu also admonished the media to remain calm; assuring that his outfit would readily brief them about the latest on the issue.&nbsp;Date | July 11, 2015Source | &nbsp;Daily Guide</a></li><li><a href="newsItem.php?ItemId=229" target="_self">Former President John Agyekum Kufuor has reiterated the need for a review of the current constitutional arrangement which gives the Chairman of the Electoral Commission (EC) an open-ended security of tenure.&nbsp;He said manning the EC for about 20 years as in the case of Dr Kwadwo Afari Gyan, the immediate past EC chairman, was not the best.He, therefore, proposed that the position be given a five-year tenure instead of the enjoyment of an open-ended security tenure as a Supreme Court Judge.Mr Kufuor, who was speaking yesterday at his residence in Accra when he received a delegation of political parties and governance institutions from Zimbabwe, Uganda and Kenya, however, said the EC chairman’s term should go over one election.He said if the EC chairman performed well in the organisation of the elections, his or her term of office should be extended.However, he said, if the EC chairman failed to organise the elections well, his or her tenure should not be renewed.He told the delegation that calls for a review of the tenure of the EC chairman was one of the reforms needed in Ghana's electoral system.Dr Kwadwo Afari Gyan was the chairman of the EC for 20 years. Following his retirement this year, President John Dramani Mahama, appointed Mrs Charlotte Osei, a former Chairperson of the National Commission for Civic Education (NCCE), as the new head of the EC.Tolerance in politicsMr Kufuor said it was crucial for Africans to tolerate one another in politics, irrespective of tribes or ideology."Why shouldn't we treat each other with respect. Rather, we look at one another as enemies or second-class beings," he said.The former President said the world was opening up, with more people showing human feelings in disaster situations, despite the pockets of violence in some countries.The Executive Director of the Institute of Economic Affairs (IEA), Mrs Jean Mensa, said members of the delegation wanted to learn from former President Kufuor’s rich experience in the promotion of democracy, good governance and economic development in Ghana and Africa.The Deputy Secretary of Administration of ZANU PF of Zimbabwe, Mr July Moyo, who spoke on behalf of the delegation, said the members wanted to learn how dialogue could be used to settle squabbles.He expressed the hope that Ghana would help Zimbabwe to craft a new level of dialogue needed to deepen its democracy.&nbsp;Date | July 11, 2015Source | &nbsp;Graphic.com.gh</a></li><li><a href="newsItem.php?ItemId=230" target="_self">&nbsp;Boko Haram has released a beheading video, its first since pledging allegiance to Isis in March.The ten-minute long footage by the Nigerian militant group mimics the violent videos released by Isis propaganda clips.It begins by showing shooting between Boko Haram gunmen and what appear to be Nigerian soldiers.&nbsp;Members of the terror group are then shown next to soldiers they have killed, showing the security badge of one victim to the camera.One soldier is made to kneel at the feet of Boko Haram members who wield guns. The video then shows the soldier’s decapitated body.&nbsp;The Nigerian Bulletin&nbsp;reports that the ‘west Africa’ insignia present in the top-left corner of the footage suggests that the group have set up a new ‘media wing’.In March of this year Boko Haram&nbsp;pledged allegiance to Isis&nbsp;(also known as Islamic State) and announced it would adopt the name “Islamic State’s West Africa Province”. An audio statement was released on the former’s social media channels, said to be the voice of the group’s leader Abubakar Shekau.More than 200 people have been killed in Nigeria in the last fortnight as part of a recent surge in violence by Boko Haram. It has been claimed that the increased bloodshed has been due to an Isis directive to intensify violence during the holy month of Ramadan.Thousands have been killed and about 1.5 million displaced during Boko Haram's six-year-old insurgency to carve out a state adhering to strict Islamic law in Nigeria, Africa's biggest economy and top oil producer. At the start of the year, it controlled a swathe of territory larger than Belgium in the northeast of the country.Boko Haram has since been pushed back with the help of offensives launched by troops from Chad and Niger while Cameroon has fought them off along its borders.&nbsp;Date | July 11, 2015Source | &nbsp;BBC</a></li><li><a href="newsItem.php?ItemId=231" target="_self">&nbsp;Ghana international midfielder Kevin-Prince Boateng has rejected offers to join Black Stars captain in China, according to his agent.&nbsp;A number of Chinese clubs have expressed interests in signing Boateng but his agent Edoardo Crnjar has stated Boateng wants to play for a top club and is not interested in a move to the Asian country.Boateng, 28, has been left out of the Schalke pre-season squad and is looking for a new club.Turkish giants Galatasaray and AC Milan have all been linked with the former Portsmouth midfielder, but there is no concrete offer yet.&nbsp;Date | July 11, 2015Source | &nbsp;Ghanasoccernet.com</a></li>                    </ul>
