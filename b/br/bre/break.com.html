                We gather user information to provide you with a customized experience 
                on our site. Your user information helps us tailor the content, 
                services, goods and advertising to your current and future needs. 
                For this reason, we may ask you to register or to provide personal 
                information when you post comments, enter a contest, order products, 
                subscribe to a newsletter and/or visit certain areas of our site. 
                If you choose not to register you may not have access to areas 
                that require personal identification. <br>
              </p>
              <p>If you register with our site or purchase products from us, from 
                time to time we may e-mail you with messages about our services 
                or third party products and services we believe may be of interest 
                to you, such as new products, features, services, special offers 
                and updated information. The newsletters may contain code that 
                enables our database to track your usage of the newsletters, including 
                whether the e-mail was opened and/or what links (if any) were 
                clicked. We will combine that information with other information 
                we have about you and may use that information to improve your 
                site experience and/or provide customized e-mail communications 
                to you. In addition, if you register with our site or purchase 
                products you may automatically receive e-mails confirming your 
                registration and/or purchase and providing you with necessary 
                information relating to the access or use of your registration 
                and/or purchase. With the exception of the e-mails described in 
                the preceding sentence which are necessary to provide customer 
                support and deliver products and services to you, you may opt-out 
                of receiving e-mail from us as described below.</p>

              <p><br>
                <font class="header">Use of Information</font><br>
                When you register, we ask for your e-mail address, a unique nickname 
                selected by you and other information. Once you are a registered 
                user you can update your profile and may be able to provide additional 
                preferential information. <br>
              </p>
              <p>For contests, we collect information from users in order to register 
                them for the contest and to provide for payment.<br>
                We may use an order form for users to request information, products 
                and services. For that order form, we collect a user’s contact 
                information (e-mail address) and necessary financial information 
                to process the order (i.e. credit card number). Contact information 
                from the order (including e-mail) may be used to deliver digital 
                products and information. We may use third parties to accept and 
                process orders and credit card purchases for merchandise and products, 
                including software. <br>

              </p>
              <p>We may occasionally present a special contest or promotion that 
                is sponsored by another company. To qualify for entry in that 
                contest or promotion, we may ask you to provide personal information. 
                If we plan to share that information with the sponsor(s) or with 
                others, we will provide a statement to that effect in the contest 
                or promotion terms. <br>
              </p>
              <p>All communication on the Internet takes place between pairs of 
                IP Addresses. Our Web servers will log the IP address that any

                diagnose technical problems or prevent abuse of our systems or 
                other site users. Your IP address may also be used to gather aggregate

              <p>Applications you use or download from our site may contain third

                may allow for communication between your software and the third

                <font class="header">Information Sharing</font><br>
                We will not share your personally identifiable information with 
                third parties, aside from entities that perform services for us, 
                such as fulfilling orders or processing payment, that either are 
                bound to comply with our privacy policy or have privacy policies 
                that protect your information unless you have “opted-in” 
                to such sharing. If you have previously opted-in to such sharing 
                under a prior privacy policy version, you are still considered 
                to have opted-in under this privacy policy. As stated, and whether 
                or not you have opted-in, we may use third parties to accept and 
                process orders for merchandise and products, including software, 
                and such third parties may get access to your personal information 
                for the purposes of providing services or products to you on our 
                behalf. In addition, if you opt-out, we may share that information 
                with third parties who send e-mails on our behalf so that they 
                do not e-mail you. <br>
              </p>
              <p>However, we may disclose information you provide if required 
                to do so by law or if we have a good faith belief that disclosure 
                is necessary to (1) comply with the law or with legal process 
                served on us; (2) protect and defend our rights or property; or 
                (3) act in an emergency to protect someone’s safety. <br>

              </p>
              <p>We may request demographic information from you (for example, 
                your age, education level or household income) from time to time. 
                We will not share that information in a manner that identifies 
                you as an individual with any other entity, unless we let you 
                know that at the time of collection or we have your permission. 
                When we share demographic information with third parties, we will 
                give them aggregate information only. <br>
              </p>
              <p>In the event that we acquired by another company, your personal 
                information may be part of the assets transferred to the acquiring 
                party. </p>
              <p><br>
                <font class="header">Opt-Out</font><br>
                If you provide us with your e-mail address, and do not opt-out 
                of receiving e-mail from us, we may e-mail you with information, 
                including information about selected third parties. If you do 
                not want to receive information from us, you may decline to receive 
                it (or “Opt-Out”) either when you provide personal 
                information to us or you may update your profile. You may also 
                choose to Opt-Out from certain types of e-mail by following the 
                unsubscribe instructions that appear on each newsletter. You may 
                also contact us as provided below. Please note that there might 
                be a brief delay between when you submit your request to opt-out 
                and when it is processed and reflected in our systems; accordingly 
                you might continue to receive e-mails from us for a few days after 
                you unsubscribe. We maintain records of those users who opt-out 
                of specific e-mail options so that we do not e-mail them with 
                respect to those types of e-mails, and we may share this information 
                with third parties who send e-mails on our behalf so that they 
                do not e-mail you; this information may also be contained in web 
                logs (see above).</p>

                <font class="header">Children Under 13</font><br>
                Our site is not directed to children under the age of 13. We assume 
                products purchased through credit card means are purchased by 
                adults. We respect the privacy of parents and children and are 
                committed to complying with the Children’s Online Privacy 
                Protection Act (COPPA). On those areas of the sites that ask for 
                age, we do not collect personal information from individuals who 
                identify themselves as under the age of 13 except in those limited 
                circumstances where we believe that such collection is permitted 
                under COPPA. </p>
              <p><br>
                If a parent believes that his or her child has submitted personal 
                information to we, he or she can contact us via e-mail or postal 
                mail as listed below. We will promptly delete the information 
                upon learning that it relates to a child under the age of 13. 
                Please note that it is possible some of this information may remain 
                archived in web logs and back-up archives after we delete the 
                information from its active database (see above regarding web 
                logs, and below regarding archived information).</p>
              <p><br>
                We believe that parents should supervise their children’s 
                online activities and consider using parental control tools available 
                from online services and software manufacturers that help provide 
                a kid-friendly online environment. These tools can also prevent 
                children from otherwise disclosing online their name, address 
                and other personal information without parental permission. </p>

                <font class="header">Other</font><br>
                We have security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse 
                and alteration of the information under our control. These include 
                a firewall to prevent unauthorized access to our systems and maintenance 
                of registration information in a separate database. Although we 
                will exercise reasonable care in providing secure transmission 
                of information between your computer and our servers, we cannot

                to us over the Internet and we accept no liability for any unintentional 
                disclosure. We will protect the transmission of credit card information
