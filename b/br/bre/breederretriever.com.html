<p><br>
    <strong>How do we use your information?</strong><br>
    <br>
  We may use the information we collect from you when you register, purchase  products, enter a contest or promotion, respond to a survey or marketing  communication, surf the website, or use certain other site features in the  following ways:</p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>To personalize your site       experience and to allow us to deliver the type of content and product       offerings in which you are most interested.</li>
  <li>To allow us to better service       you in responding to your customer service requests.</li>
  <li>To quickly process your       transactions.</li>
  <li>To administer a contest,       promotion, survey or other site feature.</li>
</ul>
<p><br>
    <strong>How do we protect visitor information?</strong><br>
    <br>
  We implement a variety of security measures to maintain the safety of your  personal information. Your personal information is contained behind secured  networks and is only accessible by a limited number of persons who have special  access rights to such systems, and are required to keep the information  confidential. When you place orders or access your personal information, we  offer the use of a secure server. All sensitive/credit information you supply  is transmitted via Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology and then encrypted into  our databases to be only accessed as stated above.<br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <strong>Do we use "cookies"?</strong><br>
  <br>
  Yes. Cookies are small files that a site or its service provider transfers to  your computer's hard drive through your Web browser (if you allow) that enables  the site's or service provider's systems to recognize your browser and capture  and remember certain information. For instance, we use cookies to help us  remember and process the items in your shopping cart. They are also used to  help us understand your preferences based on previous or current site activity,  which enables us to provide you with improved services. We also use cookies to  help us compile aggregate data about site traffic and site interaction so that  we can offer better site experiences and tools in the future.<br>
  <br>
  We may contract with third-party service providers to assist us in better  understanding our site visitors. These service providers are not permitted to  use the information collected on our behalf except to help us conduct and  improve our business.<br>
  <br>
  You can choose to have your computer warn you each time a cookie is being sent,  or you can choose to turn off all cookies. You do this through your browser  (like Netscape Navigator or Internet Explorer) settings. Each browser is a  little different, so look at your browser Help menu to learn the correct way to  modify your cookies. If you turn cookies off, you won't have access to many  features that make your site experience more efficient and some of our services  will not function properly. However, you can still place orders over the  telephone by contacting customer service.<br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <strong>Do we disclose the information we collect to outside parties?</strong><br>
  <br>
  We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer to outside parties your personally  identifiable information unless we provide you with advance notice, except as  described below. The term "outside parties" does not include Your  Best Deals. It also does not include website hosting partners and other parties  who assist us in operating our website, conducting our business, or servicing  you, so long as those parties agree to keep this information confidential. We  may also release your information when we believe release is appropriate to  comply with the law, enforce our site policies, or protect ours or others'  rights, property, or safety.<br>
  <br>
  However, non-personally identifiable visitor information may be provided to  other parties for marketing, advertising, or other uses.<br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <strong>How can you opt-out, remove or modify information you have provided to  us?</strong><br>
  <br>
  To modify your e-mail subscriptions, please let us know by modifying your  preferences in the "My Account" section. Please note that due to  email production schedules you may receive any emails already in production.<br>
  <br>
  To delete all of your online account information from our database, sign into  the "My Account" section of our site and remove your shipping  addresses, billing addresses &amp; payment information. Please note that we may  maintain information about an individual sales transaction in order to service  that transaction and for record keeping.<br>
