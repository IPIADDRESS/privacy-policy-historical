<p>•&nbsp;“Cookies” are small data files stored on your computer or device at the request of a Web site.&nbsp; In addition to the general purposes listed above, cookies may enable us to recognize you as the same user who was at our Site in the past, and relate your use of the Site to other information about you, such as other Site usage information and Personal Information.&nbsp;&nbsp; Cookies may also be used to enhance your experience on the Site (for example, by storing your username) and/or to collect general usage and aggregated statistical information.&nbsp; Most browsers can be set to detect cookies and give you an opportunity to reject them, but refusing cookies may, in some cases, limit your use of the Site or its features.&nbsp; To learn more about the use of cookies, including how to manage or delete them, click <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/consumer-education/education-resources">here</a>.<br>
•&nbsp;“Local shared objects,” such as “Flash cookies,” may be stored on your computer or device using a media player or other software installed on your computer or device.&nbsp; Local shared objects operate a lot like cookies, but cannot be managed in the same way.&nbsp; Depending on how local shared objects are enabled on your computer or device, you may be able to manage them using software settings.&nbsp; For information on managing Flash cookies, for example, click <a href="http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager.html#117118">here</a>.&nbsp;<br>
•&nbsp;A “pixel tag” (also known as a “clear GIF” or “web beacon”) is a tiny image – typically just one-pixel – that can be placed on a Web page or in our electronic communications to you in order to help us measure the effectiveness of our content by, for example, counting the number of individuals who visit us online or verifying whether you’ve opened one of our emails or seen one of our Web pages.<br>
•&nbsp;“HTML5” (the language some Web sites, such as mobile Web sites, are coded in) may be used to store information on your computer or device about your Site usage activities and to help determine how our Site is being used by our visitors, how it can be improved, and to customize it for our users.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
The above tracking technologies may be deployed by us or our service providers on our behalf.&nbsp; For example, we currently use, and/or in the future may use Coremetrics, Google Analytics, Comscore and/or other third party vendors to collect Site usage information and track traffic to, from and around the Sites.&nbsp;To find out more about how your Site usage information is collected through the Google Analytics tools, <a href="http://www.google.com/analytics/learn/privacy.html">click here</a>, to find out information about the practices of Coremetrics, <a href="http://www.ibm.com/privacy/us/en/#services">click here</a> and for Comscore, click <a href="http://www.comscore.com/About_comScore/Privacy_Policy">here</a>.&nbsp; You may be able to opt out of certain collection by Google Analytics by clicking <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en">here</a>, and for Coremetrics’ opt-out options, click <a href="http://www.ibm.com/privacy/us/en/#optout">here</a>.</p>

<p><strong>How we may use your information</strong><br>
