<h4>PRIVACY STATEMENT</h4>

<h5>Information Collection and Use</h5>

<p>breastcancer.org™ is the sole owner of the information collected on this site.

Please be aware, however, that once you leave the breastcancer.org website, breastcancer.org cannot vouch for or assume any responsibility for any material contained in a website to which a link is provided or for the policies and practices of that website. breastcancer.org collects information from our users at several different points on our website, including:</p>

<p>Though we make every effort to preserve user privacy, we may need to disclose personal information when required by law wherein we have a good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with a current judicial proceeding, a court order or legal process served on our Web site.</p>



<h4>Public Forums</h4>

<p><b>Ask-the-Expert Online Conferences at breastcancer.org</b></p>

<p>Users who participate in our online "Ask-the-Expert Conferences" are asked to provide a username, which is used solely to differentiate between remarks made by different users during the conference, and in the archived transcript that resides on the site.  This user name is entirely of the user's own choosing, and does not require any personally identifiable information.  Users should be aware that choosing a username that allows personal identification, or disclosing personally identifiable information to other conference participants makes the information submitted public information.  Such disclosure may increase the chance of receiving "spam" or unsolicited email.  breastcancer.org encourages users to use discretion when disclosing information online.</p>

<a name="cookies"></a>

<h4>Cookies</h4>



<p>A cookie is a piece of data stored on your computer's hard drive. Cookies contain information about you and your computer. A "session cookie" is a temporary file created when a website is accessed. It ceases to exist (is self-terminated) either on the basis of an pre-set expiration date or time (e.g., three hours from creation of the cookie) or when you close your web browser. Once you close your browser, the cookie simply terminates (i.e., ceases to exist). breastcancer.org uses session cookies in three places: Free Booklets by Mail, Tell-a-Friend, and Life-Lines e-mail greeting cards. This allows you to send more than one card or page without having to re-enter your own name and e-mail address each time.</p>

<p>A "persistent cookie" is a file that remains on your computer's hard drive for an extended period of time. breastcancer.org uses persistent cookies to track aggregate user statistics on the site to help us determine how people move throughout the site, which areas are popular, and which links are unpopular or hard to see. </p>

<p>Advertisers or third party vendors who implement banner ads that link to our site from other sites may also set persistent cookies on our site. We do not have access to or control over these cookies, once we have given permission for them to set cookies for advertising or tracking purposes. We may receive information regarding aggregate traffic patterns as a result of these third party cookies. </p>

<p>You may remove persistent cookies at any time from your hard drive by following Internet browser "help file" directions. </p>

<p>Cookies are in no way linked to any personally identifiable information while on our site. </p>



<h4>Web Beacons</h4>

<p>Web beacons are tiny graphical images (usually 1x1 pixels) that are served from a third party advertiser or marketing firm. Web beacons allow that third party to set their own cookies on your hard drive—enabling them to track your Internet usage across many other web sites. Web beacons help us determine the effectiveness of our advertising campaigns on other websites. Web Beacons are in no way linked to personally identifiable information while on our site. </p>


<h4>Log Files</h4>



<p>We use IP addresses to analyze trends, administer the site, track user's movement, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. "IP addresses" are the equivalent of internet "mailing addresses." They tell other computers on the Internet where to send the information you have requested, such as new web pages or images. IP addresses are not linked to personally identifiable information. </p>



<h4>Sharing Information</h4>



<p>We will share aggregated demographic information with our partners and advertisers. Partners can include providers of content and services, such as the American Cancer Society, as well as financial sponsors and advertisers. This is not linked to any personal information that can identify any individual person.</p>



<h4>Links</h4>



<p>This web site contains links to other sites. Please be aware that breastcancer.org is not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every web site that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by this website.</p>



<h4>Security</h4>

<p>This website takes every precaution to protect our users' information. When you submit sensitive information via the website, your information is protected both online and off-line as described in this policy statement. Please be aware, however, that e-mail messages sent to a website may not be secure. Site visitors sending e-mail accept the risk that a third party may intercept e-mail messages. To protect our users' information once it is received by breastcancer.org, we have the following policies:</p>

<p>On occasion, questions submitted by e-mail may be referred to a member of the breastcancer.org Professional Advisory Board or Consumer Advisory Board, for answers and support. The name and e-mail address of the person submitting the question will not be shared with the member of the Professional Advisory Board to whom the question is referred. </p>

<p>All of our users' information is restricted in our offices. Only employees or independent contractors who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, Dr. Weiss, who personally responds to medical queries; a mail manager who e-mails a response from a medical expert to a site user) are granted access to personally identifiable information. ALL employees and independent contractors are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy practices. </p>

<p>Periodically, as well as any time new policies are added, our employees and independent contractors are notified and/or reminded about the importance we place on privacy, and what they can do to ensure our customers' information is protected. If you have any questions about the security at our website, please <a href="contact_intro.html">contact technical support</a>.</p>



<h4>Correction/Updating Personal Information:</h4>



<p>If a user's personally identifiable information changes (such as your zip code), or if a user no longer desires our service, we will endeavor to provide a way to correct, update or remove that user's personal data provided to us. This can be done by <a href="contact_intro.html">contacting Customer Support</a>. Users will receive a confirmation email stating that we have received their updated or corrected information and/or their request to have personal data removed.</p>



<h4>Choice/Opt-out</h4>



<p>Our users are given the opportunity to 'opt-out' of having their information used for purposes not directly related to our site, at the point where we ask for the information. For example, users who no longer wish to receive our e-mail Updates may opt-out of receiving these communications by following the Unsubscribe directions in the Update or by <a href="contact_intro.html">contacting us</a>.</p>



<h4>Notification of Changes</h4>



<p>Users will be notified of any changes in our Privacy Policy by a link to the updated policy on the home page, including an icon indicating that the policy has recently changed.  It is our commitment that our users will always be aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under circumstances, if any, we disclose it.</p>

<p>If, at any point, we decide to use personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time it was collected, we will notify users by way of an e-mail. Users will have a choice as to whether or not we use their information in this different manner. We will use information in accordance with the privacy policy under which the information was collected.</p>
