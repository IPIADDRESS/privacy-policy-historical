              <p class="reg-ar-blk"><strong>Registration<br>
              </strong>In order to use some of the services  of this website, a user must first complete a form. During registration a user  is required to give their contact information (such as name and email address).  This information is used to contact the user about the services on our site for  which they have expressed interest. Please note that the owner's email address  and contact phone number will be displayed to our users.</p>
              <p class="reg-ar-blk"><strong>Cookies<br>
              </strong>Some of our pages require use of  cookies on our site. These cookies are for identification only.</p>
              <p class="reg-ar-blk"><strong>Log Files<br>
              </strong>We use IP addresses to analyze trends,  administer the site, track user's movement, and gather broad demographic  information for aggregate use. IP addresses are not linked to personally  identifiable information.</p>
              <p class="reg-ar-blk"><strong>Sharing<br>
              </strong>We will share aggregated demographic  information with our partners and advertisers. This is not linked to any  personal information that can identify any individual person.</p>
              <p class="reg-ar-blk">We use a credit card processing  company to bill users for goods and services. These companies do not retain,  share, store or use personally identifiable information for any secondary  purposes.</p>
              <p class="reg-ar-blk"><strong>Links<br>
              </strong>This web site contains links to other  sites. Please be aware that we are not responsible for the privacy practices of  such other sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site  and to read the privacy statements of each and every web site that collects  personally identifiable information. This privacy statement applies solely to  information collected by this Web site.</p>
              <p class="reg-ar-blk"><strong>Security<br>
              </strong>This website takes every precaution to  protect our users' information. When users submit sensitive information via the  website, your information is protected both online and off-line.</p>
              <p class="reg-ar-blk">When our registration/order form asks  users to enter sensitive information (such as credit card number), that  information is encrypted and is protected with the best encryption software in  the industry - SSL. While on a secure page, such as PayPal order form, the lock  icon on the bottom of Web browsers such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft  Internet Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to un-locked, or open, when you  are just 'surfing'.</p>
              <p class="reg-ar-blk">While we use SSL encryption to protect  sensitive information online, we also do everything in our power to protect  user-information off-line. All of our users' information, not just the  sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted in our offices. Only  employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, our  billing clerk or a customer service representative) are granted access to  personally identifiable information. Our employees must use password-protected  screen-savers when they leave their desk. When they return, they must re-enter  their password to re-gain access to your information. Furthermore, ALL  employees are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy practices. Every  quarter, as well as any time new policies are added, our employees are notified  and/or reminded about the importance we place on privacy, and what they can do  to ensure our customers' information is protected. Finally, the servers that we  store personally identifiable information on are kept in a secure environment,  behind a locked cage.</p>
              <p class="reg-ar-blk">If you have any questions about the  security at our website, you can send an email to <a href="mailto:privacy@BreedersDirect.com" class="footer-links">privacy@BreedersDirect.com</a>.</p>

              <p class="reg-ar-blk"><strong>Correction/Updating Personal  Information<br>
