<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Another of our Publisher Solutions, BiddR Connect, typically collects and passes to advertisers and their intermediaries the following information: browser type, IP address, domain names, operating systems, language preference, platform type, device location, access dates and times, referring website addresses, browsing and search activity, online transactions, randomly-generated unique cookie ID numbers relating to a specific user, and, in some cases, estimated age range and gender.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Our Advertiser Solutions also collect data, such as segment data as well as the data types listed above, through intermediary platforms. Segments are categories of consumers that advertisers use to plan and execute their digital advertising campaigns.&nbsp; An example would be female, 18-24, soccer fan, living in New York.</span></p>

<td>Is that PII/ personal data?</td>
<td>We do not collect PII as defined by the Network Advertising Initiative and Digital Advertising Alliance. Some of the data we collect would be considered pseudonymized data in the European Union—for example, where we collect IP addresses and unique cookie IDs. These IP addresses and cookie IDs, and the data we store against those identifiers, will often be pseudonymized data (a kind of personal data regulated by European data protection law).&nbsp; We and our partners in the digital advertising ecosystem use this data to understand the interests and characteristics of users without knowing who the users are—our products don’t collect users’ names and don’t handle information that reveals a users’ "real world identity".</td>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We may receive pseudonymized information about online users from other sources, including publicly available databases or third parties from whom we have purchased data.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> Examples of the types of personal information that may be obtained from public sources or third parties include: information about online activity, information about interests, and demographic information. This information is collected by data management platforms such as Lotame and LiveRamp. We use data we purchase from data management platforms to enhance and improve our understanding of a user’s characteristics and interests.

<tr>
<td>How Information is Put to Use</td>
<td>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We use Platform Data (as defined below) in our Publisher Solutions to help our publisher clients monetize their available ad space. We do this by helping publishers find advertisers and intermediaries who want to show advertisements to users. Advertisers use the Publisher Solutions to help them decide whether to pay to show an ad to a user, and, if they want to pay, how much they should pay.&nbsp; That decision takes place through an automated, software-based process called "real-time bidding" where multiple advertisers bid to show their ad.&nbsp; The Publisher Solutions support real-time bidding as well as other ways to buy online advertising space.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> We also use Platform Data in our Advertiser Solutions to help advertisers and the agencies who represent them understand the behavior of online users, create online advertising or engagement strategies, and execute ad campaigns. As part of our Advertiser Solutions, we may buy advertising inventory on behalf of advertisers or agencies, or may allow advertisers or agencies to use our technology to buy and show online ads to the right users. The Advertiser Solutions can monitor and report to the advertiser on how at an aggregate level users reacted to the ads. </span></p>

<td>Sharing Platform Data</td>
<td>In connection with the provision of our digital advertising services, we may share Platform Data with our advertiser clients, demand-side platforms (DSPs), ad exchanges (who will make the information available to advertisers and their agencies to facilitate decisions about whether to show an online ad to a user), third party service providers (including data centers, hosting providers, anti-fraud vendors, and technology and security providers with whom we have contracted), EMX subsidiaries and affiliates, and our publisher clients (who may operate either websites or apps).</td>

<div id="what-does-emx-do-and-how-do-we-use-data-on-online-users"></div>
<h5>What Does EMX Do and How Do We Use Data on Online Users?</h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We work with online publishers, advertisers and other intermediaries in the digital advertising sector. We help publishers generate advertising revenue from their websites and apps, and help advertisers find the right audiences online who are most likely to be interested in their products and services. In order to provide our services, EMX obtains data from websites, mobile applications, advertisers, advertising exchanges and other advertising platforms. We sometimes supplement that information with data collected from data brokers. A description of some of the products and services we offer is provided below.</span></p>
<strong><span class="s2">Publisher Solutions</span></strong><span class="s1"><strong>&nbsp;</strong></span>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><i>BiddR Connect</i>: If a user visits the website of a publisher within our network, our tag on the publisher page calls the EMX platform, allowing EMX to access the user's browser, obtain data on that end user, and store it against a unique ID. The information gathered typically includes the kind of device and browser the user has, the zip code, country and city the user is in, and the internet protocol or IP address of the user’s device (a unique number assigned to a browser by the user's ISP or mobile phone provider). Our software does not collect the user's name or email address, and we take care to ensure that our products do not collect anything that tells us or anyone we work with who you are "in the real world".</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><i>BiddRº360</i>: BiddRº360 does not collect any information about the user or their device. BiddRº360 lets other advertising technology software platforms know that advertising space is available and that a user has landed on a page. Those other software platforms (known as DSPs and ad exchanges) are software services which advertisers and their representatives use to find online users they want to advertise to. After BiddRº360 calls them with page information, the DSPs and ad exchanges then access information relating to an online user and that user’s device by communicating with the user's browser. What information the DSPs and ad exchanges collect can vary, depending on choices made by the DSPs, ad exchanges and consents given by the user.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><i>Summary of how other parties in the ecosystem use this data</i>: The process of matching a publisher that wants to sell advertising space with an advertiser that wants to show an ad involves several other companies and platforms which can be referred to as intermediaries.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Other than BiddRº360, our Publisher Solutions take user data and pass it to DSPs and ad exchanges, whose job it is to find advertisers who want to show an online ad to the user. Those platforms, and often the intermediaries and service providers they work with, hold other data relating to the user in order to have an understanding of the user's interests, characteristics (sometimes including age range and gender), and location. This other data held by DSPs and ad exchanges—which we do not hold in our Publisher Solutions—helps DSPs and ad exchanges form a picture of the user without knowing the user’s “real world” identity. This helps advertisers or their intermediaries work out whether they want to show an ad to that user and, if so, how much they are prepared to pay to do that.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Advertiser Solutions</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Our Advertiser Solutions are specific services we offer to advertisers and their intermediaries (usually DSPs) to help increase the value they get from showing ads online, including video ads. Our Advertiser Solutions help ensure that real human users, rather than bots (software programs which mimic human behavior and are often the cause of advertising fraud), see the ads, and assist in showing ads to the people most likely to be interested in the advertised products.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><i>Segment Data</i>: User segment data is information about a user's interests, preferences or demographic categories. Interest-based advertising involves placing a user into a segment based on information about their online behavior, interests, or characteristics.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">For instance, a segment might be women, between ages 25 and 54, interested in fashion, or—for another example—18- to 24-year-old auto-intenders (people assumed to be interested in buying a car). Knowing a user is in one or more of these segments helps advertisers plan and direct their online advertising campaigns.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Sometimes the segment data provided by a Publisher is not enough for the advertiser to make a good decision. Consequently, our Advertiser Solutions combine data provided by a Publisher with data about the user from other sources. The principal source of additional data for our Advertiser Solutions are data management platforms (or DMPs). DMPs we may use are Lotame (<a href="http://www.lotame.com/"><span class="s2">www.lotame.com</span></a>), LiveRamp (<a href="http://www.liveramp.com/"><span class="s2">www.liveramp.com</span></a>) or Factual (www.factual.com). These DMPs provide us with demographic data about the user, as well as data about the user’s interests, age group, and location.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">EMX uses this information to assess, based on criteria provided by our advertiser clients, whether it should purchase ad space for an advertiser. If the opportunity to show an ad matches the advertiser’s criteria (this assessment is, in part, carried out using information about the user, the duration of the ad, and the publisher's webpage or app), then EMX will try to win the opportunity to serve the ad. After winning an opportunity, EMX will check the ad space to make sure its characteristics match the characteristics sought. After checking the space, EMX will decide whether to purchase the ad inventory and serve an ad.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">EMX will analyze how the user interacts with the ad, how long they view it for, where the ad is on the page, and whether the user clicks on the ad. EMX will report this information back to the advertiser or their DSP on an aggregated basis.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">EMX supports the NAI Code of Conduct’s obligations regarding the collection and use of health information for interest-based advertising. This health-related information, when collected and/or used for relevant advertising, is non-sensitive and consumers may exercise choice by opting out (please see Section 10 (Your Choices) for more information). For a list of health segments used by EMX, please visit&nbsp;<a href="http://emxdigital.com/privacy/health-segments/"><span class="s2">http://emxdigital.com/privacy/health-segments/</span></a></span></p>

<div id="what-do-we-mean-by-platform-data"></div>
<h5>What Do We Mean by Platform Data?</h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Our Publisher Solutions and Advertiser Solutions are designed to use certain types of data that we call Platform Data. The term Platform Data includes data collected by us from users' browsers, data generated through the Publisher Solutions and Advertiser Solutions, as well as data we or our advertiser clients may receive from DMPs.<i>Platform Data – Publisher Solutions</i>: One of our Publisher Solutions, BiddRº360, does not collect PII or personal data (as understood in Europe). Another of our Publisher Solutions, BiddR Connect, typically collects and passes the following information to advertisers and their intermediaries (please note that in the EU this information is only collected and used after receiving user consent):&nbsp;</span></p>

<ul>
 	<li class="p1"><span class="s2">browser type;</span></li>
 	<li class="p1"><span class="s2">IP address;</span></li>
 	<li class="p1"><span class="s2">App Store ID (iTunes or Google Play);</span></li>
 	<li class="p1"><span class="s2">device ID;</span></li>
 	<li class="p1"><span class="s2">URL of the page the user is on;</span></li>
 	<li class="p1"><span class="s2">operating system and version number used on the user's device;</span></li>
 	<li class="p1"><span class="s2">device type;</span></li>
 	<li class="p1"><span class="s2">device location (country, city and zip or postal code);</span></li>
 	<li class="p1"><span class="s2">referring website addresses;</span></li>
 	<li class="p1"><span class="s2">randomly-generated unique cookie ID numbers relating to a specific user;
</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In some cases, age range and gender information is collected and passed. EMX does not collect or maintain PII for marketing purposes as PII is defined by the Network Advertising Initiative (NAI).&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><i>Platform Data – Advertiser Solutions</i>: Our Advertiser Solutions collect information on online users passed to us by our supply-side platform partners (SSPs). An SSP generally works with several Publishers. SSPs share certain data about publishers and their available ad spaces with us so that we, on our advertiser client's behalf, are able to evaluate whether to bid on an opportunity to show an ad to a user.</span></p>
EMX uses BidSwitch, a third party, to receive requests to bid from SSPs. When an SSP sends a request to bid to EMX via BidSwitch, the SSP may share certain data with EMX in order to allow EMX to evaluate whether it wants to bid. The following data is often provided by SSPs:
<ul>
 	<li class="p1"><span class="s2">SSP Cookie ID;</span></li>
 	<li class="p1"><span class="s2">publisher name;</span></li>
 	<li class="p1"><span class="s2">EMX Cookie ID;</span></li>
 	<li class="p1"><span class="s2">type of device;</span></li>
 	<li class="p1"><span class="s2">browser’s default language;</span></li>
 	<li class="p1"><span class="s2">geographic location, including country, city, latitude/longitude, zip code, and region;</span></li>
 	<li class="p1"><span class="s2">IP address with final octet removed;</span></li>
 	<li class="p1"><span class="s2">user agent;</span></li>
 	<li class="p1"><span class="s2">browser version;</span></li>
 	<li class="p1"><span class="s2">operating system version;</span></li>
 	<li class="p1"><span class="s2">playback method;</span></li>
 	<li class="p1"><span class="s2">duration of ad;</span></li>
 	<li class="p1"><span class="s2">referrer URL;</span></li>
 	<li class="p1"><span class="s2">cookie age;</span></li>
 	<li class="p1"><span class="s2">player type; and</span></li>
 	<li class="p1"><span class="s2">user segment data.</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">For Publisher Solutions and Advertiser Solutions, the information collected about users through a cookie, UID, or pixel tag is not linked to PII, and does not reveal the "real world" identity of the user. No PII is transferred in the EMX cookie, UID or pixel tag. EMX only knows a user by a pseudonymous ID. This means that while we may know some information about the user’s preferences or characteristics, we don't know who the user is.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We use Platform Data to help clients buy and sell advertising space online, as explained above, and for related uses, such as looking for and measuring possible fraud (where publishers create fake online user activity to generate ad revenue), analytics, or measuring the viewability of advertisements for ad serving and billing purposes. We also collect this data to display different content depending on user input, environmental conditions (such as the time of day), or other variables. We may use Platform Data in connection with work we do to check that ads we deliver are displaying correctly.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><i>For EEA Internet Users, the meaning of "Personal Data" under the General Data Protection Regulation ("GDPR"), and how this impacts on Platform Data</i>: "Personal Data" has been defined in the United States as any data relating to a living individual who can be identified directly from that data, or indirectly in conjunction with other information. It can take the form of a name or address. In the EU under the GDPR, this definition extends to unique identifiers, IP addresses and other identifiers which do not, by themselves, tell us who an Internet user is in the "real world".</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">EMX does not collect "real world" data such as an Internet user's name or email. We take care to ensure that we do not collect anything that tells us or anyone we work with who the internet user is in the real world. The information we have about a user does not identify that user by name, but we can use it to get a picture of the characteristics of that user (for example the kinds of products and services they are interested in, and their age range and gender).</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">When EMX first sees a user, we assign a random unique identifier to that user which allows us to automatically recognize that user when our technology sees the same unique identifier again. We store Platform Data against this ID. In Europe, this type of pseudonymous data is defined as "Personal Data" under the GDPR. We ensure that this data is held to the minimum extent needed and used in ways which comply with EU data protection requirements.

&nbsp;
<div id="privacy-shield-participation"></div>
<h5>Privacy Shield Participation.</h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">EMX participates in and has certified its compliance with the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework and the Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework. We are committed to subjecting all personal data received from European Union (EU) member countries and Switzerland, respectively, in reliance on each Privacy Shield Framework, to the Framework’s applicable Principles. To learn more about the Privacy Shield Frameworks, and to view our certification, visit the U.S. Department of Commerce’s Privacy Shield List at https://www.privacyshield.gov.
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">EMX is responsible for the processing of personal data it receives under each Privacy Shield Framework, and subsequently transfers to a third party acting as an agent on its behalf. EMX complies with the Privacy Shield Principles for all onward transfers of personal data from the EU and Switzerland, including the onward transfer liability provisions.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">With respect to personal data received or transferred pursuant to the Privacy Shield Frameworks, EMX is subject to the regulatory enforcement powers of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission. In certain situations, we may be required to disclose personal data in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Under certain conditions, more fully described on the Privacy Shield website at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.privacyshield.gov/article?id=How-to-Submit-a-Complaint"><span class="s2">https://www.privacyshield.gov/article?id=How-to-Submit-a-Complaint</span></a>, you may be entitled to invoke binding arbitration when other dispute resolution procedures have been exhausted.</span></p>

<div id="privacy-by-design"></div>
<h5>Privacy by Design.</h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> At EMX, we follow a Privacy by Design approach. Privacy considerations are taken into account in the way our systems are set up, and we integrate privacy into our strategy and product development. Our internal procedures protect privacy by proactively keeping PII (information from which individuals can directly be identified) out of our systems, and we maintain infrastructure that is effective without the use of PII.&nbsp; We do this in order to protect consumer privacy and provide relevant advertising. Ensuring the protection of privacy throughout the entire lifecycle of the data is of the utmost importance and EMX is careful to protect user’s privacy as data is collected, used, and destroyed or aggregated responsibly.</span></p>
&nbsp;
<div id="what-is-a-cookie-or-pixel-tag"></div>
<h5>What is a "Cookie" or "Pixel Tag"?</h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> A cookie is an industry-standard, small data file placed on a consumer's computer. Cookies allow marketers to "remember you" when you return to their websites and platforms. A pixel tag is a small piece of code on a webpage which allows servers to place and read cookies.&nbsp; No PII is transferred in an EMX cookie. </span></p>

<h5>Data Retention.</h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> We do not store Platform Data for any longer than we need it.&nbsp; In the case of our Publisher Solutions, we generally do not keep information about users for longer than sixty (60) days.

<h5>Your Choices for Limiting the Use and Disclosure of Your Personal Data</h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">You may decide that you want to opt-out of Interest Based Advertising (“IBA”). You may also wish to use browser settings to modify your preferences. (Please note that while most browsers accept our cookies by default, in certain cases, like Safari, cookies are blocked by default by the browser settings.)</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">EMX is a member of the Network Advertising Initiative (“NAI”) and adheres to its Codes of Conduct. NAI offers an online&nbsp;<a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/"><span class="s2">opt-out</span></a>&nbsp;platform to allow customers to limit use of their data and provides general information related to IBA. If you wish to opt out of interest-based advertising in general,&nbsp;<a href="http://preferences-mgr.truste.com/"><span class="s2">click here</span></a>, or if located in the European Union&nbsp;<a href="http://www.youronlinechoices.eu/"><span class="s2">click here</span></a>. We also use these opt-out cookies to indicate that a California data subject has opted out from EMX’ sale of their data to third-parties. Please note that EMX does not treat opt-out users differently other than the fact that will continue to receive generic ads instead of ads targeted to their interests.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">EMX may place ads on websites that are part of the Google Display Network. Based on your visits to these websites, Google uses an advertising cookie to associate your browser with interest and demographic categories. Google then uses these categories for IBA on these websites. To learn more about this and your choices from Google, please&nbsp;<a href="https://support.google.com/ads/answer/2662922?hl=en"><span class="s2">click here.</span></a></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Some web browsers may also give you the ability to enable a “do not track” setting. This setting sends a special signal to the websites you encounter while web browsing. This “do not track” signal is different from disabling certain forms of tracking by declining cookies in your browser settings, as browsers with the “</span><span class="s2">do not track</span><span class="s1">” setting enabled still have the ability to accept cookies. EMX responds to user initiated web browser “do not track” signals by placing an opt-out cookie. If we do so in the future, we will describe how we do so in this Privacy Policy. For more information about “do not track,” visit&nbsp;<a href="http://www.allaboutdnt.org/"><span class="s3">www.allaboutdnt.org</span></a>.

<h5>Your Choices for Limiting the Use and Disclosure of Your Personal Data on Mobile Devices</h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">For mobile websites, you can delete our cookie via the browser settings. For mobile apps, you can typically limit ad tracking within the settings function. On most Android devices, in the “Ads” menu, you can opt out of receiving IBA, or reset your advertising ID. On most Apple iOS devices, you can use the Ad Tracking settings to limit receipt of IBA or reset your device’s Advertising Identifier. Please note that your experience may be different depending on your individual device and service. In addition to using the options above, you may also uninstall the relevant application from your device.&nbsp; If you download a mobile application, it may use advertising to fund its development and maintenance of its software in iOS and Android.&nbsp; In situations involving applications, if you do not want to receive IBA you may need to remove the applications from your device.</span></p>

<h5>Lawful Basis for Processing Personal Data of European Online Users</h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Data protection law in Europe contains a number of "lawful bases" for processing of data. We have been careful to ensure we have a lawful basis for all of the data we process.&nbsp; Our lawful bases include:</span></p>

<ul>
