It<br>may share information provided to it with other bodies responsible for auditing or administering public funds, in order to prevent and detect fraud.</p><p><br>The Audit Commission appoints the auditor to audit the accounts of this<br>authority. It is also responsible for carrying out data matching exercises.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Data matching involves comparing computer records held by one body<br>against other computer records held by the same or another body. This is<br>usually personal information. Computerised data matching allows potentially<br>fraudulent claims and payments to be identified. Where a match is found it<br>indicates that there is an inconsistency which requires further investigation.<br>No assumption can be made as to whether there is fraud, error or other<br>explanation until an investigation is carried out.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The Audit Commission currently requires us to participate in a data matching<br>exercise to assist in the prevention and detection of fraud. We are required to provide particular sets of data to the Audit Commission for matching for each exercise, and these are set out in the Audit Commission's handbooks, which can be found at <a href="http://ww.audit-commission.gov.uk/nfi">http://ww.audit-commission.gov.uk/nfi</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The use of data by the Audit Commission in a data matching exercise is<br>carried out with statutory authority under its powers in Part 2A of the Audit<br>Commission Act 1998. It does not require the consent of the individuals<br>concerned under the Data Protection Act 1998.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Data matching by the Audit Commission is subject to a Code of Practice. This may be found at <a href="http://ww.audit-commission.gov.uk/nfi/codeofdmp">http://ww.audit-commission.gov.uk/nfi/codeofdmp</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>SMS</strong><br>Please note that the use of SMS is entirely voluntary. If you make use of these services, please take time to read through the guidelines that apply to them.</p><p><br>The transmission of SMS messages via public networks is an unprotected medium, and these messages can potentially be intercepted and tampered with by third parties. This means that third parties are able to not only intercept the contents, but also to amend them and also identify the recipient and sender of the SMS message.</p><p><br>Brent Council is not responsible if a short message (SMS) is unable to reach the recipient on time or is unable to reach the recipient at all. For technical reasons, Brent Council is unable to guarantee the availability of the SMS service. Brent Council does not accept any liability whatsoever for losses resulting from SMS messages being received late or not at all.</p><p><br>All short messages sent from Brent Council to the recipient are not chargeable at the point of sending. Brent Council reserves the rights to make the final decision on charging for sending short messages. Although Brent Council provides SMS services free of charge, users may be charged extra by their mobile phone operator for messages. Brent Council shall not be held liable for such costs.</p><p><br>Brent Council will only hold sufficient personal details for the sending of short messages. The personal details held will only be used for the intended lawful purpose and Brent Council will not disclose this information to any third party unless required to do so by law.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Summary of terms</strong></p><p><strong></strong><br><strong>Browser</strong><br>Used to locate and display Web pages via a software application.
