At Breezy HR we have a few fundamental principles:</p><ol><li>We don’t ask you for personal information unless we truly need it. (We can’t stand services that ask you for things like your gender or income level for no apparent reason.)</li><li>We don’t share your personal information with anyone except to comply with the law, develop our products, or protect our rights.</li><li>We don’t store personal information on our servers unless required for the on-going operation of one of our services.</li></ol><p>Below is our privacy policy which incorporates these goals:</p><p>Breezy HR operates breezy.hr. It is Breezy HR’s policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating our websites and software applications.</p><h4>Website Visitors</h4><p>Like most website operators, Breezy HR collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Breezy HR’s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Breezy HR’s visitors use its website. From time to time, Breezy HR may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.</p><p>Breezy HR also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. Breezy HR does not use such information to identify its visitors, however, and does not disclose such information, other than under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information, as described below.</p><h4>Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</h4><p>Certain visitors to Breezy HR websites choose to interact with Breezy HR in ways that require Breezy HR to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that Breezy HR gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up account at Breezy HR to provide a username and email address. Breezy HR collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitors interaction with Breezy HR. Breezy HR does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.</p><h4>Aggregated Statistics</h4><p>Breezy HR may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites. Breezy HR may display this information publicly or provide it to others. However, Breezy HR does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.</p><h4>Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information</h4><p>Breezy HR discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on Breezy HR’s behalf or to provide services available at Breezy HR’s websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using Breezy HR’s websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. Breezy HR’s will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, Breezy HR’s discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only when required to do so by law, or when Breezy HR believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Breezy HR, third parties or the public at large. If you are a registered user of an Breezy HR website and have supplied your email address, Breezy HR may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with whats going on with Breezy HR and our products. We primarily use our various product blogs to communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. Breezy HR takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.</p><h4>Cookies</h4><p>A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitors computer, and that the visitors browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns.
