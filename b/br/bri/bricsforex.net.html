<p>&nbsp;</p>




<p>This Privacy Policy applies only to the web site owned (however accessed 
and/or used, whether via personal computers, mobile devices, or otherwise) or 
controlled by Brics Forex, Incorporated ("Company," "we," "our" or "us") or 
other interactive features that are accessible or downloadable through the web 
site owned or controlled by Company and that post a link to this Privacy Policy. 
This Privacy Policy only covers information collected at the Web Site, and does 
not cover any information collected at any other web site or offline by Company 
(unless specifically stated). The purpose of this Privacy Policy is to disclose 
to you what information we may collect on the Web Site, how we may collect it, 
with whom we may share it, and certain other matters related to such 
information, including the choices you may have regarding our collection, use, 
and disclosure of such information.</p>
<p>Please read this Privacy Policy carefully. In addition, please review our
<a href="?a=rules">Terms &amp; Conditions Agreement</a>, which govern your use of 
the Web Site.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 id="link1">TYPES OF INFORMATION THAT MAY BE COLLECTED</h3>
<p class="returntop"><a href="https://bhvfund.com/privacy-policy/#toc-title">
</a></p>
<p>The following are the types of information we may collect:</p>
<h5 id="link1.1"><strong><font size="3">Web Site Usage Information &amp; Device 
Identifiers</font></strong></h5>
<p>We may receive and store certain types of web site usage information whenever 
you visit or interact with the Web Site. For example, we may collect the page 
served, the time, the source of the request, the type of browser making the 
request, the preceding page view, other similar information and your IP address. 
We also may collect your IP address or some other unique identifier for the 
particular device you use to access the Internet, as applicable (collectively 
referred to herein as a "Device Identifier"). A Device Identifier is a number 
that is automatically assigned to your computer, your cell phone, or other 
device used to access the Internet, and our computers identify your device by 
its Device Identifier. We may associate your Device Identifier with the personal 
information you provide. When analyzed, web site usage information helps us 
determine how visitors arrive at the Web Site, what type of content is most 
popular, and what type of visitors are interested in particular kinds of content 
and advertising.</p>
<h5 id="link1.2"><strong><font size="3">Information You Provide Us</font></strong></h5>
<p>We may ask you to provide us with two types of information: (1) personal 
information, which is information that could reasonably be used to identify you 
personally, such as your name, e-mail address, cell phone number, and physical 
address; and (2) demographic information, such as gender, zip code, or similar 
information. We may collect this information at various places and forms on the 
Web Site, including registration forms for newsletters and other communications 
(e.g., whether by e-mail, mobile device, etc.), when you communicate or 
otherwise interact with us, when you submit information to us (whether or not 
the information is intended to be posted on the Web Site), contests, surveys, 
voting or when you purchase a product or service through the Web Site. You may 
also be asked to choose a user name and password in order to identify yourself 
during future visits to the Web Site. Do not use your real name or the name of 
any other actual person as your user name. Providing us with information about 
yourself is your choice, and you can always choose not to provide certain 
information, but then you may not be able to take advantage of some of the Web 
Site' features.</p>
<h5 id="link1.3"><strong><font size="3">Information from Other Sources</font></strong></h5>
<p>We may receive information about you from other sources; for example, we may 
obtain geographic or demographic information, or information regarding your 
possible interests, from third parties, or we may receive information from a 
marketing partner in connection with a co-branded web site or promotion.. We may 
combine the information we receive from those other sources with information we 
collect through the Web Site. In those cases, we will apply this Privacy Policy 
to any personal information received, unless otherwise specifically disclosed by 
us at the time you provide your personal information.</p>
<h5 id="link1.4"><strong><font size="3">Send To A Friend</font></strong></h5>
<p>If you send a friend a communication from the Web Site, the information you 
provide (names, e-mail addresses, phone numbers, etc.) is used on a one-time 
basis to facilitate the communication and is not used for any other marketing 
purpose, unless we obtain additional consent.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 id="link3">HOW WE USE THE INFORMATION COLLECTED</h3>
