<p>We at Bright Now Dental, Inc. are dedicated to protecting your personal information and we pledge to keep it confidential and secure, in accordance with your decisions.</p>

<p>We are rapidly developing our service to meet your needs, and therefore Bright Now Dental, Inc. reserves the right to modify this policy without advance notice. Currently this Online Privacy Policy applies to all users of Brightnow.com.</p>

<p><strong>Our Privacy Pledge</strong></p>
<p>Our privacy pledge to you is this: we will not share any private information that personally identifies you ("personal information") with any third party, unless we have your consent.</p>

<p>The only exceptions to this pledge are that we reserve the right to disclose personal information to protect our rights or property, to enforce our Terms of Use Agreement, or as required by operation of law or the request of government regulators or other law enforcement officials and the courts (including the issuance of a valid subpoena). We shall have no duty to notify you of such compliance with the law.</p>

<p><strong>What information do we collect, and how can you access it?</strong></p>

<p>Bright Now Dental, Inc. learns certain information about you from your visit to brightnow.com, and what we do with this information depends on what you do when you are visiting the site. This policy explains the uses we currently make of this information. This policy lets you know what choices, access and security you have with respect to information Bright Now Dental, Inc. collects.</p>

<p>Unless you register and create a profile, send us an e-mail, or use chat rooms and forums or other products and services that are or will be available on Bright Now Dental, Inc.'s web site, we collect and store only the following information about you: the domain from which you accessed the Internet, the date and time you access the site, and the pages you visit most frequently.

Obviously, what we collect depends upon what you enter. You can edit your profile by clicking Account. You can delete your profile by simply deleting all the data fields, which will cause our server to delete the information from its online form. We reserve the right to keep all information in an off-line form, for archival purposes or as otherwise required by law.</p>

<p>If you do not consent to permit us to share your personal information with third parties, we will use that information only to track your visits to our web site, which enables us to learn more about what you, specifically, and our customers, in general, are expecting from our service.</p>

<p>If you do consent to allow us to share your personal information with third parties, we will only use that information according to the consent you give. We may use aggregate data (information about our base of users in general, from which all personally-identifying information has been removed) for any purpose.</p>
