<h1><strong>BCA Privacy Policy:</strong></h1>
<div>
<h3>Data Protection Act 1998</h3>
<p>British Car Auctions Limited (‘BCA’) respects and values the
security and privacy of its customers. BCA follows strict security
procedures in the storage and disclosure of personal information in
order to prevent unauthorised access. Personal Data is held on our
databases either because of services we have provided to you or
because we believe that customers may be interested in receiving
material from us about our business and services. As such we hold
customer contact details and the history of our customer
relationship. This allows us to manage our customer relationships
effectively and target items of interest so that you do not receive
unwanted material through the post.</p>
<p>In accordance with your rights under the Act, you may request
the amendment of the personal information held or to cease
receiving direct marketing materials. Information may, in the
ordinary course of business, move between BCA, its associated
companies and to our contractors, which may involve the transfer of
data outside the European Economic Area.</p>
<h3>Privacy policy</h3>
<p>British Car Auctions Limited is committed to ensuring that your
privacy is protected. This is our Privacy Policy:</p>
<p>When you register with our website or provide your contact
details to a BCA branch, in order to respond to your requirements
we need to know your name, address, e-mail and contact telephone
numbers. From time to time we may provide your information to our
customer service agencies for research and analysis purposes so
that we can monitor and improve the services we provide. We or our
agents and sub-contractors may contact you by post, e-mail or
telephone to ask you for your feedback and comments on our
services. We and our associated companies may also wish to provide
you with information about special features of our website or any
other service or products which we think may be of interest to you.
If you do not wish to receive this information, please tick the
relevant boxes when you complete your online or branch registration
or inform us at <a href="mailto:news@bca-group.com">news@bca-group.com</a></p>
<p>We may also want to provide you with related information from
third parties whose products or services may be of interest to you.
If you do not wish to receive this information, please tick the
relevant boxes when you complete your online or branch registration
or inform us at <a href="mailto:news@bca-group.com">news@bca-group.com</a></p>
<span>By submitting your information you consent to the use of that
information as set out in this Policy. If we change our Privacy
Policy we will post the changes on this page, and may place notices
on other pages of the website, so that you may be aware of the
information we collect and how we use it at all times. We will also
e-mail you should we make any changes so that you may consent to
our use of your information in that way.</span><br>
<br>
<strong>Use of IP Address</strong><br>
An IP address is a number that's automatically assigned to your
computer whenever you're surfing the web. web servers automatically
identify your computer by its IP address. On occasions, we collect
IP addresses for the purposes of system administration, to analyse
aggregate information, and to audit the use of our site.<br>
<br>
<strong>Use of Cookies</strong><br>
What are cookies? Cookies are pieces of information that a web site
transfers to an individual's hard drive for record-keeping
purposes. Cookies make web-surfing easier for you by saving your
preferences while you're at our site. The use of cookies is an
industry standard you will find them at most major web sites.<br>
<br>
By showing how and when visitors use our site, cookies help us see
which areas are popular and which are not. Many improvements and
updates to the site are based on such data as total number of
visitors and pages viewed and this information is most easily
tracked with cookies. We use cookies to better understand and
improve areas of the BCA web site that our users find valuable.
While both of these activities depend on the use of a "cookie,"
visitors to the BCA web site always have the option of disabling
cookies via their browser preferences.<br>
<br>
Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies. You can reset
your browser to refuse all cookies or indicate when a cookie is
being sent. However, note that some parts of the BCA web site may
not function properly or may be considerably slower if you refuse
cookies.<br>
<br>
<strong>Use of clear GIFs</strong><br>
A clear GIF (Graphics Interchange Format) or pixel tag (also known
as a 'Web beacon') is a line of code placed on some of our web
pages and/or in e-mails which, in a similar way to our use of
cookies above, allow us to analyse the specific usage patterns of
visitors.<br>
<br>
<strong>Supplementary Information</strong><br>
We may acquire information about individuals from other sources and
add such information to our house files.<br>
<br>
<strong>Links to Other Sites/ "Public" Areas</strong><br>
You should be aware that when you are on the BCA web site, you
could be directed to other sites that are beyond our control. There
are links to other sites from BCA web site pages that take you
outside our service. These other sites may send their own cookies
to users, collect data or solicit personal information. The privacy
policies of these other sites may significantly differ from that of
BCA. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of any other
sites and cannot guarantee the security of any of your personal
information collected there.<br>
<br>
<strong>Security</strong><br>
Protecting the security of all personally-identifiable information
associated with our guests is of the utmost concern to us. Once we
receive your transmission, we will take reasonable precautions to
ensure its security on our systems. Unfortunately, no data
transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.
As a result, while we take all reasonable steps to ensure the
security of our users' personal information and maintain their
privacy, we cannot guarantee or warrant the security of any
information you disclose or transmit to us online and cannot be
responsible for the theft, destruction, or inadvertent disclosure
of such personal information.<br>
<br>
