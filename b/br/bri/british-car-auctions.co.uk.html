<h1><strong>BCA Privacy Policy:</strong></h1>
<div><br>
BCA's privacy policy is to respect and protect the privacy of
visitors to the BCA web site and subscribers to any email updates
from the web site. This policy statement tells you how we collect
information from you and how we use it. It will assist you in
making informed decisions when using our site and our
services.<br>
<br>
<strong>The data we collect</strong><br>
We do request personal information such as your name, email
address, company details, etc which you can choose to provide when
you complete and submit a web form on the BCA web site. We collect
this information to help us more accurately respond to your
enquiry. You are under no obligation to provide any personal data
if you don't want to.<span>&nbsp;</span> Information collected from
the registration form on the BCA Digital Sales Guide is used to
keep you informed on BCA sales and/or products and services, on
which you have requested information.<br>
<br>
We also use personal information for purposes of administering and
expanding our business activities, providing customer service and
making available other products and services to our customers and
prospective customers. Occasionally, we may also use the
information we collect to notify you about important changes to our
web site, new services and other information we think you will find
valuable. If you choose to opt out of receiving any such
communications from us, please email us at <a href="mailto:news@bca-group.com">news@bca-group.com</a> with
"Unsubscribe" in the subject line.</div>
<div><br>
In the future BCA may decide to also collect aggregate information
from all web site visitors. This aggregate data would only be used
to customize BCA web content to deliver a better experience for our
users and will in no way personally identify you.<br>
<br>
<strong>Use of IP Address</strong><br>
An IP address is a number that's automatically assigned to your
computer whenever you're surfing the web. web servers automatically
identify your computer by its IP address. On occasions, we collect
IP addresses for the purposes of system administration, to analyse
aggregate information, and to audit the use of our site.<br>
<br>
<strong>Use of Cookies</strong><br>
What are cookies? Cookies are pieces of information that a web site
transfers to an individual's hard drive for record-keeping
purposes. Cookies make web-surfing easier for you by saving your
preferences while you're at our site. The use of cookies is an
industry standard you will find them at most major web sites.<br>
<br>
By showing how and when visitors use our site, cookies help us see
which areas are popular and which are not. Many improvements and
updates to the site are based on such data as total number of
visitors and pages viewed and this information is most easily
tracked with cookies. We use cookies to better understand and
improve areas of the BCA web site that our users find valuable.
While both of these activities depend on the use of a "cookie,"
visitors to the BCA web site always have the option of disabling
cookies via their browser preferences.<br>
<br>
Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies. You can reset
your browser to refuse all cookies or indicate when a cookie is
being sent. However, note that some parts of the BCA web site may
not function properly or may be considerably slower if you refuse
cookies.<br>
<br>
<strong>Use of clear GIFs</strong><br>
A clear GIF (Graphics Interchange Format) or pixel tag (also known
as a 'Web beacon') is a line of code placed on some of our web
pages and/or in e-mails which, in a similar way to our use of
cookies above, allow us to analyse the specific usage patterns of
visitors.<br>
<br>
<strong>Supplementary Information</strong><br>
We may acquire information about individuals from other sources and
add such information to our house files.<br>
<br>
<strong>Disclosure</strong><br>
We will not publish, give, sell or rent your information to anyone,
ever. However, we reserve the right to disclose user information in
special cases when we have reason to believe that disclosing this
information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action
against someone who may be causing injury to or interference with
(either intentionally or unintentionally) BCA's rights or property,
other users, or anyone else who could be harmed by such activities.
We also reserve the right to disclose user information when we
believe in good faith that the law requires it.<br>
<br>

You should be aware that when you are on the BCA web site, you
could be directed to other sites that are beyond our control. There
are links to other sites from BCA web site pages that take you
outside our service. These other sites may send their own cookies
to users, collect data or solicit personal information. The privacy
policies of these other sites may significantly differ from that of
BCA. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of any other
sites and cannot guarantee the security of any of your personal
information collected there.<br>
<br>

Protecting the security of all personally-identifiable information
associated with our guests is of the utmost concern to us. Once we
receive your transmission, we will take reasonable precautions to
ensure its security on our systems. Unfortunately, no data
transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.

security of our users' personal information and maintain their
privacy, we cannot guarantee or warrant the security of any
information you disclose or transmit to us online and cannot be
responsible for the theft, destruction, or inadvertent disclosure
of such personal information.<br>
