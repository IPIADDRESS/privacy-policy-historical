  <p><font>BrightNest, Inc.
  (“BrightNest,” “we,” “our” or “us”) is committed to
  respecting the privacy and security of your personal information. The
  following U.S. online privacy policy (“Privacy Policy”) describes
  the information we collect and how we use it. By using this website,
  you consent to our Privacy Policy.</font></p>
  <p><font>We may
  periodically update this Privacy Policy to reflect material changes
  in how we collect, use, share or store your personal information.  We
  encourage you to refer to this Privacy Policy on an ongoing basis so

  </p>
  <p><font><b>COLLECTING
  INFORMATION</b></font></p>
  <p><font>Like many

  <p><font>You may also
  provide information about your home by inputting such information in
  our “homefolio” feature that allows us to customize our To-Do's
  and your user experience.  You can enter (and we store) information
  about paint color, types of appliances, and other home related info.</font></p>
  <p><br><br>

  <p><font>We may extend
  any of our rights under this Privacy Policy to third parties
  performing services on our behalf.</font></p>
  <p><font><b>SHARING
  INFORMATION</b></font></p>
  <p><font>We may enable

  the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.</font></p>
