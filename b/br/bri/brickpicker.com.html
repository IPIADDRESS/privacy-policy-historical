                                        <p>
                                            BrickPicker Inc. gathers and tracks information/data that users provide through registration on our Sites for some services. In addition to this gathering of information by the registration of users, BrickPicker Inc. also gathers information through tracking systems, depending on the service being used by you. The tracking systems include deriving data by tallying page views throughout our Sites and capturing information on the type of browser being used to view the Site, tracking what pages you have visited while on the Site and in market research studies tracking what computers respond to a survey. This information enables us to better provide content and to respond to our users' needs. Taken together, these aggregate site usage data also  helps our advertisers and sponsors better understand the demographics of our audience. As BrickPicker Inc. derives its revenue mainly from advertising on our Sites, it is necessary for us to provide such demographic data to our sponsors and advertisers; this allows us to keep our services free to users 
                                        </p>
