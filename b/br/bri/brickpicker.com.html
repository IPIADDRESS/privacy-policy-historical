                        <p>We use third-party service providers to manage
                        credit card and payment processing. These service
                        providers are not permitted to store, retain, or use
                        billing Information except for the sole purpose of
                        credit card and payment processing on our behalf. When
                        you enter payment information we encrypt the
                        transmission of that information using SSL technology
                        and do not store it on our systems.</p>

                        <p>It is important to remember, however, that no system
                        can guarantee 100% security at all times. Accordingly,
                        we cannot guarantee the security of information stored
                        on or transmitted to or from our services. We cannot
                        assume responsibility or liability for unauthorized
                        access to our servers and systems. When disclosing any
                        personal or protected health information, you should
                        remain mindful of the fact that it is potentially
                        accessible to the public and,consequently, can be
                        collected and used by others without your consent.
                        Accordingly, you should consider carefully if you want
                        to submit sensitive information that you would not want
                        disclosed to the public and should recognize that your
                        use of the Internet and our sites and services is
                        solely at your risk. You are ultimately responsible for
                        maintaining the secrecy for all your personal
                        information, including your protected health
                        information. Except as provided in aBusiness Associate
                        Agreement between us and a healthcare provider, we have
                        no responsibility or liability to anyone for the

                        <h4>Steps You Can Take</h4>

                        <ul class="DescriptionList">
                            <li>Install malware detection programs that
                            regularly scan your system and incoming traffic for
                            malicious code such as computer viruses, worms,
                            Trojan Horses and spyware. Because viruses and
                            malware are continuously created and modified,
                            regular malware protection software typically
                            requires frequent updates.</li>

                            <li>Use a firewall to prevent unauthorized access
                            to your device.</li>

                            <li>Because malware often targets vulnerabilities
                            in existing operating systems, browsers, plug-ins
                            and other programs, software vendors frequently
                            update their products with security patches to
                            guard against known or commonly exploited
                            vulnerabilities. Vendors often try to alert their
                            users and recommend immediate installation of these
                            security patches.</li>

                            <li>Use a strong password using a combination of
                            letters and numbers that are not easily guessed. Do
                            not share your password with others.</li>

                            <li>If you use a shared device, always close all
                            active programs and log out before leaving it
                            unattended.</li>

                            <li>Avoid using a public wireless network, if
                            possible. If you do use a public network, use the
                            most restrictive wireless network settings on your
                            device.</li>

                            <li>If you use file-sharing programs, be sure to
                            restrict all other folders or directories to "no
                            share".</li>

                            <li>Be very cautious with any email requesting you
                            to share personal information. On websites, look
                            for the lock symbol on or near your browser's
                            address bar which signifies a secure website before
                            supplying personal information.</li>

                            <li>When participating in one of our communities,
                            blogs, forums, surveys or other open communication
                            platforms, exercise care in selecting what
                            information you share, particularly personal or
                            health information.</li>

                        Information</h4>

                        <p>When you use certain services (for example,

                        the terms of a Business Associate Agreement between us
                        and that healthcare provider. This means that we may

                        <h3>California Privacy Rights</h3>

                        <p>We do not share personal information with third
                        parties for their direct marketing purposes unless you
                        affirmatively agree to such disclosure, typically by
                        "opting in" to receive information from a third party
                        that is participating in a sweepstakes or other
                        promotion on one of our sites, for example. If you ask
                        us to share your personal information with a third
                        party for its marketing purposes, we will only share
                        information in connection with that specific promotion
                        since we do not share information with any third party
                        (other than our service providers) on an ongoing basis.
                        To prevent disclosure of your personal information for
                        use in direct marketing by a third party, do not "opt
                        in" to such use when you provide personal information
                        on one of our sites.</p>

                        <p>Users residing in certain jurisdictions, like
                        California, have a right to access personal information
                        held by us about them and their right of access can be
                        exercised in accordance with applicable law. California
                        law requires certain businesses to respond to requests
                        from California residents asking about the business's
                        practices related to disclosing personal information to
                        third parties for the third parties' direct marketing
                        purposes. Alternately, such businesses may have in
                        place a policy not to disclose personal information of
                        customers to third parties for the third parties'
                        direct marketing purposes if the resident has exercised
                        an option to opt-out of such information-sharing. We
                        have such a policy in place.</p>

                        <p>California residents may request further information
                        about our approach to this law by writing to us. When
                        writing to us, you must put the statement "Your
                        California Privacy Rights" in the body or subject line
