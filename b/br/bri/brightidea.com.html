  Brightidea.com has created this privacy statement ("Statement") in
  order to demonstrate our commitment to customer privacy. Privacy on the Brightidea.com
  web site (the "Site") is of great importance to us. Because we
  gather important information from our visitors and customers, we have
  established this Statement as a means to communicate our information
  gathering and dissemination practices. <br>
  <br>
  </span><b><span style="font-size:6.5pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt;font-family:
  Verdana;color:#666666">Collected Information:</span></b><span style="font-size:6.5pt;font-family:Verdana;color:#666666"><br>
  We require customers who register to use the services offered on our Site
  (collectively, the "Service") to give us contact information, such
  as their name, company name, address, phone number, and e-mail address, and
  financial qualification and billing information, such as billing name and
  address, credit card number, and the number of users within the organization
  that will be using the Service. At the time you express interest in attaining
  additional information, or when you register for the Service, we may also ask
  for additional personal information, such as title, department name, fax
  number, or additional company information, such as annual revenues, number of
  employees, or industry. Customers can opt out of providing this additional
  information by not entering it when asked. Customers can update or remove
  their personal information at any time by logging into the Website and
  editing their Personal Information within Profile. Customers can view their
  updated profile to confirm their edits have been made.<br>
  <br>
  Brightidea.com uses the information that we collect to set up the Service for
  individuals and their organizations. We may also use the information to
  contact customers to further discuss customer interest in our company, the
  Service that we provide.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Customer
  email addresses and any personal customer information will not be distributed
  or shared with third parties. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>Separately,

  Service, in order to receive a username and password. We may also email
  information regarding updates to the Service or company, and will send a
  Customer Newsletter. Again, email will not be distributed or shared.<br>
  <br>
  Except as we explicitly state at the time we request information, or as
  provided for in the Brightidea.com Subscription Agreement, we do not disclose
  to third parties the information provided. All financial and billing
  information that we collect through the Site is used solely to check the
  qualifications of prospective customers and to bill for the Service. This
  billing information is not used by Brightidea.com for marketing or
  promotional purposes. Brightidea.com uses a third-party intermediary to
  manage the credit card processing. This intermediary is solely a link in the
  distribution chain, and is not permitted to store, retain, or use the
  information provided, except for the sole purpose of credit card processing.
  Other third parties, such as content providers, may provide content on the
  web Site but they are not permitted to collect any information nor does Brightidea.com
  share user information with these parties.<br>
  <br>
  Customers of the Service will be using the Site to host data and information
  ("Data"). Brightidea.com will not review, share, distribute, print,

  Brightidea.com may also collect certain information from visitors to and
  customers of the Site, such as Internet addresses. This information is logged
  to help diagnose technical problems, and to administer our Site in order to
