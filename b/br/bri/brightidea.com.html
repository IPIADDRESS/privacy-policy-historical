		<h2>Web Site Data Collection Overview</h2>
		<p>Our server software
		gathers in log files, general demographic information from all users of our Web
		site and for users of our hosted application service and related support
		services. For each visitor to the Brightidea Web site, our Web server
		automatically recognizes the visitor's domain name, browser type, operating
		system, referring domains, entry page, exit page, and average time on the Web
		site. This information is used for internal purposes only, to help us improve
		our Web site and better understand our visitors' needs.</p>
		<p>We may use the services
		of marketing companies to help us collect and/or log Internet Protocol
		addresses, Internet domain names, the web browser and operating system used to
		access the Brightidea Web site, the files visited, the time spent in each file,
		and the time and date of each visit. We use Web beacons and cookies. Cookies
		are identifiers that can be sent from a Web site via your browser to be placed
		on your computer's hard drive. Thereafter when you visit a Web site, a message
		is sent back to the Web server by the browser accessing the Web site. You may
		elect not to accept cookies by changing the designated settings on your Web
		browser. However, not utilizing cookies may prevent you from using certain
		functions and features of our Web site. The information collected from the use
		of cookies is used and analyzed to improve our Web site. We use cookies to
		personalize the experience of our visitors, provide support to customers,
		record visitor preferences, provide personalized and specialized content,
		record session information, track visitor clickstream behavior throughout the
		Web site, and customize site content based on your browser type, operating
		system, and preferences. By gathering such information to supplement our
		records, we learn things like what pages are most attractive to our visitors,
		which of our products most interest our customers, and what kinds of offers our
		customers like to see. Although we or our marketing companies log the
		information coming from our site on our behalf, we control how that data may
		and may not be used. If you do not want to help us learn how to improve our
		site, products, offers and marketing strategy, you can opt-out of this Web site
		analysis tool by disabling your cookies. If you disable your cookies, you may
		still use our Web site; however, you may not be able to access certain areas
		within it.</p>
		
		<p>If you choose to receive
		company or product information, you will need to complete our online request
		forms. The online forms provide site visitors with an opportunity to request
		free product downloads and demos, view Brightidea white papers, register for
		free Brightidea online seminars as they may be offered, and enroll for various
		services. These forms require your name, company name, e-mail address, company
		address, phone number as well as other information to help us determine and respond
		to your needs related to the products and/or services requested. All
		information provided by the visitor is voluntary. We use this information to
		send updates about our company and our products and to contact you if requested
		or necessary. We also use the demographic information you provide on these
		forms in connection with studies and reports regarding our Web site, such as
		Web site usage patterns, in order to better understand the needs of visitors to
		our Web site. We will not, however, associate any personally identifiable
		information which you provide with the information in these studies and
		reports.</p>
		
		<p>We may occasionally run
		contests or other special promotions on our Web site in which we ask persons
		who choose to participate for contact information (like an e-mail address) or
		demographic information (like a zip code, industry or country). We may use the
		data we collect from you in these contests and promotions to send you
		promotional material about our company or our partners. Your contact information
		collected from these contests and promotions may be used to administer the
		contest and notify winners and contact you when necessary.</p>
		
		<h2>E-mail Addresses</h2>
		
		<p>We do not collect e-mail
		addresses without the site visitor voluntarily providing us with this information
		(typically via our online information request form, whitepaper request form,
		and other Web site forms and surveys). We will periodically use your e-mail
		information for service, sales, support, and marketing purposes. From time to
		time, we may share your e-mail address with our partner organizations and
		companies for service, sales, support, and marketing purposes. If you do not
		wish to receive marketing e-mail from us or our partners in the future, you may
		opt out as described below.</p>
		
		<h2>Customer Data</h2>
		
		<p>Customers or end users
		may use our hosted services to host certain data about their personnel. We do
		not use or disclose such data except as provided in our subscription agreements
		with our customers, or as may be required by law. Customers are responsible for
		maintaining the security of their user logins.</p>
		
		<h2>Data Security</h2>
		
		<p>We use a variety of
		security measures and employ appropriate physical, administrative and technical
		safeguards to protect against the loss or unauthorized use, alteration or
		disclosure of, or unauthorized access to, the personal information under our
		control. We have licensed the industry-standard Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)
		technology, which permits encryption of potentially sensitive information such
		as your name and address. This will make your information unusable in the event
		of unauthorized third-party interception. We store this information in a secure
		environment at one or more of our service providers. </p>
		
		<p>Brightidea personnel with
		access to this information have been trained and advised of the importance of
		maintaining the security and confidentiality of such information and of using
		it only for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy.</p>
		
		<p>Other than as expressly
		described in this Privacy Policy, we will not share personally identifiable
		information with anyone outside of Brightidea without your prior permission
		unless we believe in good faith that such release is reasonably necessary to
		(i) comply with applicable law, (ii) enforce the terms of any of our user agreements,
		or (iii) protect the rights, property or safety of Brightidea, our visitors, or
		others.</p>

		<a href="mailto:support@Brightidea.com">support@Brightidea.com</a>, Brightidea
		will provide Web site visitors at no cost with access to their personal
		information that we have on record and the ability to complete, update or

		third-party Web sites for your convenience and information. If you access those
		links, you will leave the Brightidea Web site. Brightidea does not control

		We do not endorse or make any representations about third party Web sites. The
		personal data you choose to give to unrelated third parties is not covered by
		this Privacy Policy.</p>
		
		<p>In the event your
		personal information is acquired, or is reasonably believed to have been
		acquired, by an unauthorized person, and applicable law requires notification
		to you by Brightidea, Brightidea will notify you of such breach promptly by
		email, fax, or U.S. mail, as permitted by law and consistent with the
		reasonable investigatory needs of law enforcement and/or Brightidea.</p>

		<p>Brightidea may amend this
		Privacy Policy from time to time. If Brightidea decides to make material
		changes in the way we use your personal information, we will post the changes
		on this page so that you always will know what information we collect, how it
		is used, and when and how it will be disclosed. Your use of the Brightidea Web
		site following notice of such change will be deemed acceptance of the revised
		Privacy Policy, which may include application of the new policy to information
		provided prior to the date of such change.</p>

		or similar e-mail messages from us and wish to opt out of receiving such
		messages, you may simply follow the opt-out procedure specified in such e-mail.
