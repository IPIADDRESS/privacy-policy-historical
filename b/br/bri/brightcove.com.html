(“<b>Brightcove</b>”) wants you to be familiar with how we collect, use and disclose Personal Information and Non-Personal Information (each as defined below). This Privacy Policy describes our practices in connection with information that we collect through our website located at<a target="_blank" href="http://www.brightcove.com/"><b> www.brightcove.com</b></a>, other Brightcove websites where this Privacy Policy is provided and through Brightcove’s online video platform known as the “Brightcove Service” (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.brightcove.com/">www.brightcove.com</a>, Brightcove’s other websites and the Brightcove Service are referred to in this Privacy Policy collectively as the “<b>Site</b>“). This Privacy Policy does not address the collection, use or disclosure of information by any third parties.</p><p>By using the Site, you agree to the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy, please do not use the Site. We reserve the right to change this Privacy Policy without prior notice. You can find out when this Privacy Policy was last revised by referring to the “<i>Last Updated</i>” legend at the top of this page. Any changes to our Privacy Policy will become effective upon our posting of the revised Privacy Policy on the Site. Use of the Site following such changes constitutes your acceptance of the revised Privacy Policy then in effect.</p><ol><li><h4>What Types of Information Do We Collect from You?</h4><p><b>Personal Information</b> is information that identifies an individual. In order for you to take advantage of particular opportunities provided through the Site (for example, to receive white papers, participate in certain forums on the Site or sign-up for the Brightcove Service), we may require that you furnish Personal Information. We collect Personal Information from you, such as your name, postal address, telephone number and email address, only when you voluntarily provide it to us. We may also combine Personal Information you provide to us with publicly available information, such as your organization’s name, in the event you provide us with an email address from your organization.</p><p><b>Non-Personal Information</b> is aggregated information, demographic information and any other information that does not reveal an individual’s specific identity.</p><ul><li><b>Environmental Variables.</b> We may collect certain environmental variables, such as your MAC address, computer type, screen resolution, OS version and browser type and version. These environmental variables are collected by most websites and can be used to optimize your experience on the Site.</li><li><b>Cookies.</b> We and service providers acting on our behalf may set and access cookies on your computer. A cookie is a small text file containing a unique identification number that is transferred from a website to the hard drive of your computer so that the website administrator may identify your computer and passively track its activities on the website. This unique number identifies your web browser to our computer system. Cookies allow us to automatically remember your web browser when you use the Site. The use of cookies is an industry standard, and they are currently used on most major websites. It is possible to adjust your web browser preferences to alert you when a cookie is sent to your hard drive, or to refuse cookies altogether. While we do not require you to use cookies, certain parts of the Site will not function properly if you set your browser to refuse all cookies. To learn more about cookies, please visit<a target="_blank" href="http://www.allaboutcookies.org/"> http://www.allaboutcookies.org/</a>.</li><li><b>Web Beacons</b>. Web beacons, also known as clear GIFs or single-pixel GIFs, are small image files that we, or service providers acting on our behalf, may place in our Web pages, in our advertisements and in our emails. Working in conjunction with cookies, web beacons allow us to accurately count the number of unique users who have visited a specific Site page or section, clicked on one of our advertisements, or opened or acted upon an email. They also tell us the number of times advertisements or pages are displayed. This allows us to measure the performance of our Site, our advertising and our email campaigns.</li><li><b>Information That You Provide.</b> We may also collect Non-Personal Information, such as your interests, geographic location and website address, when you provide it to us. Unless combined with Personal Information, this information does not personally identify you. In addition, we may aggregate Personal Information in a manner such that the end product does not identify you or any other Site user. Such aggregate information is considered Non-Personal Information for purposes of this Privacy Policy.</li></ul><p><b>IP Addresses.</b> Your Internet Protocol (IP) address is a number that is automatically assigned to the computer you are using by your Internet Service Provider (ISP), and in many cases, IP addresses are shared by multiple people. This number is identified and logged automatically in our server log files whenever you visit the Site, along with the time(s) of your visit(s) and the page(s) you visited. Collecting IP addresses is standard practice on the Internet and is done automatically by many websites.</p></li><li><h4>How Does Brightcove Use Information Collected From Me?</h4><p><b>Personal Information.</b> We may use Personal Information:</p><ul><li>to fulfill your requests, such as to create a Brightcove Service account, send a requested white paper, send online video updates or complete your purchases;</li><li>to operate the Brightcove Service, to send you important information regarding the Site and issues specifically affecting the Brightcove Service and your use of the Brightcove Service, including changes to Site terms, conditions and policies. Because this information may be important, you may not opt out of receiving it;</li><li>to inform you of products, programs, services and promotions from us and/or our marketing partners that we believe may be of interest to you;</li><li>to permit you to share videos uploaded to the Brightcove Service via the “email to a friend” link displayed in certain Brightcove players. If you wish to use this feature, you may be required to provide us, and we may use, your email address and your friend’s email address to facilitate sending the message. By using this functionality, you affirm that you are entitled to use and provide us with the recipient’s name and email address for this purpose. We store your email address and your friend’s email address in our system for a limited time, after which it is deleted from our system. We do not use Personal Information obtained through the “email to a friend” feature for any other purpose other than to enable the email to be sent, unless we disclose such other purpose to you at the time you provide us with the email address;</li><li>to permit you to participate in sweepstakes, contests and similar promotions (collectively, “<b>Promotions</b>”). You should carefully review the rules, if any, of each Promotion in which you participate, as they may contain additional important information about our use of your Personal Information. To the extent that the terms and conditions of such rules concerning the treatment of your Personal Information conflict with this Privacy Policy, the terms and conditions of such other rules shall control; and</li><li>for our internal business purposes, such as data analysis, audits, developing new products, enhancing our Site, improving our services, identifying usage trends and determining the effectiveness of our promotional campaigns.</li></ul><p><b>Non-Personal Information.</b> Because Non-Personal Information does not personally identify you, we may use such information for any purpose, at our sole discretion, unless otherwise noted in this Privacy Policy. In addition, we reserve the right to share Non-Personal Information with affiliates and other third parties, for any purpose. In some instances, we may combine Non-Personal Information with Personal Information (such as combining your name with your geographical location). If we do combine any Non-Personal Information with Personal Information, we will treat the combined information as Personal Information as long as it is combined.</p><ul><li><b>Delivery of Online Advertising.</b> We may use third party ad serving technology to help us deliver ads on the Site or to educate users on ad serving technology. This technology may use information (not including your name, address, email address or telephone number) about your visit to the Site in order to identify and display advertisements that may be of interest to you. In the course of serving these advertisements, a unique cookie may be placed and/or recognized on your browser. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your options about not having this information used to serve ads to you, please<a target="_blank" href="http://www.doubleclick.com/us/about_doubleclick/privacy/"> click here</a>.</li><li><b>Third Party Advertisements.</b> Third parties may display advertisements on the Site or offer you products and services in connection with the Site. Any such party’s use of cookies and other technologies is subject to such party’s own privacy policy. Third parties that are not our service providers do not have access to our cookies.</li></ul><p><b>IP Addresses.</b> We use IP addresses for purposes such as calculating Site usage levels, helping diagnose server problems and administering the Site. We may also use and disclose IP Addresses for all the purposes for which we use and disclose Personal Information. Please note that we treat IP Addresses, server log files and related information as Non-Personal Information, except where we are required to do otherwise under applicable law.</p></li><li><h4>How Does Brightcove Disclose Personal Information?</h4><p>We may disclose Personal Information:</p><ul><li>to our affiliates, Brightcove K.K., Brightcove UK Ltd., Brightcove Holdings Inc., Bright Bay Company Ltd. and any future corporate subsidiaries or affiliates, so that they may use such Personal Information for the purposes described in this policy.
