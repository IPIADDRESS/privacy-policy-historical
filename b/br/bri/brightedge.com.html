			<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

			<div class="text">
			
<br>This Privacy Policy (the "Policy") applies to data collected by BrightEdge from visitors (including customers) to the BrightEdge web site (the "Site") located at www.brightedge.com, as well as to offline activities.

<br><br>By using the Site you consent to the privacy practices described in this Policy.

<br><br>BrightEdge reserves the right to change this Policy at any time. If we make any changes to our Policy, we will post a new policy on our Site and update the "last revised" date set forth below.
