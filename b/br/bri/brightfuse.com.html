    <div class="privacy-wrap">
        <h2>
            Protect Your Privacy And Safety</h2>
        <p>
            These days, we all need to be smart about the way we use our own personal data.
            So that you can be smarter about the way you manage your professional networking
            resources, BrightFuse continues to strive to provide the safest possible environment
            for you to do so.</p>
        <h2>
            Overview</h2>
        <p>
            We have created this Privacy Policy to demonstrate our commitment to protecting
            information you submit. This Privacy Policy only applies to data gathered on the
            BrightFuse web site (the "Site"), and does not apply to any other information or
            web site. Please review this Privacy Policy periodically as we may update it from
            time to time. This Privacy Policy is effective as of March 1, 2008. Each time you
            visit the Site or provide us with information, you are, by doing so, accepting the
            practices described in this Privacy Policy at that time. You agree that by using
            the Site you are expressly and affirmatively consenting to our use and disclosure
            of the information that you provide, and consenting to receive emails, as described
            below in this Privacy Policy.</p>
        <h2>
            Personal Information</h2>
        <p>
            In order to operate the Site in an efficient and effective manner and provide users
            with relevant networking opportunities, BrightFuse may collect personal information,
            including contact information (such as an email address), from its users. In addition,
            this information allows us to provide users with private and secure areas to post
            and modify their original content on our site (e.g., resumes, interests and professional
            experience). We also automatically track certain information based upon your behavior
            on the Site and use this information to do internal research on our users' demographics,
            interests, and behavior to better understand, protect and serve users in general.
            This information may include the URL that a user has just come from (whether this
            URL is on our Site or not), the URL a user goes to next (whether this URL is on
            our Site or not), a user's computer browser information, and their IP address.</p>
        <p>
            You agree that BrightFuse may use your personal information to contact you and deliver
            information to you that, in some cases, is targeted to your interests, or provides
            administrative notices or communications applicable to your use of the Site. By
            accepting this Privacy Policy, you expressly agree to receive this information.
            If you do not wish to receive these communications, we encourage you to opt out
            of any further receipt by following the opt out provisions provided in each such
            communication.</p>
        <p>
            We do not sell our users' personal information to anyone for any reason if the user
            has indicated a desire for us to keep the information private. When posting profile
            information, our users decide for themselves how much contact information they wish
            to display (we enable private communication for those who choose to hide this information).</p>
        <p>
            All users should be aware, however, that when they voluntarily display or distribute
            personal information (such as their email address or resume), that information can
            be collected and used by others. This may result in unsolicited messages from third
            parties for which BrightFuse is not responsible. BrightFuse may also disclose
            specific user information when we determine that such disclosure is necessary to
            comply with the law, to cooperate with or seek assistance from law enforcement or
            to protect the interests or safety of BrightFuse or other users of the Site. In
            addition, personal information we have collected may be passed on to a third party
            in the event of a transfer of ownership or assets or a bankruptcy of BrightFuse</p>

            About Cookies</h2>
        <p>
            At BrightFuse, we use cookies only for the protection and convenience of our users.
            Cookies enable us to serve secure pages to our users without asking them to sign
            in repeatedly. If a user's system is idle for more than an hour, however, the cookie
            will expire, forcing the user to sign in again to continue their session. This prevents
            unauthorized access to the user's information while they are away from their computer.
            You may have the ability to reset your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate
            when a cookie is being sent; however, some BrightFuse features or services may not
            function properly without cookies.</p>
        <p>
            Third-Party Cookies: We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when
            you visit the Site. These companies may use information (not including your name,
            address, email address or telephone number) about your visits to this and other
            web sites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest
            to you. </p>

        <p>
            We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our Web site.
            These companies may use information about you and your visits to this and other

            goods and services of interest to you.</p>

            What You Should Know</h2>
        <p>
            BrightFuse cannot ensure that all of your private communications and other personal
            information will never be disclosed in ways not otherwise described in this Privacy
            Policy. Therefore, although we are committed to protecting your privacy, we do not
            promise, and you should not expect, that your personal information or private communications
            will always remain private. As a user of the Site, you understand and agree that
            you assume all responsibility and risk for your use of the Site, the internet generally,
            and the documents you post or access and for your conduct on and off the Site.</p>
        <h2>
            Some Important Tips To Use When Dealing With Prospective Contacts</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Never give out your social security number to other users.</li>
            <li>Never provide credit card or bank numbers or monetary transaction of any sort.</li>
            <li>Be cautious when dealing with contacts outside of your own country.</li>
            <li>Do not provide any non-work related personal information (i.e. social security number,
                eye color, marital status etc.) over the phone or online.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>
            Other Privacy Features On BrightFuse</h2>
        <p>
            Logging into BrightFuse is always an optional task for you to take, (although logging
            is required if you would like to contact other users or edit your profile).</p>
        <h2>
            Post A Profile</h2>
        <p>
            Posting your profile on BrightFuse puts you in contact with thousands of other users.
            When you post your profile, we automatically create a registration for you using
            the email address and password that you supply. When you return to the site in the
            future you will use that same email address and password to access and edit your
            existing profile.</p>
        <h2>
            Profile Privacy Options</h2>
        <p>
            We know that our users have varying levels of comfort when it comes to posting
            information on the Internet. To accommodate the needs of all users, BrightFuse has
            two levels of privacy from which you can choose.</p>





        <h2>
            Public Profile</h2>
        <p>
            This option gives you the most visibility to other users possible. Your profile may be
            found by searching our database. It may also be found using any publicly available internet
            search engine. Anyone may view your profile information.</p>

        <h2>
            Friends-Only Profile</h2>
        <p>
            Your profile may be found by searching our database. However, the 
            information in your profile may only be seen by those BrightFuse users you have 
            approved as a contact. BrightFuse users that are not your contacts will see very
            limited information about you, e.g. your name, location, and in some cases your job title.
            </p>        
        <h2>
            Your General Contact Information</h2>
        <p>
            Managing your privacy is as simple as selecting which pieces of your contact information
            are displayed. This is done in the section of the profile form called "Edit Basic
            Information."
        </p>
        <h2>
            Help Us Monitor Fraud</h2>
        <p>
            Please be advised that BrightFuse will never initiate a request for your personal
            information via email or pop-up window. If you ever receive a request for this type
            of sensitive information, please do not respond and immediately contact BrightFuse
            customer service at <a href="mailto:contactus@brightfuse.com">contactus@brightfuse.com</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you think you have been a victim of fraud, immediately report the committed fraud
            to your local police and contact us at <a href="mailto:contactus@brightfuse.com">contactus@brightfuse.com</a> so steps can be
            taken for your safety.</p>
