@Brint.com L.L.C. has created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate our firm commitment
to privacy.  The following discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices for
this website: @Brint.com: The BizTech Network.<p>

</p><p>We use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server, and to administer our Web
site. We provide you the the option of using browser-based cookies to deliver content specific
to your interests and to save your password so you don't have to re-enter it each time you visit
our site.
</p><p>Our site's registration form allows users the option to give us contact information (like
their name and email address).  We use customer contact information from the registration
details to send the user information about new content additions to the web site that are
considered relevant by the user as well as special promotions related to learning, knowledge,
networking and professional opportunities and services provided by our partners and affiliates.
The customer's contact information is also used to contact the visitor when necessary. Users may
opt-out of receiving future mailings; see the choice/opt-out section below.

claims that any content on @Brint.com web site violates the rights of third-parties; or (iv)
protect the rights, property, or personal safety of @Brint.com, its users and the public.
