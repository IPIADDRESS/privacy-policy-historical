<li>If you disclose any personal information relating to other people to us or to our service providers in connection with our Properties, you represent that you have the authority to do so and to permit us to use the information in accordance with this Privacy Statement.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="info-device" class="lead stat">Device information we collect through our Properties:</h3>
<ul class="bullet">
<li><em>Server log files:</em> An Internet Protocol (IP) address is a number that is automatically assigned to the computer that you are using by your Internet Service Provider and is identified and logged automatically in our server log files whenever you visit one of our Properties, along with the time of the visit, the page(s) that were visited and other information related to your visit. We use IP addresses for purposes such as routing visitors to the appropriate website for the visitor’s country, calculating usage levels, helping diagnose server problems, and administering our Properties. If you accessed one of our Properties using a mobile device like a smartphone, we may also collect your phone’s unique device ID and other similar mobile device data.</li>
<li>Your use of mobile apps: When you download and use our mobile apps on or through computers and mobile devices, we and our service providers may track and collect application usage data, such as the date and time the application on your device accesses our servers and what information and files have been downloaded to the application based on your device number.</li>
<li><em>Cookies and similar technologies:</em> A “Cookie” is a small text file containing a random and unique alphanumeric identifier that our Properties may transfer to your computer’s hard drive through your web browser that enables our systems to recognize your browser. We employ technologies like Cookies, web beacons, clear GIF, pixel or Internet tag technologies to uniquely identify your account, or the IP address associated with your Internet device. We also permit third parties to gather information on our websites, including for advertising purposes, through these technologies, as described <a href="#interest">below.</a> Cookies and the other technologies mentioned above provide information related to the ways consumers interact with our advertising or our Properties, like browser type, browsing behaviors, user web requests, pages and content viewed, the number of new visits or log-ins, search engine referral, affiliate referrals, traffic driven by banner ads or other promotions, which items are placed in shopping carts and which are abandoned, conversions and what purchases were made and zip codes. These technologies can contain or store personal and other information (such as if you have previously registered on our Properties or consented to the retention of certain personal information) and allow web browser servers to recognize return visits to our Properties and improve web browsing navigation or the quality and delivery of certain features or customized content through our Properties. Some Cookies (known as “persistent cookies”) will remain on your computer or Internet device until you delete them, while others (known as “session cookies”) are automatically erased when you exit your Internet browser. You can set your computer or Internet device to accept or reject most Cookies, or to notify you in most situations that a Cookie is offered so that you can decide whether to accept it. However, if you block Cookies, certain features on our Sites may not function. Additionally, even if you block or delete Cookies, not all tracking will necessarily stop.</li>
<li><em>Flash LSOs:</em> We and our third-party service providers may use Flash Local Storage Objects (“Flash LSOs”) in certain situations, including to recognize you and remember your preferences or other details about your visit. Flash LSOs are different from browser Cookies because of the amount and type of data stored. In addition, you generally cannot control, delete or disable the acceptance of Flash LSOs from your browser. For more information on Flash LSOs, and to learn how to control them, click on the support page for your Flash player and choose Global Storage Settings Panel and follow the instructions. To see the Flash LSOs on your computer now, go to your Flash player’s Website Storage Settings Panel and follow the instructions to review and, if you choose, to delete any specific Flash LSO.</li>
<li><em>Third-party applications and APIs:</em> We also offer and deliver services, content or interactive features through and/or using third party application programming interfaces (API), gadgets, extensions that are hosted on our Properties or through other third party websites, or social networking platforms.

<h2 id="interest">Interest-based Advertising</h2>
<p>We may place or recognize a unique Cookie on your browser when you visit our Properties for purposes of serving you targeted advertising (also referred to as “interest-based advertising”). We also allow third-party companies to place their own Cookies on your browser when you visit our Properties (or to use other technologies that permit them to collect information about your use of the Properties), so that they can collect information about your online activities over time and across different sites or other online services and serve customized advertisements to you as you browse the Internet or use mobile apps. These third parties may also use Cookies and other technologies to recognize you across the different devices you use, such as a desktop or laptop computer, smartphone or table, and serve interest-based ads to you on any of your devices. These advertising companies may participate in the Self-Regulatory Program for Online Behavioral Advertising managed by the Digital Advertising Alliance. As part of this program, our targeted advertisements may be delivered with “<a href="http://www.aboutads.info/">AdChoices</a>” icons that help you understand how data about you is being used and provide you with the ability to opt out of such interest-based advertising on the particular device from which you access the icon. Additionally, our Properties that participate in interest-based advertising may also contain such icons. Please click on an AdChoices icon or <a href="http://optout.aboutads.info/?c=2#!/">click here</a> to learn more about your choices with respect to interest-based advertising on the device you are currently using. From a mobile device, please visit the Digital Advertising Alliance’s <a href="http://www.aboutads.info/appchoices">“AppChoices” website</a> to download a free app that allows you to set preferences for data collection and use across mobile apps. When you click an AdChoices icon on our Properties, you will also be provided with a list of third parties collecting behavioral data for ad-serving purposes on that Property; please visit the privacy policies of those service providers to learn more about how they collect and use data and the &nbsp;opt out choices they provide. To learn more about the Self-Regulatory Program for Online Behavioral Advertising, please visit<strong>&nbsp;</strong><a href="http://www.aboutads.info/choices/">http://www.aboutads.info/choices/</a>. You can also generally opt-out of receiving personalized ads from third party advertisers and ad networks who are members of the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/">Network Advertising Initiative (NAI)</a>&nbsp; by visiting the <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/">opt-out page</a> on the <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/?partnerId=1//">NAI website</a>. While some browsers have a “do not track” feature that lets you tell websites that you do not want to have your online activities tracked, these features are not yet uniform and our Properties are not currently set up to respond to these signals. However, you have various choices and options as described in this Privacy Policy Statement regarding advertising and marketing communications.&nbsp;</p>
<hr class="border--mabel">
<h2 id="retention">Retention and Storage of Personal Information</h2>
<p>We will retain personal information for as long as needed or permitted in light of the purpose(s) for which it was obtained.&nbsp; The criteria used to determine our retention periods include:&nbsp; (i) the length of time we have an ongoing relationship with you and provide services to you through our Properties; (ii) whether there is a legal obligation to which we are subject; or (iii) whether retention is advisable in light of our legal position (such as in regard to applicable statutes of limitations, litigation or regulatory investigations). We seek to use secure methods to destroy personal information when it is no longer needed, including the use of reasonable technical and physical security measures to avoid unauthorized access to or use of the personal information after it is disposed</p>
<hr class="border--mabel">
<h2 id="access">Accessing and Updating Your Personal Information</h2>
<p>If you have created an online account on one of our websites and would like to update the personal information you have provided to us, you can access your account on the applicable website to view and make changes or corrections to your personal information. You may also contact us using the methods described below under <a href="#contact">“Contacting Us”</a> to request access or updates to your information. We will try to comply with your request as soon as reasonably practicable.</p>
<hr class="border--mabel">
<h2 id="optout">Opting Out of Communications</h2>
<p>If you no longer want to receive marketing-related emails from one of our brands on a going-forward basis, you may opt-out of receiving marketing-related emails by clicking the “unsubscribe” link at the bottom of any email newsletter you receive from that brand, or, if you created an online account when you registered to receive our emails, you may log-in to your account on the applicable brand’s website and make changes to your communication preferences. If you no longer want to receive promotional text messages from one of our brands, please follow the cancellation instructions contained in the last text message sent by that brand. If you are having difficulty unsubscribing from our marketing communications using the above methods, please contact us directly using the methods listed below under <a href="#contact">Contacting Us.</a></p>
<p>Please allow ample time for us to process your request. However, please note that even if you opt-out from receiving marketing emails or text messages, we may still need to send you communications about your orders, customer service inquiries, promotions participation and other service-related matters. We also may keep information we have collected about you for record-keeping, research and other purposes. Also, please note that if you participated in a promotion that involved a third party, and, as part of that promotion, you agreed to receive future marketing communications directly from that party, you will need to contact that party to opt-out of such communications. This process may be outlined in that party’s privacy policy.</p>
<hr class="border--mabel">
<h2 id="security">Security</h2>
<p>We use commercially reasonable organizational, technical and administrative means intended to protect stored and transmitted information from loss, misuse and unauthorized access or disclosure, and we (or our third-party payment processing providers) encrypt credit card numbers from e-commerce transactions conducted on our Properties using secure socket layer (SSL) technology. However, no method of Internet transmission or electronic storage is 100% secure or error-free, so we unfortunately cannot guarantee absolute security. If you have reason to believe that your interaction with us is no longer secure (for example, if you feel that the security of any account you might have with us has been compromised), please <a href="#contact">“Contact Us”</a> immediately.</p>
<hr class="border--mabel">
<h2 id="coverage">Websites Not Covered by this Privacy Policy</h2>
<p>Our Properties may contain links or references to other websites or services that are managed by third parties or that are managed by us but contain a different privacy statement. This Privacy Statement governs only information that we collect through our Properties that link to this Privacy Statement, and not to websites, services or applications that do not link to this Privacy Statement or that are maintained and controlled by other companies or organizations, including third party websites linked to from our Properties, as well as communications from third parties that reference our company or products.</p>
<p>For example, some of our Properties may offer you the ability to make purchases using third-party e-commerce providers or payment services. In those instances, you will be directed to a webpage that is hosted by the third party (or its service providers) and not by us. Unless otherwise stated, any personal information that you provide through that third party webpage will be collected by that party and not by us, and will be subject to that party’s privacy policy, rather than this Privacy Statement. In such a situation, we will have no control over, and shall not be responsible for, that party’s use of the information you provide to them.</p>
<p>Please note that many of the websites we operate outside of the United States are governed by separate privacy policies linked to from those websites. This Privacy Statement also does not cover the “offline” collection of information by us unless you have been notified that this Privacy Statement applies at the time of collection.</p>
<p>The collection and use of your information by and through third party websites, applications or other means will be governed by the privacy policies applicable to those third parties and mediums.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We are not responsible for the information collection, use, disclosure or security policies or practices of other organizations, such as Facebook, Apple, Google, Microsoft or any other app developer, app provider, social media platform provider, operating system provider, wireless service provider or device manufacturer, including with respect to any personal information you disclose to other organizations through or in connection with software applications or social media pages. The inclusion of a link or reference on the Properties does not imply endorsement of the linked site by us or by our affiliates. Websites may contain our name, logos, products or other branding even though they are actually operated by third parties that may or may not have a relationship with us. Therefore, we encourage you to read the privacy statement of every service, application, or website you visit or interact with.</p>
<hr class="border--mabel">
<h2 id="age">Children</h2>
<p>Our Properties are not intended for children under the age of 18 and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children under age 18. Children under the age of 18 should not use our Properties and should not provide their personal information to us.</p>
<hr class="border--mabel">
<h2 id="border">Cross-Border Transfers</h2>
<p>Because we operate globally, your personal information may be stored and processed in any country where we have facilities or in which we engage service providers. By using our Properties, you consent to the transfer of information to countries outside your country of residence, including the United States, which may have different data protection rules than in your country.</p>
<hr class="border--mabel">
<h2 id="contact">Contacting Us</h2>
<p>Please direct any inquiries related to this Privacy Statement or personal information we have collected about you to our Privacy Team by sending mail to Clorox Consumer Services, PO Box 24305, Oakland, California, 94623-1305, or by completing this <a href="https://cloroxconnections.custhelp.com/app/ask/cws/thecloroxcompany.com" rel="nofollow">online form</a>.
