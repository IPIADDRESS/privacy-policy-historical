		<h3>I) Disputes</h3>
		<p class="pContent"><b><font color="#FF0000">The Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in 
		accordance with, the laws of the State of California, without regard to 
		its conflict of law provisions. You and Brizy agree to submit to the exclusive 
		jurisdiction of the courts located within San Francisco County, California 
		to resolve any dispute arising out of the Agreement or the Brizy Services</font></b>.

		is a California resident, Member waives California Civil Code Section 1542, 
		which says "A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor 
		does not know or suspect to exist in his favor at the time of executing 
		the release, which, if known by him must have materially affected his settlement 
		with the debtor. EACH OF THE PARTIES HEREBY KNOWINGLY, VOLUNTARILY AND INTENTIONALLY 
		WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION 
		(INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO ANY CLAIMS, COUNTERCLAIMS, CROSS-CLAIMS, OR 
		THIRD PARTY CLAIMS) ARISING OUT OF, UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT. 
		FURTHER, EACH PARTY HERETO CERTIFIES THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE OR AGENT OF

		<h2><u>PRIVACY POLICY</u></h2>
		<p class="pContent">Updated as of May 27, 2012</p>
		<h3>User Privacy</h3>
		<p class="pContent">Brizy is a fun website that lets you refer your friends 
		to sign up and communicate with each other. Like any website that offers 
		a service where you register and provide information about yourself or your 
		opinions, it is wise to pay attention to your personal information. At Brizy 
		we understand this, and have established this Privacy Policy to explain 
		how information is collected on our website, and how this information is 
		used. Members Must Be 13 years of age or older. Brizy is intended solely 
		for use by persons 13 years of age or older. All persons under 13 are prohibited 
		from registering on Brizy.</p>
		<h3>How Does Brizy Protect Children's Privacy?</h3>
		<p class="pContent">The safety and privacy of children is extremely important 
		to us.</p>
		<p class="pContent">Brizy is a general audience web site that complies with 
		the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA). Our registration process 
		is designed to restrict children under the age of 13 from becoming members 
		of Brizy and using our site. We've also designed the tone and style of the 
		site to appeal to teenagers. If we receive information suggesting that a 
		user who has registered with Brizy is under the age of 13, we require the 
		user to provide evidence confirming that the user is at least 13 years old. 
		If the user fails to provide such information within 48 hours, we immediately 
		terminate the user's account and nullify all personally identifiable information 
		displaying on the site and collected from such user.</p>
		<h3>What Is the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act?</h3>
		<p class="pContent">The Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) 
		requires that commercial web sites obtain parental consent (under most circumstances) 
		prior to the collection of any personally identifiable information from 
		children whom they know to be under the age of 13. In addition, COPPA requires 
		that web sites that collect personal information from children under the 
		age of 13 provide parents with:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Notice. Parents must be provided notice regarding what information 
			is collected, how the information will be used, and with whom the information 
			may be shared.</li>
			<li>The ability to prevent further use of the information collected 
			about the child and prevent any future collection of personal information 
			from the child.</li>
			<li>The ability to access and review their child's personal information.</li>
		</ul>
		COPPA also limits the amount of personal information a web site can collect 
		from a child. Web sites may not collect any more personal information than 
		is necessary to participate in a given game or activity.
		<p class="pContent">For more information about COPPA, please visit the
		<a target="_blank" href="http://www.ftc.gov/">Federal Trade Commission's web site.</a></p>
		<p class="pContent">Parents: If your child is under the age of 13 and 
		has joined Brizy using a false age, please notify Brizy Site, 
		and we will immediately cancel your child's account and nullify all personally 
		identifiable information displaying on the site and collected from them. 
		If you would like to know more about our site, information practices, stored 
		information about your child, or how to close your child's account, please
		<a href="http://www.brizy.com/contactus.php" target="_blank">contact</a> Brizy. We will 
		happily respond to all queries from parents with Privacy questions or concerns.</p>

		<h3>User Information Collected by Brizy</h3>
		<p></p>
		<h3>Personally Identifiable User Information</h3>
		<p class="pContent">All users begin using Brizy's services by registering 
		on the Brizy website. When registering, users provide personally identifiable 
		information, which includes their first and last name, email address, mailing 
		address, which school they attend, a user-chosen password, and date of birth, 
		and other personal information. To complete the registration process, Brizy sends a validation email message 
		to each user, with a URL link back to our website. This URL contains an 
		alphanumeric identifier and a user-specific numeric pass code that allows 
		us to confirm the user's identity.</p>
		<h3>Cookies and Passive Data Collection</h3>
		<p class="pContent">Brizy logs standard user information and clickstream 
		data for all users, including a user's IP address, operating system, and 
		page views. When users visit particular pages within Brizy, a UserID may 
		be placed in the URL, allowing customized features for the user. Users should 
		be aware that other websites visited before entering Brizy might place personally 
		identifiable information within a user's URL during a visit to their website, 
		and Brizy has no control over such websites. Accordingly, some of this information 
		may be logged by a subsequent website that collects URL information. In 
		addition to the standard log information, Brizy uses a variety of technologies 
		to create a more personalized experience for its users. Cookies are small 
		data files sent by websites to a user's browser and hard drive that identify 
		the computer to the website. We use cookies to allow enhanced features, 
		such as allowing registered users to bypass typing their passwords before 
		entering the website. We may also use cookies to enable customizable content 
		for users, as they become available. Users have the option, within their 
		Internet browsers, to disable cookies and continue to access the Brizy website. 
		Pixel tags are tiny graphic files that are included in HTML-encoded e-mail 
		messages. We use pixel tags to gather information about the e-mails we send 
		to our registered users. When such a message is opened in an HTML-capable 
		e-mail program, the recipient's computer accesses our server to retrieve 
		the pixel tag file, and allows us to record and store the date and time, 
		the recipient's e-mail address, and other standard logging information. 
		The pixel tag also may read cookies. Brizy web pages may also contain similar 
		pixel tags that allow us to count users who have visited those pages, to 
		compile aggregated statistics about site usage, and to deliver co-branded 
		services as they become available. Brizy pixel tags collect only a limited 
		set of information including a cookie number, time and date of a page view, 
		and a description of the page on which the pixel tag resides. Brizy web 
		pages may also contain pixel tags placed there by third party ad servers, 
		to monitor the effectiveness of their advertising. We do not have access 
		to, nor control over, advertisers' cookies or how they may be used. If you 
		would like more information about advertisers' use of cookies, and about 
		your option not to accept these cookies, please click
		<a target="_blank" href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp">here</a>.</p>

		the referral page, an email is automatically sent from that registered user 
		to the referral address, encouraging the referral to sign up on the Brizy 
		website. If the referred person does not sign up within a few days, we also 
		send a reminder from the registered user to the referral address. All registered
