    <h2>When carrying out any of the above activities, we:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Conduct an independent risk assessment into whether the proposed data transfer will provide an adequate level of protection for the rights of the data subjects; and</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>If we do not find that there is an adequate level of protection, we put into place adequate safeguards to protect the rights of the data subjects. This is ensured by way of a contractual agreement with any applicable data controller or data processor to whom data is transferred, where possible using the European Commission model clauses in respect of transfers from controller to controller and in respect of transfers from controller to processor.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>We only engage in transfers of personal data outside the EEA to a country whose data protection laws have not been approved by the European Commission as providing adequate protection for data subjects’ rights if there is an adequate level of protection for the rights of data subjects.
      <br>In assessing adequacy, we consider general adequacy criteria and legal adequacy criteria. If our assessment of the ‘general adequacy criteria’ reveals that, in the particular circumstances of the case, the risk to the rights of data subjects associated with the transfer is low, we may consider that an exhaustive analysis of the ‘legal adequacy criteria’ may not be necessary. If a high risk is identified (for example, in the event that the data is particularly sensitive) then a more comprehensive investigation of the legal adequacy criteria would be carried out.
      <br>The criteria we consider in making the assessment is as set out below:</p>
    <h1>General Adequacy Criteria:</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>The nature of the personal data;</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>The purposes for which the data is intended to be processed;</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>The period during which the data is intended to be processed;</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>The country or territory of origin of the information contained the data;</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>The country or territory of the final destination of the information;</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Any security measures taken in respect of the data in the country or territory of destination.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Legal Adequacy Criteria:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>The law in force in the country or territory in question;</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>The international obligation of the recipient country or territory;</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>The rules or codes of practice which govern the processing of personal data in the third country.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>If adequacy is established by way of our assessment, then we would proceed with the transfer of the data. If adequacy is not established by way of our assessment, then we would seek to enter into a contractual relationship with the data controller or data processor in question to ensure that the security of the data is maintained to our required standards before any transfer takes place.</p>
    <h4><br>EU-U.S. Privacy Shield and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield</h4>
