                    <h6 class="mtop30">How do we collect and use information?</h6>

                    <p>
                        Our primary goals in collecting information are to provide and improve our Services, to
                        administer your use of the Services (including your Account, if you are an Account holder), and
                        to enable you to enjoy and easily navigate our Services.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                    </p><h6>Account Information.</h6>
                    When you create an Account we'll collect certain information that can be used to identify you, such
                    as your name, email address, and credit card information ("<strong>Personally Identifiable
                    Information</strong>" or "<strong>PII</strong>"). We may also collect certain information that is
                    not PII because it cannot be used by itself to identify you. If you choose to create an Account
                    through one of your SNS Accounts, you may have to provide us with your username (or userID) so that
                    your identity can be authenticated by the SNS Account. When the authentication is complete, we’ll be
                    able to link your Account with the SNS Account and access certain PII, such as your name and email
                    address, and other PII that your privacy settings on the SNS Account permit us to access. We don’t
                    receive or store passwords for any of your SNS Accounts.
                    <p></p>

                    <p>
                    </p><h6>Information Collected Using Cookies.</h6>
                    Information Collected Using Cookies. We collect certain information through the use of "cookies,"
                    which are small text files that are saved by your browser when you access our Services. We may use
                    both session cookies and persistent cookies to identify that you've logged in to the Services and to
                    tell us how and when you interact with our Services. We may also use cookies to monitor aggregate
                    usage and web traffic routing on our Services and to customize and improve our Services. Unlike
                    persistent cookies, session cookies are deleted when you log off from the Services and close your
                    browser. Although most browsers automatically accept cookies, you can change your browser options to
                    stop automatically accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting cookies. Please note,
                    however, that if you don't accept cookies, you may not be able to access all portions or features of
                    the Services. Some third-party services providers that we engage may also place their own cookies on
                    your browser. Note that this Privacy Policy covers only our use of cookies and does not include use
                    of cookies by such third parties.
                    <p></p>

                    <p>
                    </p><h6>Information Related to Use of the Services.</h6>
                    Our servers automatically record certain information about how a person uses our Services (we refer
                    to this information as "<strong>Log Data</strong>"), including both Account holders and non-Account
                    holders (either, a "<strong>User</strong>"). Log Data may include information such as a User's
                    Internet Protocol (IP) address, browser type, operating system, the web page that a User was
                    visiting before accessing our Services, the pages or features of our Services to which a User
                    browsed and the time spent on those pages or features, search terms, the links on our Services that
                    a User clicked on and other statistics. We use this information to administer the Services and we
                    analyze (and may engage third parties to analyze) this information to improve and enhance the
                    Services by expanding their features and functionality and tailoring them to our Users' needs and
                    preferences. We may use a person's IP address to generate aggregate, non-identifying information
                    about how our Services are used.
                    <br>
                    Our web pages may contain electronic images known as web beacons (sometimes called single-pixel
                    gifs) and may be used to compile aggregated statistics to analyze how our site is used and may be
                    used in some of our emails to let us know which emails and links have been opened by recipients.
                    This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of our customer communications and marketing campaigns.
                    <p></p>
                    <p>
                    </p><h6>Location Information.</h6>
                    In some cases we collect and store information about where you are located, such as by converting
                    your IP address into a rough geolocation, such as the city where you are located when you access the
                    Services. We may use location information to improve and personalize our Services for you.
                    <p></p>

                    <h6 class="mtop30">What Information Do We Share With Third Parties?</h6>

                    <p>
                        We will not share any PII that we have collected from you except as described below:
                    </p>

                    <p>
                    </p><h6>Information Shared with Our Services Providers.</h6>
                    We may engage third party service providers to work with us to administer and provide the Services,
                    such as our payment processor facilitating transactions for your subscription. These third-party
                    services providers have access to your PII only for the purpose of performing services on our
                    behalf.
                    <p></p>

                    <p>
                    </p><h6>Information Shared with Third Parties.</h6>
                    We may share aggregated information and non-identifying information with third parties for industry
                    analysis, demographic profiling and other similar purposes.
                    <p></p>

                    <p>
                    </p><h6>Information Disclosed in Connection with Business Transactions.</h6>
                    Information that we collect from our users, including PII, is considered to be a business asset. As
                    a result, if we go out of business or enter bankruptcy or if we are acquired as a result of a
                    transaction such as a merger, acquisition or asset sale, your PII may be disclosed or transferred to
                    the third-party acquirer in connection with the transaction.
                    <p></p>

                    <p>
                    </p><h6>Information Disclosed for Our Protection and the Protection of Others.</h6>
                    It is our policy to protect you from having your privacy violated through abuse of the legal
                    systems, whether by individuals, entities or government, and to contest claims that we believe to be
                    invalid under applicable law. However, it is also our policy to cooperate with government and law
                    enforcement officials and private parties. Accordingly, we reserve the right to disclose any
                    information about you to government or law enforcement officials or private parties as we, in our
                    sole discretion, believe necessary: (i) to satisfy or comply with any applicable law, regulation or
                    legal process or to respond to lawful requests, including subpoenas, warrants or court orders; (ii)
                    to protect our property, rights and safety and the rights, property and safety of third parties or
                    the public in general; and (iv) to prevent or stop activity we consider to be illegal or unethical.
                    <p></p>

                    <h6 class="mtop30">Facebook Connect</h6>

                    <p>
                        Our Site allows users to create an account and login to the Service using their Facebook account
                        credentials through Facebook Connect. Creating an account for the first time through Facebook
                        Connect will prompt users to merge their Brightstorm and Facebook accounts. By using Facebook
                        Connect, you are allowing Brightstorm to access your Facebook account information and you are
                        agreeing to the Facebook Terms of Use in your use of the Site via Facebook.


                        <br>
                        If you are not currently registered as a Brightstorm user and you click on "Sign in Using
                        Facebook," you will first be asked to enter your Facebook credentials and then be given the
                        option to register and join Brightstorm. We allow users to automatically post recent activity
                        back to Facebook, and give them the option to disable Facebook Connect at any time by logging
                        into "My Profile" and clicking on "My Facebook Profile." Further, you can edit your privacy
                        settings for the reviews that appear on Facebook or disconnect this service by visiting the
                        "Facebook Application Settings" page.

                    <h6 class="mtop30">International Transfer </h6>

                    <p>
                        Your PII may be transferred to, and maintained on, computers located outside of your state,
                        province, country or other governmental jurisdiction where the privacy laws may not be as
                        protective as those in your jurisdiction. If you're located outside the United States and choose
                        to provide your PII to us, we may transfer your PII to the United States and process it there.
                        Your consent to this Privacy Policy followed by your submission of any PII represents your
                        agreement to that transfer.

                        children under 13. If we learn that we have collected PII of a child under 13 we will take steps
                        to delete such information from our files as soon as possible.
