							<h2>Privacy Policy (updated July 2008)</h2>
                <p class="justify">This Privacy Policy statement describes our practices regarding how information we collect on the Roku Web sites and via Roku products ("Roku Devices") is used and shared with third parties. By visiting the Roku Web sites or using Roku Devices, you accept the practices described in this statement. This statement applies to anonymous data and personal information collected at the Roku Web sites and via Roku Devices. This statement also applies to personally identifiable customer information collected in connection with the sale, support and use of Roku Products.</p>
				<h3>Part I. Information Collection</h3>
				<p class="justify">Roku collects both anonymous and personally identifiable information through our Web sites and Roku Devices.  This information is used to effect e-commerce transactions, provide customer service and support, and to ensure that Roku products and services effectively deliver high-quality experiences.</p>
				<p class="justify">Roku Web sites collect personally identifiable information at several points, including processes associated with e-commerce, product registration, account creation and e-mail opt-in.  Visitors may voluntarily provide (and we will collect) information including: name, email address, billing and shipping information, product purchase information, and product registration information.</p>
				<p class="justify">We also collect the personal information of third parties that is provided by visitors who submit that personal data through our Web sites, in connection with, for example, referrals or gift purchases.</p>
				<p class="justify">We may collect information related to the use of our Web sites - through, for example, the use of cookies - in order to better understand our customers' needs.  A cookie is a small text file that our Web server places on your computer hard drive that includes a unique identifier.  Cookies enable Roku to track usage patterns and deliver customized content to users.</p>
				<p class="justify">Roku Devices regularly upload usage information to Roku as part of their use.  The collected information includes the specific identifiers of streams played, duration played, various quality measures, error logs, software version numbers, and other usage statistics.  Usage information uploaded from Roku Devices is personally identifiable by product serial number. In some instances, serial numbers are associated with personally identifiable information to aid in customer service and support.</p>
                <p class="justify">The collected information from many users is aggregated for analysis and, in some instances, made generally available to users of Roku Devices and Roku Web Services in an anonymous fashion.  For example, to provide features such as "Top 10" lists.  Further, Roku may use personally identifiable information to make content recommendations to individual users.</p>
                <p class="justify">If you do not wish Roku to use your information as described in this section, please follow the procedure in Part III (Access to Your Information) below.</p>
                <p class="justify">In order to protect the privacy interests of younger Internet users, we do not actively market our Web sites or products to children under 13. We do not knowingly collect information from children under 13 for marketing purposes. We encourage children of any age to visit our Web sites or to use our products only with the supervision of their parents.</p>
				<h3>Part II. Information Usage</h3>
				<p class="justify">Information collected by Roku is, first and foremost, used to understand how customers are using our products and services in order to make them better.</p>
				<p class="justify">Anonymous, aggregated data is analyzed on a regular basis to understand product usage, feature popularity, software quality, and to influence the design of future products.</p>
				<p class="justify">Personal information is used to fulfill orders, provide customer support, and for marketing purposes such as email announcements of new products or offers.  We provide an option for you to choose not to receive marketing communications and you may always contact us at customerservice@roku.com to opt-out of marketing communications (however, we reserve the right to use your contact information if we consider it necessary to send you crucial information about the product or services you have purchased from us.)</p>
				<p class="justify">Roku may also share information with companies integral to the use of the product. For example, we may share information collected from the Netflix Player by Roku with Netflix, Inc.  This information is only identifiable by serial number, but the receiving party may be able to link serial number to personally identifiable information they have collected on their own.  In those cases, the use of that information is subject to the privacy policies of the receiving party.</p>
				<p class="justify">Roku uses third parties (including contractors and service providers) to help with certain aspects of its operations, which may require disclosure of your personal information to them. For example, Roku may use a third party to communicate with you (via telephone, email, or letter) about our products or services, to send information to you, to process and collect payment via your credit card (if applicable), and to perform other work that we may need to outsource. Roku requires these contractors and third parties to use your personal information only as necessary to perform the services they are asked to perform.</p>
				<p class="justify">We may share some or all of your personal information with our current or future "affiliates" (which means a parent company, any subsidiaries, joint ventures, or other companies under a common control), in which case we will require our affiliates to honor this privacy policy. If another company acquires Roku (or a business unit of Roku that uses your personal information), that company will possess the personal information collected by Roku and it will assume the rights and obligations regarding your personal information as described in this privacy policy.</p>
				<p class="justify">We offer links to other Web sites. Please note: those other Web sites may observe privacy standards different from ours and the collection and use of your personal information will be governed by the privacy policies on those other sites.</p>
                <p class="justify">Our Web sites offers developer forums and message boards. Please be advised that any information posted in these venues will be publicly available.</p>
                <p class="justify">Finally, please be assured that Roku does not sell information collected from customers.</p>
				<h3>Part III. Access to Information</h3>
				<p class="justify">If you wish to ask for correction or deletion of any of your personal information held by us or a change in the way we use your information, please contact support at customerservice@roku.com.  We will use commercially reasonable efforts to fulfill your request in a timely manner, but no more than 30 days. However, even if Roku deletes such personal information from its 'live' database, it may still be stored on other databases (including those kept for archival purposes).</p>
				<h3>Part IV. Data Storage and Security</h3>
				<p class="justify">Roku uses industry-standard methods of securing its electronic databases of personal information. For example, sensitive customer information is transferred via industry standard Secure Sockets Layers (SSL), and our databases are protected by two layers of Firewalls. Except as provided elsewhere in this privacy policy, Roku limits access to personal information in electronic databases to those persons in Roku's organization who have a business need for such access. However, you should know that no company, including Roku, can fully eliminate security risks associated with personal information.</p>
				<p class="justify">Your privacy is very important to us. Due to factors beyond our control, however, we cannot fully ensure that your personal information will not be disclosed to third parties other than those mentioned above. For example, we may be legally required to disclose information to the government or third parties under certain circumstances, or third parties may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private communications.</p>
				<h3>Part V. Modifications</h3>
				<p class="justify">We may amend this privacy policy at any time by posting the amended version on our web sites.</p>
				<h3>Part VI. Contact Information</h3>
				<p class="justify">If you have any questions regarding this privacy policy, please contact support. We will use commercially reasonable efforts to resolve disputes within 90 days.</p><!-- ============================ Bottom Page ================================== -->
