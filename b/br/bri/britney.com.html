        <span class="bodycopy1">Zomba Recording Corporation ("Zomba", 
        "we", "us") collects e-mail addresses from children 
        under 13 (individually, "Child" or collectively, "Children") 
        on the following sites:<a href="http://www.aaron-carter.com">www.aaron-carter.com</a>,

        and <a href="http://www.onthelinemusic.com">www.onthelinemusic.com</a> 
        (the "Children Sites"). We collect these e-mail addresses directly, 
        in response to Children’s requests to receive e-mail updates or other 
        information regarding a particular recording artist or group of artists. 
        When we collect these e-mail addresses, we also request the e-mail address 
        of one parent or guardian ("Parent").</span></p>
      <p class="bodycopy1"><span class="single">How We Use the Personal Information. 
        </span>We use the Children’s e-mail addresses to send them updates 
        about the artist(s) they’ve requested and other artists and music, 
        and for no other purpose. We use the Parents’ e-mail addresses to 
        inform them of their Children’s requests, our resulting contact with 
        their Children, and other information regarding their rights and our collection 
        and use of their Children’s personal information.</p>
      <p class="bodycopy1"><br>
        <span class="single">Third Parties.</span> We work with third parties 
        that provide services, which may include website hosting, e-commerce affiliation, 
        data analysis, e-mailing and other services of an administrative nature. 
        Personal information may be shared with such third parties for the purpose 
        of providing such services. We seek to impose confidentiality obligations 
        on such service providers. We do not otherwise knowingly disclose Children’s 
        personal information to third parties.</p>
      <p class="bodycopy1"><br>
        <span class="single">GetMusic and DotClick.</span> Please note that we 
        operate the Children’s Sites in conjunction with an unaffiliated 
        entity, GetMusic LLC ("GetMusic"). We also provide a link to 
        media player plug-in software on some of the Children’s Sites to 
        websites owned or controlled by DotClick Corporation ("DotClick"). 
        Neither GetMusic nor DotClick collects information or data from visitors 
        to the Children’s Sites, however, there is a link on the Children’s 
        Sites to websites owned and/or controlled by GetMusic and DotClick, on 
        which websites visitors may voluntarily provide personal information to 
        GetMusic and/or DotClick. We are not responsible for GetMusic’s or 
        DotClick’s collection or use of information or data, but rather such 
        collection and use is subject to GetMusic’s and DotClick’s privacy 
        practices. You should review the privacy policies of GetMusic and DotClick 
        to understand how they collect and use information.<br>
      </p>
      <p class="bodycopy1"><span class="single">Conditioning Participation on 
        Unnecessary Disclosure.</span> Participation in all activities offered 
        through the Children Sites is voluntary. We may not condition a Child’s 
        participation in any activity offered on the Children Sites on the Child’s 
        disclosing more information than is reasonably necessary to participate 
        in such activity.</p>
      <p class="bodycopy1"><span class="single"><br>
        Parental Review.</span> To review the personal information that we have 
        collected from a particular Child, such Child’s Parent may send a 
        request by e-mail to <span class="bodycopy1"><a href="mailto:privacycoordinator@zomba.com">privacycoordinator@zomba.com</a></span>. 
        This request must contain the Child’s e-mail address so we can provide 
        the requesting Parent with the proper information. Because we must ensure 
        that such requests are from the applicable Child’s Parent, they must 
        be sent from the Parent’s e-mail address initially provided by such 
        Child. If this is impossible because the Parent’s e-mail address 
        is inoperable, or for any other reason, such Parent may mail a signed 
        request, including such Parent’s telephone number, to Zomba Recording 
        Corporation’s address as provided below. Through the same process, 
        Parents may: (i) request that we delete their Children’s personal 
        information and make no further use of it; and (ii) update your child’s 
        personally identifiable information.</p>
