IT IS INTENDED TO SUPPLEMENT THE TERMS OF OUR GENERAL <a href="http://www.jiverecords.com/zombaprivacy/adultpriv.html">PRIVACY POLICY</a>, WHICH ALSO APPLY (EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT SUCH TERMS ARE INCONSISTENT WITH THESE ADDITIONAL TERMS) TO OUR COLLECTION AND USE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION FROM CHILDREN UNDER THE AGE OF 13.</p>
      <p><strong>The Personal Information We Collect.</strong> Zomba Recording Corporation ("Zomba", "we", "us") collects e-mail addresses from children under 13 (individually, "Child" or collectively, "Children") on the following sites: <a href="http://www.thebackstreetboys.com" target="_blank">www.thebackstreetboys.com</a>,  <a href="http://ww.britney.com" target="_blank">www.britney.com</a>, <a href="http://www.nickcarter.com/" target="_blank">www.nickcarter.com</a>, <a href="http://www.niveamusic.com" target="_blank">www.niveamusic.com</a>, <a href="http://www.nsync-world.com" target="_blank">www.nsync-world.com</a>, <a href="http://www.nickcannonmusic.com" target="_blank">www.nickcannonmusic.com</a>, <a href="http://www.justintimberlake.com/" target="_blank">www.justintimberlake.com</a>, <a href="http://www.jcchasez.net/" target="_blank">www.jcchasez.net</a>, <a href="http://www.ciaraworld.com/" target="_blank">www.ciaraworld.com </a>and <a href="http://www.ciaramusic.com/" target="_blank">www.ciaramusic.com</a> (the "Children Sites").         We collect these e-mail addresses directly, in response to Children’s requests to receive e-mail updates or other information regarding a particular recording artist or group of artists. When we collect these e-mail addresses, we also request the e-mail address of one parent or guardian ("Parent").</p>
      <p><strong>How We Use the Personal Information. </strong>We use the Children’s e-mail addresses to send them updates about the artist(s) they’ve requested and other artists and music, and for no other purpose. We use the Parents’ e-mail addresses to inform them of their Children’s requests, our resulting contact with their Children, and other information regarding their rights and our collection and use of their Children’s personal information.</p>
      <p><br>
          <strong>Third Parties.</strong> We work with third parties that provide services, which may include website hosting, e-commerce affiliation, data analysis, e-mailing and other services of an administrative nature. Personal information may be shared with such third parties for the purpose of providing such services. We seek to impose confidentiality obligations on such service providers. We do not otherwise knowingly disclose Children’s personal information to third parties.</p>
      <p><br>
          <strong>Conditioning Participation on Unnecessary Disclosure.</strong> Participation in all activities offered through the Children Sites is voluntary. We do not condition a Child’s participation in any activity offered on the Children Sites on the Child’s disclosing more information than is reasonably necessary to participate in such activity.</p>
      <p><strong><br>
  Parental Review.</strong> To review the personal information that we have collected from a particular Child, such Child’s Parent may send a request by e-mail to <a href="mailto:privacycoordinator@zomba.com">privacycoordinator@zomba.com</a>. This request must contain the Child’s e-mail address so we can provide the requesting Parent with the proper information. Because we must ensure that such requests are from the applicable Child’s Parent, they must be sent from the Parent’s e-mail address initially provided by such Child. If this is impossible because the Parent’s e-mail address is inoperable, or for any other reason, such Parent may mail a signed request, including such Parent’s telephone number, to Zomba Recording Corporation’s address as provided below. Through the same process, Parents may: (i) request that we delete their Children’s personal information and make no further use of it; and (ii) update your child’s personally identifiable information.</p>
