<p><img src="../images/m_head_privacy.gif" width="400" height="32" alt="Privacy and Security Policy"></p>

<p>At Brivo Systems, privacy and security are core elements of our service.
Accordingly, we are always conscious and respectful of the privacy and
confidentiality of your business and personal information.  When you access
our website as a visitor, we want you to know that your Personal
Information (name, address, phone number and email address) is safe.  When
you access our website as a Brivo® Access Control System (ACS)
customer, your Personal and Business Information (product identification
information, internet access information such as web browser, connection
speed, domain and IP address, user access data, etc.) is safe and
confidential.  This Privacy and Security Statement will answer your
questions about the kind of information we collect in order to properly
serve you, how we use that information and how it is protected.</p>

<p>If you have questions or comments about Brivo's Privacy and Security
Statement, please feel free to contact us at <nobr><a href="mailto:privacy@brivo.com">privacy@brivo.com</a>.</nobr></p>

<p><b><u>What Information is Collected and How Will it Be Used?</u></b></p>

<p>For visitors, Brivo collects only the Personal Information necessary to
enable us to respond to your requests for our products and services.  When
you visit our website, you may be asked to identify your product needs or
the business category of your company, as well as your e-mail address,
company name, business address and phone number in order to respond to your
information requests.</p>

<p>For our customers, we collect only the information that is needed to
properly serve you and administer our business.  This will include Personal
and Business Information.  You will be asked to complete a product
registration form for the Brivo ACS system, enter user access data and
provide information necessary for billing.</p>

<p><b>Passive Collection of Information</b><br>

Our Web server automatically recognizes your domain name, but not your
e-mail address. As stated above, we do not collect nonpublic personal
information from visitors to our sites unless you expressly provide it to
us. The information we do collect from our Web sites (such as domain name,
number of hits, pages visited and length of user session) may be combined
to analyze how our Web sites are used. This information is then used to
improve the usefulness of the sites.</p>

<p><b>Cookies</b><br>

Like most Web sites, the Brivo ACS online interface uses cookies —
small files written to your browser's memory — to preserve session
information and to record browser characteristics. Cookies are not used to
access personal information or to monitor your actions.</p>

<p><b>Brivo may also use your Personal and Business Information to:</b></p>

<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Provide you with educational material related to our services and
recommendations regarding security practices.</li>

<li>Contact you to inform you of product and service enhancements and to
offer Brivo-related promotions or discounts that we think may be of
interest to you. </li>

<li>Notify you of any regulatory or compliance issues that will affect your
ACS service.</li>

<li>Ask you to participate in surveys to better understand your needs in
order to improve our products.</li>
</ul>
<p></p>

<p><b>Third Party Products</b><br>

Brivo actively forms partnerships with "best-in-class" companies and may,
on occasion, use your contact information to let you know about special
offers that may be of interest to you.  You may contact us at any time in
order to change your preferences with respect to marketing contacts from
Brivo, by e-mailing us at <nobr><a href="mailto:privacy@brivo.com">privacy@brivo.com</a>.</nobr></p>

<p><b>HOWEVER,</b> at our discretion, we will disclose information IF we
believe we are required to do so by law, believe that such disclosure is
necessary to protect us from legal liability or believe we need to do so to
protect someone's safety or the integrity of the site.  <b>Except as
herein, Brivo will not disclose any security information (e.g., user access
data) to any third parties unless directed to do so by you, or we receive
your explicit prior permission.</b></p>

<p><b><u>How Secure is Your Information?</u></b></p>

<p>Brivo uses a variety of security measures to safeguard the
confidentiality of information that it collects. Every Brivo employee is
trained on our privacy and security procedures.  Only authorized Brivo
employees or its representatives are permitted access to your Business
Information.  Moreover, Brivo uses industry-standard technical safeguards
and security measures to safeguard the confidentiality of the information
in its possession, such as firewalls and Secure Socket Layers ("SSL"). 
Information collected by Brivo is stored on secured servers, co-located at
a third party's secure facilities.  Additionally, the hosting facility is
guarded by 24 X 7 security guards, as well as card access and locked cage
areas, and security camera surveillance.</p>

<p>Except as specifically stated herein, Brivo will not access security
information entered by you in the course of using Brivo's ACS Service
except in the following limited circumstances:</p>

<p>
</p><ul>
<li>To provide necessary technical support, usually at your request and
with your permission;</li>

<li>To produce regular backups, restore data from backups at your request
or install software updates and/or upgrades.</li>
</ul>
<p></p>


<p><b>Deleting or Updating Information</b><br>

Brivo encourages you to contact us if you wish to delete, correct or
update your Business Information in our systems, or if you desire to change
your preferences with respect to marketing contacts from Brivo, by
e-mailing us at <nobr><a href="mailto:privacy@brivo.com">privacy@brivo.com</a>.</nobr></p>

<p>Brivo reserves the right to change this Privacy and Security Policy. Any
changes to this policy will be posted to this page as soon as reasonably
possible and will become effective immediately. Therefore, please check
this page periodically. Use of the Brivo site constitutes consent to any
policies then in effect.</p>
