<h1>BrightTALK™<br>PRIVACY POLICY</h1>
<p><em>(date of last revision: 2 April 2012)</em></p>
<h4>1. INTRODUCTION</h4>
<p>BrightTALK™ recognises that privacy is important when using the Web for communications. This policy explains how BrightTALK collects, stores, uses and shares personal information and information about your visits to the network, including the pages you view, the links you click and other actions taken in connection with any Web site with the brighttalk.com domain (the "Site") which is owned by BrightTALK. For the purposes of this Privacy Policy, BrightTALK means collectively BrightTALK Inc and BrightTALK Ltd and from time to time any subsidiary corporations, successors and assigns. Personal information is information from which you can be personally identified, such as your name, address, email address, or telephone number, and demographic or other information about you when such information is tied to personally identifiable information. Personal information does not include "aggregate" information, which is data we collect about the use of the Site or about a group or category of products, services or users, from which individual identities or other personal information has been removed. It is important that you read and understand this Privacy Policy ("Policy"). You must accept all the terms and conditions of this Policy and the User Agreement before accessing any service provided on, through or by the Site ("Services"). If you do not accept the terms and conditions of this Policy, then you cannot access the Services.</p>
<p>BrightTALK may update this Policy at any time. In the event there are material changes in the way we treat your personal information, we will notify you by email. Unless stated otherwise, our current Policy applies to all personal information that we have about you and your account. This policy in no way restricts or limits our collection and use of aggregate information.</p>
<p>Minors under the age of eighteen years old are not eligible to use the Site and we therefore ask that minors do not submit any personal information to us or use any of the services provided on, through or by the Site (the "Services").</p>
<p>If you have questions or concerns regarding this Policy, please contact BrightTALK at the address below.</p>
<h4>2. PRIVACY RIGHTS FOR CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS</h4>
<p>Under California law, customers who are California residents are entitled to annually request and obtain information about the personal information we shared, if any, with other businesses for their own direct marketing. If applicable, the information would include the categories of personal information and the names and addresses of those businesses with which we shared personal information for the immediately prior calendar year.

<h4>5. USE AND SHARING OF INFORMATION</h4>
<p class="p1">5.1 BrightTALK’s Use of Information</p>
<p class="p1">BrightTALK collects and uses your personal, profile and activity information (together referred to as "Profile Information") as described in this Policy, to operate and improve its services, to carry out the transactions you request, to provide you with information you request or to inform you about other information, events, promotions, products or services we think will be of interest to you, to facilitate your use, and our administration, of the Site, and for the purpose for which the information was provided. These uses may include making our services easier to use by eliminating the need for you to enter the same information repeatedly, for research and analysis to improve our services and technologies, to display customised content and advertising, to contact you in connection with your enquiries, surveys, your Account or to deliver promotional material, and to provide anonymous reporting to BrightTALK Content Owners.</p>
<p class="p1">BrightTALK may store and process personal information collected on the Site or other BrightTALK Web sites in locations in which BrightTALK or its affiliates, subsidiaries or agents maintain facilities, and by using a BrightTALK service, you consent to any such transfer, if necessary to provide our services, of your information outside your country and the European Economic Area.</p>
<p class="p1">5.2 Sharing of Information</p>
<p class="p1">BrightTALK does not share or sell your Profile Information with third parties or non-affiliated companies except to provide the products or services you have requested, when we have your permission, or under the following circumstances:</p>
<p></p>
<p class="p2">When you attend or view content in a Channel, you will automatically be subscribed to that Channel (a "Subscription"). &nbsp;When you attend or view a Channel, Summit, a webinar, a video or other content, BrightTALK may share your Profile Information including your email address and telephone number (as well as details and viewing times of the content you have viewed on that Channel, Summit, webinar, video or other content) with that Channel Owner or with the Sponsor of that Summit or webinar or owner of the content viewed (each a "Content Owner"). For the purposes of this Policy, "Summit" means a collection of various webinars on a particular topic that may include webinars from more than one Channel, and "Sponsor" means someone who sponsors a BrightTALK Summit or webinar or other content in exchange for brand promotion, thought leadership opportunities, and the leads generated from the Summit or webinar audience where applicable. In attending or viewing a Channel, Summit, webinar, video or other content, you consent to our sharing your Profile Information with the Content Owner who may use such information to provide you with marketing messages, and we encourage you to review the Content Owner"s own Privacy Policy to ensure you are satisfied with the provisions. BrightTALK does not control or limit, and we are not responsible for, the activities of Content Owners in the use, control and protection of personal information. We may provide your Profile Information including your email address and telephone number to our subsidiaries, affiliated companies or other trusted businesses or persons for the purpose of processing Profile Information on our behalf. These parties are required to process such information based on our instructions and in accordance with this Policy. They do not have any independent right to share this information. We may share your personal information with a credit checking company or with a credit card processing company to bill users for our services. These third parties do not retain, share, or store any personally identifiable information except to provide these services and are bound by strict confidentiality requirements which limit their use of such information. We may disclose such personal information to satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process or enforceable government request, to enforce our User Agreement and investigate violations thereof, to prevent, detect and address fraud, security or technical issues, or to protect against harm to the rights and property of BrightTALK and its users as required or permitted by law. We may disclose or transfer your Profile Information if BrightTALK is acquired by or merged with another company or in the event of a sale of company assets, financing or acquisition or in any other situation where personal information may be transferred as one of the business assets of BrightTALK. We will provide notice before this occurs and will post a new Privacy Policy if necessary. Sharing your Profile Information in the circumstances described above may involve your personal information being transferred outside your country and the EEA and in accepting this Policy and using the Services you consent to any such transfer.</p>

You can close your account in accordance with our User Agreement. If you close your account, we may retain your personal information but only for the purposes of preventing fraud or future abuse, enforcing our User Agreement, protecting against harm to the rights and property of BrightTALK and its users, and if required or permitted by law. All retained information will continue to be subject to the terms of this Policy. You have a right under the Act to access information held about you, subject to an administrative fee to meet our reasonable costs.
