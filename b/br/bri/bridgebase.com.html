</p><h4>Bridge Base Online Privacy Statement</h4>
<i>(last updated: Sep 2014)</i>
<p>
Bridge Base Online ("BBO") is committed to protecting your privacy. This privacy statement applies to the data collected by BBO through the Bridge Base Online web pages  and the original BBO program (collectively, the Site); it does not apply to data collected through other online or offline BBO sites, products or services.

</p><h4>Collection of your personal information</h4>
We will ask you when we need information that personally identifies you or allows us to contact you.
<br>
<br>
<div style="background-color:yellow;">We will ask you for your username, password, and a valid email address during the registration process.</div>
<br>
<div style="background-color:yellow;">You need not enter your real name in the registration form or your profile. The public portion of your profile (Name, country, skill level, other information) will be visible to every other member of the site.
</div>
<p>
If you choose to engage in commerce on our site, we may ask you for your real name, address, telephone number, and credit card details. You can opt to have us remember your name, address, and telephone number and credit card expiration date as a convenience for you.  We will not store your credit card number or credit card security code.
</p><p>
From time to time we may request demographic information.
</p><p>
If you choose to play in tournaments sponsored by a National Bridge Organization ( "NBO" -- for example, the ACBL ) we  will ask you for your player number in that NBO to allow us to report your results. 
</p><p>
We record visitor IP addresses, usernames, and many details of site activity. 
</p><p>
We may record all chat, including private chat between usernames.
</p><p>
We record hands played on the site. This information is made publicly available.

</p><h4>Use of Your Personal Information</h4>
The personal information collected will be used to operate the Site and to provide the service(s) or carry out the transaction(s) you have requested or authorized. 
<p>
In support of these uses, BBO may use personal information to provide you with more effective customer service, to improve the Site and any related BBO products or services, and to make the Site easier to use by eliminating the need for you to repeatedly enter the same information or by customizing the Site to your particular preference or interests. 
</p><p>
We may use your personal information to provide you with important information about the product or service that you are using, including critical updates and notifications
</p><p>
We may use your personal information to provide you with information about products or services you may be interested in.
</p><p>
Personal information collected on the Site may be stored and processed in the United States or any other country in which BBO or its affiliates, subsidiaries or agents maintain facilities, and by using the Site, you consent to any such transfer of information outside of your country. 

</p><h4>Sharing of Your Personal Information</h4>
BBO may disclose personal information if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to (a) conform to the edicts of the law or comply with legal process served on BBO or the Site; (b) protect and defend the rights or property of BBO and our family of Web sites; or (c) act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of BBO products or members of the public. 
<p>
<span style="background-color:yellow;"> BBO may also disclose your personal information to cooperate with our partners in abuse-related investigations.</span> For instance: ACBL requires that BBO report the names of players who have been banned from ACBL games.
</p><p>
Personally identifiable demographic information will not be shared except as specified above. From time to time, we may publish summaries of our demographic data.

</p><h4>Control of Your Personal Information</h4>
Except as otherwise described in this statement, personal information you provide on the Site will not be shared outside of BBO and its controlled subsidiaries and affiliates without your permission. 
<p>
Please be aware that this privacy statement and any choices you make on the Site will not necessarily apply to personal information you may have provided to BBO in the context of other, separately operated, BBO products or services.

</p><h4>Security of Your Personal Information</h4>
BBO is committed to protecting the security of your personal information. We use a variety of security technologies and procedures to help protect your personal information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. For example, we store the personal information you provide on computer servers with limited access that are located in controlled facilities. Additionally, when we transmit sensitive personal information (such as a credit card number) over the Internet, we protect it through the use of encryption, such as the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol. 
<p>
</p><div style="background-color:yellow;"> The public portion of your profile (Name, email, country, skill level, other information) will be visible to every other member of the site. 
</div>

We sometimes use your local storage ( typically, your hard drive ) to store your preferences (for example: screen size, screen position ).
