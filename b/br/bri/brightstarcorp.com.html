	If You Only Visit: If you do nothing during your visit to this Site but browse or download information, we automatically collect and store the following information about your visit:<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp; The Internet Protocol Address and domain name used, but not the e-mail address.<br>

	Distribution List: The Site will offer you the option of adding your name and e-mail address to a distribution list for information on new products and services, special offers and other marketing opportunities. We will not add your name and e-mail address to such a list unless you affirmatively permit us to do so, that is, you have “opted-in.” You may also remove your name and e-mail address from a distribution list at any time by using the “unsubscribe” technique found in the e-mail message, that is, you may “opt-out” at any time. We will act on your opt-out promptly, but it may not be effective immediately die to normal processing delays.</p>
<p>
	5. Sharing with Third Parties<br>
	Except as outlined below in this Statement, we never provide your personal information to third parties without your consent.<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp; We may provide personal information from a customer to a third party, including a Seller, as necessary to process that customer’s request or order or otherwise service a customer’s account.<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp; We reserve the right to disclose or report personal information in limited circumstances where we believe in good faith that disclosure is required under law, to cooperate with regulators or law enforcement authorities, and to protect our rights or property. This may include the exchange of information with other organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction.<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp; We reserve the right to use your e-mail or other address to send you important information relating to your account.<br>
	The Site may also contain optional surveys and questionnaires asking for information, as well as several opportunities for visitors to ask questions. We use the information you provide to help us design and build better products, to customize your shopping experience, and to provide advice and purchase recommendations. Taking part in any of these segments is always optional. We do not share the names and e-mail addresses of recipients of our distribution list or the results of our surveys and questionnaires with third parties, including Sellers.<br>
	We do research on our users’ demographics, interests, and behavior based on the information provided to us when making a purchase, from surveys and from our server log files. We do this to better understand and serve our Users. This research is compiled and analyzed on an aggregated basis so as to prevent identification of personal information relating to any one individual. We may share this aggregated data with our Sellers and other business partners. In addition, we will share aggregated data with our Sellers in order to collect funds owed to us by the Sellers and in order to administer our relationships with those Sellers.<br>

	6. Cookies<br>
	When you come into our Site, our server attaches a small text file to your hard drive — a cookie. A “ cookie” assigns you a unique identifier so that we can recognized you each time you re-enter our Site, so we can recall where you’ve previously been on our site, and which keeps track of the pages you view on our Site. Cookies help us deliver a better Site experience to our users.<br>
	This information collected by using a cookie is sometimes called “clickstream.” We use this information to understand how our users navigate our Site, and to determine common traffic patterns, including what site the user came from. We may use this information to make site navigation and product recommendations, and to help redesign our Site in order to make your experience on our Site more efficient and enjoyable. We may also use this information to better personalize the content, banner ads, and promotions that you and other users will see.<br>
	You also have choices with respect to cookies. By modifying your browser preferences, you have the choice to accept all cookies, to be notified when a cookie is set, or to reject all cookies. If you choose to reject all cookies you will be unable to use those services or engage in activities that require the placement of cookies. Certain aspects of the Site may not function properly if you set your browser to reject all cookies.</p>
<p>
	7. Security<br>
	This Site uses Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption technology. The SSL protocol provides server authentication, data integrity, and privacy on the Web. SSL encrypts your personal and financial information as it is being transmitted, including credit card information, and also verifies the identity of the server and that the original message arrives at its destination.<br>
	No data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your personal information, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us or from this Site, and therefore you use this Site at your own risk. Once we receive your transmission, we use our best effort to ensure its security on our systems. We also cannot be responsible for criminal acts of third parties, such as “hackers,” who may seek to compromise our security measures through unlawful means. Industry-accepted security measures have been integrated into the design, implementation, and day-to-day operation of the Site.</p>

	With respect to European Employee Data, Brightstar and/or its affiliates provide covered employees in the EU with information regarding the data transfers that are covered by Safe Harbor via separate policies and procedures.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
	Individuals identified in European Customer Representative Data and European Employee Data may contact Brightstar’s Safe Harbor Privacy Contact identified below with questions and/or to review EU Personal Data that Brightstar holds about them.&nbsp; Employees may also contact their local human resources manager with any questions or concerns.&nbsp; Any such covered individual who cannot resolve his/her question directly with Brightstar or its affiliate can contact the local data protection authority for further information and assistance.<br>
