                         <b>Automatically Collected Information.</b><br>
                         We may use automatic methods such as cookies (small amounts of data, which often includes an anonymous unique identifier that is sent to your browser from a Website's computers and stored on your computer's hard drive) to understand Website trends, deliver a more personalized experience and to improve our content and offerings. Examples of the information we may collect and analyze using these methods include, the Internet protocol (IP) address used to connect your computer to the Internet; e-mail address; type and version, operating system, and platform; purchase history, which we may aggregate with similar information from other customers; the full Uniform Resource Locator (URL) clickstream to, on, and from our Website, including date and time; and cookie information. We may also use software tools to measure and collect session information, including page response times, download errors, length of visits to certain pages, page interaction information (such as scrolling, clicks, and mouse-overs), and methods used to browse away from the page.</p>
                         
                         <p>If you do not want information collected through the use of cookies, there is a simple procedure in most browsers that allows the user to accept or reject cookies.

                            As required by law, we are notifying our customers of their right to
privacy, our complaint procedure, billing procedure, refund policy, converter/
TV compatibility and subscriber service procedure.

                             <b>Privacy Notice</b><br>

The notice is being provided in accordance with the Cable Television Consumer
Protection and Competition Act of 1992, a Federal law which requires all cable operators to notify subscribers
of the collection, use and disclosure of personally identifiable information regarding cable
subscribers.<br><br>
Blue Ridge Communications collects and maintains certain information, concerning individual subscribers,
which is necessary to provide cable television service to our subscribers and to detect unauthorized
reception of our service. Such information includes billing records, service maintenance and
repair records, premium service subscription, marketing and research survey information and subscriber
complaints.<br><br>
We do not maintain this information any longer than is necessary for our business purposes.
Information such as credit references, previous address, social security and driver license numbers
are maintained, for purpose of identity regarding the applicants for our services, for a period of five
(5) years. After such time, if the purpose for which such information was collected has been accomplished,
Blue Ridge Communications will destroy the information.<br><br>
As a subscriber, you may review (and correct if necessary) any personal information held by us that
pertains to you. These records are available at the local Blue Ridge Communications office, serving
you, during the hours of 9 AM to 5 PM, Monday through Friday.<br><br>
We request that you contact us beforehand by telephone or letter so that we may locate the information
and set up an appointment for your review.<br><br>
Blue Ridge Communications may from time-to-time make your personal information available to our
sales agents, research consultants, our accountants, programming services, representatives of franchising
authorities, and collection agencies for the purpose of collecting money owed by a subscriber.
Names and addresses of Blue Ridge Communications subscribers are provided to Program Guide
distributors for the purpose of mailing; please notify our office by telephone or letter if you do not want
to be included on the list.<br><br>
Any person, who feels aggrieved by an action of Blue Ridge Communications in violation of Section
631 of the Cable Television Consumer Protection and Competition Act of 1992, may bring a civil
action in a United States District Court.
The Cable Act restricts the collection of subscriber information and the disclosure of personally
identifiable information.<br><br>
If Blue Ridge Communications is served with a court order requiring disclosure of personally identifiable
information concerning a subscriber, we will inform the subscriber before any such information
is released. Under some circumstances, a governmental entity may seek a court order to obtain personally
identifiable subscriber information from a cable system concerning one of its subscribers. The
subscriber would then be given an opportunity to contest issuance of such an order.<br><br>
In emergency situations, 911 Response Centers may contact us for directions to a subscriber's
home. We will release this information unless you contact us in advance.

We will periodically email you information from Blue Ridge and Blue Ridge marketing partners. To

                             </p><ol>
                               <li>Standard installations will be performed within seven business days after an order has been
placed. (“Standard means any installation located within 125 feet of existing distribution system.”)</li>

                               <li>Installations and other installation related activities will be scheduled within a four hour time period

                             <b>Refund Policy</b><br>
                             When you terminate cable service with us, depending on what day of the month you terminate, you
may receive a credit for those days of service which you prepaid and did not use the service.
<br>If the amount of the refund is $1.99 or less, it is our policy not to refund this amount to you due to
the cost of processing. Amounts of $2.00 or greater will be automatically sent to you at the last
address indicated on your bill. If you want the check sent to a new address, you must notify your local
office.
                           </p>
                           <p>
                             <b>Consumer Education</b><br>
                             
                             Some older TV sets and VCRs do not have enough channel capacity to provide all of the channels
we make available. A converter may be necessary to view these channels. The converter does not
need to have descrambling capabilities. When using any cable converter you may not be able to benefit
from some of the special functions of your TV set and VCR. For example: to view one channel
while recording another; to watch and record two different TV shows at the same time; to use
advanced picture generation and display features such as “picture in picture.” Converters are available
from local retailers or directly from Blue Ridge Communications.<br>
If Blue Ridge Communications has provided you with a remote control for use with a converter or
other device, please be advised that compatible remote controls are available from retail outlets.
Many remotes designated as “universal remotes” will operate the converter boxes. You may contact
your local Blue Ridge Communications office for advice prior to purchasing a remote control.
