            Brandscreen only processes personal information for the purposes described in this
            Privacy Policy and/or the supplementary privacy notices for specific services. In

        <ul>
            <li>Providing our services, including the display of customized content and advertising;</li>
            <li>Auditing, research and analysis in order to maintain, protect and improve our services;

        <p>
            Brandscreen processes personal information on our servers in the United States of
            America and in other countries. In some cases, we process personal information on
            a server outside your own country. We may process personal information to provide

            and according to the instructions of a third party, such as our advertising partners.</p>
        <h2>
            Choices for personal information</h2>
        <p>
            When you sign up for a particular service that requires registration, we ask you
            to provide personal information. If we use this information in a manner different
            than the purpose for which it was collected, then we will ask for your consent prior
            to such use.</p>
        <p>
            If we propose to use personal information for any purposes other than those described
            in this Privacy Policy and/or in the specific service privacy notices, we will offer
            you an effective way to opt out of the use of personal information for those other
            purposes. We will not collect or use sensitive information for purposes other than
            those described in this Privacy Policy and/or in the supplementary service privacy
            notices, unless we have obtained your prior consent.
        </p>
        <p>
            Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies, but you can reset your browser
            to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some
            Brandscreen features and services may not function properly if your cookies are
            disabled.
        </p>
        <p>
            You can decline to submit personal information to any of our services, in which
            case Brandscreen may not be able to provide those services to you.

            Information sharing</h2>
        <p>
            Brandscreen only shares personal information with other companies or individuals
            outside of Brandscreen in the following limited circumstances:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>We have your consent. We require opt-in consent for the sharing of any sensitive
                personal information. </li>
            <li>We provide such information to our subsidiaries, affiliated companies or other trusted
                businesses or persons for the purpose of processing personal information on our
                behalf. We require that these parties agree to process such information based on
                our instructions and in compliance with this Privacy Policy and any other appropriate
                confidentiality and security measures. </li>
            <li>We have a good faith belief that access, use, preservation or disclosure of such
                information is reasonably necessary to (a) satisfy any applicable law, regulation,
                legal process or enforceable governmental request, (b) enforce applicable Terms
                of Service, including investigation of potential violations thereof, (c) detect,
                prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues, or (d) protect
                against harm to the rights, property or safety of Brandscreen, its users or the
                public as required or permitted by law. </li>
            <li>If Brandscreen becomes involved in a merger, acquisition, or any form of sale of
                some or all of its assets, we will ensure the confidentiality of any personal information
                involved in such transactions and provide notice before personal information is
                transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy. </li>
            <li>We may share with third parties certain pieces of aggregated, non-personal information,
                such as the number of users who searched for a particular term, for example, or
                how many users clicked on a particular advertisement. Such information does not
                identify you individually.</li>

            Please contact us at the address below for any additional questions about the management
            or use of personal data.</p>
        <h2>
            Information security</h2>
        <p>
            We take appropriate security measures to protect against unauthorized access to
            or unauthorized alteration, disclosure or destruction of data. These include internal
            reviews of our data collection, storage and processing practices and security measures,
            as well as physical security measures to guard against unauthorized access to systems
            where we store personal data.
        </p>
        <p>
            We restrict access to personal information to Brandscreen employees, contractors
            and agents who need to know that information in order to operate, develop or improve
            our services. These individuals are bound by confidentiality obligations and may
            be subject to discipline, including termination and criminal prosecution, if they
            fail to meet these obligations.
        </p>
        <h2>
            Data integrity</h2>
        <p>
            Brandscreen processes personal information only for the purposes for which it was
            collected and in accordance with this Privacy Policy or any applicable service-specific
            privacy notice. We review our data collection, storage and processing practices
            to ensure that we only collect, store and process the personal information needed
            to provide or improve our services or as otherwise permitted under this Policy.
            We take reasonable steps to ensure that the personal information we process is accurate,
            complete, and current, but we depend on our users to update or correct their personal
            information whenever necessary.
        </p>
        <h2>
            Accessing and updating personal information</h2>
        <p>
            When you use Brandscreen services, we make good faith efforts to provide you with
            access to your personal information and either to correct this data if it is inaccurate
            or to delete such data at your request if it is not otherwise required to be retained
            by law or for legitimate business purposes. We ask individual users to identify
            themselves and the information requested to be accessed, corrected or removed before
            processing such requests, and we may decline to process requests that are unreasonably
            repetitive or systematic, require disproportionate technical effort, jeopardize
            the privacy of others, or would be extremely impractical (for instance, requests
            concerning information residing on backup tapes), or for which access is not otherwise
            required. In any case where we provide information access and correction, we perform
            this service free of charge, except if doing so would require a disproportionate
            effort. Some of our services have different procedures to access, correct or delete
            users’ personal information. We provide the details for these procedures in the
            specific privacy notices or FAQs for these services.
