		 <b>Solid</b> statement
<p>
Brabantia believes in protecting any personal information you share with us. We will respect either your permission to use that information or your demand not to use it. The choice will always be up to you.
We also believe it is important to explain to you how we will use your information and why you should share information with us. That is why we developed this privacy statement. It tells you exactly what we will or will not do. It represents what we believe in and states what we commit ourselves to.
<br>
<br>
<b>Why should you share information with Brabantia?</b><br>
Sharing your personal information enables us to match our products to your wishes more closely. It tells us how you feel about us, about our products, about our services. It might also offer you a number of benefits now and in the future. Some of the current examples of these benefits are the fact that:
</p><li> you can register your purchases, entitling you to the benefits involved with it;</li>
<li> it will be possible for you to request information specific to your interests;</li>
<li> you are entitled to all our services;</li>
<br>
<br>
<b>How do you share information with Brabantia?</b><br>
You may choose to share your information with us by completing the online registration, by sending an information request, by entering a contest, by registering a purchase with the inserted reply card, by participating in a promotion, by subscribing to a newsletter or by communicating with a customer service representative. Registration of your information always involves filling in a form.

<br>
<b>You're in control!</b><br>
We want to know you better so we can provide you with better products and services. However, the choice of whether you want this kind of service is up to you. Sharing information with Brabantia is never a must. To assure that you are always in control of your own data, we commit ourselves to the following 'rules':
<br>
<br>
<li> We will only collect, use or share your personal information if you give us explicit permission to do so.</li>
