<br><br>
<p>This document explains BrainMass Inc.’s (“BrainMass.com”) policies for the collection, use and disclosure of personal information.</p> 
<p>This policy forms part of, and should be read in conjunction with, our Terms and Conditions and Legal Disclaimer.</p>  
<p>BrainMass.com believes that privacy is crucial for the ongoing success of Internet commerce. Our status as an Online Solution Service 
requires us to have a stringent policy regarding all of the information that we collect.</p>
<p>Your use of this site or BrainMass.com’s services constitutes acceptance of these terms and conditions. If you do not agree with these 
policies, please cease using this site immediately.</p>
<p>BrainMass.com takes reasonable precautions to ensure your privacy on the terms contained in this policy. BrainMass.com uses reasonable 
efforts to, but cannot totally prevent, unintended disclosures by such means as hackers and other unauthorized individuals, and inadvertent 
or illicit employee actions.</p>
<p class="bold">What This Covers:</p>
<p>Privacy Information covers BrainMass.com's treatment of nonpublic personal information that we collect in connection with providing 
you with BrainMass.com services (such as BrainMass.com Online Teaching Assistant Account and Access, BrainMass.com Post-a-Problem, 
BrainMass.com Submit-an-Essay, BrainMass.com Solution Bank and BrainMass.com Advertising Services).</p> 
<p>If you are a former user of a BrainMass.com service, we will continue to treat the nonpublic personal information we collected from you in 
connection with our services as described here.</p>
<p>We use information collected from the Online Teaching Assistant to send the Online Teaching Assistant information about BrainMass.com, to 
contact the Online Teaching Assistant for various reasons, and for internal accounting and other procedures. Information is used to check 
the Online Teaching Assistant’s eligibility and to obtain and verify qualifications in regard to the application, and to support the 
ongoing provision of service. It is also used for login validation purposes.</p>
<p>We use information collected from the student-user to send the student information regarding the service requested and to support the 
on-going provision of service.</p> 
<p class="bold">Information Automatically Collected:</p> 
<p>Our Web site keeps track of usage data, such as the source address that a page request is coming from, your IP address or domain name, 
the date and time of the page request, the referring Web site (if any) and other parameters in the URL. This is collected in order to better 
understand Web site usage in the aggregate so that we know what areas of our Web site users prefer. Automatically collected information is 
also used for the same purposes as Online Teaching Assistant and student-supplied information.</p> 
<p class="bold">Information Sharing and Disclosure:</p>
<p>BrainMass.com will not sell or rent your nonpublic personal information to anyone.</p>

	<li>We need to share the information to provide the product or service you have requested;</li>
	<li>We respond to subpoenas, court orders or legal process.</li>
</ul>
<p>Except for the above parties, and for use by BrainMass.com’s consultants and professional advisers on BrainMass.com’s behalf for the uses 
disclosed herein, BrainMass.com does not share personal information with any other third parties. BrainMass.com may, however, provide to 
third parties aggregate or statistical information that does not disclose personally identifiable information.</p>
<p>BrainMass.com may display targeted advertisements of interest or benefit to you based on nonpublic personal information. If you respond 
to these advertisements and then give the advertiser personal information about yourself, you may reveal to the advertiser or ad server that 
you possess the characteristics used to select the audience for the advertisement.</p>
<ul>
	<li>BrainMass.com does not share any personally identifiable information about you with any third parties when you click on these ads.</li>
	<li>BrainMass.com advertisers may include financial service providers (such as mortgage bankers, securities broker-dealers, and insurance agents) 
	and non-financial companies (such as retailers, airlines, and publishers).</li>
</ul>
<p>If you do not wish to disclose information about yourself to advertisers, you may choose to communicate with the advertiser directly in a 
manner that does not disclose that you viewed the BrainMass.com advertisement.</p>
<p class="bold">Confidentiality and Security:</p>
<p>We restrict access to your nonpublic personal information to those employees who reasonably need to come into contact with that information 
to provide services to you.</p> 
<p>We maintain physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards that comply with federal regulations to guard your nonpublic personal 
information.</p>
