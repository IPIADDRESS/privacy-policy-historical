<p> BrainTrack has established the following privacy policy: </p>

<ul>

<li> <strong>Personal Information — </strong>BrainTrack does not store or retain any personally identifiable information about its users except when users subscribe to BrainTrack's email list or apply for a scholarship. Email subscribers are asked for an email address so that they can receive periodic newsletters and other updates about BrainTrack. Scholarship entrants provide contact information that is used only for the purposes of BrainTrack's scholarships and not for any internal or third-party marketing purposes. If you no longer wish to receive our newsletter, you may opt-out of receiving them by following the instructions included in each newsletter or by emailing us at info@braintrack.com. 
 </li>

 <li> <strong>Sharing of Personal Information — </strong>We will share your personal information with third parties only in ways that are described in this privacy policy.  We may disclose your personal information as required by law, such as to comply with a subpoena, or similar legal process; </li>

	 <ul>

		<li> When we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud, or respond to a government request;
		 </li>

		 <li> We may provide your personal information to companies that provide services to help us with our business activities such as an email service provider to send out emails on our behalf, to our partners to fulfill your requests or to a third party who offers customer service.  These third parties are authorized to use your personal information only as necessary to provide these services to us; </li>

		<li> If we are involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of our assets, you will be notified via prominent notice on our Web site of any change in ownership or uses of your personal information, as well as any choices you may have regarding your personal information.  </li>

	</ul>

	<li> <strong>School Information and Other Request Forms — </strong>Any information provided by users in an information request form is sent directly to a partner's website for the purpose of providing information to the site visitor, such as when a user completes a form to request information from a college.  </li>

	<li> <strong>Partner Policies — </strong>BrainTrack's partners, such as those that collect school information requests through iframed pages on BrainTrack, maintain their own privacy policies that users should review before continuing to provide information on their sites. </li>

	<li> <strong>Log Files — </strong>BrainTrack maintains standard website log files. This information is for understanding traffic patterns to the website and contains no personally identifiable information. </li>

	<li> <strong>Third-party Cookies — </strong>The use of third party cookies is not covered by our privacy policy.  We do not have access or control over these cookies.  </li>

	<li> <strong>Clear Gifs (Web Beacons) — </strong>Our third party tracking utility partner employs a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a web beacons), that help us better manage content on our site by informing us what content is effective.  Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users.  In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on Web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence.  We do not tie the information gathered by clear gifs to our customers’ personal information.  </li>

	<li> <strong>Analytics — </strong>BrainTrack uses third-party analytical packages to help gather statistical and other information about traffic to the site. This information is collected to improve our website, make it more user-friendly and monitor that it is performing correctly. These tools set cookies to perform session tracking to determine when a user moves from one page to another. In some cases an analytics service may record mouse clicks, mouse movements, scrolling activity as well as any text a user types in this website, except text in password fields. The packages do not track browsing habits across other web sites or text inputted in password fields. No personal information is being tracked through these Analytics. </li>

	<li> <strong>Third-Party Advertising — </strong>BrainTrack uses third-party advertising companies to serve ads to site visitors. These companies may use information (not including your name, address, email address, or telephone number) about visits to this and other web sites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services that may be of interest. They may set and retrieve cookies to achieve this. A full list of companies that may be involved in displaying ads on BrainTrack can be found <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.google.com/adsense/support/bin/answer.py?answer=94149" target="_blank">here</a>. Visitors can contact these companies for further details. </li>

This privacy policy applies only to the information collected by this Web site. </li>

	<li> <strong>Site Terms and Conditions — </strong>Please see our <a href="/conditions.htm">Terms and Conditions</a> section establishing the use, disclaimers, and limitations of liability governing the use of our website. </li>
