	<li><strong>Information you publish to Brainshark blogs or public portals</strong> – Brainshark’s Websites include public blogs, portals, and elements of the Brainshark’s free Website, myBrainshark™, that allow Visitors to submit and publish comments.</li>
	<li><strong>Billing information</strong> – For certain editions of our Services that are purchased using a credit card, Brainshark requires you to provide billing information, such as your billing name and address, and your credit card number.</li>
	<li><strong>Information you provide to Customers</strong> – A capability of the Services allows Customers to request registration information from viewers of their video presentation content. For example, the myBrainshark site includes presentations created by many Customers, and some include a Guest Book registration form. Brainshark is not responsible for the information practices of its Customers, and does not access this information except with Customer's permission to provide Support and assistance.</li>
</ul>

<h3>3. Use of Information Collected</h3>

<p>Brainshark uses data about Visitors and Customers to perform the following actions:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>To respond to your request</strong> - such as to create a Brainshark account, provide login information for a webinar for which you have registered or provide technical support.</li>
	<li><strong>For marketing purposes</strong> - Brainshark may use information you provide to contact you to further discuss your interest in the Services and to send you information regarding Brainshark or its Services.</li>
	<li><strong>To improve Brainshark’s Websites and products</strong> - Brainshark may use Website Navigational Information to provide Visitors and Customers with relevant content and in the aggregate to identify trends and usage patterns.</li>
	<li><strong>To deliver messages that help you use the Service</strong> – As part of helping its Customers use the Service effectively, Brainshark communicates with its Customers about new features and product releases, best practices, scheduled site maintenance notifications, customer events, and more. To increase the relevancy of this information, this may be customized to your designated user role within the application (for example: administrator, author), products or editions you have specifically licensed, or your usage of the application.</li>
	<li><strong>To process your payment</strong> - Brainshark uses credit card information solely to process payment for Services for which the Customer has provided that information. Brainshark utilizes a third party payment service to process credit card payments. When you provide credit card information on the Site, that information is sent directly to the third party payment service. Brainshark does not have access to your full credit card number and does not store such information in its own systems. Information transmitted to the third party payment service is encrypted using SSL software. The third party payment service is required to comply with all applicable privacy and security laws and the rules and regulations issued by the credit card companies. Brainshark is not responsible for the third party payment service’s failure to comply with such laws, rules and/or regulations.</li>
	<li><strong>To deliver the features of the Service</strong> – Customers use the Service to Create, Share, and Track online and mobile video presentations. As part of the Sharing features, Customers and Viewers may provide the email of the person to Share the content with, and this information is used only to perform the Share function. Tracking information includes the date and time that a presentation was viewed, IP address and location, what portion(s) of the content were viewed and in what order, and responses to interactive questions or surveys. Individual information may be associated with this tracking information, either through information you provide to the Customer or by a unique identifier that the Customer has associated with an individual and has passed to a personalized presentation URL. Reporting and Notification features enable Customers to receive tracking information via emailed reports or to pass data to their other systems. Brainshark does not use or access individual information collected by its Customers in their use of the Services except with permission in providing Support and assistance. Brainshark does not sell this information.</li>
</ul>

<h3>4. Sharing of Information Collected</h3>

<p>We will share your personal information with third parties only in the ways that are described in this privacy statement.</p>

<p>Unless described in this Privacy Policy, Brainshark does not share, sell, rent, or trade any information collected through its Website or Services with third parties for their promotional purposes.</p>

<p>Brainshark occasionally partners with third parties who co-sponsor events with Brainshark (such as webinars and other live events). In these cases, both parties may share Personal Information that you provide when registering for the co-sponsored event to allow them to contact you regarding products, programs, services and promotions that they believe may be of interest to you.
