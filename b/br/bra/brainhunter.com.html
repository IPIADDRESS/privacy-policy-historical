    resume and skills (your "information") </font></small></p>
    <p><strong><small><font face="Verdana">Disclosure to Employers</font></small></strong></p>
    <p><small><font face="Verdana">Your contact information (name, address, phone number, etc)

    allowing yourself to be submitted to a job (a process you control fully) or by applying
    directly to a job.</font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Verdana">By default, your resume IS VIEWABLE by recruiters if they
    do a manual search of our database. But this viewable resume DOES NOT contain any contact
    information such as your name, address, phone, number, email, etc.</font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Verdana">You can BLOCK COMPANIES from being able to see ANY
    information including your resume in a manual search. If you select this option, employers
    will only see your name and resume once you agree to be submitted to a job, or apply
    directly. More info on this is available in our HELP screens. </font></small></p>
    <p><strong><small><font face="Verdana">Disclosure to Non-Employers</font></small></strong></p>

    described above, including personal information, resume information, email addresses,
    information about your visits to the site, etc. We may disclose statistical information
    gathered as a whole (eg. Total number of job-seekers, total number of IT job seekers), but
    never disclosure information on an individual basis. </font></small></p>

    information is available to job seekers to increase their knowledge of your firm. We do
    NOT disclose any contact information, or individual user information.</font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Verdana">You have the option of posting "Confidential"
    jobs, where no company information will be shown on the site, and will only be disclosed
    on a personal basis to each pre-screened, interested candidate. More information on these
    features is available in our HELP screens. </font></small></p>
    <p><strong><small><font face="Verdana">Opt-Out and Modification</font></small></strong></p>
    <p><small><font face="Verdana">Both Job Seekers and Employers have the ability to OPT-OUT
    and delete their information permanently from the system. Both Job Seekers and Employers
    have full control over their information and can modify at any time. </font></small></p>
