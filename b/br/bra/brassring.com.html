      <h4>I. Introduction</h4><p>
      The following sets forth BrassRing LLC's privacy policy, which contains 
      four separate sections as follows:
      
  

</p><p>
  
    </p><ol>
      <li style="list-style: upper-roman;"> This Introduction; </li>
      <li style="list-style: upper-roman;">BrassRing Online Privacy Policy, which addresses the privacy practices

      <li style="list-style: upper-roman;">BrassRing's ASP Privacy Policy, which addresses the privacy practices 
        applicable to information processed by BrassRing in its role as an ASP

      <li style="list-style: upper-roman;">A General Section, which applies to all of our privacy policies. <p></p> 
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>BrassRing respects individual privacy. BrassRing strives to collect and 
      use personal information in a manner consistent with the laws of the countries 
      in which it does business. BrassRing abides by the Safe Harbor Principles 
      developed by the U.S. Department of Commerce and the European Commission.
    </p><p> BrassRing LLC is a licensee of the TRUSTe Privacy Program and the TRUSTe 
      EU Safe Harbor Program. TRUSTe is an independent, non-profit organization 
      whose mission is to enable individuals and organizations to establish trusting 
      relationships based on respect for personal identity and information by 
      promoting the use of fair information practices. Because we want to demonstrate 
      our commitment to our users' privacy, we have agreed to disclose our privacy 
      practices and have them reviewed for compliance by TRUSTe. 
    </p><h4> II. BRASSRING ONLINE PRIVACY POLICY</h4>
    <p> This Online Privacy Policy covers use of the site www.brassring.com and

      you disclose to us on this web site on our on-line URC site is subject to 
      our Online Privacy Policy. Information you disclose on the BrassRing job 
      board portion of the site powered by Career Builder is covered by the Career 
      Builder privacy statement linked to that page.</p>
    <p> With respect to data received through its websites, BrassRing will, at 
      its own discretion:</p>
    <ol>
      <li> Use personal information it obtains 
        relating to you, including but not limited to your name, mailing address, 
        phone number and email address, for the purposes of contacting you, conducting 
        internal business research, and carrying out other marketing activities. 
        We may also disclose such information to third parties when they provide 
        a service on our behalf. These third parties are not permitted to use 
        such information for their own purposes. BrassRing does not share, sell, 
        trade, or rent your personal information to third parties for unknown 
        reasons.</li>
      <li> From time to time send our visitors and/or clients e-mail messages 
        with new site feature announcements, enhancements, maintenance information 
        and general updates. We provide you the opportunity to ‘opt-out’ 
        of having your personally identifiable information used for certain purposes, 
        when we ask for this information. For example, if you purchase a product/service 
        but do not wish to receive any additional marketing material from us, 
        you can indicate your preference on our order form. If you no longer wish 
        to receive our newsletter and promotional communications, you may opt-out 
        of receiving them by following the instructions included in each newsletter 
        or communication or you may contact us at 781.530.5000, email us at <a href="mailto:dalee@brassring.com">dalee@brassring.com</a>, 
        or send written notification to the attention of David Lee, 343 Winter 
        Street, Waltham, MA. 02451. You will be notified when your personal information 
        is collected by any third party that is not our agent/service provider, 
        so you can make an informed choice as to whether or not to share your 
        information with that party.</li>
      <li> Collect and store information generated through use of our on-line 
        business services. We may use some of this information in the aggregate 
        for marketing research, such as, for example, in compiling statistics 
        on BrassRing's website visitors, base, and in assessing clients' business 
        needs. If we decide to mention a particular client on the site, we will 
        take reasonable steps to gain that client's assent before posting. </li>
      <li> Collect and store information provided directly or indirectly to us 
        through participation in online contests and/or client satisfaction surveys 
        and the like. </li>
      <li>Create standard usage logs through our web server, such as IP address, 
        browser type, and access times. </li>
      <li>Collect prospective employee information through use of our own application 
        for internal job placement. That information will be treated according 
        to local regulations governing employment practices. </li>
      <li>Tie standard usage logs and cookie (session ID and persistent) information 
        to personally identifiable information. Cookies are information generated

      The BrassRing Web site may contain links to other sites. Please be aware

      This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by the BrassRing 
      Web site.</p>
    <p> Please see Section IV. General, for additional provisions that related 
      to brassring.com web site privacy practices.<br>
    </p>
    <h4>III. BrassRing's ASP Privacy Policy</h4>
    <p>This ASP Privacy Policy applies only to all transfers of personally identifiable 
      information ("Personal Information") received by BrassRing in 
      any format through its hosted recruitment software (<em>Enterprise</em>, 
      and/or <em>Talent Gateways</em>™), whether supplied directly by BrassRing 
      customers or by candidates for employment at BrassRing customers anywhere 
      in the world, including transfers from the European Economic Area (EEA) 
      to the United States. Any other visitors to BrassRing.com should refer to 
      the On-Line Privacy Policy which covers non-ASP BrassRing.com website use.</p>
    <p> BrassRing abides by the EU Safe Harbor framework as set forth by the Department 
      of Commerce regarding collection, use, and retention of data from the European 
      Union. As such we operate as a data processor for our hosted recruitment 
      software customers. Our hosted recruitment software customers fill the role 
      of data controller. Individual users involved in recruitment activities 
      usually interact directly with BrassRing's customers rather than with BrassRing. 
      BrassRing provides its customers the option of disclosing their relationship 
      with us by providing notice to individual employees and candidates of the 
      customer about the BrassRing technology that they use. BrassRing maintains 
      only that information related to the candidate recruitment process, which 
      our customers' have asked us to process. This ASP Privacy Policy does not 
      reflect the privacy practices of BrassRing's customers and BrassRing is 
      not responsible for its customers' privacy policies or practices. BrassRing 
      does not review, comment upon or monitor its customers' compliance with 
      their respective privacy policies, nor does BrassRing review its customer 
      instructions to determine whether they are in compliance with or conflict 
      with the terms of a customer's published privacy policy.</p>
    <ol>
      <li> <strong>Notice/Use of Information</strong><br>
        Because it supplies a hosted system, BrassRing operates as a data processor 
        for our recruitment software customers. Our hosted recruitment software 
        customers fill the role of data collector. Individual users involved in 
        recruitment activities usually interact directly with BrassRing's customers 
        rather than with BrassRing. BrassRing provides its customers with the 
        option of disclosing their relationship with us by providing notice to 
        individual employees and candidates of the customer about the BrassRing 
        technology that they use. BrassRing maintains only that information related 
        to the candidate recruitment process, which our customers have asked us 
        to process. It is the BrassRing customer's responsibility to ensure that 
        the data the customer collects can be legally collected in the country 
        of origin. The BrassRing customer is responsible to give its employees 
        and candidates for employment the appropriate level of notification that 
        Personal Information is being collected and maintained. BrassRing does 
        collect aggregate and demographic data, which is not associated with an 
        individual candidate's Personal Information, and that may be used for 
        statistical analysis and training purposes. </li>
      <li><strong>Notification of Changes/Choice</strong><br>
        We will maintain information in accordance with this ASP Privacy Policy. 
        If we decide to change this Policy, we will post the changes on this page 
        so that our recruitment software customers or their candidates for employment 
        are always aware of what information we process, how we use it, and under 
        what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. If at any point we decide 
        to use Personal Information in a different manner, we will notify our 
        recruitment process customers by way of email or by posting a notice on 
        our website for at least 30 days prior to the change in use. Customers, 
        in turn, are responsible for notifying candidates and providing them a 
        choice as to whether or not we use their information in this different 
        manner. </li>
      <li><strong>Onward Transfer</strong><br>
        We employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on our 
        behalf. Examples may include customer service, resume processing, and 
        data storage. If we disclose information of our customers or job candidates 
        to a third party that is acting as our agent or on our behalf, we will 
        ensure that the third party has agreed to abide by the Safe Harbor principles 
        or is subject to the Data Directive, or can otherwise assure adequate 
        protection of such information. We may seek to assure adequate protection, 
        for example, by entering into written agreements with third parties requiring 
        such parties to provide at least the same level of privacy protection 
        as is required by the Safe Harbor and/or the Data Directive. </li>
      <li><strong>Data Integrity</strong><br>
        BrassRing will use Personal Information only in ways compatible with the 
        purpose for which it was collected or subsequently authorized by our customers. 
        BrassRing will take reasonable steps to ensure that Personal Information 
        is relevant for its intended use, accurate and complete. </li>
      <li><strong>Security</strong><br>
        BrassRing is committed to ensuring the security of the information it 
        processes. To prevent unauthorized access or disclosure, maintain data 
        accuracy, and ensure the appropriate use of information, we have put in 
        place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard 
        and secure the information we process. BrassRing strives to protect the 
        privacy of the information we process, and inadvertent disclosure is extremely 
        unlikely. In the event of such an inadvertent disclosure, BrassRing will 
        take all commercially reasonable steps to limit and remedy the disclosure. 
        However, we cannot guarantee that unauthorized third parties will never 
        be able to defeat those procedures or use your personal information for 
        improper purposes. </li>
      <li><strong>Access/Correction</strong><br>
        In most cases, when BrassRing collects Personal Information we do so on 
        behalf of another company (as an agent or data processor). To request 
        access to or correction of this information, please contact the company 
        to which you provided it. BrassRing technology allows its recruitment 
        software customers access to all of the information processed on their 
        behalf and allows for the processing of any requested corrections to such 
        information. </li>
      <li><strong>Oversight/Enforcement</strong><br>
        BrassRing has a Privacy Officer who is responsible for BrassRing's compliance 
        with and enforcement of this Policy. BrassRing's Privacy Officer, Ronald 
        Poore, is available to any of its employees, customers, vendors, business 
        partners, or others who may have questions concerning this Policy or data 
        security practices. BrassRing's Privacy Officer may be contacted by email 
        at <a href="mailto:rpoore@brassring.com">rpoore@brassring.com</a>, by 
        telephone at 781.530.5155 or by mail at BrassRing, 343 Winter Street, 
        Waltham, MA 02451. If users have questions or concerns regarding this 
        statement, they should first contact Ronald Poore.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>We participate in the EU Safe Harbor Privacy Framework as set forth by 
      the United States Department of Commerce. As part of our participation in 
      the safe harbor, we have agreed to TRUSTe dispute resolution for disputes 
      relating to our compliance with the Safe Harbor Privacy Framework. If you 
      have any complaints regarding our compliance with the Safe Harbor you should 
      first contact us (as provided above). If contacting us does not resolve 
      your complaint, you may raise your complaint with TRUSTe by Internet at 
      http://www.truste.org/consumers/watchdog_complaint.php, fax at 415-618-3421, 
      or mail at Watchdog Complaints, TRUSTe, 685 Market Street, Suite 560, San 
      Francisco, CA, USA 94105. If you are faxing or mailing TRUSTe to lodge a 
      complaint, you must include the following information: the name of company, 
      the alleged privacy violation, your contact information, and whether you 
      would like the particulars of your complaint shared with the company. For 
      information about TRUSTe or the operation of TRUSTe's dispute resolution 
      process, see <a href="http://www.truste.org/consumers/watchdog_complaint.php">http://www.truste.org/consumers/watchdog_complaint.php</a> 
      or request this information from TRUSTe at any of the addresses listed above. 
      The TRUSTe dispute resolution process shall be conducted in English. </p>
    <p>
      For human resources data we have agreed to cooperate with Data Protection 
      Authorities. Any questions, comments or complaints about the data practices 
      (including without limitation compliance with data privacy principles of 
      notice, choice, onward transfer, access, security, data integrity, or enforcement) 
      of a hosted recruitment software customer for whom BrassRing processes data 
      should be addressed to that customer.<br>
     </p><h4> IV. General</h4>
    <ol>
      <li> <strong>Security</strong><br>
        BrassRing has implemented reasonable technical and organizational measures 
        designed to secure personal information collected on our website as well 
        as Personal Data processed on behalf of its customers from accidental 
        loss and from unauthorized access, use, alteration or disclosure including, 
        in appropriate circumstances, the use of firewalls, restricted access, 
        and encrypted transmissions. However, we cannot guarantee that unauthorized 
        third parties will never be able to defeat those measures or use your 
        personal information for improper purposes. </li>
      <li><strong>Notification of Changes</strong><br>
        If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes 
        to this privacy statement, the homepage, and other places we deem appropriate 
        so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use 
        it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. We will use 
        information in accordance with the privacy policy under which the information 
        was collected. If, however, we are going to use users' personally identifiable 
        information in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection 
        we will notify our hosted recruitment software customers and/or our website 
        users as appropriate via email and/or by posting a notice on our website 
        for 30 days. </li>
      <li><strong>Legal Disclaimer</strong><br>

        faith belief that such action is necessary in order to conform to the 
        edicts of the law, comply with legal mandates, enforce the TOS of our 
        websites, or to protect the rights, property, or personal safety of BrassRing, 
        its users and the public. </li>
      <li><strong>Children's privacy</strong><br>
