    <h2>bragster.com Privacy Policy</h2>
<div id="general-content">

<p>Latest update: 12th February, 2008</p>

<h3>We take your privacy very seriously!</h3>
<p>Welcome to bragster.com, the destination for friends to create fun bets. It is a fun place where you can create or participate in not-too-serious challenges with your friends (or the general public), meet new people and brag a little bit ('<strong>Bragster Service</strong>'). The Bragster Service is operated by Wannabet Ltd. (‘<strong>WAB</strong>’). WAB aims to offer its member community an automated and self-regulating platform (‘<strong>Platform</strong>’) that allows members to interact with each other by replicating small bets, dares, guesses and challenges (‘<strong>Bets</strong>’) that they would do in real life, with the convenience of the internet and/or mobile technology. The stakes in these Bets can be the bragster.com currency which is equivalent to points ('<strong>BragBucks</strong>'), or a prize of your choosing ('<strong>Prize</strong>').&nbsp;</p>

<p>Your privacy matters to us and we wanted to reassure you that we will do the right thing with any Personal Information you share with us. This Privacy Policy is part of our <a href="/main/terms">T&amp;Cs</a>, and is intended to give you relevant information while writing it in plain English rather some sort of “arggh, all this legalese stuff again”. </p>
<p>The <u>key points</u> are:</p>
<ul class="discs">
    <li>We treat your privacy very seriously, and want to foster a transparent environment throughout the website so that you know who you are playing with (including their personal ratings). </li>
    <li>You can cancel your membership at any time (as long as you are not committed to any Bets at that time).</li>

    <li>We will never disclose your Personal Information to any third party for marketing or other purposes unless we receive your permission.</li>
    <li>We hate spam, so you have the option to select which messages you like to receive (eg: you could easily decide to only receive the emails that are critical for the good proceeding of your Bets).</li>
    <li>We are partnering with reputable hosting providers to keep your details secure.</li>
</ul>
<h3>CHANGES IN PRIVACY POLICY</h3>
<p>From time to time we may update this Privacy Policy and will post a notice of any significant changes on our website. You should visit this page each time you use the Bragster Service to review any such changes to the privacy policy. Your continued use of this website or our service and/or continued provision of Personal Information to us will be subject to the terms of the then-current Privacy Policy.</p>
<h3>INFORMATION COLLECTED BY WANNABET LTD</h3>
<p>We collect different types of information that we use in different ways, as explained below. Throughout our Privacy Policy we will use the term '<strong>Personal Information</strong>'. This is information about you that identifies you as an individual. For example, when you register for the Bragster Service, you submit information such as your name, email address, country of residence, gender and age. As part of your personal profile, you may also choose to submit additional information such as interests, photos, personal blog or website addresses, etc. You may also submit Personal Information when you use the Bragster Service (e.g. by participating in Bets or communicating with other Members), if you make an enquiry or complaint to us, or in other ways. </p>

<p>We also collect <strong>Anonymous Information</strong> without connecting it to any name, address or other Personal Information. This data provides us with Anonymous Information about how people use our site and demographic information about our users, but does not identify you. For example, Anonymous Information may tell us how many people have participated in a particular (type of) Bet.</p>
<h3>USE OF INFORMATION</h3>
<p>We will display your Personal Information on your public profile, according to the preferences you set in your Account. We will use your name so that we can personalise your experience. We will use your email address to contact you from time to time. You can control the types and, over time, the frequencies of certain emails you receive. We may also use your Personal Information to process any applications for membership, Bets you make, for security reasons to confirm that you are who you say you are, to confirm and investigate any transactions in respect of your use of the Bragster Service, to provide the Bragster Service to you, to process and deal with any queries or complaints you make, to monitor and investigate any suspected breach of our T&amp;Cs or any laws and, where you have given your consent, to send you offers or promotions from WAB or carefully selected third parties. </p>
<p>You must also be aware that visitors and other members can see which Bets you are involved in. If you wish to create a Bet that is not visible to the public other than those members that are invited to the Bet, you can select this option in the Bet Creation Process. <strong>Please note that you cannot hide your participation from the public if the person who created the Bet has not selected this private option. </strong></p>
<p>We may use the Anonymous Information to statistically analyze site usage and to customize our site's content, layout and services, or for marketing purposes. The resulting information will allow us to improve our site and better understand and serve our users.</p>
<p>We may disclose your Personal Information to our employees, agents, partners and affiliates in order to administer your Account. With your consent, we may disclose your Personal Information to carefully selected third parties so they can send you offers or promotions. Also, we may disclose your Personal Information if we reasonably believe we are required to do so by law, regulation or other government authority or to protect the rights and property of WAB, its affiliates or the public. We may also cooperate with law enforcement agencies in any official investigation and we may disclose your Personal Information to the relevant agency in doing so.</p>

<h3>REVIEWING AND CHANGING YOUR PROFILE</h3>
<p>You can review and revise your personal public profile, and decide not to disclose certain facts to the public. Also, you can choose not to disclose your real name or age to the public. You can however not hide from the public your trust rating or comments that have been posted about you by people who participated in bets you created or for which you acted as referee as those are a crucial parameter for other members to interact with you. If you decide to cancel your membership altogether, we will remove your profile and it will not be visible to others anymore. The bets in which you got involved or comments you posted however will remain visible as they are an integral part of those events. Your picture will be removed from those.</p>
<h3>INTERNET AWARENESS</h3>
<p>Whenever you voluntarily post personal information in public areas, like journals, web blogs, message boards, and forums, you should be aware that this information can be accessed by the public and can in turn be used by others to send you unsolicited communications. Please exercise discretion in deciding what information you disclose.</p>

<h3>ACQUISITION AND GROUP COMPANIES</h3>

If an acquiring company should plan to materially change this privacy policy, we will notify you beforehand.</p>
