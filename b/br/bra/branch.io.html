            <p>
              Below, we explain what information we collect on behalf of our Clients through the Services, and how we use it. We process information in a way that is relevant for the purpose for which it was collected as described below.
            </p>
            <h4>The Branch Services: Overview</h4>
            <p>
              Branch provides a variety of Services intended to help Clients bridge together the identity of their Users across a wide array of platforms, devices and applications. Branch helps Clients by connecting User interactions across siloed applications (email, SMS, web browsers, social platforms, native applications and others), so that Clients understand the multiple steps that a User took to ultimately complete a transaction with the business. This information is used by the Client to better inform marketing and product decisions as well as to provide improved user experiences by using their knowledge of continuity.
            </p>
            <p>
              Branch has no direct relationship with Users. Branch’s Services are provided when Branch Clients install on their platforms “Branch Mechanisms” (including links, pixels, direct platform integrations, etc.) that capture the User action on behalf of the Client. By associating the information collected from these Mechanisms, Branch creates and stores identifiers unique to the Branch platform, and then uses a variety of techniques to connect these User actions and identifiers together. Some of these common connection techniques include a direct pass-through of identifiers from platform to platform, probabilistic matching using real time and historical parameters observed from each interaction, as well as using historical connections aggregated across the Branch platform. In some cases, these connections are made without the use of cookies. These techniques help Clients match Users with devices they use, including matching the same User across multiple devices.
            </p>
            <p>
              The key use cases of Branch’s connection service are:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                To support Clients in implementing deep linking, which uses Branch’s connection information in real time to improve the User experience.
                <ul><li>For example, if a User clicks on a link in an email or ad to a specific page in a Client’s app, Branch helps the User get to that page after they download the app.</li></ul>
              </li>
              <li>
                To report individualized and aggregated analytics metrics about the performance of the Client’s product and marketing initiatives to the Client directly.
                <ul><li>For example, Branch can tell a Client how many Users that downloaded an app or that went to a specific page in an app came from clicking on a specific link, and provide corresponding advertising identifiers.</li></ul>
              </li>
              <li>
                To assist the Client by presenting real time, targeted messaging to their Users depending on past behavior observed across the tracked platforms with the purpose of driving more engagement to the Client.
                <ul><li>For example, Branch can use Branch Mechanisms to provide a tailored message like a coupon code or special offer in your website to users who have interacted with your app and/or website in the past.</li></ul>
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Branch requires that each Client commit to share with Branch only information that it has lawfully obtained (including, where necessary, by obtaining consent from Users, or from their parents for children under 13, or in certain jurisdictions, under 16), and that it has the right to share with Branch, and we strongly discourage Clients from sharing sensitive User information with us, as such information is not necessary for the provision of the Services.
            </p>
            <p>
              In the charts below, we summarize the information collected automatically by the Services.
            </p>
            <h4>Information Collected By Branch Links and Pixels</h4>
            <p>
              Branch collects the following information from web URLs created by the Client and pixels placed on Client websites. Some of this information is considered personal data under applicable law (in other words, information that itself may identify a unique individual or can be linked back to an individual) (“<b>Personal Data</b>”).

              Our Clients use the information collected via the Services to improve their Users’ app experiences, customize their apps to Users, and to better understand their app marketing programs and how Users discover their apps. For example, a User may want to share information about a hotel that she found in a travel app with a friend. When that User sends her friend a Branch link to that hotel, after clicking the link the friend is brought directly to the content relating to that hotel within the app, rather than landing on the app’s homepage and having to search for the hotel. The travel app would also gain insights and analytics as to how the content is being shared from its app.
            </p>

              We require that our Clients utilize our Services responsibly and in accordance with our Terms &amp; Conditions. Branch is not responsible for the data practices of any of our Clients through the Services or otherwise. Each Client’s practices are subject to each Client’s individual privacy policy. Users should review the privacy policy of each Client to understand how that Client uses User information collected through the Services.

              <b>Services:</b> Because Branch is a service provider that processes data on behalf of its Clients, any requests relating to European Users’ exercise of their rights of access, rectification, erasure, or restriction under the European General Data Protection Regulation (<b>“GDPR”</b>) must be provided to Branch by a Client. Clients can notify Branch of these requests <a href="https://gdpr.branch.io/hc/en-us/requests/new">here</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
              Moreover, Branch supports functionality to allow Clients to respect granular controls regarding User data privacy rights. Clients can flag in the Branch SDK that a particular User has requested that their data not be processed by Branch, in which case Branch will no longer process engagement data on behalf of the Client for that User.
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>Website:</b> Website Users who are residents of the European Economic Area may seek confirmation regarding whether Branch is processing Personal Data about you, request access to such data, and ask that we correct, amend, or delete it where it is inaccurate or has been processed in violation of the Privacy Shield Principles. You can submit such requests starting on May 25, 2018 at <a href="https://gdpr.branch.io/hc/en-us/requests/new"> https://gdpr.branch.io/hc/en-us/requests/new</a>, which will be processed in line with applicable law. Although we make good faith efforts to provide you with access to your Personal Data, there may be circumstances in which we are unable to provide access, including but not limited to: where the information contains legal privilege, would compromise others’ privacy or other legitimate rights, where the burden or expense of providing access would be disproportionate to the risks to your privacy in the case in question, or where it is commercially proprietary.  To protect your privacy, we will take commercially reasonable steps to verify your identity before granting access to or making any changes to your Personal Data.
