<h1>
    Brayola Privacy Policy 
</h1>

<p>
This privacy statement explains the privacy practices of Brayola for users of the Site. If not specifically defined herein, capitalized terms have the meaning given to them in the Brayola Terms of Service, which is available at 
<a href="http://brayola.com/terms">brayola.com/terms</a>.
</p>


<h1>
    Brayola’s Commitment to Privacy
</h1>

<p>
Brayola respects your right to privacy. Your ability to make informed choices about the uses of your information is important to us. This privacy statement explains Brayola’s policy regarding the collection, use, disclosure and protection of Personal Information. The terms of this privacy policy apply to information collected from you unless different terms are specified as part of a special offer or in another form or contract we provide you.
</p>

<h1>
    What is Personal Information?
</h1>

<p>
“Personal Information” is information that can be directly associated with a specific person or entity such as a person’s name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, credit card number, or information about activities directly linked to that person, such as his or her purchases (through affiliate programs). Personal Information also includes information that you may choose to provide to us, such as your educational, medical and employment history profile. 
Personal information does not include “aggregate” information. Aggregate information is data we collect about a group or category of products, services or customers, from which individual customer identities have been removed.  In other words, information about how you use a service may be collected and combined with information about how others use the same service, but no Personal Information will be included in the resulting data. Likewise, information about the products or services you use or purchase may be collected and combined with information about the products and services used or purchased by others, but no Personal Information will be included in the resulting data. Aggregate data helps understand trends and customer needs so that new products and services can be considered and so existing products and services can be tailored to customer desires.
</p>



<h1>
    Collection of Personal Information
</h1>

<p>
We collect Personal Information that you provide us, such as when you:
register to use the Site or Services;
post or submit any content on the Site or Services, or any conversation between users;
use links to third party websites
contact us for any reason.
We may automatically collect some information when you use the Site or Services, such as your computer’s IP address, operating system, the site from which you linked to us, and the time and date of your visit, your searching history, the sites to which you were linked thorough the Site, and activities. We also collect information received from third parties to the extent that they have entered into an agreement with you as a result of your relationship with Brayola. 
</p>

<h1>
    Use of Personal Information
</h1>

The personal information we collect is used to process your requests or transactions, to provide you high quality service, to customize your use of the Site or Services according to your preferences, and to tell you about specific goods or services we believe will be of interest to you.  If you prefer not to receive promotional information from us, we make it easy for you to let us know. You can contact us at any time to decline promotional information (see under the heading “Choice” below). 


<h1>
    Use of Personal Information
</h1>

<p>
Brayola does not sell, rent, share, or disclose Personal Information to third parties without your prior consent, except in the limited circumstances described in this statement. 
</p>

<h1>
    Communities
</h1>

<p>
If you use any of the features of the Site or Services, please remember that any information disclosed in these venues may be automatically made public, even without your knowledge or authorization. You should exercise caution when disclosing any information, including Personal Information, in such venues, as you do not know who will access or use such information and for what purposes. Brayola is in no way responsible for the accuracy, use or misuse of any information, including Personal Information, which you disclose in such venues.
</p>

<h1>
    Other Disclosures
</h1>

<p>
In addition, we may disclose Personal Information in the good faith belief that we are required to do so by law, or that doing so is reasonably necessary to comply with legal process, respond to any claims, or to protect the rights, property, or personal safety of Brayola, our customers, or the public.  Information about our customers, including Personal Information, may be disclosed as part of, or during negotiations of, any merger, sale of company assets or acquisition.
</p>

<h1>
    Protection of Personal Information
</h1>

<p>
Brayola has put into place security measures in an effort to protect personal information from loss, misuse or alteration while it is under our control. Personal information we collect is stored electronically and may be combined with other membership information. We use technical, contractual, administrative and physical measures in an effort to protect against unauthorized access.
Further, when you enter personal information online, that information is encrypted using a security software called SHA1. SHA1 encrypts all information before it is sent over the Internet, including passwords to Brayola accounts.
Account information is accessible online only through the use of a password. To protect the confidentiality of personal information, you must keep your password confidential and not disclose it to any other person.  If other people have access to your email, they may be able to obtain access to your password and obtain personal information about you, or change information about your user profile. You may not want to use an email account operated by an employer because many employers have the legal right to access such email accounts.
</p>

<h1>
    Choice
</h1>

<p>
By registering you agree to receive promotional messages from Brayola. If at any time you wish to stop receiving promotional information from Brayola, you may opt out by:
E-Mailing us at support@brayola.com; or
Accessing your registration information and checking the box that allows you to opt out of receiving promotional emails. 
</p>

<h1>
    Aggregate Information
</h1>

<p>
Brayola appreciates the importance of safeguarding the privacy of your personal information that may be provided to us.  However, Brayola does use and disclose de-identified aggregate information for the purposes of evaluating and improving our services and tailoring our products. Brayola may choose at its sole discretion to transfer, sell, provide or share such information with third parties, including with Brayola’s business partners for commercial purposes, and by providing any information to Brayola you consent to such provision of de-identified aggregate information to any third party.
</p>

<h1>
    What Are Cookies and Are You Required to Accept Them?
</h1>

<p>
Cookies are small files that are stored on your computer. We use cookies to help optimize your use of the Site.  For example, we use cookies to customize our home page for you and to better display pages according to your browser type. When you make a purchase cookies allow us to better maintain the status of your account.

<h1>
    Use of the Site by Children
</h1>

<p>
    Brayola does not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under the age of 13, and you must be 18 years of age or older in order to establish an account.  Parents are able to set up accounts for their children.   In this way verifiable parental consent is required in order to register a child under the age of 13 to be enrolled, and any parent setting up an account for his or her hereby represents and warrants that he or she is the parent or legal guardian of such child, and has the authority to provide information and render consents on behalf of such child. In the event you become aware that an individual under the age of 13 has enrolled without parental permission, please advise us immediately. 
</p>

<h1>
    Online Links to Other Sites
</h1>

<p>
    By searching an item shown on the Site, you may be taken to a site of a third party. In addition, Brayola members or users can link to other webs of third parties that provide useful information, or who have agreed to offer goods and services to Brayola members. Any personal information you provide on the linked pages is provided directly to this third-party and is subject to that third party’s provider’s privacy policy.
    Except as described above, Brayola is not responsible for the content or privacy practices of Web sites to which we link. Links to third party or other sites are provided for your convenience. We encourage you to learn about the privacy practices of each Web site before providing them with personal information.
