<p>This Privacy Policy tells you about the information Brazen Careerist collects through its websites - Brazen Connect virtual events, Brazen Life blog, Brazen U courses, Brazen Careerist email newsletter - (collectively, the “Site”) and how we use that information. By using our services and accessing Brazen Careerist properties, you are consenting to the information collection and use practices described in the Privacy Policy, as modified from time to time by us.</p>

<p>If you have any questions or comments about this Privacy Policy or our use of your personally identifiable information, please contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@brazencareerist.com">privacy@brazencareerist.com</a>.</p>

<ol class="spaced_out_list"><li><strong>Information Collection</strong>. We do collect information that identifies users of the Site (“Personal Information”). We also collect non-personal information (“Anonymous Information”), such as pages visited, and comments left. We may also collect or develop aggregated information, which may include Anonymous Information and Personal Information (“Aggregated Information”).
		<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;"><li><strong>Children Under the Age of 13</strong>. We do not intentionally gather Personal Information about users who are under the age of 13. If you are under the age of 13, you are not authorized to use the Site.</li>

The information you provide will be collected by Brazen Careerist and if applicable, shared with the employer(s) participating in a virtual event (“Event”) that you are signing up for. This includes but is not limited to your location, your industry, and other questions you answer during the registration process. If providing information for an Event, this information may become subject to the policies of the respective Employer(s) after it has been shared, as Brazen Careerist is not responsible for these policies.
