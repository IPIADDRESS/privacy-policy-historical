For website activities that request personal information, you agree to provide accurate and current information about yourself.  Your membership and/or participation in our website activities will be canceled without notice if at any time we discover that you provide false information, or violate any term of our Privacy Policies or our <a href="terms.php">Terms of Usage Agreement</a>.  We retain personal information for an indefinite amount of time to preserve our membership database and to comply with various federal and state laws.

			<div class="aboutText">Use and Collection of Information by <font color="#996600">Bravo</font></div>

			<div class="aboutText">To participate as a member of our general audience website, or in special events, contests, sweepstakes or Interactive Areas, you may be required to provide personal information such as your name, home and e-mail addresses, telephone number, birth date and gender.  Non-members may also participate in Interactive Areas conducted, operated and/or managed by <font color="#996600">Bravo</font> after submitting their full name, e-mail address, and selecting a username and password.  Interactive Areas not conducted, operated and/or managed by <font color="#996600">Bravo</font> may require a different registration process.  We may also survey visitors about various topics, including their television viewing preferences and comments about how we can improve our programming, website, and services to you.  Response to our surveys is entirely voluntary.</div>

			<div class="aboutText">We collect personal information for several important purposes, including to protect the security of our visitors and the site, improve our program service and website, distribute our newsletter, notify the winners of our contests and sweepstakes, allow participation in Interactive Areas, and for future marketing and/or promotional use about our program service or website.  We will also offer an "E-card" feature that allows visitors to send an e-mail version of a post card to another person to inform them about <font color="#996600">Bravo</font> activities.  We do not collect the sender's or the recipient's e-mail information on E-Cards.</div>

			<div class="aboutText">The only personal information this website obtains about you is information voluntarily provided by you.  We do not collect additional personal information about visitors or members from other sources.  This means that a person can visit our website and navigate through the site without giving us personal information.  To gauge the effectiveness of our website, we collect non-personal information about our members and visitors, such as Internet server and browser identification, the Internet service provider, the web page from which a visitor enters our site, and how much time the visitor spends on each page.  This information does not reveal a visitor's personal identity.</div>

			<div class="aboutText">Our contests, sweepstakes, and special events are often produced with the generous support of non-affiliated sponsors and/or promotional partners.  The personal information collected by our website in conjunction with such events may also be used for the marketing of additional services and events by <font color="#996600">Bravo</font> , and/or its promotional partners and sponsors beyond the contest, sweepstakes and/or special event.  Depending on the event, visitors will be able to either grant their approval on how their personal information will be used before it is collected ("opt-in") or choose to deny use of their information for additional purposes ("opt-out").  Prior to the commencement of each contest, sweepstakes, and/or special event, we will prominently post on the website applicable rules, terms and conditions, and if necessary, any supplemental privacy provisions that will inform our visitors about how their personal information will be collected, used and disclosed.</div>

Companies not affiliated, owned or operated by <font color="#996600">Bravo</font>, its parents, affiliates or subsidiaries may handle some of these transactions.  We call these companies that conduct our e-commerce operations and/or order fulfillment "operational providers."  We generally require our operational providers to adhere to the provisions in <font color="#996600">Bravo</font>'s privacy policy.  We generally prohibit such providers from sharing our visitors' personal information with parties other than <font color="#996600">Bravo</font> and require that these providers only use the personal information for the purpose of conducting the sale of <font color="#996600">Bravo</font>-related merchandise.</div>

			<div class="aboutText">Occasionally, an operational provider will have its own terms of use and a different privacy policy.  In these instances, we will identify such providers in this Privacy Policy.  Be advised that when you visit the operational provider's website, you will be subject to the privacy policy and terms of usage agreement of that provider.</div>

			<div class="largeColoredtext">Use and Collection of Information by Advertisers and Sponsors</div>

			<div class="aboutText">Our website will post banner ads and other forms of advertisements, and/or links to the websites of advertisers or sponsors, which are companies that are not owned or operated by <font color="#996600">Bravo</font>, its parents, affiliates or subsidiaries.
