<div class="aboutText">Use and Collection of Information by <font color="#996600">Bravo</font></div>

<div class="aboutText">To participate as a member of our general audience website, or in special events, contests, sweepstakes or Interactive Areas, you may be required to provide personal information such as your name, home and e-mail addresses, telephone number, birth date and gender.  Non-members may also participate in Interactive Areas conducted, operated and/or managed by <font color="#996600">Bravo</font> after submitting their full name, e-mail address, and selecting a username and password.  Interactive Areas not conducted, operated and/or managed by <font color="#996600">Bravo</font> may require a different registration process.  We may also survey visitors about various topics, including their television viewing preferences and comments about how we can improve our programming, website, and services to you.  Response to our surveys is entirely voluntary.</div>

<div class="aboutText">We collect personal information for several important purposes, including to protect the security of our visitors and the site, improve our program service and website, distribute our newsletter, notify the winners of our contests and sweepstakes, allow participation in Interactive Areas, and for future marketing and/or promotional use about our program service or website.  We will also offer an "E-card" feature that allows visitors to send an e-mail version of a post card to another person to inform them about <font color="#996600">Bravo</font> activities.  We do not collect the sender's or the recipient's e-mail information on E-Cards.</div>

<div class="aboutText">The only personal information this website obtains about you is information voluntarily provided by you.  We do not collect additional personal information about visitors or members from other sources.  This means that a person can visit our website and navigate through the site without giving us personal information.  To gauge the effectiveness of our website, we collect non-personal information about our members and visitors, such as Internet server and browser identification, the Internet service provider, the web page from which a visitor enters our site, and how much time the visitor spends on each page.  This information does not reveal a visitor's personal identity.</div>  

<div class="aboutText">Our contests, sweepstakes, and special events are often produced with the generous support of non-affiliated sponsors and/or promotional partners.  The personal information collected by our website in conjunction with such events may also be used for the marketing of additional services and events by <font color="#996600">Bravo</font> , and/or its promotional partners and sponsors beyond the contest, sweepstakes and/or special event.  Depending on the event, visitors will be able to either grant their approval on how their personal information will be used before it is collected ("opt-in") or choose to deny use of their information for additional purposes ("opt-out").  Prior to the commencement of each contest, sweepstakes, and/or special event, we will prominently post on the website applicable rules, terms and conditions, and if necessary, any supplemental privacy provisions that will inform our visitors about how their personal information will be collected, used and disclosed.</div>  

<a name="third_parties"><div class="largeColoredtext">Use and Collection of Information by Contract Service and Operational Providers</div></a>

<div class="aboutText">For the convenience of our visitors, we will provide the opportunity to purchase <font color="#996600">Bravo</font>-related merchandise and services through this website.  Companies not affiliated, owned or operated by <font color="#996600">Bravo</font>, its parents, affiliates or subsidiaries may handle some of these transactions.  We call these companies that conduct our e-commerce operations and/or order fulfillment "operational providers."  We generally require our operational providers to adhere to the provisions in <font color="#996600">Bravo</font>'s privacy policy.  We generally prohibit such providers from sharing our visitors' personal information with parties other than <font color="#996600">Bravo</font> and require that these providers only use the personal information for the purpose of conducting the sale of <font color="#996600">Bravo</font>-related merchandise.</div>

<div class="aboutText">Occasionally, an operational provider will have its own terms of use and a different privacy policy.  In these instances, we will identify such providers in this Privacy Policy.  Be advised that when you visit the operational provider's website, you will be subject to the privacy policy and terms of usage agreement of that provider.</div>

<div class="largeColoredtext">Use and Collection of Information by Advertisers and Sponsors</div>

<div class="aboutText">Our website will post banner ads and other forms of advertisements, and/or links to the websites of advertisers or sponsors, which are companies that are not owned or operated by <font color="#996600">Bravo</font>, its parents, affiliates or subsidiaries.

<div class="aboutText">We have created a special section of our website for the enjoyment of children called "Bravo On With the Show."  The "Bravo On With the Show" site allows participation by parents, teachers and children in various activities designed to restore student involvement in theater and the arts.  <font color="#996600">Bravo</font> respects the privacy of your child and maintains specific policies governing the collection of information from children under the age of thirteen. We also offer parents additional guidelines to help keep your child's personal information safe and your family's Internet participation enjoyable.

<div class="aboutText">The "Bravo On With the Show" section of our website does not knowingly collect, use or disclose any personal information from visitors under the age of thirteen.  Our "Spread the Word" link on the site offers an "E-card" feature that allows visitors to send an e-mail version of a post card to another person to inform them about "Bravo On With the Show." We do not, however, collect the sender's or the recipient's e-mail or other information on the "E-cards."</div>

<div class="aboutText">As an added protection, we have developed the general audience portion of the Bravotv.com site to appeal primarily to visitors eighteen years of age and older, although visitors of all ages may navigate through the site.  On all portions of our website, we do not knowingly collect personal information from visitors under the age of thirteen.  If upon notification by a parent, or discovery by other means, that a child under thirteen has improperly registered as a member or participated on our site by using false information, we will immediately cancel the child's membership or participation, and delete all personal information from our records.  Any "Bravo On With the Show" visitors over the age of thirteen will be subject to the privacy policies for the general audience portion of our site.</div>

<div class="aboutText">If at any time we decide to collect certain information from children, we will update this portion of our Privacy Policy.  We will also require verifiable parental consent, in accordance with applicable law, before we collect any personal information from children under thirteen years of age, except in the following circumstances allowed by law:
<ul>
<li>To provide notice and get consent from a parent or guardian;
</li><li>Response to a one-time request from a child, after which we will immediately delete the child's information;
</li><li>To fulfill a child's request for a subscription to a online newspaper, magazine or specific information on a regular basis and notify the parent or guardian before we contact the child again;
</li><li>To protect the safety of a child who is participating on this site; and
</li><li>To protect the security or integrity of the site, to take precautions against liability, to respond to a validly executed subpoena or warrant from law enforcement, or if permitted under other provisions of law.
</li></ul></div>
