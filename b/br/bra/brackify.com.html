<h4>Our Policy:</h4>
<p>Welcome to the web site (the “Site”) of Brackify, LLC, doing business as Brackify (“Brackify”, “we”, “us” and/or “our”). This Site is operated by Brackify and has been created to provide information about Brackify and to provide end users (“you”, “your”) with the ability to participate in one or more voting based brackets and/or other social games (the “Brackify Services”). Many of our voting brackets and other social games are hosted in connection with a third party (our “Partners”). This Privacy Policy sets forth Brackify’s policy with respect to information including personally identifiable data (“Personal Data”) and other information that is collected from Site visitors.
</p>

<h4>Information We Collect:</h4>
<p>When you interact with us through the Site, we may collect Personal Data and other information from you, as further described below:</p>
<p><strong>Personal Data That You Provide Through the Site:</strong> We collect Personal Data from you when you voluntarily provide such information, such as when you contact us with inquiries, respond to one of our surveys, register for access to the Brackify Services or use certain Brackify Services. For instance, when users register with the Site, they are asked to provide their name and e-mail address.  Additional information may be provided to Brackify when users voluntarily connect to the Site through a social media account.  Wherever Brackify collects Personal Data, we make an effort to provide a link to this Privacy Policy.
<br>
By voluntarily providing us with Personal Data, you are consenting to our use of it in accordance with this Privacy Policy. If you provide Personal Data to this Site, you acknowledge and agree that such Personal Data may be transferred from your current location to the offices and servers of Brackify and the authorized third parties referred to herein located in the United States.
</p>

<h4>Other Information:</h4>
<p>
<strong>Non-Identifiable Data:</strong> When you interact with Brackify through the Site, we receive and store certain personally non-identifiable information. Such information, which is collected passively using various technologies, cannot presently be used to specifically identify you.
<br>
Brackify may store such information itself or such information may be included in databases owned and maintained by Brackify affiliates, agents or service providers. This Site may use such information and pool it with other information to track, for example, the total number of visitors to our Site, the number of visitors to each page of our Site, and the domain names of our visitors' Internet service providers. It is important to note that no Personal Data is available or used in this process. 
</p>
<p>
In operating this Site, we may use a technology called "cookies." A cookie is a piece of information that the computer that hosts our Site gives to your browser when you access the Site. Our cookies help provide additional functionality to the Site and help us analyze Site usage more accurately. For instance, our Site may set a cookie on your browser that allows you to access the Site without needing to remember and then enter a password more than once during a visit to the Site. In all cases in which we use cookies, we will not collect Personal Data except with your permission. On most web browsers, you will find a “help” section on the toolbar. Please refer to this section for information on how to receive notification when you are receiving a new cookie and how to turn cookies off. We recommend that you leave cookies turned on because they allow you to take advantage of some of the Site’s features.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Aggregated Personal Data:</strong> In an ongoing effort to better understand and serve the users of the Brackify Services, Brackify often conducts research on its customer demographics, interests and behavior based on the Personal Data and other information provided to us. This research may be compiled and analyzed on an aggregate basis, and Brackify may share this aggregate data with its affiliates, agents, business partners and other third parties. This aggregate information does not identify you personally. Brackify may also disclose aggregated user statistics in order to describe our services to current and prospective business partners, and to other third parties for other lawful purposes.
</p>

<h4>Our Use of Your Personal Data and Other Information:</h4>
<p>
Brackify uses the Personal Data you provide in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Policy. If you provide Personal Data for a certain reason, we may use the Personal Data in connection with the reason for which it was provided. For instance, when we offer a Brackify Service, such as a contest, with a Partner and you register for such Brackify Service, your Personal Data may be shared with such Partner to faciliate your participation.  If you contact us by e-mail, we will use the Personal Data you provide to answer your question or resolve your problem. Also, if you provide Personal Data in order to obtain access to the Brackify Services, we will use your Personal Data to provide you with access to such services, to provide you with game notifications and to monitor your use of such services. Brackify and its subsidiaries and affiliates (the “Brackify Related Companies”) may also use your Personal Data and other personally non-identifiable information collected through the Site to help us improve the content and functionality of the Site, to better understand our users and to improve the Brackify Services. Brackify and its affiliates and Partners may use this information to contact you in the future to tell you about services we believe will be of interest to you, such as upcoming Brackify brackets. If we do so, each communication we send you will contain instructions permitting you to "opt-out" of receiving future communications. In addition, if at any time you wish not to receive any future communications or you wish to have your name deleted from our mailing lists, please contact us as indicated below.
<br>
If Brackify intends on using any Personal Data in any manner that is not consistent with this Privacy Policy, you will be informed of such anticipated use prior to or at the time at which the Personal Data is collected.
</p>

<h4>Our Disclosure of Your Personal Data and Other Information:</h4>
<p>
Brackify is not in the business of selling your information. We consider this information to be a vital part of our relationship with you. There are, however, certain circumstances in which we may share your Personal Data with certain third parties without further notice to you, as set forth below (and as previously set forth above):
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
<strong>Related Companies:</strong> We may also share your Personal Data with our Related Companies for purposes consistent with this Privacy Policy.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Agents, Consultants and Related Third Parties:</strong> Brackify, like many businesses, sometimes hires other companies to perform certain business-related functions. Examples of such functions include mailing information, maintaining databases and processing payments. When we employ another Brackify to perform a function of this nature, we only provide them with the information that they need to perform their specific function.        
</p>
<p>
<strong>Legal Requirements:</strong> Brackify may disclose your Personal Data if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to (i) comply with a legal obligation, (ii) protect and defend the rights or property of Brackify, (iii) act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of the Site or the public, or (iv) protect against legal liability.

<p>
This Privacy Policy applies only to the Site. This Site may contain links to other web sites not operated or controlled by Brackify (the “Third Party Sites”).

However, please remember that the manner in which Social Media Services use, store and disclose your information is governed by the policies of the applicable Social Media Services provider, and, as a result, Brackify shall not have any liability or responsibility for the privacy practices or other actions of Social Media Services that may be enabled within and/or otherwise accessible through the Site.
