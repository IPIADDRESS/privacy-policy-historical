<h1>Privacy Policy<br>
<span class="prod_subhead">Our Commitment To Privacy</span></h1>
<p><strong>Your privacy is important to us.</strong> To better protect your privacy we provide this notice explaining our online information practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used.</p>
<h4>The Information We Collect</h4>
<div class="photo_box"><img height="134" alt="Nature Image" width="200" src="images/sunset_04.jpg">
<p><strong>"I've been a personal trainer since 1983.</strong> The hardest part of my work has been to help people achieve a new attitude about their optimal weight and getting fit. I think the <a href="product.asp?specific=137&amp;title=Slim-Naturally">Slim Naturally</a> and <a href="product.asp?specific=157&amp;title=Healing-Meditation">Healing Meditation</a> audios are the biggest life-changing discoveries I've made in years. My friends and clients agree!<br>
— <em>M.S., Trainer, Omaha, NE</em></p>
<p><strong>This notice applies to all information collected or submitted on the Brain Sync website.</strong> On some pages, you can order products, make requests, and register to receive materials. To process your request, we ask for information such as your name, address, email address and credit card information.</p>
</div>
<p><strong>On some pages, you can submit information about other people.</strong> For example, if you order a gift online and want it sent directly to the recipient, you will need to submit the recipient's name and address.</p>
<h4>The Way We Use Information</h4>
<p><strong>We use the information you provide about yourself when placing an order only to complete that order.</strong> We do not share this information with outside parties except to the extent necessary to complete that order.</p>
<p>We use the information you provide about someone else when placing an order only to ship the product and to confirm delivery. We do not share this information with outside parties except to the extent necessary to complete that order.</p>
<p>We use return email addresses to answer the email we receive. Such addresses are not used for any other purpose and are not shared with outside parties.</p>
<p>You can register with our website if you would like to receive our email newsletters. Information you submit on our website will not be used for this purpose unless you request so.</p>
<p>We use non-identifying and aggregate information to better design our website and to share with advertisers. For example, we may tell an advertiser that X number of individuals visited a certain area on our website, or that Y number of men and Z number of women filled out our registration form, but we would not disclose anything that could be used to identify those individuals.</p>
<p>Finally, we never use or share the personally identifiable information provided to us online in ways unrelated to the ones described above without also providing you an opportunity to opt-out or otherwise prohibit such unrelated uses.</p>
<h4><br>
Shipping</h4>
<p><strong>When shipping packages</strong> we show the sender as Brain Sync Corporation.</p>

<p><strong>To prevent unauthorized access,</strong> maintain data accuracy, and ensure the correct use of information, we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online.</p>
<p><br>
Our Commitment To Children's Privacy</p>
<p>Protecting the privacy of the very young is especially important. For that reason, we never collect or maintain information at our website from those we actually know are under 13, and no part of our website is structured to attract anyone under 13.</p>
