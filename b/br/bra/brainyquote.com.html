<div class="bq_s">
<h2>1. Introduction</h2>
<p>Thank you for visiting BrainyQuote.com, a site designed to inform, inspire, educate and entertain users all around the globe (the "Site"). The Site is created by Xplore, Inc., a corporation doing business in the Lone Star State. This Privacy Policy is written to better explain how we collect and use your information, and to cover our caboose in case you plan to sue us because you don't like how we use information, or you're a person who just doesn't like quotes.</p>
<p>BY ACCESSING OR USING THE SITE, YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE READ AND UNDERSTAND THIS PRIVACY POLICY AND THAT YOU AGREE WITH THE TERMS OF THIS PRIVACY POLICY AS WELL AS OUR <a href="/inquire/terms.html">TERMS OF SERVICE</a>. If you do not agree with our policies and practices, your choice is not to use the Site.</p>
</div>
<div class="bq_s">
<h2>2. Personal Information We Collect</h2>
<p>Good news! You don't have to give us any personally identifiable information when you use the Site. Please do not share any other personally identifiable information or your life story (it's not that we're not interested, and we can't stop you) when you submit a quote to us for consideration. We will not disclose any information that you provide to us except in accordance with the provisions of this Privacy Policy.</p>
</div>
<div class="bq_s">
<h2>3. Non-Personal Information We Collect</h2>
<p>We may collect information about you that is not personal information ("Collected Information"). When you access the Site and/or submit a quote, we may collect such things as your IP address, browser, operating system, referring URL, metadata, specific pages that you access on the Site or prior to or after visiting the site, the length of time you spend at the site, and other general information about our visitors. This information, on its own, cannot usually be used to identify you.</p>
</div>
<div class="bq_s">
<h2>4. Use of Information</h2>
<p>We may use the Collected Information for a wide variety of purposes, including printing physical paper copies of it and turning it into an origami hat (kidding again). All jokes aside, we and our third party service providers may use this information to help administer the Site and the servers that provide the Site, generate statistical information, monitor and analyze Site traffic and usage patterns, and improve the Site's content and content delivery, including any online content, materials, and services that we describe or make available on the Site.</p>
<p>If you contact us for support or assistance, we may use any contact information you provide to us, including your name or email address, (also deemed "Collected Information" hereunder) to provide service and support to you. We may also use Collected Information and the associated statistical data we and our third party service providers generate to deliver targeted advertisements to you and other visitors of the Site.</p>
<p>We and our third party service providers may store Collected Information for as long as needed for the purposes indicated in this Privacy Policy, which may be indefinitely.</p>
</div>
<div class="bq_s">
<h2>5. Disclosure of Your Information</h2>
<p>We may share Collected Information with certain of our third party service providers (e.g., our web hosting provider whose server logs collect the non-personal information described above) in order to provide the Site to you. We may also share Collected Information with some of our business and marketing partners in furthering our mission as an organization or delivering the content, materials, and services available on or through the Site to you. We and our third party service providers may also produce reports on Site traffic, usage patterns, and similar data generated from Collected Information, and we may share these reports with our business and marketing partners and others. Specifically, though, we may share your non-personal information with the following third party service providers:</p>
<ul>
<li>Google, as a third party vendor, uses cookies to serve ads on the Site. Google's use of the DART cookie enables it to serve ads to our users based on their visit to our sites and other sites on the Internet. Users may opt out of the use of the DART cookie by visiting the <a href="http://www.google.com/privacy_ads.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Google ad and content network privacy policy.</a> Tracking of users through the DART cookie mechanisms are subject to Google's own privacy policies.
</li>
<li>RadiumOne, which uses cookies to identify and collect anonymous user interests on the Site. You may opt out of the RadiumOne cookie by visiting the <a href="http://www.radiumone.com/about/opt.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">RadiumOne Preference Manager</a>.
</li>
<li>Glam Media, which uses cookies to identify and collect anonymous user interests on the Site. You may opt out of the Glam Media cookie by visiting the <a href="http://www.glammedia.com/about_glam/legal/opt-out" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Glam Media Preference Manager</a>.
</li>
<li>Quantcast, as a third party vendor, uses cookies to identify and collect anonymous user interests on the Site. Users may opt out of the use of the Quantcast cookie by visiting the <a href="http://www.quantcast.com/opt-out" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Quantcast Preference Manager</a>.
</li>
<li>comScore, Inc. (weird capitalization intentional - but that's how they spell it), as a third party vendor, uses cookies to identify and collect anonymous user interests on the Site via its Scorecard Research program. You may opt out of this cookie by visiting the <a href="http://www.scorecardresearch.com/preferences.aspx" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Scorecard Research Preference Manager</a>.
</li>
<li>Yieldbot, uses cookies to identify anonymous user interests (starting to notice a pattern here?) on the Site. You may opt out of this cookie by visiting - wait for it - the <a href="http://yieldbot.com/privacy-policy.html#opt-out" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Yieldbot Privacy Policy Opt-out</a>.
</li></ul>
<p>If all or part of our company is sold, merged, or otherwise transferred to another entity, we may transfer Collected Information to such entity as part of that transaction.</p>
<p>Every authorization which you grant to us in this Privacy Policy, you also grant to any third party that we may hire, contract, or hire as an intern for the purpose of operating, maintaining, repairing, or otherwise improving or preserving the Site or its underlying files or systems. You agree not to hold us liable for the actions of any of these third parties, even if we would normally be held vicariously liable for their actions, and that you must take legal action against them directly should they commit any tort or other actionable wrong against you.</p>
</div>
<div class="bq_s">
<h2>6. Cookies</h2>
<p>Cookies aren't just delicious; they also apparently have something to do with computers. These Cookies are placed on your computer when your web browser accesses the Site. We use cookies to save your preferences and to recognize you when you return to the Site. We also use cookies to track ads and to share information with third parties as described above. Because of this, you should enable your cookies when you use the Site. Please note that you may not be able to access the full functionality of the Site if cookies are disabled on your browser.</p>
<p>We also use web beacons to monitor the traffic patterns of visitors from one BrainyQuote.com page to another. A web beacon is an object that is embedded in a web page and is usually invisible to you but allows us to confirm that you have viewed the web page.</p>
<p>Advertising agencies, advertising networks, and other companies may place advertisements on the Site, and on the Internet generally, and may use their own cookies, web beacons, and other technology to collect information about you. We do not control the use of such technology and have no responsibility for the use of such technology to gather information about you. Our systems do not recognize browser "Do Not Track" signals, but several of our service providers who utilize cookies and other tracking technologies on our Site enable you to opt out of this type of advertising.</p>
<p>If you would like to learn more about behavioral advertising or to opt out of having this information used by companies that are part of the Network Advertising Initiative to deliver targeted ads, please visit <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Network Advertising Initiative</a>. In addition, the Federal Trade Commission provides useful information about online privacy on its own website at <a href="http://www.consumer.ftc.gov/topics/privacy-identity" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">FTC Privacy Site</a>.</p>
<p>If you're new to the Internet, please don't try dunking your mouse in milk and eating it; this is the Number One complaint we get after users read our Privacy Policy.</p>
<div class="bq_fq bq_fq_insert">
<p>Think what a better world it would be if we all, the whole
world, had cookies and milk about three o'clock every afternoon and
then lay down on our blankets for a nap.</p>

<div class="bq_s">
<h2>7. Third Party Websites</h2>
<p>We may link to third party websites from our own Site. We have no control over, and are not responsible for, these third party websites or their use of your personally identifiable information.</p>
<p>The Site may also offer you the ability to interact with social plugins from social media sites, such as Facebook (facebook.com), Google+ (plus.google.com), Twitter (twitter.com), and Pinterest (pinterest.com). The social media sites may receive data when you visit a website - such as networkadverising.org - that has plugins. In some cases, we may know that you clicked on a social plugin such as a Facebook Like button, or receive other information from the social media sites. Similarly, if you have previously provided personally identifiable information to a third-party operating a plug-in on this website, then this third-party may recognize you on the Site. Your use of social media plugins is subject to each social media site's privacy policy, which may be different from ours.</p>
<p>We recommend that, if you have a ridiculous amount of free time (and nothing better to do), you review their privacy policies and other agreements governing your use of their website. Once you do, you should report back to us in a detailed and meticulously proofread memorandum explaining all of these websites, so we may immediately put it to use under that corner of the table that is lower than the rest.</p>
</div>
<div class="bq_s">
<h2>8. Law Enforcement</h2>
<p>We may disclose your information to a third party where we believe, in good faith, in bad faith, or in so-so faith, that it is desirable to do so for the purposes of a civil action, criminal investigation, or other legal matter. We may also use and disclose information about you to establish or exercise our legal rights, to assert and defend against legal claims, or if we believe such disclosure is necessary to investigate, prevent, or take other action regarding actual or suspected illegal or fraudulent activities or potential threats to the physical safety or well-being of any person.</p>
<p>In the event that we receive a subpoena affecting your privacy, we may elect to notify you to give you an opportunity to file a motion to quash the subpoena, or we may attempt to quash it ourselves, but we are not obligated to do either. Chances are that if the police are looking into your activities on a quote website, you've really got issues, and we're probably going to hand over your information and tell your family and friends.</p>

punish more severely.</p>

<div class="bq_s">
<h2>9. Security of Information</h2>
<p>We may, but are not obligated to, secure the Site with packs of hungry bunnies; we hope they don't eat your information. However, we make no representations as to the security or privacy of your information. It is in our interest to keep the Site secure, but we recommend that you use anti-virus software, firewalls, and other precautions to protect yourself from security threats. If you become aware of any breach of Site security or this Privacy Policy, please notify us immediately. (Be the third pig, not one of the first two.)</p>
</div>
<div class="bq_s">
<h2>10. California Online Privacy Protection Act</h2>
<p>We allow California users to use the Site, and we fully comply with California's privacy laws. If you have any questions about your rights under this Privacy Policy, please contact us for more information.</p>
</div>
<div class="bq_s">
<h2>11. Amendments</h2>
<p>We may amend this Privacy Policy from time to time, and the amended version will be posted on the Site in place of the old version. We will also include the date that the currently displayed Privacy Policy took effect to help you determine whether there have been any changes since you last used the Site. Like our Terms of Service, you must visit this page each time you come to the Site, and read and agree to it if the date it was last modified is more recent than the last time you agreed to the Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to the new Privacy Policy, you must immediately cease using our service.</p>
</div>
<div class="bq_s">
<h2>12. Location of this Site.</h2>
<p>This Site is hosted and operated in the United States. However, we and our third party service providers may, in our effort to provide the Site, store Collected Information in the United States, or we may transfer it to, and store it within, other countries.</p>
</div>
<div class="bq_s">
<p>Those who access or use the Site from jurisdictions outside the United States do so at their own choice and risk and are solely responsible for compliance with local law. If you are not a resident of the United States, you acknowledge and agree that we may collect and use your personal information outside your home jurisdiction, and that we may store your personal information in the United States or elsewhere. Please note that the level of legal protection provided in the United States or other non-European countries from which you may access our Site may not be as stringent as that under European Union privacy standards or the privacy laws of some other countries, possibly including your home jurisdiction.</p>
