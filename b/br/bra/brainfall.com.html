<p align="center"><strong>BrainFall.com, Inc. Privacy Policy</strong><br>
    <strong>(Last Updated: June 18,  2007)</strong></p>
<p align="left"> <br>
  BrainFall.com, Inc. (“BrainFall”)  has created this privacy policy (the “<strong>Policy</strong>”) to explain our privacy  practices so you will understand when and how personal information is  collected, used, disclosed and protected with respect to our services (“<strong>Service</strong>”)  and Web site (“<strong>Site</strong>”) located at <strong><u><a href="http://www.rupture.com/">http://www.brainfall.com</a></u></strong>. By  using the Service, you consent to the privacy practices described in this  Policy.<br>
  We reserve the right to  change this Policy at any time. If we make any material changes to our Policy,  we will post a new policy on our Site and update the “last updated” date set  forth above. Therefore, we encourage you to check our Policy whenever you use  the Service to see if it has been updated since your last visit.<br>
  <strong>INFORMATION ABOUT YOU</strong><br>
  We collect two basic  types of information with our Service, namely personal information and  aggregate information. Personal information is information that is directly  associated with a specific person or entity such as a user’s e-mail address and  user-chosen ID and password. <br>
  Our definition of  personal information does not include “aggregate” information. Aggregate  information is data we collect about a group or category of services or users  from which individual user identities have been removed. In other words,  information on how you use our Service may be collected and combined with  information about how others use the Service, but no personal information will  be included in the resulting data. Aggregate data helps us understand trends in  our users’ needs so that we can better consider new features or otherwise  tailor our Service. We may share aggregate information about our users with  third parties for various purposes, including to help us better understand and  improve our Service, and for advertising and marketing purposes.<br>
  Those are the types of  personal and other information we collect. You should refer to the rest of this  Policy to see how we use, disclose and protect this information:<br>
  <strong>Information You Give  Us.</strong><br>
  We collect information  you give us at various times when you register with us and use our Service.  Examples include the following:<br>
  <strong>Registration  and Transaction Information.&nbsp; </strong>When you register to  use the Service, we may collect various kinds of contact information about you  including your e-mail address. You will also be asked to create a user-chosen  ID and password for your use when accessing the Service. <br>
  <strong>Submissions  and Customer Service. </strong>&nbsp;From  time-to-time we may post surveys, contests or sweepstakes on our Service, which  may request demographic information and customer feedback.&nbsp; Participation in these requests is completely  voluntary and with each request you will have the choice of whether or not to  participate and disclose information.&nbsp; We  may also collect personal information if you provide it via e-mail, message  boards, or other interactive services. Please do not post any information that  you expect to keep private.&nbsp; In addition,  we may collect and retain information that identifies you personally when you  send us comments, questions or suggestions. <br>
  <strong>Automatically Collected  Information.</strong><br>
  We automatically  receive certain types of information whenever you interact with us. For  example, when you use the Service, our systems may automatically collect your  IP address and the type of operating system or browser you use. In addition,  when you opt to record the results of your quizzes on your profile for the  Facebook service, available at <a href="http://www.facebook.com/">http://www.facebook.com</a> (“Facebook”), we automatically collect your Facebook user id and the results of  any quizzes taken via the Service.<br>
  We may also collect  information pertaining to any transactions conducted by you on the Site,  information pertaining to the files accessed or used by you, and standard  access information, such as the time and date of accessing the Service, the  country from which the Service is being accessed, and usage of the Service. We  use such information to help manage the effectiveness of our online advertising  and to gather access information, such as counting the users who have visited  those pages and compiling aggregated statistics about Service usage.<br>
  We may use cookie  technology to collect information so that we can improve our Site by seeing  which areas and features are most popular; to personalize the Site and improve  the Site experience; and to allow you to visit the Site without re-entering  your member ID and/or password. In addition, our third party advertisers may also  place cookies on your browser. Most browsers automatically accept cookies as  the default setting. You can modify the setting to reject cookies or to prompt  you before accepting a cookie from the sites you visit by editing browser  options. If you decide not to accept our cookies or those of our third party  advertisers, you may not be able to use some of the Site’s features or  services, and you may have a less satisfactory experience. <br>
  <strong>No Information about  Children.</strong><br>
  Our Service is not  intended to be used by children under the age of 13, and we do not knowingly,  directly or passively, collect information from children under the age of 13.  If we create offers and products that make it appropriate to collect  information from children under the age of 13, we will notify you of the change  in this Policy.<br>
  <strong>USE OF PERSONAL  INFORMATION</strong><br>
  <strong>Internal Use of  Personal Information.</strong><br>
  All contact information  submitted by you is stored in our database and may be archived elsewhere. Our  records are stored indefinitely in the form of a database, as are our archival  backup copies.&nbsp; <br>
  Access to your personal  information will be limited to specific BrainFall employees. In general, we use  personal information internally to serve our users and enable them to take  maximum advantage of our Service. For example, personal information may be used  to conduct marketing analysis, to create an individual profile and provide  personalized services, to provide services or complete transactions you have  requested, to anticipate and resolve problems with our Service, to respond to  customer support inquiries, and to create and inform you of new products and  services from BrainFall that better meet your needs. Personal information may  also be used to compare usage data. By registering with our Service, you give  consent for us to communicate with you at any of the contact points you provide  to us for any of the aforementioned purposes.<br>
  You should review the  following section to understand when BrainFall discloses personal information  to non-affiliated third parties.<br>
  <strong>Disclosure of Personal  Information.</strong><br>
  We do not rent, sell,  or share personal information about you with other people or non-affiliated  companies except (i) as may be necessary to perform internal analyses and  business functions, (ii) as part of a business transfer, or (iii) when required  by law or permitted to protect our rights, property, or safety. The following  section describes these disclosure circumstances more fully.</p>
<div align="left">
  <ul type="disc">
    <li><strong>Business Functions. </strong>We may share       personal information with third party vendors who assist us in performing       internal functions necessary to operate our business.

    <li><strong>Internal Analysis. </strong>We may use       information about you for our own internal purposes, such as to estimate       our audience size, measure aggregate traffic patterns as well as to       understand demographic, customer interest, and other trends among our users.       We may outsource these tasks and disclose personal information about you       to third parties in aggregate, provided the use and disclosure of your       personal information by these third parties is restricted to performance       of such tasks. </li>
    <li><strong>Business Transfers.</strong> Information about       our users and the Service is one of our most important business assets.       Therefore, information about our users, including personal information,       will be disclosed as part of any merger or acquisition, creation of a       separate business to provide the Service or fulfill products, sale or       pledge of company assets as well as in the event of an insolvency,       bankruptcy or receivership in which personal information would be       transferred as one of the business assets of the company. </li>
    <li><strong>Protection of BrainFall and Others.</strong> We may release       personal information in the good faith belief that release is appropriate       and necessary to comply with legal process or authority (e.g., a lawful       subpoena, warrant or court order); to enforce or apply our policies; to       initiate, render, bill, and collect for amounts owed to us; to protect our       rights, property, or personal safety of BrainFall, our users, our       employees, or the public; or if we reasonably believe that an emergency       involving immediate danger of death or serious physical injury to any       person requires disclosure of communications or justifies disclosure of       records without delay. </li>
  </ul>
