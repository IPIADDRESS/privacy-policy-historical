<p>BrainyHistory respects the privacy concerns of the users of its Internet Sites ("Sites"), and has created this privacy statement to explain what information we gather from your visit to our Sites, and how such information may be used.</p>
<h3>Use of Information</h3>
<p>As a general policy, no personally identifiable information, such as your name or address, is automatically collected from your visit to BrainyHistory. However, certain non-personal information is recorded by the standard operation of BrainyHistory's Internet servers. Information such as the type of browser being used, its operating system, and your IP address is gathered in order to enhance your online experience. For example, it may be used to tailor content and advertising to your interests.</p>
<p>In special cases, BrainyHistory may disclose user information when there is reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be causing injury to, or interference (either intentionally or unintentionally) with, BrainyHistory's rights or property, other BrainyHistory web site users, or anyone else that could be harmed by such activities.</p>
