	<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
	<h2>Last updated: Nov 21, 2013</h2>
	
	<hr class="infoLineBreak">
		
	<p>
		We do not take responsibility for any content that a user may post on brandyourself.com (the “Website”). Information that is posted on the Website must 
		abide by the <a href="/info/about/terms">Terms of Service</a>. We will take reasonable measures to ensure that personal information is kept private. 
		All information is posted at the user's risk.  
	</p>
	
	<h3>The Information We Collect</h3>
	<p>
		When you register with BrandYourself, you provide us willingly with certain personal information like your name, address, email address, demographic 
		information, financial information, employment information and/or other personal information.
	</p>
	<br>
	<p>
		When you enter BrandYourself, we automatically collect your browser type and Internet Protocol (“IP”) address. This information is gathered for all 
		BrandYourself visitors and helps us determine how often different areas of our site are visited.  We may link IP addresses to information that is 
		personally identifiable.  In addition, we store certain information from your browser using "cookies." A cookie is a piece of data stored on the 
		user's computer tied to information about the user. We use session ID cookies to confirm that users are logged in and to enable us to facilitate 
		access to different aspects of the Website.  For example, by showing when and how you and others visit the Website, cookies help us to see which 
		pages of the Website are popular and which are not.  Cookies can also help us to improve your enjoyment of the Website, for example, by remembering 
		your address or other personal information when you request information or services on the Website.  You can remove or block this cookie using the 
		settings in your browser if you want to disable this convenience feature.  Please be aware that disabling this function may impact your use and 
		enjoyment of the Website.
	</p>
	<br>
	<p>
		If you choose to provide us with access to an account you have with a social network service such as Facebook or LinkedIn, then we may collect certain 
		account related information.  For example, if you provide us your Facebook account information or permission to access your Facebook account, then we 
		may access the information contained in your account and profile including, without limitation, the primary email address you associate with your 
		Facebook account, your gender, our name, your birthdate, your country or locale, your Facebook friends, information about your Facebook friends, and 
		other such accessible information.  One purpose of this is so that we can analyze such information to help you make your profiles more search engine 
		friendly.
	</p>
	<br>
	<p>
		You may also create a BrandYourself profile. When you do so, you post content at your own risk. Any improper collection or misuse of information 
		provided on BrandYourself is a violation of the BrandYourself <a href="/info/about/terms">Terms of Service</a> and should be reported. BrandYourself 
		may also gather information about you from other sources. By using BrandYourself, you are consenting to have your personal data transferred to and 
		processed in the United States. 
	</p>
		
	<h3>Children Under Age 13</h3>
	<p>
		The Website is not directed toward anyone under the age of 13, and BrandYourself does not knowingly collect or solicit personal information from 
		anyone under the age of 13 or knowingly allow such persons to register. If you are under 13, please do not attempt to register for BrandYourself. 
		No one under age 13 may provide any personal information to or on BrandYourself. In the event that we learn that we have collected personal information 
		from a child under age 13 without verification of parental consent, we will delete that information as quickly as possible. If you believe that we 
		might have any information from or about a child under 13, please contact us. 	
	</p>
		
	<h3>Children Between the Ages of 13 and 18</h3>
	<p>
		We recommend that minors over the age of 13 ask their parents for permission before sending any information about themselves to anyone over the Internet.
	</p>
		
	<h3>Use of Information Obtained by BrandYourself</h3>
	<p>
		We may use personal information about you by including it in our company directory located at 
		<a href="http://brandyourself.com/directory">http://brandyourself.com/directory</a> (or such other web address or medium, including without limitation 
		print or other electronic form, as determined by us) (“Directory”), or otherwise with your consent.  
		We may occasionally use your name and email address to send you notifications regarding new services offered by BrandYourself that we think you may 
		find valuable. (You can customize the type and frequency of our email communication in your settings). We may also send you service-related 
		announcements from time to time through the general operation of the service.
	</p>
	<br>
	<p>
		We may use information about you that we collect from other sources to help you search engine optimize your links. For example, we may analyze the 
		name you use on your Facebook profile and let you know you should change it to help your Facebook profile rank higher in search results. 
	</p>
	<br>
	<p>
		All sharing of information is done at your own risk. Please keep in mind that if you disclose personal information on the Website this information 
		may become publicly available. 
	</p>
	<br>
	<p>
		Nonpersonally identifiable information is information that does not reflect or reference an individually identifiable user or that no longer reflects 
		or references an individually identifiable user.  We may collect, store, use, and share non-personally identifiable information for any purpose 
		whatsoever at our discretion.
	</p>
	<br>
	<p>
		We maintain full rights to any information collected on the Website, and may freely collect, store, use, share, and disclose such information unless 
		prohibited by this Privacy Policy or applicable law.  
	</p>
	<br>
	<p>
		In the event of a change in control of our company or sale of substantially all of the assets or business of our company, any information owned by or 
		in the control of us may be transferred to such successor, who will comply with the terms of this Privacy Policy.
	</p>
		
	<h3>Sharing Your Information with Third Parties</h3>
	<p>
		Other than (a) in the Directory, (b) if necessary to operate the Website, (c) required by law to protect our right or the rights of others, or 
		(d) with your consent, we will not share your information with third parties. We may let you choose to share information with marketers or electronic 
		commerce providers through sponsored groups or other on-site offers. 
	</p>
		
	<h3>Links</h3>
	<p>
		BrandYourself may contain links to other websites not maintained by or related to us. We are of course not responsible for the privacy practices or 
		policies of such other web sites.  To the extent that you disclose personally identifiable information to any such third parties, different rules may 
		apply to their use and disclosure of personal information that you disclose to them.  Users should be aware when leaving our site to read the privacy 
		statements of each and every web site that collects personally identifiable information.  This Privacy Policy applies solely to information collected 
		by BrandYourself. 	
	</p>
		
	<h3>Third Party Advertising</h3>
	<p>

		Third party advertisers have no access to your contact information stored on BrandYourself unless you choose to share it with them. This privacy policy covers the use
		of cookies by BrandYourself and does not cover the use of cookies or other tracking technologies by any of its advertisers.
	</p>
		
	<h3>Changing or Removing Information</h3>
	<p>
		Access and control over personal information on BrandYourself is available.  You may also contact us with your change or removal request at 
		<a href="mailto:support@brandyourself.com">support@brandyourself.com</a>.	
	</p>
		
	<h3>Security</h3>
	<p>
		We limit access to personally identifiable information about you to our employees and third party agents who we reasonably believe need to have
		 access to such information to provide you with the information or services you request from us.
	</p>
	<br>
	<p>
		The Website has security measures in place to help protect against the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control.  While we 
		cannot guarantee that loss, misuse or alteration to data will not occur, we use industry standards, such as Secure Socket Layer technology (SSL), to 
		help safeguard against such occurrences.  In certain areas, the information passed between your browser and our system is encrypted with SSL technology 
		to create a protected connection between you and the Website to ensure confidentiality.  In the event that a breach into our security systems occurs 
		and there is a possibility that an unauthorized person acquires your personal information, we will notify of such breach pursuant to applicable law.
	</p>

	<h3>Visiting our Website from Outside the US</h3>
	<p>
		This Privacy Policy is intended to cover collection of information the Website from residents of the United States.  If you are visiting the 
		Website from outside the United States, please be aware that your information may be transferred to, stored, and processed in the United States 
		where our servers are located and our central database is operated.  The data protection and other laws of the United States and other countries 
		might not be as comprehensive as those in your country.  Please be assured that we seek to take reasonable steps to ensure that your privacy is 
		protected.  By using our services, you understand that your information may be transferred to our facilities and those third parties with whom we 
		share it as described in this Privacy Policy.

		be effective upon posting to the Website.  Material changes will be conspicuously posted on the Website.  We encourage you to refer to this policy 
		on an ongoing basis so that you understand our current privacy policy. Unless stated otherwise, our current privacy policy applies to all information
