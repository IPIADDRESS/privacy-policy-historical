	  		<p>We do not take responsibility for any content that a user may post. Information that is posted must abide by the Terms of Use. We will take reasonable measures to ensure that personal information is kept private. All information is posted at the user's risk.</p>

			<h2>The Information We Collect</h2>

			<p>When you connect third party accounts like your Facebook or LinkedIn profile, we collect your public profile info so that we can analyze it help you make your profiles more search engine friendly.</p>

			<h2>Children Between the Ages of 13 and 18</h2>
			<p>We recommend that minors over the age of 13 ask their parents for permission before sending any information about themselves to anyone over the Internet.</p>

			<p>We may use information about you that we collect from other sources to help you search engine optimize your links. For example, we may analyze the name you use on your Facebook profile and let you know you should change it to help your Facebook profile rank higher in search results.</p>

			<h2>Sharing Your Information with Third Parties</h2>

			<p>We will not share your information with third parties. We may not let you choose to share information with marketers or electronic commerce providers through sponsored groups or other on-site offers. If the ownership of all or substantially all of the BrandYourself business, or individual business units owned by BrandYourself, LLC, were to change, your user information may be transferred to the new owner so the service can continue operations.
