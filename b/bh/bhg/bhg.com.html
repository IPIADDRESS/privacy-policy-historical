            (such as their names, email addresses, and phone numbers) over the

            information collected as you navigate through our sites. Third-party
            providers featured on or linked to by our websites, such as vendors
            of products and services offered through our sites, may gather the

            on our sites, we ask you to register. When you register, we collect
            personally identifiable information about you including your name,
            mailing address, email address, user name and password. We may also
            ask for some additional information, for example, hobbies, age, browser
            type, and the like, but you're free to register without providing
            this information if you prefer. In addition, at various other points
            on our sites, we may ask you for personal information including when
            you: place an order for products, complete a survey, and report a
            problem with one of our sites. We use this information to process
            your orders and to help improve our sites.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">From time to time, we also

            partners. If you choose to participate in one of these contests or
            promotions, you'll have to provide some information about yourself
            (such as name, address, and email address). We may share this information
            with co-sponsors of the contest or other promotional partners, but
            we will always identify the other parties involved (for example, in
            the contest rules). We don’t control these third parties’ privacy
            practices, and our Privacy Policy does not apply to their collection
            and use of personal information. We urge you to review their privacy
            policies and learn how they will use the information before participating.
            If you don’t want us to collect the information requested in the promotion,
            or to provide it to our cosponsors or partners, please do not participate

            to your browser from a web server and stored on your computer's hard 
            drive. A cookie contains a unique number that allows our sites to 
            identify your computer. For example, cookies allow us to keep track 
            of your user name and password (if you are a registered visitor) so 
            you don’t have to re-enter that information each time you visit our 
            site. We also use cookies to make sure you don’t see the same ads 
            repeatedly when you visit our sites. The help function on most browsers 
            contains information on how to set your browser to notify you before 
            accepting cookies or to disable cookies entirely. However, if you 
            don’t accept cookies, you won’t be able to take advantage of various 
            features on our sites that are available to other visitors. In addition,

            target advertisements that you see on the pages of our sites and to 
            serve and target promotions or other marketing messages. This advertising 
            company also collects "clickstream data," information about your visit 
            to our site and to other sites, that can be aggregated and used to 
            target advertising on this and other sites, and used for marketing 
            research and other similar purposes. This clickstream data does not 
            include personally identifying information such as your name, address, 
            email address or telephone number. This advertising company uses cookies 
            for many of the same reasons we do, and collects information directly 
            from our users. We share web site usage information about visitors 
            to our web site, who have received a targeted promotional campaign, 
            with this advertising company for the purpose of targeting future 
            campaigns and upgrading visitor information used in reporting statistics. 
            For this purpose, we and our third-party advertising company note 
            some of the pages you visit on our web site through the use of pixel 
            tags (also called clear gifs). If you would like to know more about 
            its information gathering practice and "opt-out" procedures, please

            Your IP address is a number that is used by computers connected to
            the Internet to identify your computer so that data (such as the web
            pages you request) can be sent to you. Your IP address does not tell
            us who you are. Like the IP address, none of this other information
            identifies you personally either; we collect it for aggregate reporting
            on site activity that we, and our advertisers, may use. For example,
            we may want to know how long the average user spends on our site,
            which pages or features get the most attention, and the like. The
            aggregate information helps to understand our audience and confirm
            the value of advertising on our websites.</font></p>
