facilities or support to enable you to participate in an event. We
may collect health information if you tell us about your

collecting and why.</p>

interest to you, however no information will be shared in this way
without your permission.</p>

<h2>Keeping your records</h2>
<p>We keep records for as long as required to operate the service
in accordance with legal requirements and tax and accounting rules.
Where your information is no longer required, we will ensure it is
disposed of in a secure manner.</p>
<h2>Cookies</h2>
<p>We use different types of cookies to help our websites work
well. A cookie is a small file of letters and numbers that we may
put on your computer or mobile device. These cookies allow us to
distinguish you from other users of the website helping us to
provide you with a good experience when you browse our website and
also allows us to improve our site. For example cookies will tell
us whether you have visited our site before or whether you are a
new visitor, or they can be used to measure the effectiveness of
our online marketing campaigns, to ensure we are getting a good
return on investment from our digital marketing.</p>
<p>The main categories of cookies that we use are:</p>
<p><strong>1. Cookies that are necessary to run the
site<br></strong>Our sites use some cookies which are essential
to keeping the site working and provide the services you need.
These include cookies that enable you to:</p>
<ul>
<li>stay logged in for an entire visit to the site, or</li>
<li>add things to a shopping basket and keep them there until you
decide to check out.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>2. Cookies which help us improve the site</strong><br>
We use cookies to help us see how people are using our sites. These
are known as ‘analytics cookies’, ‘tracking cookies’ or ‘web
beacons’. We use analytics cookies:</p>
<ul>
<li>to see what website content is popular and how people are using
the site as they allow us to track users movement through our
websites.&nbsp; This type of information is amalgamated so that we
can build up a picture of how the site is performing.</li>
<li>to make sure we offer you a consistent service. For example, if
we are testing new website content or we want to run a survey, we
use cookies to remember what content you have seen or if you have
already been asked to join the survey.<br>
In addition, when we email you, we may place a tiny tag (also known
as ‘tracking pixel’ or ‘web beacon’) on the email we send out.
These do not collect any personal information, but they let us know
how many people are opening and reading our emails so that we can
choose more popular content.</li>
</ul>
<p>The information we collect using analytics cookies does not
involve collecting the name or address of any user. The analytics
cookies that we use only operate through our websites so they and
the data they collect are not shared with anyone else.</p>
<p><strong>3. Cookies which help us get value for money from
advertising</strong></p>
<p>We occasionally use other types of cookies that can track how
our advertisements perform.&nbsp; These cookies will help us
identify which advertisements resulted in a “click through” to the
BHF website or someone downloading one of our advice sheets.</p>
<h3>A note about Youtube cookies</h3>
<p>We have begun to embed our Youtube videos using the
‘Privacy-enhanced’ settings. This uses a cookie if the video is
