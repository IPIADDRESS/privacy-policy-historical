<p style="margin: 7.5pt 0cm;"><strong>What this privacy and cookie policy covers</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The British Heart Foundation is committed to protecting your personal information and being transparent about what information we hold, whether you are a donor, volunteer, shopper or campaigner.</p>
<p style="margin: 7.5pt 0cm;">Developing a better understanding of our supporters through their personal data allows us to fundraise more efficiently, which ultimately helps in the fight for every heartbeat. We have made improvements to this policy so that transparency is at the core of what we do, especially around our policy on profiling and wealth screening (see 'Fundraising' section below).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The purpose of this policy is to give you a clear explanation about how the BHF and all of its subsidiaries collects and uses the personal information you provide to us and that we collect, whether online, via phone, email, in letters or in any other correspondence or from third parties.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We ensure that we use your information in accordance with all applicable laws concerning the protection of personal information. This policy explains:</p>
<ul>
    <li style="text-align: justify;">What information the BHF may collect about you;</li>
    <li style="text-align: justify;">How we will use that information;</li>
    <li style="text-align: justify;">Whether we disclose your details to anyone else;</li>
    <li style="text-align: justify;">Your choices regarding the information you provide to us; and</li>
    <li style="text-align: justify;">How we use cookies to provide services to you or to improve your use of our websites.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you have any queries about this privacy and cookies policy please contact the Data Protection Officer at the Legal and Corporate Governance Department, British Heart Foundation, 180 Great Hampstead Road, London or email:&nbsp;<a href="mailto:dataprotection@bhf.org.uk" rel="nofollow">dataprotection@bhf.org.uk</a>.</p>

    <div class="faq-content wysiwyg" data-ui-component="faqBlock2">
        <p>We collect information in the following ways:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Information you give us.</strong> For example, when you engage with our social media or message boards, make a donation to us, register for an event or otherwise provide us with personal information. When you register, we’ll ask for personal information, like your name, email address and telephone number to store with your account.</li>
    <li><strong>Information we get from your use of our website and services.</strong> We collect information about the services you use and how you use them, like when you watch a video on YouTube, visit our websites or view and interact with our ads and content.</li>
    <li><strong>Information from third parties.</strong><span>We may also receive information about you from third parties. This can include information such as your name, postal address, email address, phone number, your </span><span>geographic location (for mobile devices), </span><span>credit/debit card details and whether you are a tax payer so that we can claim Gift Aid. </span><span>&nbsp;We, like all companies, are able to confirm what browser you are using, IP address and computer operating systems that are being used and this information may be used to improve the services we offer</span></li>
</ul>
<p>Wherever possible we use aggregated or anonymous information which does not identify individual visitors to our websites. See below, under&nbsp;<strong>Marketing materials</strong>&nbsp;– to understand our purposes for processing your personal information.</p>
<p><span>Data Protection law recognises that certain categories of personal information are more sensitive. This is known as sensitive personal data and covers health information, race, religious beliefs and political opinions. We do not usually collect ‘sensitive personal data’ about our supporters unless there is a clear reason for doing so, such as participation in a marathon or similar fundraising event or where we need this information to ensure that we provide appropriate facilities or support to enable you to participate in an event. </span></p>
<p><span>We may also collect&nbsp;sensitive personal data if you make the information public or if you tell us about your experiences relating to heart disease (for example, if you call our helpline, act as a case study for us or volunteer to be a ‘Heart Voice’); however we will always make it clear to you when we collect this information from you,&nbsp;<span style="text-align: justify;">what sensitive personal data we are collecting and why.&nbsp;</span><br>

    <div class="faq-content wysiwyg" data-ui-component="faqBlock5">
        <p>When we collect and use your personal information, we will make sure this is only done accordance with at least one of the legal grounds available to us under Data Protection law.
</p>
<p>One of these is where we have obtained your specific consent to use your information for a previously notified purpose, such as to send you email/text marketing or to provide you with a product, service or information at your request.</p>
<p>Another is where we have a legal obligation to use or disclose information about you – for instance, where we are ordered by a court or regulatory authority or we are legally required to hold donor transaction details for Gift Aid or accounting/tax purposes.</p>
<p>In certain instances, we may collect and use personal information where this is necessary in our legitimate interest as a charity, this includes being able to:</p>
<ul>
    <li>send direct marketing material to supporters by post or contacting them by telephone for fundraising purposes (subject to checking against the Telephone Preference Service and any existing marketing preferences). See more at <strong>Marketing Materials</strong> below;</li>
    <li>conduct research to better understand who our supporters are and better target our fundraising activity. See more at <strong>Fundraising</strong> below; </li>
    <li>monitor who we deal with to protect our charity against fraud, money laundering and other risks;</li>
    <li>maintain and administer our donor database and systems.</li>
</ul>
<p>
In all cases, we balance our legitimate interests against your rights as an individual and make sure we only use personal information in a way or for a purpose that you would reasonably expect in accordance with this Policy and that does not intrude on your privacy or previously expressed marketing preferences.
</p>
<p>Where we process sensitive personal data (as mentioned above), we will make sure that we only do so in accordance with one of the additional lawful grounds for processing such as where we have your explicit consent or you have made that information manifestly public. When we do this, we will tell you what sensitive personal data we are collecting and why.

        <p style="margin-bottom: 11.25pt; text-align: justify;"><span>We use multiple first and third party technologies such as pixel tags and web beacons to track and improve the user experience on our sites, quality of service and to monitor the effectiveness of campaigns and digital marketing activity. </span></p>

<ul>

    <li style="text-align: justify;"><span>make sure we offer you a consistent service. For example, if we are testing new website content or we want to run a survey, we use tracking to remember what content you have seen or if you have already been asked to join the survey.</span></li>
</ul>
