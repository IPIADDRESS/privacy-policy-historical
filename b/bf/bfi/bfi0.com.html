       <span class="insideh2">Epsilon Interactive Clients</span>

<br>
<br>



Epsilon Interactive works with the world's leading marketers to create permission-based email marketing programs that achieve superior results. 

<br><br>

Epsilon Interactive's role in supporting our clients may include hosting the actual collection site, delivery of email, tracking results of email campaigns, analysis of data, and transferring collected data back to the client. Epsilon Interactive is contractually bound to keep our clients' customer data private and this data is never shared across clients.

<br><br>

Some of our clients use Epsilon Interactive's email marketing technology platform to design and send their own campaigns. We have a stringent policy against sending unsolicited commercial email. If problems arise with a client's campaign, we will work with the client to resolve the problems and prevent them in the future. If Epsilon Interactive determines that a client has knowingly used our system for sending unsolicited commercial email, we will immediately revoke the client's permission to send email using our product or our system.

<br><br>

Internet user privacy is very important to Epsilon Interactive and our clients. The protection of consumers' information and privacy is a vital part of our business.

<br><br>

Before companies can use Epsilon Interactive technology to send email, they must commit to us in writing that consumers have agreed to receive such email messages. 

<br><br>

Epsilon Interactive is a licensee of the TRUSTe Privacy Program. Questions, concerns, comments and complaints can be addressed to <a href="mailto:privacy@epsiloninteractive.com" class="body3">privacy@epsiloninteractive.com</a>. 

<br><br>

TRUSTe is an independent, non-profit organization whose mission is to build users' trust and confidence in the Internet by promoting the use of fair information practices. For more information on TRUSTe, please <a href="http://www.truste.org/" target="_blank" class="body3">click here</a>. Because this Web site wants to demonstrate its commitment to users' privacy, it has agreed to disclose its information practices and have its privacy practices reviewed for compliance by TRUSTe. 

<br>
<br>

If you feel that this company is not abiding by its posted privacy policy, you should first contact Epsilon Interactive's Privacy Administrator by email at <a href="mailto:privacy@epsiloninteractive.com" class="body3">privacy@epsiloninteractive.com</a>. 

<br><br>

If you do not receive acknowledgment of your inquiry or your inquiry has not been addressed to your satisfaction, you can then contact <a href="http://www.truste.org/users/users_watchdog.php" target="_blank" class="body3">TRUSTe</a>. TRUSTe will then serve as a liaison to Epsilon Interactive for prompt complaint resolution.

       <span class="insideh2">Safe Harbor</span>

<br>
<br>




The collection of personal information by businesses is governed by Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 October 1995 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal information and on the free movement of such information, as well as the national legislation of European Union Member states. For more information, see <a href="http://europa.eu.int/comm/internal_market/privacy/index_en.htm" target="_blank" class="body3">http://europa.eu.int/comm/internal_market/privacy/index_en.htm</a>.

<br>
<br>

Epsilon Interactive enters into processing contracts with its clients in the EU that specify that the EU client recognizes that it is a data controller for the purposes of data protection legislation and therefore it will need to be in compliance with the relevant Member State national law. Any data processed by Epsilon Interactive is not further disclosed to third parties, except where required by the European client as a data controller or when required by law. Any information that our EU clients identify as sensitive will be treated as such.

<br><br>

Epsilon Interactive has a Privacy Administrator who is responsible for the internal supervision of Epsilon Interactive privacy policies and a team of technicians to handle data security. Epsilon Interactive educates its employees about compliance with the Safe Harbor Principles and has self-assessment procedures in place to ensure its compliance. <a href="http://www.truste.org/" target="_blank" class="body3">TRUSTe</a> serves as Epsilon Interactive's third-party dispute resolution provider.

<br><br>

We participate in the EU Safe Harbor Privacy Framework as set forth by the United States Department of Commerce. As part of our participation in the safe harbor, we have agreed to TRUSTe dispute resolution for disputes relating to our compliance with the Safe Harbor Privacy Framework.  If you have any complaints regarding our compliance with the Safe Harbor you should first contact us.  

<br><br>

If contacting us does not resolve your complaint, you may raise your complaint with TRUSTe by:



<ul><li type="square">Internet – <a href="http://www.truste.org/users/users_watchdog.php" target="_blank" class="body3">http://www.truste.org/users/users_watchdog.php</a>;</li>
