                  <p align="left">You can use this Site without providing your Personal Data, although doing so may limit your ability to obtain certain information or to use other valuable BD Services, including, for example, informational newsletters and responses to specific inquiries you may have. Where no Personal Data is legally required or is necessary for a particular service (for example, to contact you in response to your request), the use of a pseudonym is accepted.</p>
                  <p align="left">We keep your Personal Data only for as long as reasonably necessary for the purposes for which it was collected or to comply with any applicable legal reporting or document retention requirements. We will take reasonable steps to update, correct or, upon your request, delete your Personal Data in our possession that you have previously submitted via this Site. In order to request an update, with respect to your Personal Data, please contact us as provided below. If at any time you wish not to receive further communications, you may also follow the unsubscribe procedure included in our communication.</p>
                  <p align="left"><strong>Access</strong><a name="access"></a>. BD permits a reasonable right of access and review of Personal Data held by BD by the individual to whom the Personal Data relates; however, to guard against fraudulent requests for access, BD will require information which it determines is sufficient to allow it to confirm the identity of the person making the request before granting access or making corrections. BD will endeavor to provide the information in question within a reasonable time and may charge an appropriate cost (e.g. photocopying, mail charges) to the individual making the request. BD reserves the right not to change any Personal Data but will append alternative text the individual concerned believes is appropriate.</p>
                  <p align="left">In addition, in certain circumstances, BD may decline to provide access to Personal Data, including where BD determines that the information requested: </p>
                  <ul style="background-image: none;">
                  	<li style="background-image: none;">(a) May disclose:

                    <li style="background-image: none;">(e) Could reasonably result in serious harm to the treatment or recovery of the individual concerned, serious emotional harm to the individual or another individual, or serious bodily harm to another individual; or</li>
                    <li style="background-image: none;">(f) May harm or interfere with law enforcement activities or other investigative or regulatory functions of a body authorized by statute to perform such functions.</li>

                    <br>
                    Please note that although after receiving a request to update, correct or delete information, we will make reasonable efforts to effect such a change promptly, it is not always possible to complete the process before another communication is distributed. We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause. Even if you have requested removal of your Personal Data from our lists, BD reserves the right to retain it in our files in some limited circumstances such as when such Personal Data may be necessary to honor your request to opt out of further communications, resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems or as provided in our <a href="/legal/terms.asp">Terms and Conditions</a>. If BD is required to retain any portion of the Personal Data for such purposes, BD shall use reasonable efforts to limit such Personal Data to what is necessary to accomplish the particular purpose. Further, you acknowledge that due to technical constraints and the fact that we back up our systems, Personal Data may continue to reside in our systems even after deletion. Therefore, you should not expect that your Personal Data will be completely removed from our systems in response to your request.<br>
                    <br>
                    BD will not respond to repetitious or vexatious requests for access. In determining whether a request is repetitious or vexatious, it will consider such factors as the frequency with which information is updated, the purpose for which the information is used, and the nature of the information.<br>

                  <p>BD uses the Personal Data you provide for our business purposes in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Statement and Consent. </p>
                  <ul>
                    <li> If you provide Personal Data for a certain reason, that Personal Data will be available to us for use in connection with the reason for which it was provided or for a consistent purpose, including, if applicable, processing an order placed by you or informing you that the product is no longer available. For instance, if you contact us by e-mail, we may use the Personal Data you provide to respond to you; or if you contact us about a job listing, the information you provide to us may be used to consider you for the position. We may also combine Personal Data that you have provided to us with information obtained by us from other parties.<br>
                    </li>
                    <li>BD and its affiliates also may use your Personal Data, User Data and other information collected through the Site to help us improve the content and functionality of the Site, to better understand our customers and markets, to improve our products and services and to effect and facilitate sales. <br>
                    </li>
                    <li> BD and its affiliates may use this information to contact you, electronically, through telemarketing or otherwise, in the future to tell you about, and to offer for sale, products or services we believe will be of interest to you. If we do so, each communication we send you will contain instructions permitting you to "opt out" of receiving future communications. </li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>If at any time you wish not to receive any future communications or to have your name deleted from our mailing lists, you may follow the "unsubscribe" procedure included with our communication.

                  <p><strong><u>Do We Share the Information that We Receive?<a name="share"></a></u></strong></p>
                  <p>BD considers your information to be a vital part of our relationship with you. BD will share information including Personal Data with its subsidiaries and affiliates that have also agreed to be bound by this Privacy Statement and Consent. In addition, BD, like many businesses, sometimes hires other companies to perform certain business-related functions. Examples include mailing information, maintaining databases and processing payments. When we retain another non-affiliated company to perform a function of this nature, we seek to provide them with only the information that they need to perform their specific functions, and we require them to protect your Personal Data in accordance with this Privacy Statement and Consent and BD's restrictions.</p>
                  <p>In addition, if you input Personal Data on a co-branded registration page, relating, for example, to a contest co-sponsored by both BD and a partner company, then your Personal Data will be available both to BD and to such partner company. While BD will only use such Personal Data in accordance with this Privacy Statement and Consent, such partner company's use of your Personal Data will be subject to the privacy policy of that company and BD cannot be responsible for their use of your information. We encourage you to review the privacy policy of such partner company before providing information on any such co-sponsored page or promotion.</p>
                  <p>There are also a limited number of circumstances in which we may share your Personal Data and other information in our possession with certain additional third parties without further notice to you, as set forth below:</p>
                  <p><strong>Legal Requirements:</strong><a name="require"></a> BD may disclose your Personal Data, User Data and other information if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to (a) comply with a legal obligation, (b) protect and defend the rights or property of BD or its affiliates, (c) act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of the Site or the public, or (d) protect against legal liability.</p>
                  <p><strong>Business Transfers, Combinations and Related Activities:<a name="btransfers"></a></strong> As we develop our business, we might sell, buy, restructure or reorganize businesses or assets. In the event of any sale, merger, reorganization, restructuring, dissolution or similar event involving our business or assets, Personal Data may be part of the transferred assets.</p>
                  <p>BD is the parent company of a large international group of companies. In light of this fact, we may, from time to time transfer your Personal Data to one of our databases in another country as provided above under the heading <a href="#transfer">Transfer of Your Data Abroad</a>.</p>

                  <p>In addition, if you submit unsolicited Personal Data we will use it as provided herein, however, the other information included in such unsolicited submission is not covered by this Privacy Statement and Consent.

                  <p>Please note that, as set forth above, this Privacy Statement and Consent does not apply to the providing or use of certain Personal Data other than through the Site nor to the providing or use of Personal Data of past or present employees of, or consultants engaged by, Becton, Dickinson and Company and/or its subsidiaries, for employment or benefits administration purposes, both of which are governed by BD Policies designed for those respective purposes.</p>
