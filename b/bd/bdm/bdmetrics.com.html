Cookies are text files that are placed by a client server onto the browser of a visitor to a Web
site. &nbsp;These files are generally harmless to the visitor’s computer and can store navigation
information as the visitor moves about a Web site. &nbsp;Generally, cookies do not provide PII
about the individual who is using the computer (only the computer used to access the Web
through what is known as the IP address). &nbsp;Cookies can perform many important and useful
functions, such as helping website owners determine which sections of their sites are more
appealing to their visitors and helping speed the Web experience by eliminating the need to enter user names and passwords constantly.
