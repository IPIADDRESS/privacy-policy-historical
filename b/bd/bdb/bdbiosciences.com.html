          <strong>Access</strong>
          <a name="access" id="access">&nbsp;</a>. BD permits a reasonable right of access and review of Personal Data held by BD by the individual to whom the Personal Data relates; however, to guard against fraudulent requests for access, BD will require information which it determines is sufficient to allow it to confirm the identity of the person making the request before granting access or making corrections. BD will endeavor to provide the information in question within a reasonable time and may charge an appropriate cost (e.g. photocopying, mail charges) to the individual making the request. BD reserves the right not to change any Personal Data but will append alternative text the individual concerned believes is appropriate.</p>
        <p align="left">In addition, in certain circumstances, BD may decline to provide access to Personal Data, including where BD determines that the information requested:</p>
        <ul style="LIST-STYLE-TYPE: none; LIST-STYLE-IMAGE: none">

<br><br></li>
          <li>(e) Could reasonably result in serious harm to the treatment or recovery of the individual concerned, serious emotional harm to the individual or another individual, or serious bodily harm to another individual; or

          <li>(f) May harm or interfere with law enforcement activities or other investigative or regulatory functions of a body authorized by statute to perform such functions.
<br><br></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Please note that although after receiving a request to update, correct or delete information, we will make reasonable efforts to effect such a change promptly, it is not always possible to complete the process before another communication is distributed. We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause. Even if you have requested removal of your Personal Data from our lists, BD reserves the right to retain it in our files in some limited circumstances such as when such Personal Data may be necessary to honor your request to opt out of further communications, resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems or as provided in our <a href="/legal/terms/">Terms and Conditions</a>. If BD is required to retain any portion of the Personal Data for such purposes, BD shall use reasonable efforts to limit such Personal Data to what is necessary to accomplish the particular purpose. Further, you acknowledge that due to technical constraints and the fact that we back up our systems, Personal Data may continue to reside in our systems even after deletion. Therefore, you should not expect that your Personal Data will be completely removed from our systems in response to your request.</p>
        <p>BD will not respond to repetitious or vexatious requests for access. In determining whether a request is repetitious or vexatious, it will consider such factors as the frequency with which information is updated, the purpose for which the information is used, and the nature of the information.</p>

While BD will only use such Personal Data in accordance with this Privacy Statement and Consent, such partner company's use of your Personal Data will be subject to the privacy policy of that company and BD cannot be responsible for their use of your information. We encourage you to review the privacy policy of such partner company before providing information on any such co-sponsored page or promotion.</p><p>There are also a limited number of circumstances in which we may share your Personal Data and other information in our possession with certain additional third parties without further notice to you, as set forth below:</p><p><strong>Legal Requirements:</strong><a name="require" id="require">&nbsp;</a> BD may disclose your Personal Data, User Data and other information if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to (a) comply with a legal obligation, (b) protect and defend the rights or property of BD or its affiliates, (c) act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of the Site or the public, or (d) protect against legal liability.</p><p><strong>Business Transfers, Combinations and Related Activities:<a name="btransfers" id="btransfers">&nbsp;</a></strong> As we develop our business, we might sell, buy, restructure or reorganize businesses or assets.
