</div>
<p class="agbTermText">Before a child under 13 can use a Game, Bigpoint requires registration and consent from a parent. During the registration process only the child’s account name, the child’s email address, the parent’s email address and the child’s password are collected and stored. If the child is under 13, the age of the child is not stored.
  The registration information is only used to confirm the registration and to send the parent a message asking for consent and allowing the parent to activate the child’s user account.
  Once the parent consents to the registration and storage of personal information of the child, this personal information is only used to provide the Game and related services and to send information about Bigpoint Games. Children’s information is not disclosed to third parties except for purposes of operating and providing the Game as detailed in Section 4. Bigpoint does not condition a child's participation in a Game or activity on the child providing more personal information than is reasonably necessary for that activity.
  Parents can access any personal information collected online, correct or modify any such personal information, or direct us to delete or make no further use of your child’s or your personal information. To do so, please send an email with your request to stop@bigpoint.com or contact us via phone or mail as detailed in Section 10.
  In the event that we learn that we have collected personal information from a child under age thirteen without parental consent we will delete that information as quickly as possible. If you know or have reason to believe that we might have collected any information from or about a child under thirteen without parental consent, please contact us at stop@bigpoint.com.
  Bigpoint may collect further personal information from the parent as detailed below.
  *Not all Bigpoint Games are suitable for children under the age of 13. Bigpoint restricts access to such games to players that meet the age requirement.</p><div class="agbTermTitle">

third party while you are utilizing a Bigpoint service or while on a Bigpoint website.
If you play a Game at a third-party SNS, Bigpoint will be able to access and store information about you as described herein. The categories of
information you share will depend, in part, on the privacy settings you have established at the SNS where you access the application. The SNS may allow
you to control how you share information with a third-party application (for example, a Bigpoint game as an application on the SNS website) through
your privacy settings on the SNS.  Bigpoint does not control the privacy settings made available through the SNS to the users of the SNS.  Bigpoint
refers you to the SNS’ privacy policy posted on the SNS’ site to determine what options are available regarding privacy settings on the SNS.</p><p class="topLink"><a href="#privacy_top">Back to top</a></p><br><br><div class="agbTermTitle">
