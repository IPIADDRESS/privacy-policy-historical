<p><strong>What happens from a technical point of view when my
personal information is submitted through the Website?</strong></p>
<p>When your personal information is collected through a page on
the Website it is directed into one or more IT systems. It is then
stored and used depending on which BPP company or training entity
the information needs to go to in order for (e.g.) your request for
information to be processed, for you to be registered on a training
course or for your to receive related course materials. Your
personal information may be held on the IT system of the BPP group
company (e.g. for the purpose of providing training or educational
services to you) and/or on the system of another company (within or
outside the BPP group of companies) outside the UK which is
providing IT hosting or similar services, in accordance with a
suitable contract in place with that company.</p>
<p><a href="/privacy-policy.aspx#backtoQs">Back to list</a></p>
<p><a name="whoweshareinfo" title="Bookmark Target"></a><strong>Who do we share your personal
information with?</strong></p>
<p>The BPP company to whom your personal information is directed
through the Website may transfer your personal information to other
companies in the Apollo group of companies which includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Other companies in the BPP group of companies (including BPP
Holdings&nbsp;Limited and its subsidiaries and affiliates);
and</li>
<li>Apollo Group, Inc. and/or Apollo Global, Inc. (and subsidiaries
and affiliates of each of them) which are companies based in the
US</li>
</ul>
<p>(together “Apollo Group Companies”).</p>
<p>We may make your personal information available to other
businesses which we engage to help us run our business, for example
to provide services to us.&nbsp; This may include (this is not a
definitive list) market research companies, providers of direct
marketing services, training providers, suppliers of services
relating to whistleblowing (please see the “Whistleblowing and
Compliance with US SOX Law” section below) and IT hosting and
maintenance providers. &nbsp;In addition (if you are a student or
delegate on one of our courses) we may make your personal
information available to external awarding bodies and auditors
which verify your test and examination results, in order to obtain
accreditations for you.&nbsp; We may also make it available to
relevant central government departments or other external bodies
which oversee the quality of the services we provide and the
process of awarding qualifications and accreditations.&nbsp; In
accordance with the requirement of the Data Protection Act 1998 we
would impose restrictions and standards in our written contract
with them in order to ensure they keep your personal information
secure and that they use it only for the purpose for which we
provide it to them.&nbsp; If these businesses are outside the UK,
the section “Will my personal information be transferred outside
the UK?” below will be relevant.</p>
<p>We may be required by law or for tax or other purposes to
disclose your personal information to local or central government
authorities or official agencies.&nbsp; We may be required by law
or legal process (i.e. by a court or tribunal) to release it to
other external organisations.&nbsp; We may also release it to
parties to which you authorise us to release it.&nbsp; In addition,
there may be circumstances in which it is necessary for us to
disclose your personal information to external companies or
organisations in order to protect our customers or our own
interests but this would be carried out in compliance with
applicable privacy laws.</p>
<p>We will not sell your personal information to any third party
except where necessary as part of our legitimate business processes
(e.g. in the event that our management or administration is to be
taken over by an external organisation).&nbsp; Should we do this we
would ensure it was carried out in accordance with the Data
Protection Act 1998.</p>

<p><a name="outsideukeurope" title="Bookmark Target"></a><strong>Will my personal information be
transferred outside the UK and/or Europe?</strong></p>
<p>We may wish to transfer your personal information to the US or
to other countries (for example, to an overseas service provider,
training product manufacturer, agent or supplier) for the purposes
described above.&nbsp; If you are using the Website from outside
the UK other laws may apply to your personal information.&nbsp; We
are not subject to local laws applicable in your country and this
privacy policy may not be compliant with those local laws.&nbsp;
You should not submit your personal information to us unless you
accept this position.</p>
<p>We may transfer your personal information to the US to Apollo
Group, Inc. and/or Apollo Global, Inc. for the purposes described
above (including but not limited to the statistical analysis
purpose described above).<br>
The Website may be hosted on servers located outside the UK and/or
Europe and maintenance and support services for the Website may be
provided from outside the UK and/or Europe.&nbsp; This means your
personal information may be stored in other countries.</p>
<p>All of this means that your personal information may be
transferred to other countries which do not have the same privacy
laws as are applicable in the UK and other parts of Europe.&nbsp;
However, in order to prevent unauthorised access or disclosure,
damage or loss of your personal information, we take suitable
physical and electronic, organisational and technical measures to
this end, in accordance with our obligations under the Data
Protection Act 1998. In addition, any transfer of your personal
information to another country would be carried out in accordance
with the Data Protection Act 1998.&nbsp;</p>

<a name="soxlaw" title="Bookmark Target"></a>
<p><strong>Whistleblowing and compliance with US SOX
Law</strong></p>
<p>We have explained above that your personal information may be
used for the purpose of ensuring compliance with legal, regulatory
and other good governance obligations and that it may be disclosed
to service providers.&nbsp; This includes use for the purpose of
enabling Apollo Group Companies to comply with The US
Sarbanes–Oxley Act of 2002 (“SOX Law”).&nbsp; The purpose of the
SOX Law is to guard against unethical, improper or illegal business
conduct including, for example, accounting and financial fraud,
conflicts of interest and white collar crime.</p>
<p>The Apollo companies may appoint one or more service providers
to assist them in managing a whistleblowing helpline and a webpage
which act as a reporting mechanism (the “Helpline”) to ensure
compliance with the SOX Law, local laws and regulations relating to
similar purposes and any other laws and regulations which relate to
fraudulent, illegal or unethical behaviour.&nbsp; It is possible
that a BPP employee, student or faculty teacher may report matters
of concern through the Helpline and that your personal data may be
used by the Apollo companies, its service provider(s) which manage
the Helpline and by BPP for the purpose of investigating any such
report and taking remedial action thereafter.&nbsp; For example, if
a BPP employee suspects that an earlier employee is misusing
company records for his own purposes or is committing a fraud which
involves your personal information, he may report this through the
Helpline.&nbsp; Should this happen, your personal information would
only be used for the purpose of ensuring compliance by the Apollo
companies and the BPP companies with the relevant laws and
regulations.&nbsp; Wherever reasonably possible your personal
information would be anonymised prior to use for the purpose of
investigations and remedial action so that it does not relate to
you, but in some specific circumstances this may not be possible as
it may prohibit a full investigation.</p>
<p>Any transfers to the Apollo companies and its service
provider(s) which manage the Helpline and which may also be in the
US would be carried out in accordance with the Data Protection Act
1998 (please see the section directly above).&nbsp; There would be
contractual measures in place with those service providers to
protect your personal information (please see the “<a href="/privacy-policy.aspx#whoweshareinfo">Who do we share your personal
information with?</a>” section above) to ensure that (first) it is
used only in accordance with Apollo’s instructions (in particular,
the instructions of the relevant BPP company) and for the purpose
of investigating suspected compliance issues, and (secondly) that
it keeps such personal information secure.&nbsp; In addition,
reasonable efforts are used to ensure that the website related to
the Helpline and messages sent through that portal are secure and
in particular, they are encrypted.&nbsp; A limited number of
specially trained Apollo and BPP employees only will have access to
your personal information which is disclosed through the Helpline
where and to the extent that this is necessary for the purposes of
carrying out their roles.&nbsp; In any event, their access will be
very limited, secure, carefully controlled and justified.&nbsp; To
this end they will be subject to appropriate confidentiality
obligations.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We encourage our employees to use the Helpline in good faith and
only for serious or substantial issues which cannot properly be
reported via other means.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Provided reports are made through the Helpline in good faith, we
try to protect your identity as much as possible.&nbsp; However, we
cannot guarantee this (especially in subsequent court or tribunal
proceedings) and we are required to inform the subject of the
reports about the allegation(s).&nbsp; Those subjects have the
right to request their own personal information, as do you (see
directly below).</p>

<p>You can ask to access the personal information which the

you can ask to be provided with a copy of it.&nbsp; In some
circumstances the relevant BPP company may provide access not

its administration costs in responding to your request and it is
permitted to do this under the Data Protection Act 1998.&nbsp; You
would need to put your request in writing.&nbsp; You may email or

your browser, the date and time of your visit and which pages of

statistics which help us to improve this website. The information
obtained in this way does not identify you personally. However, we
may review our server logs for security purposes, such as to detect
intrusions into our network.&nbsp; If we suspect criminal activity
we might share our server logs - which contain visitors’ IP
addresses - with the police or other appropriate investigative
authority and they may use that information to trace and identify
individuals.</p>
<p>We may also use “cookies” on our websites. Cookies are small
text files which your browser places on your hard drive so that the
website can recognise you on future visits to that site. They make
it easier for you to maintain your preferences on our websites, and
allow us to tailor the sites to your preferences, provide features
such as shopping baskets and measure your use of our sites.</p>
<p>We may also use electronic images known as “web beacons” on this
website and in communications generated from using and/or
registering on this website, such as promotional emails.&nbsp;
Web-beacons usually work in conjunction with cookies.</p>
<p>We mainly use cookies to measure general visitor numbers to our
websites, and also to monitor click-through rates from
advertisements hosted on third-party websites. These statistics are
gathered in aggregate and do not identify individual visitors, but
allow us to monitor the effectiveness of our website and our
marketing efforts. From time to time, we may also use cookies and /
or web beacons to track the effectiveness of promotional emails
that we may send to named individuals. In these cases, additional
cookies enable us to monitor those individuals’ responses to these
emails (e.g. if recipients click on links contained in the emails).
We are therefore sometimes able to associate visits to our websites
with identifiable individuals, allowing us to monitor response
rates and thus the effectiveness of these communications channels.
In all of the above examples, our cookies do not themselves contain
any personally identifiable information, only encrypted session IDs
that can only be interpreted by our websites’ tracking

or services, those of other members of the Apollo Group Companies,
and/or those of carefully selected third parties.&nbsp; This is
known as “direct marketing”.&nbsp; Whenever we collect your
personal information on the Website we will make it clear if it may
be used for direct marketing purposes.&nbsp; At the same time we
will seek your consent to receive this or we will permit you to
opt-out of receiving this (depending on applicable laws).&nbsp;</p>
<p>In direct marketing sent by any of the electronic methods
described above the relevant BPP company would provide you with a
simple way to refuse further direct marketing by the relevant
method.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you refuse further electronic marketing, the relevant BPP
company(ies) would not necessarily remove your personal information
from its/their database(s) but as soon reasonably possible it/they
would note that you had changed your mind.&nbsp; This means that
it/they may continue to hold your personal information (including
your contact details), but in a repressed form, and only to ensure
that it/they did not contact you further for the purpose of sending
marketing by electronic means where you had objected to this.</p>
<p>If at any other time you wish to change your mind about your
direct marketing preferences please contact us promptly using the
