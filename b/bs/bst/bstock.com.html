<p><strong>HOW WE USE YOUR INFORMATION</strong></p>
<p>We use personal information collected via our Sites for a variety of business purposes described below. If you are from the European Economic Area, we have also described the legal basis for collecting and using the personal information we collect from you.<br>
We normally collect personal information from you where the processing is in our legitimate business interests (“Business Purposes”), in order to enter into or perform a contract with you (“Contractual”), where we have your consent to so (“Consent”), and/or for compliance with our legal obligations (“Legal Reasons”).</p>
<p>We may use the personal information we collect in the following ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>To provide access to and use of our Services (for our Business Purposes, Contractual purposes and/or with your Consent).</li>
<li>To enable us to notify you if you post the winning bid in an auction and/or confirm your purchases (for Contractual purposes and/or with your Consent).</li>
<li>To respond to your requests for support or to provide you with information you have requested about B-Stock or any of our Services (for our Business Purposes, Contractual purposes and/or with your Consent).</li>
<li>To provide our Sellers, service providers and/or partners with information about your winning bid and/or to confirm your purchases to entities who require such information to ensure successful fulfilment of any purchases you make through the Services (for Contractual purposes and/or with your Consent).</li>
<li>To send you information about your relationship or transactions with us and other service related information, including confirmations, invoices, technical notices, updates, security alerts and support and administrative messages (for our Business Purposes, Contractual purposes and/or with your Consent).</li>
<li>To communicate with you and to personalize our communications with you (for our Business Purposes and/or with your Consent). For example, we may contact you by phone or email or other means (where this in accordance with your marketing preferences) to inform you about auctions, products, services, special offers or other promotional information related to our Services that we believe will be of interest to you. For more information about managing your marketing preferences, please see the “<a href="#yourdata">Your Data Protection Rights</a>“</li>
<li>To prevent, detect, mitigate, and investigate fraud, security breaches, potentially prohibited or illegal activities and enforce our agreements and policies (for our Business Purposes and/or Legal Reasons).</li>
<li>For other Business Purposes such as data analysis, identifying usage trends, determining the effectiveness of our promotional campaigns and to enhance, customize and improve our Services.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you have questions about or need further information concerning the legal basis on which we collect and use your personal information, please contact us using the contact details provided under the “<a href="#contact">How to contact us</a>”.</p>
<p><strong>HOW WE RETAIN YOUR INFORMATION</strong></p>
<p>We retain your personal information for as long as it is necessary and relevant for the purposes outlined in the section above. When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymise it or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from further processing until deletion is possible.</p>
<p>In addition, we may retain personal information from closed accounts for Legal Reasons, e.g. to comply with national laws, prevent fraud, collect any fees owed, resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems, assist with any investigation, enforce our customer agreements and take other actions permitted or required by applicable national laws.</p>
<p><strong>HOW WE SHARE YOUR INFORMATION</strong></p>
<p>We may disclose your personal information to the following categories of recipient’s parties for the following purposes:</p>
<p><strong>With Sellers:</strong> If you are purchasing inventory through the Services, B-Stock may share such information with the Sellers from whom you bid-on or buy products via the Services, as necessary to ensure successful fulfillment of any bids and/or purchases you make via the Services.</p>
<p><strong>Service Providers:</strong> B-Stock may use other companies to perform services on its behalf and which require access to your information to do that work. Examples include, hosting data, analysing data, providing marketing assistance, facilitating some aspects of the Services, sending e-mail, fulfilling purchase requests and providing payment processing services. These other companies may be supplied with or have access to your personal information solely for purposes that are described in this Policy or notified to you when we collect your personal information.</p>
<p><strong>B-Stock Group Companies:</strong> We may share your information with our parent companies, subsidiaries and/or affiliates for use and processing purposes described in this Policy.</p>
<p><strong>Special Circumstances:</strong> There may be instances when B-Stock may disclose personal information without providing you with a choice in order to protect the legal rights of its Sellers, B-Stock, or any of their affiliates, employees, agents and contractors; to protect the safety and security of visitors to our Site; to protect against fraud or for risk management purposes; or to comply with the law, governmental request, judicial proceeding or other legal process (including in response to public authorities to meet national security or law enforcement requirements).</p>
<p><strong>Business Transfers:</strong> If B-Stock or any Seller sells all or part of its business or makes a sale or transfer of assets or is otherwise involved in a merger or business transfer, or in the unlikely event of a bankruptcy, we may transfer your personal information to a potential buyer (and its agents and advisors) in connection with that transaction.</p>
<p id="yourdata"><strong>YOUR DATA PROTECTION RIGHTS</strong></p>
<p>You have the following data protection rights:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you wish to <strong>access, correct, update</strong> or <strong>request deletion</strong> of your personal information, you can do so at any time by contacting us using the contact details provided under the “How to contact us” heading below.</li>
<li>In addition, if you are a resident of the European Union, you can <strong>object to processing</strong> of your personal information, ask us to <strong>restrict processing</strong> of your personal information or <strong>request portability</strong> of your personal information. Again, you can exercise these rights by contacting us using the contact details provided under the “How to contact us” heading below.</li>
<li>You have the right to <strong>opt-out of marketing communications</strong> we send you at any time. You can exercise this right by clicking on the “unsubscribe” or “opt-out” link in the marketing e-mails we send you. To opt-out of other forms of marketing (such as postal marketing or telemarketing), then please contact us using the contact details provided under the “How to contact us” heading below.</li>
<li>Similarly, if we have collected and process your personal information with your consent, then you can <strong>withdraw your consent</strong> at any time. Withdrawing your consent will not affect the lawfulness of any processing we conducted prior to your withdrawal, nor will it affect processing of your personal information conducted in reliance on lawful processing grounds other than consent.</li>
<li>You have the <strong>right to complain to a data protection authority</strong> about our collection and use of your personal information. For more information, please contact your local data protection authority. (Contact details for data protection authorities in the European Economic Area, Switzerland and certain non-European countries (including the US and Canada) are available <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/article-29/structure/data-protection-authorities/index_en.htm">here</a>.)</li>
</ul>
<p>We will consider and act upon any request in accordance with applicable data protection laws.</p>
<p><strong>SECURITY</strong></p>
<p>We have implemented appropriate administrative, technical, personnel and physical measures designed to protect the security of any personal information in our possession against loss, theft and unauthorized use, disclosure or modification. However, please also remember that we cannot guarantee that the internet itself is 100% secure. Although we will do our best to protect your personal information, transmission of personal information to and from our site is at your own risk. You should only access the services within a secure environment.</p>
<p><strong>INTERNATIONAL DATA TRANSFERS</strong></p>
<p>Your personal information may be transferred to, and processed in, countries other than the country in which you are resident. These countries may have data protection laws that are different to the laws of your country (and, in some cases, may not be as protective).</p>
<p>Specifically, our Site servers are located in the United States and in Germany, and our group companies and third party service providers and partners operate around the world. This means that when we collect your personal information we may process it in any of these countries.</p>
<p>However, we have taken appropriate safeguards to require that your personal information will remain protected in accordance with this Policy. Such measures include implementing the European Commission’s Standard Contractual Clauses for transfers of personal information between our group companies and between us and our third-party providers, which require all such recipients to protect personal information that they process from the EEA in accordance with European data protection laws.</p>
<p id="cookies"><strong>COOKIES AND SIMILAR TECHNOLOGIES</strong></p>
<p>We use cookies (small text files containing a string of alphanumeric characters that we put on your computer) and other similar tracking technologies (like web beacons and pixels) to collect information about the pages you view, the links you click, and other actions you take through our Services, in our Sites and within our advertising or e-mail content.
