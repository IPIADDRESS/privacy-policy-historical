    <p>
        Effective: July 1, 2004<br>
        Last Updated: May 22, 2018
    </p>

    <p>This Privacy Policy (“Policy”) describes and governs the information collection, use, and sharing practices of
        Varsity Brands Holding Co., Inc. and Hercules Achievement, Inc., and all of their corporate affiliates,
        subsidiaries, and divisions as may change from time to time (collectively, “Varsity Brands,” “we,” “us,” and
        “our”) with respect to Varsity Brands’ various products, services, websites, mobile applications, and other
        digital and interactive services (together, the “Services”).</p>

    <p>Before you use or submit any information through or in connection with the Services, please carefully review this
        Policy. By using any part of the Services, you consent to the collection, use, and disclosure of your
        information as further outlined in this Policy. We will continue to evaluate this Policy as we update and expand
        the Services and our offerings, and we may make changes to the Policy accordingly. Any changes will be posted
        here and you should check this page periodically for updates. If we make material changes to this Policy, we
        will provide you with notice as required by law. Your continued use of the Services will signify acceptance of
        the terms of the updated Policy.</p>

    <h4>EXCLUSIONS FROM THIS POLICY</h4>
    <p>Some services or products offered by or affiliated with Varsity Brands may be governed by a separate privacy
        policy of which you will be made aware upon using such services or products. In those instances, the service- or
        product-specific privacy policy shall apply. In the event of a conflict between the service- or product-specific
        policy and this Policy, the service- or product-specific terms will control.</p>

    <p>Also, please note that some information we collect is in connection with Services we offer directly to schools
        and school districts for school purposes via contracts that may contain different privacy protections in
        accordance with applicable federal and state laws (e.g., the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act or
        various state privacy laws). In the event of a conflict between the terms in this Policy and the data protection
        and security provisions in such contracts, the provisions in such contracts will govern with respect to such
        conflict and all other terms in this Policy will remain in effect.</p>
    <h4>INFORMATION WE COLLECT</h4>
    <p>We collect information in multiple ways, including when you provide information directly to us, and when we
        passively collect information from you, such as from your browser or device.</p>

    <h5>1. Information You Provide Directly to Us</h5>

    <p>We may collect information from you in a variety of ways, such as when you:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Register for an account
        </li><li>Make a purchase
        </li><li>Enter a sweepstakes or contest or register for a promotion
        </li><li>Complete a survey or provide us with feedback
        </li><li>Complete an order or information form
        </li><li>Request certain features (e.g., newsletters, updates, and other products)
        </li><li>Use certain features that require your information to function (e.g., portions of our site that require
            log-in to participate)
        </li><li>Communicate with us, such as through an online form
        </li><li>Post user-generated content, including comments or photographs, to or on any of our Services, including on
            community forums and blogs
    </li></ul>

    <p>The information you provide directly to us includes, but is not limited to: (i) name; (ii) email address; (iii)
        age; (iv) postal address; (v) username and password associated with your account; (vi) phone numbers; and (vi)
        demographic information. If you order a product or service that we offer for sale through the Services, we may
        also collect and maintain your billing address, shipping address, product selections, financial information
        (such as your credit or debit card information or ACH information, applicable card expiration dates and security
        codes) and your order number. We may also use third party payment processors to collect certain financial
        information from you, such as your name, address, credit or debit card information or ACH information,
        applicable card expiration dates and security codes in order to process your transactions. When financial
        information is collected and processed by such third parties, we do not collect, store or otherwise maintain
        such information, and use and storage of that information is governed by the payment processor’s applicable
        terms of service and privacy policy.</p>

    <p>To use certain parts of the Services, you may be requested to submit information about others. For example, if
        you order a gift online and want to send it directly to the recipient, you will need to submit the recipient's
        address. In this circumstance, the types of information we may request include, but may not be limited to, the
        recipient’s name, address and telephone number. Moreover, there may be content that you choose to share with a
        friend through the Services. If so, we will ask for your friend’s name and email address. We will send your
        friend an email on your behalf inviting him or her to visit our websites or check out our products.</p>

    <p>Some of our online Services include chat rooms, forums, message boards, news groups and other community tools
        available to our users. Please remember that any information that is disclosed in these areas becomes public
        information for both us and other users to use and share. Please be considerate and respectful of others while
        using the community to share your opinions. We reserve the right, but do not have the obligation, to review and
        monitor such posting, and to delete postings that may be viewed as inappropriate or offensive to others.</p>

    <h5>2. Information that is Passively or Automatically Collected</h5>

    <p>a. Device/Usage Information</p>

    <p>We may automatically collect certain information about the computer or devices (including mobile devices or
        tablets) you use to access the Services. As described further below, we may collect and analyze information such
        as (a) IP addresses, geolocation information, unique device identifiers, IMEI and TCP/IP address, and other
        information about your computer or device(s), browser types, browser language, operating system, mobile device
        carrier information, the state or country from which you accessed the Services; and (b) information related to
        the ways in which you interact with the Services, such as: referring and exit web pages and URLs, platform type,
        the number of clicks, domain names, landing pages, pages and content (such as advertisements and videos) viewed
        and the order of those views, statistical information about the use of the Services, the amount of time spent on
        particular pages, the date and time you used the Services, the frequency of your use of the Services, error
        logs, and other similar information. As described further below, we may use third-party analytics providers and
        technologies, including cookies and similar tools, to assist in collecting this information.</p>

    <p>b. Cookies and Other Electronic Technologies</p>

    <p>We may also collect data about your use of the Services through the use of Internet server logs, cookies and/or
        tracking pixels. A web server log is a file where website activity is stored. A cookie is a small text file that
        is placed on your computer when you visit a website, that enables us to: (i) recognize your computer; (ii) store
        your preferences and settings; (iii) understand the web pages of the Services you have visited; (iv), enhance
        your user experience by delivering content specific to your interests; (v) perform searches and analytics; and
        (vi) assist with security and administrative functions. Some cookies are placed in your browser cache while
        those associated with Flash technologies are stored with your Adobe Flash Player files. Tracking pixels
        (sometimes referred to as web beacons or clear GIFs) are tiny electronic tags with a unique identifier embedded
        in websites, online ads and/or email, and that are designed to provide usage information like ad impressions or
        clicks, measure popularity of the Services and associated advertising, and to access user cookies. As we adopt
        additional technologies, we may also gather additional information through other methods.</p>

    <p>Please note that you can change your settings to notify you when a cookie is being set or updated, or to block
        cookies altogether. Please consult the "Help" section of your browser for more information (e.g., Internet
        Explorer; Google Chrome; Mozilla Firefox; or Apple Safari). You can also manage the use of Flash technologies,
        including cookies and local storage objects with the Flash management tools available at Adobe's website. Please
        note that by blocking any or all cookies, you may not have access to certain features or offerings of the
        Services.</p>

    <h5>3. Location Information</h5>

    <p>We may collect different types of information about your location, including general information (e.g., IP
        address, zip code) and more specific information (e.g., GPS-based functionality on mobile devices used to access
        the Services), and may use that information to customize the Services with location-based information,
        advertising, and features. For example, if your IP address indicates an origin in Chicago, the Services may be
        customized with Chicago-specific information and advertisements. In order to do this, your location information
        may be shared with our agents, vendors or advertisers. If you access the Services through a mobile device and
        you do not want your device to provide us with location-tracking information, you can disable the GPS or other

    <h5>4. Information Collected By and From Social Media and Other Content Platforms</h5>

    <p>When you “like” or “follow” us on Facebook, Twitter, or other social media sites, we may collect some information
        from you including your name, e-mail address, and any comments or content you post relevant to us. We may also
        collect your information if you sign up for one of our promotions or submit information to us through social
        media sites. Moreover, if you access the Services through a third-party connection or log-in (e.g., Facebook
        Connect), you may allow us to have access to and store certain information from your social network profile.
        This includes your name, gender, profile picture, your “likes” and check-ins, and your list of friends,
        depending on your settings on such services. If you do not wish to have this information shared, do not use a
        social networking connection to access the Services. For a description of how social networking sites handle
        your information, please refer to their privacy policies and terms of use, which may permit you to modify your
        privacy settings.</p>

    <h5>5. Information from Affiliates and Non-Affiliated Third Parties</h5>

    <p>We may also obtain information about you, such as demographic information, from various third parties, such as
        business partners, marketers, researchers, analysts, and other parties that we may attribute to you based on
        your assignment to certain statistical groups. We use this information to supplement the information that we
        collect directly from you in order to derive your possible interests and to provide more relevant experiences
        for you with our brand and improve our products, analytics, and advertising.</p>

    <h4>WHEN WE DISCLOSE USER INFORMATION</h4>
    <p>Varsity Brands may disclose and/or share your information to or with any non-affiliated third parties under the
        following circumstances:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><span style="text-decoration: underline">Service Providers.</span> We may provide access to or share your
            information with select third parties who perform services on our behalf, including without limitation
            billing, sales, marketing, advertising, market research, customer support, fulfillment and manufacturing,
            data storage, analysis and processing, and legal services.
        </li><li><span style="text-decoration: underline">Protection of Varsity Brands and Others.</span> By using the
            Services, you acknowledge and agree that we may access, preserve and disclose your information, including,
            but not limited to, any user content, if required to do so by law or in a good faith belief that such
            access, preservation or disclosure is reasonably necessary to: (a) comply with legal process; (b) enforce
            our Terms of Service, this Policy, or other contracts with you, including investigation of potential
            violations thereof; (c) respond to claims that any content violates the rights of third parties; (d) respond
            to your requests for customer service; and/or (e) protect the rights, property or personal safety of Varsity
            Brands, its agents and affiliates, its users and/or the public. This includes exchanging information with
            other companies and organizations for fraud protection, and spam/malware prevention, and similar purposes.
        </li><li><span style="text-decoration: underline">Business Transfers.</span> As we continue to develop our business,
            we may buy, merge or partner with other companies. In such transactions, (including in contemplation of such
            transactions, e.g., due diligence) user information may be among the transferred assets. If a portion or all
            of Varsity Brands’ assets are sold or transferred to a third-party, customer information (including your
            email address) would likely be one of the transferred business assets.
        </li><li><span style="text-decoration: underline">Public Forums.</span> Our Services offer publicly accessible blogs
            and community forums. You should be aware that any information you provide in these areas may be read,
            collected, and used by others who access them. Please also remember that if you choose to provide
            information on public features of the Services, individuals reading such information may use or disclose it
            to other individuals or entities without our control and without your knowledge, and search engines may
            index that information. We therefore urge you to think carefully about what you choose to disclose publicly
            and make sure it’s information you want to share with the public.
        </li><li><span style="text-decoration: underline">Consent.</span> We may disclose your information to any third
            parties based on your consent to do so.
    </li></ul>

    <h4>PERSONALIZED CONTENT, ADVERTISING, AND YOUR CHOICES</h4>
    <h5>1. Online and Email Analytics</h5>

    <p>We may use third-party web analytics services on our Services, such as those of Google Analytics. These service
        providers use the sort of technology previously described in the “Cookies and other electronic technologies”
        section to help us analyze how users use the Services, including by noting the third-party website from which
        you arrive, and provide certain features to you. The information (including your IP address) collected by the
        technology will be disclosed to or collected directly by these service providers, who use the information to
        evaluate your use of the Services. To prevent Google Analytics from using your information for analytics, you
        may install the Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on by
        <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout" target="_blank">clicking here</a>.</p>

    <p>If you receive email from us, we may use certain tools, such as clear GIFs to capture data such as when you open
        our message or click on any links or banners our email contains. This data allows us to gauge the effectiveness
        of our communications and marketing campaigns.</p>

    <h5>2. Tailored Online and Mobile Advertising</h5>

    <p>Subject to applicable law, we may personalize the content and advertising that you see when using the Services
        through the use of third-party advertising technologies that allow for the delivery of relevant content and
        advertising on the Services, as well as other websites you visit and other applications you use. The ads may be
        based on various factors such as the content of the page you are visiting, information you provide such as your
        age and gender, your searches, demographic data, user-generated content, and other information we collect from
        you. These ads may be based on your current activity or your activity over time and across other websites and
        online services and may be tailored to your interests.</p>

    <p>Also, third parties whose products or services are accessible or advertised via the Services may place cookies or
        other tracking technologies on your computer, mobile phone, or other device to collect information about your
        use of the Services in order to (i) inform, optimize, and serve ads based on past visits to our websites and
        other sites and (ii) report how our ad impressions, other uses of ad services, and interactions with these ad
        impressions and ad services are related to visits to our websites and use of our Services. We also allow other
        third parties (e.g., ad networks and ad servers such as Google Analytics, DoubleClick and others) to serve
        tailored ads to you on the Services, other sites, and in other applications, and to access their own cookies or
        other tracking technologies on your computer, mobile phone, or other device you use to access the Services. We
        neither have access to, nor does this Policy govern, the use of cookies or other tracking technologies that may
        be placed on your computer, mobile phone, or other device you use to access the Services by non-affiliated,
        third-party ad technology, ad servers, ad networks or any other non-affiliated third parties. Those parties that
        use these technologies may offer you a way to opt out of ad targeting as described below. You may receive
        tailored advertising on your computer through a web browser. If you are interested in more information about
        tailored browser advertising and how you can generally control cookies from being put on your computer to
        deliver tailored advertising, you may visit the
        <a href="http://optout.networkadvertising.org/?c=1" target="_blank">Network Advertising Initiative’s Consumer Opt-Out link</a>,
        the <a href="http://optout.aboutads.info/?c=2" target="_blank">Digital Advertising Alliance’s Consumer Opt-Out link</a> or
        <a href="http://www.youronlinechoices.com/uk/your-ad-choices" target="_blank">Your Online Choices</a> to opt-out
        of receiving tailored advertising from companies that participate in those programs.</p>

    <p>To opt out of Google Analytics for display advertising or customize Google display network ads, you can visit the
        <a href="https://www.google.com/settings/ads" target="_blank">Google Ads Settings page</a>. Please note that to
        the extent advertising technology is integrated into the Services, you may still receive advertisements even if
        you opt-out of tailored advertising. In that case, the ads will just not be tailored.</p>

    <p>When using a mobile application you may also receive tailored in-application advertisements. Each operating
        system, iOS for Apple phones, Android for Android devices and Windows for Microsoft devices provides its own
        instructions on how to prevent the delivery of tailored in-application advertisements. You may review the
        support materials and/or the privacy settings for the respective operating systems to opt-out of tailored in-app
        advertisements. For any other devices and/or operating systems, please visit the privacy settings for the
        applicable device or contact the applicable platform operator. We do not control how the applicable platform
        operator allows you to control receiving personalized in-application advertisements; thus, you should contact
        the platform provider for further details on opting out of tailored in-application advertisements.</p>

    <p>Please note that to the extent advertising technology is integrated into the Services, you may still receive
        advertisements even if you opt-out. In that case, the advertising will not be tailored to your interests. Also,
        we do not control any of the above opt-out links or whether any particular company chooses to participate in
        these opt-out programs. We are not responsible for any choices you make using these mechanisms or the continued
        availability or accuracy of these mechanisms.</p>

    <h4>NOTICE CONCERNING DO NOT TRACK SIGNALS</h4>
    <p>Do Not Track (“DNT”) is a privacy preference that users can set in certain web browsers. We are committed to
        providing you with meaningful choices about the information collected on the Services for third-party purposes,
        and that is why we provide links to the various industry opt out pages referenced above. However, we do not
        recognize or respond to browser-initiated DNT signals, as the Internet industry is currently still working
        toward defining exactly what DNT means, what it means to comply with DNT, and a common approach to responding to
        DNT. To learn more about Do Not Track, you can do so
        <a href="http://allaboutdnt.com/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

    <h4>DATA RETENTION</h4>
    <p>We keep your information for no longer than necessary for the purposes for which it is processed. The length of
        time for which we retain information depends on the purposes for which we collected and use it and/or as
        required to comply with applicable laws.</p>

    <h4>SECURITY</h4>
    <p>We have implemented administrative, technical, and physical security measures to protect against the loss, misuse
        and/or alteration of your information. These safeguards vary based on the sensitivity of the information that we
        collect and store. However, we cannot and do not guarantee that these measures will prevent every unauthorized
        attempt to access, use, or disclose your information since despite our efforts, no Internet and/or other
        electronic transmissions can be completely secure.</p>

    <h4>DATA SUBJECT RIGHTS</h4>
    <p>If you would like further information in relation to your legal rights under applicable law or would like to
        exercise any of them, please contact us using the information in the “Contact Information” section below at any
        time. Your local laws (e.g., in the EU) may permit you to request that we:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>provide access to and/or a copy of certain information we hold about you
        </li><li>prevent the processing of your information for direct-marketing purposes (including any direct marketing
            processing based on profiling)
        </li><li>update information which is out of date or incorrect
        </li><li>delete certain information which we are holding about you
        </li><li>restrict the way that we process and disclose certain of your information
        </li><li>transfer your information to a third party provider of services
        </li><li>revoke your consent for the processing of your information
    </li></ul>

    <p>We will consider all requests and provide our response within the time period stated by applicable law. Please
        note, however, that certain information may be exempt from such requests in some circumstances, which may
        include if we need to keep processing your information for our legitimate interests or to comply with a legal
        obligation. We may request you provide us with information necessary to confirm your identity before responding
        to your request.</p>

    <h4>YOUR MARKETING CHOICES</h4>
    <p>If you have provided contact information through the Services and decide that you do not want a certain Varsity
        Brands business division to use that information for marketing purposes, you can opt-out of future use at any
        time by: (i) going to the link provided at the bottom of any email you receive and opting out of receiving
        future marketing information from the specific business division that sent you such marketing email; (ii) by
        sending us an email at <a href="mailto:privacy@varsitybrands.com">privacy@varsitybrands.com</a>, and specifying
        which Varsity Brands’ business division emails you no longer wish to receive; or (iii) through your account
        settings. Please note that you may not be able to opt out of emails about your transactions and relationship
        with us, such as emails regarding your account, requests or inquiries, and purchases of products and/or
        services.</p>

    <h4>INTERNATIONAL USERS</h4>
    <p>The information discussed in this Policy is processed in the United States by Varsity Brands, whose principal
        office in the United States is located at 14460 Varsity Brands Way, Farmers Branch TX 75244 . Your information
        will be processed in the United States for the purposes described herein. As described above, we also may
        subcontract the processing of your data to, or otherwise share your data with, other members within the Varsity
        Brands group or our service providers in countries other than your country of residence, including the United
        States, in accordance with applicable law. Such third parties may be engaged in, among other things, the
        provision of Services to you, the processing of transactions and/or the provision of support services. By
        providing us with your information, you acknowledge any such transfer, storage or use.</p>

    <p>If we provide any information about you to third party information processors, we will take appropriate measures
        to ensure such companies protect your information adequately in accordance with this Privacy Policy. These
        measures include signing Standard Contractual Clauses in accordance with EU and other data protection laws to
        govern the transfers of such data. For more information about these transfer mechanisms, please contact us as
        detailed in the “Contact Information” section below.</p>

    <p>If applicable, you may make a complaint to the data protection supervisory authority in the country where you
        reside. Alternatively you may seek a remedy through local courts if you believe your rights have been
        breached.</p>

    <h4>THIRD PARTY LINKS AND SERVICES</h4>
    <p>The Services may contain links to or “frame” third-party websites, applications and other services (e.g.,
        including retailers or merchants where you can make purchases). Please be aware that we are not responsible for
        the privacy practices of such other sites and services. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our
        Services and to read the privacy statements of each and every site they visit that collects their
        information.</p>

    <p>The Services may also include widgets and social media features such as the Facebook "Like" button, which are
        interactive mini-programs that provide specific services from another company (e.g. displaying the news,
        opinions, music, etc.). Information such as your email address may be collected through these features. These
        features may collect your IP address and set cookies to enable them to function properly. We are not responsible
        for nor do we endorse the privacy practices or the content of such third-party services. Any information you
        provide via those services is subject to their applicable privacy policies and is not covered by this
        Policy.</p>

    <h4>CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS</h4>
    <p>California Law permits visitors who are California residents to request a list of the third parties to which we
        have disclosed “personal information” (as that term is defined under applicable California law) for such third
        parties’ direct marketing purposes. We do not currently share personal information with third parties for their
        own direct marketing purposes.</p>

    <h4>INFORMATION FROM CHILDREN</h4>
    <p>The Services are intended for general audiences and not for children under the age of 13. If we become aware that
        we have collected “personal information” (as defined by the United States Children’s Online Privacy Protection
        Act) from children under the age of 13 without legally-valid parental consent, we will take reasonable steps to
        delete it as soon as possible. We do not knowingly process data of EU residents under the age of 16 without
        parental consent. If we become aware that we have collected data from an EU resident under the age of 16 without
        parental consent, we will take reasonable steps to delete it as soon as possible. We also comply with other age
        restrictions and requirements in accordance with applicable local laws.</p>

    <h4>CHANGES TO THIS POLICY</h4>
    <p>We reserve the right to change this Policy at any time to reflect changes in the law, our data collection and use
        practices, the features of our Services, or advances in technology. Please check this page periodically for
        changes. Your continued use of the Services following the posting of changes to this Policy will mean you accept
        those changes.</p>

    <h4>QUESTIONS ABOUT THIS POLICY</h4>
    <p>If you have any questions about our Policy, you can contact us by emailing us at
        <a href="mailto:privacy@varsitybrands.com">privacy@varsitybrands.com</a> or by writing to us at: Varsity Brands,
