Policy</u></font></b></center><br><br>BSP Rewards firmly believes that personal 
privacy should be protected. We are acutely aware that evolving technologies present 
new challenges for user privacy. We work to comply with the guidelines set by 
numerous privacy organizations to ensure that we stay on the cutting edge of privacy 
protection. </font></div><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b><font size="2">By 
visiting BSP Rewards, you are accepting the practices described in this Privacy 
Notice. </font> </b></font></p><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">BSP 
Rewards is the sole owner of the information collected on this site. We will not 
sell, share, or rent this information to others in ways different from what is 
disclosed in this statement. BSP Rewards collects information from our users at 
several different points on our website.</font></p><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Registration</b><br>In 
order to use this website, a user must first complete the registration form. During 
registration a user is required to give their contact information (such as name 
and email address). This information is used to contact the user about the services 
on our site for which they have expressed interest. It is optional for the user 
to provide demographic information (such as income level and gender), and unique 
identifiers (such as social security number), but encouraged so we can provide 
a more personalized experience on our site. </font></p><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Order</b><br>We 
request information from the user on our order form. Here a user must provide 
contact information (like name and shipping address) and financial information 
(like credit card number, expiration date). This information is used for billing 
purposes and to fill customer's orders. If we have trouble processing an order, 
this contact information is used to get in touch with the user.</font><br><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b><br>What 
Personal Information About Customers Does BSP Rewards Gather?</b><br>The information 
we learn from customers helps us personalize and continually improve your experience 
at BSP Rewards. Here are the types of information we gather. </font></p><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Information 
You Give Us</b><br>We receive and store any information you enter when you register 
for our reward program or give us in any other way. You can choose not to provide 
certain information, but then you might not be able to take advantage of many 
of our features. We use the information that you provide for such purposes as 
responding to your requests, customizing future shopping for you, improving our 
offers, and communicating with you. </font></p><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>What 
about Cookies?</b><br>We receive and store certain types of information whenever 
you interact with us. For example, like many Web sites, we use "cookies," 
and we obtain certain types of information when your Web browser accesses BSP 
Rewards. The Federal Trade Commission provides useful information about online 
privacy on its own Web site, Site Seeing on the Internet. </font></p><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>E-mail 
Communications</b><br>To help us make e-mails more useful and interesting, we 
often receive a confirmation when you open e-mail from BSP Rewards if your computer 
supports such capabilities. We also compare our customer list to lists received 
from other companies, in an effort to avoid sending unnecessary messages to our 
customers. If you do not want to receive e-mail or other mail from us, please 
adjust your preferences by visiting the Profile section on our site.</font></p><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Information 
from Other Sources</b><br>For reasons such as improving personalization of our 
service (for example, providing better product recommendations or special offers 
that we think will interest you), we might receive information about you from 
other sources and add it to our account information. </font></p><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Does 
BSP Rewards Share the Information It Receives?</b><br>Information about our customers 
is an important part of our business, and we are not in the business of selling 
it to others. We share customer information only with the subsidiaries BSP Rewards, 
and as described below. <br><br><b>Surveys &amp; Contests</b></font></p><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">From 
time-to-time our site requests information from users via surveys or contests. 
Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and the user 
therefore has a choice whether or not to disclose this information. Information 
requested may include contact information (such as name and shipping address), 
and demographic information (such as zip code, age level). Contact information 
will be used to notify the winners and award prizes. Survey information will be 
used for purposes of monitoring or improving the use and satisfaction of this 
site.</font></p><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Tell-A-Friend</b></font></p><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">If 
a user elects to use our referral service for informing a friend about our site, 
we ask them for the friend's name and email address. BSP Rewards will automatically 
send the friend a one-time email inviting them to visit the site. BSP Rewards 
stores this information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email. The 
friend may contact BSP Rewards at remove@bsprewards.com to request the removal 
of this information from their database.</font><br></p><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Links</b><br>This 
web site contains links to other sites. Please be aware that we, BSP Rewards, 
are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage 
our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements 
of each and every web site that collects personally identifiable information. 
This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by this Web site.<br><br><b>Security</b></font></p><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This 
website takes every precaution to protect our users' information. When users submit 
sensitive information via the website, your information is protected both online 
and off-line.</font></p><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">When 
our registration/order form asks users to enter sensitive information (such as 
credit card number and/or social security number), that information is encrypted 
and is protected with the best encryption software in the industry - SSL. While 
on a secure page, such as our order form, the lock icon on the bottom of Web browsers 
such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, as 
opposed to un-locked, or open, when you are just 'surfing'.</font></p><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">While 
we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also do everything 
in our power to protect user-information off-line. All of our users' information, 
not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted in our offices. 
Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, 
our billing clerk or a customer service representative) are granted access to 
personally identifiable information. Our employees must use password-protected 
screen-savers when they leave their desk. When they return, they must re-enter 
their password to re-gain access to your information. Furthermore, ALL employees 
are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy practices. Every quarter, as well 
as any time new policies are added, our employees are notified and/or reminded 
about the importance we place on privacy, and what they can do to ensure our customers' 
information is protected. Finally, the servers that we store personally identifiable 
information on are kept in a secure environment, behind a locked cage.</font></p><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Supplementation 
of Information</b></font></p><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In 
order for this website to enhance its ability to tailor the site to an individual's 
preference, we combine information about the purchasing habits of users with similar 
information from our partners to create a personalized user profile. When a user 
makes a purchase from any of these companies, the companies collect and share 
that purchase information with us so we can tailor the site to our users' preferences.</font><br></p><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Agents</b><br>We 
employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf. Examples 
include sending postal mail and e-mail, removing repetitive information from customer 
lists, analyzing data, providing marketing assistance, processing credit card 
payments, and providing customer service. They have access to personal information 
needed to perform their functions, but may not use it for other purposes. </font></p><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Promotional 
Offers</b><br>Sometimes we send offers to selected groups of BSP Rewards customers 
on behalf of other businesses. When we do this, we do not give that business your 
name and address. If you do not want to receive such offers, please adjust your 
please adjust your preferences by visiting the Profile section on our site. </font></p><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Business 
Transfers</b><br>As we continue to develop our business, we might sell or buy 
stores or assets. In such transactions, customer information generally is one 
of the transferred business assets. Also, in the unlikely event that BSP Rewards 
or substantially all of its assets are acquired; customer information will of 
course be one of the transferred assets.</font></p><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Protection 
of BSP Rewards and Others</b><br>We release account and other personal information 
when we believe release is appropriate to comply with law; enforce or apply our 
Conditions of Use and other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety 
of BSP Rewards, our users, or others. This includes exchanging information with 
other companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction.<br><br><b>Special 
Offers<br></b></font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We 
send all new members a welcoming email to verify password and username. Established 
members will occasionally receive information on products, services, special deals, 
and a newsletter. Out of respect for the privacy of our users we present the option 
to not receive these types of communications. Please see our choice and opt-out 
below.</font></p><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Site 
and Service Updates<br></b></font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We 
also send the user site and service announcement updates. Members are not able 
to un-subscribe from service announcements, which contain important information 
about the service. We communicate with the user to provide requested services 
and in regards to issues relating to their account via email or phone.</font></p><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Correction/Updating 
Personal Information:<br></b></font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">If 
a user's personally identifiable information changes (such as your zip code), 
or if a user no longer desires our service, we will endeavor to provide a way 
to correct, update or remove that user's personal data provided to us. This can 
usually be done at the member information page or by emailing our Customer Support 
representatives.</font></p><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Choice/Opt-out<br></b></font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Our 
users are given the opportunity to 'opt-out' of having their information used 
for purposes not directly related to our site at the point where we ask for the 
information. For example, our order form has an 'opt-out' mechanism so users who 
buy a product from us, but don't want any marketing material, can keep their email 
address off of our lists. </font></p><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Users 
who no longer wish to receive our newsletter or promotional materials from our 
partners may opt-out of receiving these communications by replying to unsubscribe 
in the subject line in the email or email us at remove@bsprewards.com </font></p><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Users 
of our site are always notified when their information is being collected by any 
outside parties. We do this so our users can make an informed choice as to whether 
they should proceed with services that require an outside party, or not.</font></p><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Notification 
of Changes<br></b></font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">If 
we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes on our Homepage 
so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and 
under circumstances, if any, we disclose it. If at any point we decide to use 
personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at 
the time it was collected, we will notify users by way of an email. Users will 
have a choice as to whether or not we use their information in this different 
manner. We will use information in accordance with the privacy policy under which 
the information was collected. </font></p><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Third-party

the Company use any means of indirect collection that identifies our members.

children's privacy; we do not consider our web site or service to be aimed at 
children. Accordingly, children who are 16 years of age or younger, may <b>NOT</b> 
apply for membership at BSP Rewards and are not eligible for our service. Furthermore, 
anyone under 18 will not be able to participate in our shopping club. BSP Rewards 
does not sell products for purchase by children. We sell children's products for 
purchase by adults. If you are under 18, you may use BSP Rewards only with involvement

our registered credit card program:</b><br><br></font></p><li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We work to protect the security 
of your information during transmission by using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software, 
which encrypts information you input.</font></li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br><li>We reveal only the last five 
digits of your credit card numbers when confirming your membership enrollment.

one including our advertisers will be able to identify you individually. All data 
is treated in groups for our data processing purposes, and at no stage will the 
advertiser know who you are. Data shared with advertisers is in anonymous group 
statistical form. This allows advertisers to participate more effectively by sending 
out ads targeted to various member groups based on their interests. For example: 
an advertiser may be told that 10,000 members are interested in receiving ads 
related to golf. But, at no stage will they "know" who these 10,000 
members actually are. The program is designed to make it<b> impossible</b> for 
outside companies to access personal information.<br><br><b>Conditions of Use,
