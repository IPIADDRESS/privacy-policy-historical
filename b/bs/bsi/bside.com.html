</p><h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p></p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>

B-Side Entertainment, Inc. ("B-Side") has created this Privacy Policy in
order to disclose its use of consumer data collected about you.  This
Privacy Policy is effective as of September 1, 2005.  Any questions
regarding this policy should be directed by email to 
<a href="mailto:privacy@bside.com">privacy@bside.com</a>.  
You may also contact B-Side at 4107
Sinclair Ave, Austin, TX 78756.  The following discloses B-Side's
information gathering and dissemination practices for its marketing
website.
</p>

<h2>Information Collected and Received</h2>

<p>
B-Side may collect or receive information about each person who registers
with the B-Side website including, but not limited to, user name, password,
first and last name, email address, street address, gender, occupation,
and interests.  B-Side also collects information on
the pages you access and other information you may volunteer, such as
survey information.
</p>

<h2>Uses of Information</h2>

<p>
B-Side may make the email addresses and other information collected from
B-Side's users available to other organizations.  If you supply B-Side with your
postal address online, you may, receive mailings from other third party
companies involved in the film festivals B-Side covers.
These third party companies may use the information that you provide at
B-Side to deliver you mailings with offers about goods and services that
may be of interest to you.  B-Side may use a third party company to
distribute B-Side's offers.
</p>

<p>
B-Side may use your IP address to help diagnose problems with B-Side's
server and to administer B-Side's web site.  Your IP address may also be
used to help identify you and your online profile and to gather broad
demographic information.  B-Side's site's registration form requires users
to give B-Side contact information (such as your name and email address)
and demographic information (such as your zip code, age, or income level). 
B-Side uses customer contact information from the registration form to send
the user information about B-Side's company and promotional material from
some of B-Side's partners.  The customer's contact information is also used
to contact the user when necessary.  Users may choose to opt-out of
receiving future mailings.  Demographic and profile data may also be
collected at B-Side's site.  B-Side may use this data to tailor the
visitor's experience on B-Side's site, show the visitor content that B-Side
thinks you may be interested in, and display content according to your
preferences.  The demographic and profile data may be shared with
advertisers on an aggregate basis.
</p>

<h2>Security</h2>

<p>
B-Side uses industry-standard technologies when transferring and receiving
consumer data exchanged between B-Side and other companies to help ensure
its security.  This site has security measures in place to protect the
loss, misuse and alteration of the information under B-Side's control. 
B-Side's servers are backed up regularly and protected by security systems.
</p>

<h2>Cookies</h2>

<p>
"Cookies" are small pieces of information that are stored by your browser
on your computer's hard drive.  B-Side's site uses cookies to keep track of
your session, shopping cart, and advertising delivery.  B-Side may also use
cookies to deliver content specific to your interests and to save your
password.  B-Side may use an outside ad company to display ads on B-Side's
site.  These ads may also contain cookies.  While B-Side uses cookies in
other parts of B-Side's web site, cookies received with banner ads are
collected by B-Side's ad company and B-Side does not have access to this
information.
</p>

<h2>Links</h2>

<p>
B-Side may create links to other web sites.  B-Side will make a reasonable
effort to link only to sites that meet similar standards for maintaining
each individual's right to privacy.  However, many other sites that are not
associated or authorized by B-Side may have links leading to B-Side's site.
 B-Side cannot control these links and B-Side is not responsible for any
content appearing on these sites.
</p>

<h2>Amendments</h2>

<p></p>
B-Side may amend this policy at any time.  If B-Side is going to use
personally identifiable information collected through B-Side's corporate
site in a manner materially different from that stated at the time of
collection B-Side will notify users via email and/or by posting a notice on
B-Side's Web site for 30 days.  This Agreement may not be otherwise amended
except in a writing that specifically refers to this policy and is
physically signed by both parties.
