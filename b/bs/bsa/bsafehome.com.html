							<b>PRIVACY POLICY</b><br>
							<hr color="#c0c0c0" noshade="" size="4">
							Bsafe Online, Inc. (“Bsafe Online,” “We” or “Us”) is committed to respecting 
							the privacy rights of visitors to the websites operated by Bsafe Online and its 
							affiliated companies, including without limitation www.bsafe.com, 
							www.bsafehome.com and www.bsafeonline.com (the “Sites”). Bsafe Online has 
							adopted the privacy policies outlined below, which serve as the basis for our 
							use of Your personal information in our business and advertiser relationships. 
							This Privacy Policy is intended to comply with privacy laws applicable to Bsafe 
							Online, its affiliated companies and the operation of the Sites. This Privacy 
							Policy, however, does not cover Bsafe Online‘s or its affiliated companies’ 
							offline privacy practices.
							<ul type="1">
								<li>
									<b>INFORMATION COLLECTED.</b><br>
									We collect two types of information about users: "Personal Information" (such 
									as name, email address, mailing address, phone, credit card or debit card, 
									personal preferences and other account-related information) and "Aggregate 
									Information" (such as information about how many users log on to the Sites on a 
									daily basis). Personal Information is collected online when users voluntarily 
									submit non-public personal information on the Sites by establishing a customer 
									account, requesting information, purchasing our products or services, receiving 
									electronic notices or other similar communications and other similar 
									activities. Aggregate Information is non-personally identifiable/anonymous 
									information about You, such as age, gender, pages most frequently accessed by 
									You or search terms entered by You. Aggregate Information is used in a 
									collective manner, and no single person can be identified by that compiled 
									information (for example, the number of people who logged into the Sites in a 
									particular day). Aggregate Information does not personally identify a specific 
									user. Your Personal Information will be retained for fulfillment of the 
									intended purposes for which such Personal Information is collected. We will 
									establish minimum and maximum retention periods based upon the type of 
									information collected (i.e. sensitivity), the intended purposes and as 
									otherwise may be legally required. For example, Bsafe Online will purge Your 
									customer data no more than two (2) years after Your deactivation of a service.
									<br>
									<br>
								</li><li>
									<b>SECURITY:</b><br>
									Bsafe Online maintains commercially reasonable safeguards to ensure the 
									security, integrity and privacy of the Personal Information provided by You. 
									Such security safeguards are intended to be appropriate to the sensitivity of 
									the Personal Information collected. To the extent Bsafe Online transfers any 
									Personal Information to third-parties, Bsafe Online will use commercially 
									reasonable efforts to assure that such third-parties to whom We may transfer 
									any Personal Information have knowledge of our Privacy Policy and provide 
									sufficient protection of such Personal Information. In particular, Bsafe Online 
									requires that a secure session be established using Secure Socket Layer (SSL) 
									and Secure Electronic Transaction (SET) protocol when You submit Personal 
									Information to Us through Your use of the Sites to establish an account, use 
									the shopping cart, input credit card or debit card information for payment, and 
									access certain product pages.
									<br>
									<br>
								</li><li>
									<b>COOKIES:</b><br>
									The Sites may utilize a standard technology called a “cookie” to collect 
									information about how the Site is used. A “cookie” is a small text file placed 
									on your hard drive by our web page server. These cookies do not collect 
									Personal Information, only Aggregate Information, and We do not combine 
									Aggregate Information collected through cookies with other Personal Information 
									to determine who You are or what Your e-mail address is. The Sites can access 
									the Aggregate Information only from a cookie sent by the Sites. We cannot 
									access other cookies sent by other web sites or the information contained 
									therein. Additionally, We cannot learn Your email address through the use of a 
									cookie. The only way We would learn such Personal Information is if You 
									specifically submit that Personal Information to Us, for example, by purchasing 
									a product through our Sites, by entering a sweepstakes or promotion, by 
									requesting information, etc. We use cookies to track usage of the Sites and 
									further customize Your experience when You are visiting the Sites. By tracking 
									usage, We can best determine what features of the Site best serve the users. 
									Without cookies, the Sites would "forget" items that may be stored, such as 
									purchases or schedule searches, when You go to a different page. The session 
									information used by the Sites is deleted when Your browser is closed. We may 
									use cookies to track banner advertisement usage. We do provide third parties 
									with Aggregate Information about our users, such as “2,000 people viewed Your 
									ad today,” as more fully set forth below. On those pages of the Sites not 
									requiring Your registration, You may decline to accept cookies sent by the 
									Sites by selecting an option on Your browser to reject cookies. However, some 
									portions of the Sites may require registration in order to access those areas. 
									In such case, We ask that You register and provide Us with basic information on 
									our registration page. Cookies enable our server to know that You are a 
									registered user; therefore, our registration system requires that You accept 
									the cookies from the Sites. Other sites linked to the Site also may send 
									cookies; however We do not control such activities.
									<br>
									<br>
								</li><li>
									<b>USE OF INFORMATION:</b><br>
									Your privacy is important to us. We will use the Personal Information provided 
									by You in accordance with good commercial practice and applicable law. If you 
									provide Us with Your E-mail address, or have done so in the past, We may upon 
									occasion send You e-mail offers. We may use information provided by You, for 
									example, to provide a service, to ensure proper billing, to measure consumer 
									interest in our various services and to inform You about various products and 
									services offered on the Sites (including both our own products and the products 
									of others). These offers may be based on information provided by You in Your 
									initial transaction with Us, in surveys, from information that may indicate 
									purchasing preferences and lifestyles, as well as information available from 
									external sources such as census bureau data. These e-mail offers will come 
									exclusively from Bsafe Online or its affiliated companies. All offers are 
									carefully developed to ensure that they meet our standards. Our goal is to 
									target offers to Site user who We believe will find them of value. The lists 
									used to send You product and service offers are developed and managed under 
									conditions designed to safeguard the security and privacy of Your Personal 
									Information. By providing information using the Sites, You warrant to Bsafe 
									Online that Your Personal Information is reliable for its intended uses, 
									accurate, complete and correct, and that you will promptly notify use if such 
									Personal Information is no longer current or correct.
									<br>
									<br>
								</li><li>
									<b>NO DISTRIBUTION.</b><br>
									As a general policy, Bsafe Online does not share, sell or trade Personal 
									information with third parties without permission from the user; however, We 
									may provide Your Personal Information to third parties directly involved in the 
									operation, performance, support and/or maintenance of the Sites and each 
									product or service offered on the Sites, including our web site designers, 
									hosts, service providers, technical consultants and business partners. Any 
									Personal Information, however, will be used by such organizations only to 
									perform their functions and/or to provide services in support of the Sites or 
									as otherwise approved by You and for no other purpose. We reserve the right to 
									assign or transfer Your Personal Information to any successor in interest to 
									our business associated with the Sites by merger, reorganization, sale of 
									assets or operation of law. Aggregate information may at times be shared with 
									Bsafe Online business partners and other third parties. We also may divulge 
									Personal Information if such information is required for us to comply with any 
									valid legal process, such as a subpoena, search warrant, statute or court 
									order, or if we reasonably believe that You have commit unlawful acts or acts 
									that may endanger the health or safety of another user or of the general 
									public.
									<br>
									<br>
								</li><li>
									<b>OPT-OUT/OPT-IN:</b><br>
									Bsafe Online provides customers with an easy means to decline receiving e-mail 
									offers. Although most customers tell Us that they appreciate receiving notice 
									of these opportunities, We recognize the importance of providing You with the 
									choice to “opt-out”. If You do not want Bsafe Online to send You any e-mail or 
									postal mail about our products and services, You can opt out at the time by 
									contacting our Privacy Officer at the Contact Address. Also, all e-mail offers 
									sent by Bsafe Online will inform You as to how You can “opt-out” or decline 
									receiving further e-mail offers. If, at a later date, You choose to have Your 
									name removed from our database, You can do so by contacting our Privacy Officer 
									at the Contact Address. However, with respect to any Personal Information that 
									is sensitive in nature, we will require You to “opt-in” to having such Personal 
									Information used or shared by Bsafe Online.
									<br>
									<br>
								</li><li>
									<b>CORRECTIONS TO PERSONAL INFORMATION COLLECTED ONLINE.</b><br>
									Additionally, You may request to view the Personal Information collected about 
									You through Your use of the Sites by accessing Your account or sending an 
									e-mail to our Privacy Officer at the Contact Address. If You send Your request 
									by email, we will send such Personal Information (or a summary thereof) for 
									review to the email address on file for the account name in our database only. 
									If at any time You wish to change, correct or update Your Personal Information, 
									or have it removed from our database, You may do so by accessing Your account. 
									You also may submit a change request to our Privacy Officer by sending an email 
									to the Contact Address.
									<br>
									<br>
								</li><li>
									<b>ACCOUNTABILITY/CHALLENGING COMPLIANCE.</b><br>
									We have designated our Privacy Officer, who can be contacted at the following 
									address (“Contact Address”): By Mail: Privacy Officer, Bsafe Online, Inc., P.O. 
									Box 1149 Fort Walton Beach, Florida 32548-11492; By Email: 
									privacyofficer@bsafeonline.com. Our Privacy Officer is accountable for Bsafe 
									Online’s compliance with this Privacy Policy. If You have any challenge 
									concerning our compliance with this Privacy Policy or if You have any questions 
									about Bsafe Online’s purposes for the collection and retention of your Personal 
									Information, then please contact our Privacy Officer at the Contact Address and 
									provide a description of your concerns sufficient in detail to permit the 
									Privacy Officer to investigate your concerns and contact you. It is our intent 
									to make available to You through Privacy Officer specific information about 
									this Privacy Policy and our management of Your Personal Information as may be 
									required by applicable law.

									<b>CHILDREN:</b><br>
									Bsafe Online does not knowingly solicit data from children or knowingly market 
									to children. Bsafe Online is concerned about the safety of children and their
