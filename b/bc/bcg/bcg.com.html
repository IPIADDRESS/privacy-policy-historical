					<h2>BCG Privacy Policy</h2>


	<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p><p>The Boston Consulting Group ("BCG") understands that your privacy is important to you.&nbsp;BCG is strongly committed to protecting your privacy and the personal information that you may provide to BCG as you access and use the materials on BCG.com (the "Site"), including the subscription pages of the Site. In addition, information that you submit to BCG in response to an email request for information or other outreach from BCG, or through BCG’s employment application processes, will also be treated in accordance with this Privacy Policy.&nbsp;In this written Privacy Policy, BCG describes the scope and breadth of our commitment to privacy. BCG may, in its discretion, amend this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any material changes to our policy will be reflected on this page, so that you remain informed about the information we collect and how we use it. By exploring and using this Site, and by submitting information to BCG, you agree to BCG's use of such information as described herein. This Site may contain links to external sites, which sites are not governed by this privacy policy, and BCG does not take responsibility for the privacy practices of any third party sites to which we link. We encourage you to review the privacy policies of any such sites before you submit information there.</p><p><strong>Information That We Collect, and How We Use It</strong></p><p>BCG collects information from our users when they create their account for this Site, when they request copies of publications, seek additional information regarding our services or employment opportunities, or register for conferences and other BCG-sponsored events. Some of BCG’s registration, enrollment, account setup and other forms may ask users to give us contact information, unique personal identifiers, financial information, subject areas of interest and/or demographic information. We may use this data to tailor the visitor's experience at our Site or, if applicable, to assess candidacy and qualifications for employment with BCG.&nbsp;We sometimes aggregate demographic information, and the types of systems and browsers of users for internal purposes, so that we may better understand the user population of our Site, identify subject areas of interest, and determine whether the Site is designed to work with the computer settings of a majority of our visitors. BCG also may conduct user surveys on the Web, which usually are intended to provide BCG with information on a number of areas, such as user identity, user viewing habits, whether or not users found what they were searching for, whether the Site content is relevant to user needs, and the like. BCG uses the information gathered from such surveys to improve our web content, navigation, and overall visitor experience.</p><p>Any personal information that you provide, such as your name, address, e-mail address, phone number, subject areas of interest, etc., allows BCG to inform you about updates to the service and to notify you about other products and services offered by BCG that may be of interest to you. We will not sell, share, or rent or otherwise make available any of that information to other parties, except that we may disclose the information to third parties who perform services on our behalf and have a need to access the information in connection with those services.&nbsp;In addition, BCG may disclose contact information for you in response to inquiries by bona-fide rights owners in connection with allegations of infringement of copyright or other proprietary rights arising from information that you have posted on the Site or otherwise provided to BCG. Individuals that subscribe to e-mail newsletters are given the opportunity to opt-out of promotions, news, and information at the time of sign up. BCG also provides users the opportunity to opt-out of receiving communications from us at the points where we request information. You may also feel free to contact us as indicated below.</p><p><strong>E-Mail Addresses</strong></p><p>We may collect the e-mail addresses at the point of subscription, of users who wish to receive e-mail notification of publications and press releases in identified subject areas of interest, and of those who send us e-mail messages or express interest regarding our services or employment opportunities, or register for conferences and other BCG-sponsored events. We will not, however, share any e-mail addresses with any third party or send unsolicited e-mail to any of the addresses we collect, except in very limited circumstances as set forth in this policy.</p><p><strong>Cookies</strong></p><p>BCG may use browser cookies on this Site to keep track of your visit to our Site.
