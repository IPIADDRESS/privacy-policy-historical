How We May Collect Other  Information 
  We and our third  party service providers may collect Other Information in a variety of ways,  including:Â&nbsp; 

  Through your browser or  device:Â&nbsp; Certain information is collected by most  browsers or automatically through your device, such as your Media Access  Control (MAC) address, computer type (Windows or Macintosh), screen resolution,  operating system name and version, device manufacturer and model, language, Internet  browser type and version and the name and version of the Services (such as the  App) you are using.Â&nbsp; We use this  information to ensure that the Services function properly.Â&nbsp; 
  Through  your use of the App:Â&nbsp; When  you download and use the App, we and our service providers may  track and collect App usage data, such as the date and time the App on your  device accesses our servers and what information and files have been downloaded  to the App based on your device number. 
  Using  cookies:Â&nbsp; Cookies are pieces of  information stored directly on the computer that you are using.Â&nbsp; Cookies allow us to collect information such  as browser type, time spent on the Services, pages visited, language  preferences, and other anonymous traffic data.Â&nbsp;  We and our service providers use the information for security purposes,  to facilitate navigation, to display information more effectively, and to  personalize your experience while using the Services.Â&nbsp; We can recognize your computer to assist your  use of the Services.Â&nbsp; We also gather statistical  information about the usage of the Services in order to continually improve their  design and functionality, understand how they are used and to assist us with  resolving questions regarding them.Â&nbsp; Cookies further allow  us to select which of our advertisements or offers are most likely to appeal to  you and display them while you are on the Services.Â&nbsp; We may also use cookies in online advertising  to track responses to our advertisements, and we may use cookies or other files  to track your use of other websites for analytics or advertising purposes.


  If you do not want  information collected through the use of cookies, there is a simple procedure  in most browsers that allows you to automatically decline cookies, or be given  the choice of declining or accepting the transfer to your computer of a  particular cookie (or cookies) from a particular site.Â&nbsp; You may also wish to refer to http://www.allaboutcookies.org/manage-cookies/index.html.Â&nbsp; However, if you do not accept these cookies,  you may experience some inconvenience in your use of the Services.Â&nbsp; For example, we may not be able to recognize  your computer and you may need to log in every time you visit the applicable Services.Â&nbsp; You also may not receive advertising or other  offers from us that are relevant to your interests and needs.Â&nbsp; 
      We also use:
  
    Google Analytics, which uses cookies and other, similar  technologies to collect and analyze information about use of our Websites and  to report on activities and trends. Â&nbsp;You  can learn about Google Analytics by going to www.google.com/policies/privacy/, and opt  out by downloading the Google Analytics opt-out browser add-on, available at https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout; and
    Adobe's analytics service, which uses cookies and web beacons to help  us understand more about the effectiveness of our advertising campaigns.

  At this time, we do not respond to browser  &amp;ldquo;Do-Not-Track&amp;rdquo; signals.


  Using pixel  tags and other similar technologies:Â&nbsp; Pixel tags (also known as web beacons and  clear GIFs) may be used in connection with some Services to, among other  things, track the actions of users of the Services (including email recipients),  measure the success of our marketing campaigns and compile statistics about  usage of the Services and response rates.Â&nbsp; 
  IP Address:Â&nbsp; Your &amp;ldquo;IP  Address&amp;rdquo; is a number that is automatically assigned to the computer that  you are using by your Internet Service Provider (ISP).Â&nbsp; An IP Address may be identified and logged  automatically in our server log files whenever a user accesses the Services,  along with the time of the visit and the page(s) that were visited.Â&nbsp; Collecting IP Addresses is standard practice  and is done automatically by many websites, applications and other services.Â&nbsp; We use IP Addresses for purposes such as  calculating usage levels of the Services, helping diagnose server problems, and  administering the Services.
  Physical Location:Â&nbsp; We may collect the physical  location of your device by, for example, using satellite, cell phone tower or  WiFi signals. Â&nbsp;We may use your device&amp;rsquo;s  physical location to provide you with personalized location-based services and  content, including specific information about our Services if you are in  physical proximity to one of our properties and have opted into receiving text  messages from us. Â&nbsp;We may also share your  device&amp;rsquo;s physical location, combined with information about what advertisements  you viewed and other information we collect, with our marketing partners to  enable them to provide you with more personalized content and to study the  effectiveness of advertising campaigns.Â&nbsp;  In some instances, you may be permitted to allow or deny such uses  and/or sharing of your device&amp;rsquo;s location, but if you choose to deny such uses  and/or sharing, we and/or our marketing partners may not be able to provide you  with the applicable personalized services and content.
  From you:Â&nbsp; Other information, such as your preferred  means of communication, is collected when you voluntarily provide it.Â&nbsp; 
  By  aggregating information:Â&nbsp; Aggregated  Personal Information does not personally identify you or any other user of the Services  (for example, we may aggregate Personal Information to calculate the percentage  of our users who have a particular telephone area code).

How We May Use and Disclose Other  Information 
  We may use and disclose Other Information for any purpose,  except where we are required to do otherwise under applicable law.Â&nbsp; If we are required to treat Other Information  as Personal Information under applicable law, then we may use it for all the  purposes for which we use and disclose Personal Information. 
 In some instances, we may combine Other Information with  Personal Information.Â&nbsp; If we do, we will  treat the combined information as Personal Information as long as it is combined.
