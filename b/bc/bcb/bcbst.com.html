Information received from the BCBST web site depends in part on what you do when you visit or transact business on the BCBST web site.  BCBST respects the privacy of every individual who visits our web site.  Therefore, we would like to define the types of information we receive and describe how it is maintained in this privacy policy ("Privacy Policy").<br>
<br>
USING THIS WEB SITE CONFIRMS YOUR CONSENT AND AGREEMENT TO OUR PRIVACY POLICY, INCLUDING COLLECTION, USE AND DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION BY BCBST AS DESCRIBED HEREIN.  YOUR USAGE ALSO SIGNIFIES YOUR COMPLIANCE WITH OUR
<a href="user_agrmt.asp"><b> USER AGREEMENT</b></a>.</font></p>
<ul>
  <li><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Guests</b> - Browsers of our web site often visit solely to obtain general information about BCBST’s operations and services.  If you visit our web site to read or download information, you enter our secured site as a guest.  As a guest, we collect and store only the following information: the name of the domain from which you access the Internet (for example: aol.com, if you connect from an America Online account), the date and time you accessed our site and the Internet address of the web site from which you linked directly to our site.  We use this information to measure the number of visitors to the different sections of our site and to help us make our site more useful to visitors.</font></li>
  <li><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Members</b> - Browsers who currently have health insurance coverage with BCBST can access our web site to conduct transactions such as submit an application for coverage; check claim status, referrals and pre-authorizations; verify benefit information; and pay premiums.  Prior to utilization of these services, BCBST may ask for personal information (such as date of birth, social security number, name, address with zip code, telephone number and e-mail address) to verify appropriate usage.  This information is collected during registration at which time, you will be asked to create a user name and password.  BCBST, its employees or affiliates will not have access to your user name and password that you create.  Upon receipt of your registration, BCBST generates a confirmation letter to your address of record for additional security.  If you receive this notification by mail and did not register to access the services available on our web site, please contact BCBST immediately at

  <li><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Members Under 13 Years of Age</b> – BCBST often covers minor dependents through their parent or legal guardian’s health insurance policy.  Children under the age of 13 can access our site as guests.  Should they wish to use a service or feature available through the BCBST web site, we require that they do so with the permission of their legal guardian (i.e. user name and password of legal guardian).  BCBST will not knowingly collect or use any personal information regarding a user under the age of 13 without the consent of a parent or guardian.  Should you have any additional questions, please contact us at
    <a href="mailto:webmaster@bcbst.com">webmaster@bcbst.com</a>.&nbsp;</font></li>
  <li><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>E-Mail (Requests and Submissions)</b> – Please do not send e-mail to us with personal information.  BCBST has no way to secure personal information sent via e-mail because this information can be accessed by other users on the Internet.  If you send us e-mail to ask a question, we will only use the information you provide to answer your request.  Personal information will not be provided to a non-affiliated third party without your prior consent, except as permitted by federal and state law.  If you have submitted information about yourself through our web site and/or e-mail message and would like for us to delete that information from our records, please send an e-mail to

  <li><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Statistical Data</b> – BCBST continually strives to enhance the features and services that are offered to our web site browsers.  In an effort to determine the effectiveness and functionality of our web site, we monitor aggregated data regarding the use of our web site.  For instance, we track the number of visits to a certain page; direct links from other web sites; and frequency of usage for independent services (i.e. claim status, application for coverage, etc).  Questionnaires or surveys, during usage, are sometimes utilized to develop and improve the services offered.  Although questionnaires and surveys assist BCBST in enhancing the services offered through our web site, we understand that not everyone is comfortable participating.  Therefore, questionnaires and surveys are not mandatory for our users and allow the user to choose not to participate.   We may share statistical data with our affiliates, brokers, and providers for marketing purposes and the improvement and promotion of our web site services.  Although we reserve the right to share this information as indicated above, this statistical data, including questionnaires and surveys, does not contain any personal information that could disclose the user’s identity.&nbsp;</font></li>
</ul>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Disclosure of Non-Public Personal Information:</b></font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><font size="2" face="Arial">We restrict access to nonpublic personal information unless it is needed to complete a transaction that our member has authorized (i.e. claims administration, adjustment and management; detection, investigation or reporting of actual or potential fraud; misrepresentation or criminal activity; underwriting; policy placement or issuance; loss control; ratemaking and guaranty fund functions; reinsurance and excess loss insurance; risk management; case management; disease management; quality assurance and improvements; utilization review, actuarial, scientific, medical or public policy research; grievance procedures, audits, etc).  Information is shared with entities (i.e. providers and vendors) that assist BCBST in supplying products and services to our members or that promote products and services on behalf of BCBST.  Information is provided to nonaffiliated third parties as required by federal and state law.  BCBST maintains physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards that comply with federal regulations to guard your nonpublic personal information.</font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Arial">
  We reserve the right to disclose personal information to entities that perform marketing services (i.e. brokers) on our behalf or to other institutions with which we have joint marketing agreements.  BCBST requires each entity to execute a Confidentiality Agreement prior to disclosure.  The following information may be shared:</font></p>
  <ol>
    <li><font size="2" face="Arial">name, address and telephone number;</font></li>
    <li><font size="2" face="Arial">social security number and date of birth;</font></li>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Use of Cookies:</b></font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><font size="2" face="Arial">A “cookie” is a mechanism that permits a web server to send small pieces of information or text through your browser to be stored on your hard drive.  This information or text allows the server to identify frequent visitors of individual web sites.  BCBST may place a cookie on your computer that will allow us to identify users so that we may enhance their experience on our web site.  Our cookies are not used to track your activity on any site other than bcbst.com nor will they be utilized to send unsolicited e-mail or provide us with the users personally identifiable information.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Direct Access to Other Sites:</b></font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><font size="2" face="Arial">BCBST offers direct links to other separate and individual web sites that offer information, which could be beneficial to our members.  Since these direct links are separate web sites independent of bcbst.com, they may not follow the same privacy guidelines set forth here.  BCBST assumes no responsibility or control over the acts or privacy policies of the third party web sites to which BCBST provides direct links.  We suggest that you contact the appropriate controlling authorities of these sites or review their privacy policy.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Opt-Out</b></font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><font size="2" face="Arial">BCBST provides its members and users the opportunity to ‘‘opt-out’’ of having their information used for purposes not related to the BCBST web site when BCBST requests such information. Users who no longer wish to receive materials from our affiliates, brokers, or related third parties  may opt-out of receiving these communications by replying to unsubscribe in the subject line in the email or contacting BCBST at
  <a href="mailto:help_5911@bcbst.com">help_5911@bcbst.com</a> or (423)
  755-5911.&nbsp;</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Correction/Updating Personal Information</b></font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><font size="2" face="Arial">If the personally identifiable information of a user of our services changes or a group’s information changes, or if the user or group no longer desires to use the services on this web site, BCBST will endeavor to provide a way to correct, update or remove that user’s personal data.  To correct or update personal information, contact BCBST at

</blockquote>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Security</b></font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><font size="2" face="Arial">BCBST takes precautions to protect its users’ personal non-public information. When users submit sensitive information to BCBST, the information is protected both online and off-line.</font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Arial">
  When the registration/login form asks users to enter sensitive information, that information is encrypted and is protected with the encryption software, specifically SSL 3.0, RC4 with 128 bit encryption (High) which may be updated from time to time. While on a secure page, such as the login page, the lock icon on the bottom of web browsers such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to unlocked, or open, when you are just ‘‘surfing’’.</font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Arial">
  While BCBST uses SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, BCBST protects user-information off-line. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job are granted access to personally identifiable information. BCBST employees must use password-protected screen-savers when they leave their desk. When they return, they must re-enter their password to re-gain access to your information. Furthermore, all employees are kept up-to-date on BCBST security and privacy practices.
  Semi-annually, as well as any time new policies are added, employees are notified and/or reminded about the importance BCBST places on privacy, and what they can do to ensure our user information is protected. Finally, the servers that store personally identifiable information are kept in a secure environment.&nbsp;</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>BCBST Reserves The Right To Modify Its Privacy Policy</b></font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><font size="2" face="Arial">BCBST reserves the right to change or update this Privacy Policy at any time.  Any changes made to our privacy policy will be posted on this site in a manner that is easily identifiable.  Please review our privacy policy on a regular basis to review any changes.&nbsp;</font></p>
