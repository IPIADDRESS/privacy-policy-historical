          <p>Because we value your relationship with us, we have detailed below 
            our privacy objectives for our Web site:</p>
        <ul>
          <li> 
            <p><span class="bold">Security Practices</span><br>
              <br>
              We recognize and respect your desire for privacy when it comes to 
              your personal and health care affairs. We attempt to protect online 
              information according to established company security standards 
              and practices, and we continually evaluate new technologies for 
              safeguarding information.</p>
          </li>
          <li> 
            <p><span class="bold">Use of E-Mail<br>
              </span><br>
              Please use your own best judgment when sending information via the 
              Internet to an e-mail address. E-mail sent via the Internet may 
              pass through private and public networks with varying levels of 
              security. Some networks may have taken steps to secure e-mail transmissions 
              while others have not, thereby compromising the privacy and integrity 
              of an e-mail. An e-mail may be copied, altered or destroyed.<br>
              <br>
              <span class="bold">If you have personal or confidential information 
              to relay to our company, please call the appropriate member service 
              phone number that you will find in our <a href="customers/contactPhone.html">Blue 
              Cross Phone Numbers</a> section.</span><br>
              <br>
              We preserve the content of your e-mail, your e-mail address and 
              our response so that we can efficiently respond to questions you 
              might have. We also do this in an effort to meet legal and regulatory 
              requirements. <br>
              <br>
              We will respect your request to be, on not to be, contacted by e-mail.</p>
          </li>
          <li> 
            <p><span class="bold">Surveys and Forms<br>
              </span><br>
              You may have the opportunity to provide information to us through 
              online surveys and forms. We use this information to better understand 
              health care needs and to provide quality products, services and 
              other opportunities. <br>
              <br>
              BCBSAL wants your visit to our Web site to be informative and enjoyable. 
              We plan to use any information we obtain from you to help us continually 
              improve the content, functionality and overall usefulness of our 
              Web site; but in no way will make specific and individually identifiable 
              information given to us available without your specific consent.</p>

          <li> 
            <p><span class="bold">Updates to the Statement </span><br>
              <br>
              Evolving technology will continue to provide us with new and better 
              ways to collect and use information so that we may better serve 
              your health coverage needs. We may revise or update the BCBSAL Privacy 
              Statement in the future to reflect these technological advances, 
              and we encourage you to return to this page from time to time for 
              any updates.</p>

          <li> 
            <p><span class="bold">Confidentiality </span><br>
              <br>
              Again, please use your own best judgment when sending information 
              via the Internet to an e-mail address. <br>
              <br>
              <span class="bold">If you have personal or confidential information

              <br>
              If you do provide personal information, such as an e-mail, telephone 
              or fax number, or other identifying information, we do not plan 
              to disclose it without your consent. We maintain this information,

              government regulated, security and confidentiality standards.</p>
