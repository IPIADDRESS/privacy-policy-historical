This privacy policy was last updated on 8th February 2015.</p><h5>Information we may collect from you</h5><p>We may collect and process the following information about you:</p><ul class="body-1"><li>information (such as your name, email address, postal address and telephone number) that you provide by completing forms on the Site, including if you register as a user of the Site, subscribe to any service, upload or submit any material via the Site or request any information;</li><li>in connection with an account sign-in facility, your log-in and password details;</li><li>details of any transactions made by you through the Site;</li><li>communications you send to us, for example to report a problem or to submit queries, concerns or comments regarding the Site or its content; or</li><li>information from surveys that we may, from time to time, run on the Site for research purposes, if you choose to respond to, or participate in, them.</li></ul><p>You are under no obligation to provide any such information. However, if you should choose to withhold requested information, we may not be able to provide you with certain services.</p><p>We may, from time to time, run referral programmes or similar initiatives, such as a "Tell a Friend" programme, that invite you to provide us with the contact details of someone who is known to you who may find our products or services to be of interest.  We will only use those contact details for the purpose of the relevant initiative (and not for general marketing purposes). By providing us with their details, you confirm that you have their permission to do so and must not provide us with the details of anyone from whom you do not have such permission.  We reserve the right to identify you as the person who has made the referral in the message that is sent to them.</p><p>When you visit the Site, we may automatically collect additional information about you, such as the type of internet browser you use, any website from which you have come to the Site and your IP address (the unique address which identifies your computer on the internet) which is automatically recognised by our web server. You cannot be identified from this information and it is only used to assist us in providing an effective service on the Site and to collect broad demographic information for aggregate use.</p><h5>Cookies</h5><p>When you interact with the Site, we try to make that experience simple and meaningful. When you visit the Site, our web server sends a cookie to your computer.  Cookies are small pieces of information which are issued to your computer when you visit a website and which store and sometimes track information about your use of the Site. A number of cookies we use last only for the duration of your web session and expire when you close your browser. Other cookies are used to remember you when you return to the Site and will last for longer.</p><p>We use cookies to:</p><ul class="body-1"><li>remember that you have visited us before; this means we can identify the number of unique visitors we receive. This allows us to make sure we have enough capacity for the number of users that we get;</li><li>customise elements of the promotional layout and/or content of the pages of the Site;</li><li>collect anonymous statistical information about how you use the Site (including how long you spend on the Site) and where you have come to the Site from, so that we can improve the Site and learn which parts of the Site are most popular with visitors; and</li><li>gather information about the pages on the Site that you visit, and also other information about other websites that you visit, so as to place you in a "market segment". This information is only collected by reference to the IP address that you are using, but does include information about the county and city you are in, together with the name of your internet service provider. This information is then used to localise the service providers most suitable to you.

Please note, however, that by blocking or deleting cookies used on the Site, you may not be able to take full advantage of the Site.</p><p>In addition to cookies, tracking Gifs may be set by us or third parties in respect of your use of the Site. Tracking Gifs are small image files within the content of the Site or the body of our newsletters so we or third parties can understand which parts of the Site are visited and whether particular content is of interest.</p><h5>Uses made of your information</h5><p>We will use the information you provide to:</p><ul class="body-1"><li>enable us to process your orders for credits and to provide you with the services and information offered through the Site and which you request;</li><li>administer your account with us;</li><li>verify and carry out financial transactions in relation to payments you make online;</li><li>audit the downloading of data from the Site;</li><li>improve the layout and/or content of the pages of the Site and customise them for users;</li><li>identify visitors to the Site;</li><li>carry out research on our users' demographics and tracking of sales data;</li><li>send you information we think you may find useful or which you have requested from us, including information about our products and services [or those of carefully selected third parties], provided you have indicated that you do not object to being contacted for these purposes;</li><li>allow, with your consent, carefully selected third parties to send you information directly which you may find useful regarding their products and services.</li></ul><p>You can tell us not to contact you with information regarding our products and services [or those of third parties] [or to share your details with third parties so that they can send you information regarding their products and services], either at the point such information is collected on the Site (by checking or un-checking (as directed) the relevant box) or, where you do not wish us to continue to use your information in this way, by following the unsubscribe instructions on any communications sent to you.  You can also exercise the right at any time by contacting us using the Contacting us details at the end of this privacy policy.</p><p>Information sharing</p><p>We may disclose aggregate statistics about visitors to and users of the Site in order to describe our services to prospective partners  and other reputable third parties and for other lawful purposes, but these statistics will include no personally identifiable information.</p><p>We may disclose your personal information to any of our affiliates, or to our agents or contractors who assist us in providing the services we offer through the Site, processing transactions, fulfilling requests for information, receiving and sending communications, updating marketing lists, analysing data, providing support services or in other tasks, from time to time.  Our agents and contractors will only use your information to the extent necessary to perform their functions.</p><p>In the event that we undergo re-organisation or are sold to a third party, you agree that any personal information we hold about you may be transferred to that re-organised entity or third party.</p><p>We may disclose your personal information if required to do so by law or if we believe that such action is necessary to prevent fraud or cyber crime or to protect the Site or the rights, property or personal safety of any person.</p><h5>Public forums</h5><p>The Site may, from time to time, make chat rooms, message boards, news groups and/or other public forums available to its users.  Any information that is disclosed in these areas becomes public information and you should exercise caution when using these and never disclose your personal information.</p><h5>Child safety</h5><p>Protecting the safety of children when they use the Internet is very important to us.  We recommend that children receive permission from their parent or guardian before gaining access to the Site or sending personal information to us or anyone else online.</p><h5>External links</h5><p>The Site may, from time to time, contain links to external sites.  We are not responsible for the privacy policies or the content of such sites.</p><h5>Payment processing</h5><p>Payment details you provide will be encrypted using secure sockets layer (SSL) technology before they are submitted to us over the internet. Payments made on the Site are made through our payment gateway provider, Braintree. You will be providing credit or debit card information directly to Braintree which operates a secure server to process payment details, encrypting your credit/debit card information and authorising payment. Information which you supply to Braintree is not within our control and is subject to Braintree's own privacy policy and terms and conditions.</p><h5>Security</h5><p>We place great importance on the security of all personally identifiable information associated with our users. We have security measures in place to attempt to protect against the loss, misuse and alteration of personal information under our control. For example, our security and privacy policies are periodically reviewed and enhanced as necessary and only authorised personnel have access to personal information. Whilst we cannot ensure or guarantee that loss, misuse or alteration of information will never occur, we use all reasonable efforts to prevent it.</p><p>You should bear in mind that submission of information over the internet is never entirely secure. We cannot guarantee the security of information you submit via the Site whilst it is in transit over the internet and any such submission is at your own risk.</p><p>It is advisable to close your browser when you have finished your user session to help ensure others do not access your personal information if you use a shared computer or a computer in a public place.</p><h5>Storage of your information</h5><p>Information that you submit via the Site is sent to and stored on secure servers located in the United States. This is necessary in order to process the information. Information submitted by you may be transferred by us to our other offices and/or to the third parties mentioned in the circumstances described above (see Information sharing), which may be situated outside the European Economic Area (EEA) and may be processed by staff operating outside the EEA. The countries concerned may not have similar data protection laws to the EEA. Where we transfer your information we will take all reasonable steps to ensure that your privacy rights continue to be protected. By submitting information via the Site, you agree to this storing, processing and/or transfer.  </p><h5>Your rights</h5><p>You have a legal right under the Data Protection Act 1998 to a copy of all the personal information about you held by us.
