This is why we started Bidvine. We wanted a better way to find local service providers who could do what we needed, were available when we needed them, and were interested to help. With a background in marketing and marketplaces, as a team we felt uniquely positioned to tackle this challenge and build a business that could be everyone\'s first and best choice for getting from to-do to done as quickly as possible.","three":"We first conceived of this idea in a shared workspace in Dubai, UAE, are building the platform in Waterloo, Canada, are creating the reality of Bidvine and going to market in London, UK - and through it all we are powered by people."},"header":"About","hero":"Pursue your passions","metaDescription":"Bidvine finds you local service professionals for free.

Bidvine helps seasoned professionals with decades of experience expand their customer base. New professionals looking to win their first customers and build a book of reviews are also being successful on Bidvine. For more details on the types of pros having success on Bidvine, check out Bidvine\'s pro success stories, which are interviews with pros who are growing their businesses and earning great reviews.","a3":"Bidvine verifies some information about customers and pros to help make our platform a safer place for everyone. For pros, that includes requiring a profile photo, providing an official ID and completing Bidvine’s Verified ID process, and confirming an email address. For customers, we ask detailed questions related to each service, require that customers verify their phone number, and flag requests for additional screening where necessary. Both customers and pros are encouraged to report any suspicious behaviour to us.","a4":"You are required to add certain information including profile photo, business description, business location, and business type and business registration information. What information you add beyond this is always up to you, but we encourage all pros to add photos of their work and get reviews from past customers. Photos show your process and quality. Reviews show that you do great work and can be trusted to help out by providing a great experience. Reviews and photos dramatically increase your chances of getting hired - we can\'t overstress their importance.","a5":"You\'ll add your business location and how you meet customers: they come to you, you go to them, and/or you deliver your services online or over the phone. You also add all the services that you offer to your profile. We use this information plus our algorithms to match you with the right customers. Send a bid to the customers that are a fit. Pass on the ones that aren\'t a fit and adjust your settings so you aren\'t sent these mismatches in future.","a6":"Each time you choose to send a bid to a matching customer, you\'ll see how many credits the bid costs. You\'ll purchase credits to send the bid - with the number of credits depending on the service and the job size. If the customer does not view your bid within 4 days then we refund your credits. For some services, you can send bids automatically using BidMatch. With BidMatch, your bids are sent to matching customers immediately. Rather than paying to send the bid, you are only charged if the customer contacts you.","a7":"You don\'t. All payments are handled directly between you and the customer. They book you directly.
