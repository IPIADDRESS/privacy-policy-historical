<p><span class="bodytxt">When we collect personal information about you we will collect this information from you lawfully and fairly and not in any unreasonably intrusive way.&nbsp; You acknowledge and agree that we may collect this information from you in connection with or as a consequence of your use of our site, including, without limitation, the supply of the online trading services to you.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span class="bodytxt">We are the sole owner of the information collected on this site.&nbsp; We will not sell, share, or rent this information to others in any way other than as disclosed in this privacy statement.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span class="bodytxt">We collect information from our users at several different points on our site.&nbsp; We collect information about your bidding, buying and selling activities if you choose to participate on our site as a result of you engaging in these activities, and also from ratings and comments received from other users regarding you engaging in those activities.&nbsp; We also collect information from any form of correspondence, such as emails and telephone conversations, from you or from a third party about you.&nbsp; We may also collect information from you if you choose to partake in special promotions with third parties on our site. This information will be shared with that third party, but only with your consent and for the purpose of that promotion.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span class="bodytxt">We will also collect financial information about you if you choose to bid for certain goods and services on our site, if you sell on our site, and also as set out in the <u><a href="/static/help/TermsandConditions.html">Terms and Conditions of Use of this Site</a></u>.&nbsp; We do charge fees for selling, and your payment information will be used to charge you accordingly.&nbsp; We may pass your payment information onto recognised partners in certain cases, such as for charging you for selling and in those auctions where the services of shipping and delivery or fulfilment companies are offered to our users, but only in cases where our users have requested those services from us. Other information that we collect is outlined below.</span></p>
<p class="medhed"><b>Registration&nbsp;</b></p>
<p><span class="bodytxt">In order to use our site, you must first complete the registration form.&nbsp; When you register we collect personal information such as your name, address, email address, telephone and fax numbers.&nbsp; This information is used to contact you about the services on our site for which you have expressed interest.&nbsp; We also collect additional information (such as “How did you hear about us?”, your interests), and unique identifiers (such as your company name and VAT number, if applicable).&nbsp; All information that is mandatory is made known on the registration form and is necessary to complete the registration process. You are encouraged to provide the additional, optional information specified on the registration form so we can provide you with a more personalized experience on our site.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span class="medhed"><b>Cookies&nbsp;</b></span></p>
<p><span class="bodytxt">A Cookie is a small data file that your browser writes to your own computer’s hard drive in order to remember certain information and is linked to some personally identifiable information while on our site.&nbsp; Cookies are used to store your Handle and Password so that you don’t need to type these in each time you log in or make a bid, thereby saving time whilst on our site.&nbsp; If you reject cookies, you may still browse our site. However, in order to log in and bid or sell, cookies are required to be turned on.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span class="bodytxt">There are two sorts of cookies used on our site: session cookies and persistent cookies. &nbsp; Once you close your browser, the session cookie simply terminates, whereas the persistent cookie remains to enable us to track and target your interests to enhance your experience on our site.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span class="medhed"><b>Log Files&nbsp;</b></span></p>
<p><span class="bodytxt">We collect statistical information about you from page hits.&nbsp; Every page, image or cgi program requested by your browser from our servers is logged in a log file, which also collects the following information: your remote IP address, the referring HTML page and the type of browser and computer that you are using. &nbsp; We use IP addresses to analyze trends, administer our site, track your movements, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use.&nbsp; The statistical information we gather is used internally for marketing analysis.&nbsp; This information and IP addresses are not linked to personally identifiable information.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span class="medhed"><b>Sharing</b></span>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span class="bodytxt">If you successfully sell a product or successfully win an auction, or are the runner up in an auction where the winning bidder defaults, then your name, email address, phone number and fax number, payment details including credit card information and mailing address may be passed onto the other party involved in that auction in accordance with the <u><a href="/static/help/TermsandConditions.html">Terms and Conditions of Use of this Site</a></u>.&nbsp; For example, if you bid on an auction and win the auction, your details will be passed onto the seller of that item for auction. Similarly, if you are selling an item on auction, your details will be passed onto the winning bidder of your auction.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span class="bodytxt">We will share aggregated demographic information with our business partners and advertisers. &nbsp; When we do, you will not be personally identifiable, and your personal information will only be used as part of an aggregated compilation of information.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span class="bodytxt">We will release information about you when required by law to do so. &nbsp; Otherwise, we may release information about you, at our sole discretion, when we believe, that such release of information is reasonably necessary or appropriate to:</span></p>
<p><span class="bodytxt">(a) enforce or apply the <u><a href="/static/help/TermsandConditions.html">Terms and Conditions of Use of this Site</a></u>; or</span></p>
<p><span class="bodytxt">(b) to protect the rights, property or safety of bidorbuy.com, our users or others.</span></p>
<p><span class="bodytxt">We will also share information, including personally identifiable information about you, with our parent, subsidiaries and related entities in order to provide you with an international trading service.&nbsp; All these entities will treat your information according to this privacy policy and in the same manner they would treat their own users’ information.</span></p>
<p class="medhed"><b>External Links</b>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span class="bodytxt">This web site contains links to other sites.&nbsp; Please be aware that we are not responsible for the privacy practices or content of such other sites.&nbsp; We encourage you to be aware when you leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every web site that collects personally identifiable information.&nbsp; This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by this site.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="medhed"><b>Newsletter</b>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span class="bodytxt">If you wish to subscribe to our newsletter, we ask for contact information such as email addresses.&nbsp; However, it is completely at your discretion to be removed from such a list as set out in our choice and opt-out section below.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span class="medhed"><b>Site and Services Updates</b>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span class="bodytxt">We also send you site and services announcement updates.&nbsp; You are not able to un-subscribe from these because they contain important information about our site and our services.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="medhed"><b>Surveys &amp; Contests&nbsp;</b></p>
<p><span class="bodytxt">From time-to-time we request information from you via surveys or contests.&nbsp; Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and you therefore have a choice whether or not to disclose any information to us.&nbsp; Information requested may include contact information (such as email addresses) and demographic information. We partner with third parties for supplying prizes for our contests, but no information is shared with these third parties.</span></p>
<p><span class="bodytxt">Contact information will be used by us to notify the winners and award prizes in relation to our competitions, and also for promotional mailings.&nbsp; Survey information will be used for the purposes of monitoring or improving the use and satisfaction of this site.&nbsp; Established users of our site will be automatically entered into some of our contests, thereby providing them with more opportunities to win.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="medhed"><b>Public Forums&nbsp;</b></p>

<p class="medhed"><b>Security&nbsp;</b></p>
<p><span class="bodytxt">We take every precaution to prevent the loss, misuse and alteration of all information under our control.&nbsp; When you submit sensitive information via our site, your information is protected both online and off-line.</span></p>
<p><span class="bodytxt">When our registration form asks you to enter sensitive information (such as credit card number), that information is encrypted and is protected using SSL. &nbsp; While on a secure page, such as our registration form, the lock icon on the bottom of Web browsers such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to un-locked, or open, when you are just ‘surfing’.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span class="bodytxt">While we use encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also do everything in our power to protect user-information off-line.&nbsp; The servers that we store personally identifiable information on are kept in a secure environment.</span></p>
<p><span class="bodytxt">If you have any questions about the security at our site, you can send an email to <a href="mailto:hello@bidorbuy.com">hello@bidorbuy.com</a>.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="medhed"><b>Special Offers&nbsp;</b></p>
<p><span class="bodytxt">We send all new members a welcoming email to verify password and username. Established members will occasionally receive information on products, services, special deals, and a newsletter.&nbsp; Out of respect for the privacy of our users, our users have the option not receive these types of communications (refer to our choice and opt-out section below).&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="medhed"><b>Correction/Updating Personal Information:&nbsp;</b></p>
<p><span class="bodytxt">If your personally identifiable information changes (such as your email address), or if you no longer desire to use our services, you may correct, update or remove your personal data provided to us.&nbsp; This can be done at the member information page or by emailing our Customer Support at <a href="mailto:hello@bidorbuy.co.za">hello@bidorbuy.co.za</a>.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="medhed"><b>Choice/Opt-out&nbsp;</b></p>
<p><span class="bodytxt">If you no longer wish to receive our newsletter, information about products and services and special deals, surveys, or promotional materials from us or our partners you may opt-out of receiving these communications by following the unsubscribe instructions in the relevant email or by emailing us at <a href="mailto:hello@bidorbuy.co.za">hello@bidorbuy.co.za</a>.&nbsp;</span></p>
