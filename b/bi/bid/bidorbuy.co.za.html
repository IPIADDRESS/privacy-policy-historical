<p><b>Information Collection and Use</b> </p>

<p>When we collect personal information about you we will collect this information from
you lawfully and fairly and not in any unreasonably intrusive way.&nbsp; You acknowledge
and agree that we may collect this information from you in connection with or as a
consequence of your use of our site, including, without limitation, the supply of the
online auction services to you.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We are the sole owner of the information collected on this site.&nbsp; We will not
sell, share, or rent this information to others in any way other than as disclosed in this
privacy statement.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We collect information from our users at several different points on our site.&nbsp; We
collect information about your bidding, buying and selling activities if you choose to
participate on our site as a result of you engaging in these activities, and also from
ratings and comments received from other users regarding you engaging in those
activities.&nbsp; We also collect information from any form of correspondence, such as
emails and telephone conversations, from you or from a third party about you.&nbsp; We may
also collect information from you if you choose to partake in special promotions with
third parties on our site. This information will be shared with that third party, but only
with your consent and for the purpose of that promotion.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We will also collect financial information about you if you choose to bid for certain
goods and services on our site, and also as set out in the <u><a href="http://new.bidorbuy.co.za/legal/user-agreement.shtml">Terms and Conditions of Use
of this Site</a></u>.&nbsp; If we do charge a commission of any fees to you, then your payment
information will be used to charge you accordingly.&nbsp; We may pass your payment
information onto recognised partners in certain cases, such as in those auctions where the
services of shipping and delivery or fulfillment companies are offered to our users, but
only in cases where our users have requested those services from us.<b> </b>Other
information that we collect is outlined below.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b>

</b><p><b>Registration&nbsp;</b> </p>

<p>In order to use our site, you must first complete the registration form.&nbsp; When you
register we collect personal information such as your name, address, email address,
telephone and fax numbers.&nbsp; This information is used to contact you about the
services on our site for which you have expressed interest.&nbsp; We also collect
additional information (such as “How did you hear about us?”, your interests),
and unique identifiers (such as your company name and VAT number, if applicable).&nbsp;
All information that is mandatory is made known on the registration form and is necessary
to complete the registration process. You are encouraged to provide the additional,
optional information specified on the registration form so we can provide you with a more
personalized experience on our site.&nbsp;</p>
<b>

</b><p><b>Cookies&nbsp;</b> </p>

<p>A Cookie is a small data file that your browser writes to your own computer’s hard
drive in order to remember certain information and is linked to some personally
identifiable information while on our site.&nbsp; Cookies are used to store your Handle
and Password so that you don’t need to type these in each time you log in or make a
bid, thereby saving time whilst on our site.&nbsp; If you reject cookies, you may still
browse our site. However, in order to log in and bid or sell, cookies are required to be
turned on.&nbsp;</p>

<p>There are two sorts of cookies used on our site: session cookies and persistent
cookies. &nbsp; Once you close your browser, the session cookie simply terminates, whereas
the persistent cookie remains to enable us to track and target your interests to enhance
your experience on our site.&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Log Files</b>&nbsp;</p>

<p>We collect statistical information about you from page hits.&nbsp; Every page, image or
cgi program requested by your browser from our servers is logged in a log file, which also
collects the following information: your remote IP address, the referring HTML page and
the type of browser and computer that you are using. &nbsp; We use IP addresses to analyze
trends, administer our site, track your movements, and gather broad demographic
information for aggregate use.&nbsp; The statistical information we gather is used
internally for marketing analysis.&nbsp; This information and IP addresses are not linked
to personally identifiable information.&nbsp;</p>
<b>

</b><p><b>Sharing&nbsp;</b> </p>

<p>If you successfully sell a product or successfully win an auction then your name, email
address, phone number and fax number, payment details including credit card information
and mailing address may be passed onto the other party involved in that auction in
accordance with the <u><a href="http://new.bidorbuy.co.za/legal/user-agreement.shtml">Terms and Conditions of Use of this Site</a></u>.&nbsp; For example, if
you bid on an auction and win the auction, your details will be passed onto the seller of
that item for auction. Similarly, if you are selling an item on auction, your details will
be passed onto the winning bidder of your auction.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We will share aggregated demographic information with our business partners and
advertisers. &nbsp; When we do, you will not be personally identifiable, and your personal
information will only be used as part of an aggregated compilation of information.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We will release information about you when required by law to do so. &nbsp; Otherwise,
we may release information about you, at our sole discretion, when we believe, that such
release of information is reasonably necessary or appropriate to:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>(a) enforce or apply the <u><a href="http://new.bidorbuy.co.za/legal/user-agreement.shtml">Terms and Conditions of Use of this Site</a></u>; or</p>

<p>(b) to protect the rights, property or safety of bidorbuy.com, our users or others.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>We will also share information, including personally identifiable information about
you, with our parent, subsidiaries and related entities in order to provide you with an
international trading service.&nbsp; All these entities will treat your information
according to this privacy policy and in the same manner they would treat their own
users’ information.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b>

</b><p><b>External Links&nbsp;</b> </p>

<p>This web site contains links to other sites.&nbsp; Please be aware that we are not
responsible for the privacy practices or content of such other sites.&nbsp; We encourage
you to be aware when you leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and
every web site that collects personally identifiable information.&nbsp; This privacy
statement applies solely to information collected by this site.&nbsp;</p>
<b>

</b><p><b>Newsletter&nbsp;</b> </p>

<p>If you wish to subscribe to our newsletter, we ask for contact information such as
email addresses.&nbsp; However, it is completely at your discretion to be removed from
such a list as set out in our choice and opt-out section below.<b>&nbsp;</b></p>

<p>Site and Services Updates&nbsp;</p>

<p>We also send you site and services announcement updates.&nbsp; You are not able to
un-subscribe from these because they contain important information about our site and our
services.&nbsp;</p>
<b>

</b><p><b>Surveys &amp; Contests&nbsp;</b> </p>

<p>From time-to-time we request information from you via surveys or contests.&nbsp;
Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and you therefore have
a choice whether or not to disclose any information to us.&nbsp; Information requested may
include contact information (such as email addresses) and demographic information. We
partner with third parties for supplying prizes for our contests, but no information is
shared with these third parties.</p>

<p>Contact information will be used by us to notify the winners and award prizes in
relation to our competitions, and also for promotional mailings.&nbsp; Survey information
will be used for the purposes of monitoring or improving the use and satisfaction of this
site.&nbsp; Established users of our site will be automatically entered into some of our
contests, thereby providing them with more opportunities to win.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b>

</b><p><b>Public Forums&nbsp;</b> </p>

<p>If we make chat rooms and message boards available to our users, please remember that
any information that is disclosed in these areas becomes public information. &nbsp; You
should therefore exercise caution when deciding to disclose your personal information.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b>

</b><p><b>Tell-A-Friend&nbsp;</b> </p>

<p>If you elect to use our referral service for informing a friend about our site, we ask
you for your friend’s name and email address.&nbsp; We will automatically send your
friend a one-time email inviting them to visit our site&nbsp; We store this information
for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email.&nbsp; Your friend may at any time
contact us at <a href="mailto:hello@bidorbuy.co.za">hello@bidorbuy.co.za</a> to request
the removal of this information from our database.&nbsp;</p>
<b>

</b><p><b>Security&nbsp;</b> </p>

<p>We take every precaution to prevent the loss, misuse and alteration of all information
under our control.&nbsp; When you submit sensitive information via our site, your
information is protected both online and off-line.</p>

<p>When our registration form asks you to enter sensitive information (such as credit card
number), that information is encrypted and is protected using SSL. &nbsp; While on a
secure page, such as our registration form, the lock icon on the bottom of Web browsers
such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to
un-locked, or open, when you are just ‘surfing’.&nbsp;</p>

<p>While we use encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also do everything
in our power to protect user-information off-line.&nbsp; The servers that we store
personally identifiable information on are kept in a secure environment.</p>

<p>If you have any questions about the security at our site, you can send an email to <a href="mailto:hello@bidorbuy.com">hello@bidorbuy.co.za</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<b>

</b><p><b>Supplementation of Information&nbsp;</b> </p>

<p>In order for this site to properly fulfill its obligation to our customers, it is
necessary for us to supplement the information we receive with information from third
party sources.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Special Offers&nbsp;</p>

<p>We send all new members a welcoming email to verify password and username. Established
members will occasionally receive information on products, services, special deals, and a
newsletter.&nbsp; Out of respect for the privacy of our users, our users have the option
not receive these types of communications (refer to our choice and opt-out section below).<b>&nbsp;</b></p>

<p>Correction/Updating Personal Information:&nbsp;</p>

<p>If your personally identifiable information changes (such as your email address), or if
you no longer desire to use our services, you may correct, update or remove your personal
data provided to us.&nbsp; This can be done at the member information page<b> </b>or by
emailing our Customer Support at <a href="mailto:hello@bidorbuy.co.za">hello@bidorbuy.co.za</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<b>

</b><p><b>Choice/Opt-out&nbsp;</b> </p>

<p>If you no longer wish to receive our newsletter, information about products and
services and special deals, surveys, or promotional materials from us or our partners you
may opt-out of receiving these communications by following the unsubscribe instructions in
the relevant email or by emailing us at <a href="mailto:hello@bidorbuy.co.za">hello@bidorbuy.co.za</a>.&nbsp;</p>
