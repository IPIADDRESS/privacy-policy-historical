				<h1>BiddingForGood Privacy Policy</h1>
			</div>
				
			<p>The privacy of your personal information is very important to us. As such, BiddingForGood, Inc. ("BiddingForGood") (formerly cMarket, Inc.) presents this statement to give our users a clear understanding of how we operate our Web  site and how we handle your personal information. If you have any questions or  concerns relating to privacy or security, please send an email to <a href="mailto:webmaster@biddingforgood.com">webmaster@biddingforgood.com</a>. BiddingForGood may modify this statement at any time, and, if  we do, we will notify our users that we have done so.</p>
				
			<h3>What Information We Collect</h3>
			<p>When you visit and navigate our Web site, we will not collect personal information about you unless you provide us that information  voluntarily. By "personal information," we mean data that is unique  to an individual, such as a name, address, email address, telephone number or  credit card related information.</p> <p>When you register for any service or feature on our site, we require the following personal information: email address and first  and last name. We may also ask you to select a personal username and password. In addition, we request that you provide additional information, such as  gender, telephone number, street address, city, state, zip code and country. If  you register for any service under which BiddingForGood will process payments made by you, then we may require certain financial information (such as the name on the  credit card, credit card number and expiration date).</p> <p>BiddingForGood does not collect information posted in any discussion or chat areas on our site.</p>    
				
			<h3>How We Use Information</h3>
			<p>Because we consider any personal information you give us as confidential, except in the limited circumstances described below, BiddingForGood uses information collected from you in aggregate form only. In other words, we combine the information with data collected from other individuals to produce anonymous, aggregated statistical information. We collect and use demographic information in order to improve the products and services we offer, to conduct market research, to generate profiles and reports, and to improve  the overall experience of our site. We also may share this anonymous, aggregated information -- which does not identify individuals -- with partners, advertisers or other third parties.</p> <p>That said, except as described below, BiddingForGood will not disclose to third parties any identifying personal information gathered from you (including your email address) unless (1) we tell you how your information will be used and you give BiddingForGood specific permission to share this information or (2) BiddingForGood is required to disclose such information by any applicable law or legal process (like a subpoena or court order). Specifically, when users provide email addresses during an auction, those email addresses remain entirely under the control of the organization holding the auction, except as described below.</p> <p>An exception to this general rule concerns our role as a facilitator of online fundraising events. In order to fulfill this role effectively, BiddingForGood must be able to provide personal information of users to the organization holding the event. Specifically, BiddingForGood discloses the following information: (1) name, email and mailing address (and/or other contact information) of all donors, (2) name and email of all "interested parties" - e.g., individuals who access the BiddingForGood site via refer your  friends, email-this-page and/or email update functionalities, as well as  individuals who place watches on items, and (3) name, email, mailing address  (and/or other contact information) and credit card number or all high bidders  and second-highest bidders (in case the high bidder is ineligible).</p> <p> Two other exceptions to this general rule: (1) when a user arrives at, registers and bids in a BiddingForGood auction via a third party media source, BiddingForGood may share that contact information (email address) with that third party media source, as well as non-personalized bidder information; and (2) when a user registers for the BiddingForGood Bidder Community or participates in an auction that has elected to access the BiddingForGood Bidder Community, the user agrees to receive communications and other information regarding BiddingForGood.</p> <p>Finally, as a general matter, BiddingForGood may contact registered users to an auction with promotions or special offers related to products or services bid on by those users. Users may unsubscribe from receiving such information at any time.</p> <p>Please note that we do share non-personally-identifiable information (such as anonymous usage data, referring/exit pages and URLs, number of clicks, etc.) with interested third-parties so that they can understand usage patterns on our Site and assist us both in enhancing the BiddingForGood Service and improving your experience.</p>
				
			<h3>Security</h3>
			<p>BiddingForGood utilizes generally-accepted security measures (such as encryption) to protect against the misuse or unauthorized disclosure of any personal information you submit to us. However, like other Internet sites, we cannot guarantee that it is completely secure from people who might attempt to evade security measures or intercept transmissions over the Internet.</p>
				
			<h3>Updating Information and Opting-Out</h3>
			<p>We provide you with the ability to correct or update any information you have provided us. Simply click on the "My Acccount " link located at the top of each BiddingForGood auction page.</p> <p>If you no longer wish to receive communications from BiddingForGood, you may email us at <a href="mailto:webmaster@biddingforgood.com">webmaster@biddingforgood.com</a> or click on the "unsubscribe" link at the bottom of any email sent to you by BiddingForGood.</p> <p>You should know that opting-out or unsubscribing from our site does not delete the personal information from our system that  may exist in backup or disaster-recovery files.</p>
				
			<h3>Cookies</h3>
			<p>Cookies are pieces of data stored on your computer's hard drive by a Web site. Cookies are an industry standard and used by most  major Web sites to improve their services.</p> <p>BiddingForGood uses cookies for user convenience. The cookie will tell our system certain information so you don't have to fill in the same  information each time you visit us. However, BiddingForGood does not store this  information. Our site can only read the  cookies placed on your computer by us. We cannot access any information on your  hard drive placed there by you or any other source.</p> <p>Cookies also may be used by BiddingForGood on an aggregate basis to track site navigation. This information is not traceable to an  individual user.</p> <p>The cookie feature can be turned off on your browser. For more information on turning off the cookie feature, consult your browser "Help" section. If you choose to turn off cookies, you can still  access all areas of our site. However, you might have to "refuse" a  cookie each time you encounter one searching our site.</p>
				
			<h3>IP Addresses</h3>
			<p>An Internet Protocol (IP) address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer by your Internet service provider  whenever you access the Internet. This number may be the same each time you  access the Internet or it may change. Like other Internet sites, BiddingForGood uses  IP addresses to collect aggregate information about numbers of visitors and  site usage. The address is logged on our server when your computer requests  information from BiddingForGood. However, to allow users to access our site  anonymously, your IP address is not linked with personal information about you.  However, BiddingForGood reserves the right, in rare instances, to use IP addresses to  identify individuals who threaten our site, service or users.</p>
				
			<h3>Chats And Discussion Boards</h3>
			<p>Please be aware that chat areas and discussion boards are open to the public so others using these areas on our site can read your  posts. Any information you include when participating in chats or in posts to  discussion areas is available to anyone with Internet access. For example, if  you include your email address in a message you post on a discussion board, it  is publicly accessible.</p> <p>Chats and discussion boards are monitored. BiddingForGood reserves the right to remove any posts we feel are inappropriate, contain abusive language or threaten or violate the privacy of our company, sponsors or  visitors.</p>
				
			<h3>Surveys and Polls</h3>
			<p>If you respond to any surveys or polls on our site, we may ask you for demographic information such as your gender or age.  This information is collected only as anonymous, aggregated information  and is used for statistical purposes. Otherwise, we do not collect or  store your personal responses.</p>
				
			<h3>Children</h3>
			<p>We ask that only individuals who are over the age of 18 register on our site. If we learn that we inadvertently have  collected identifying personal information from an individual under the age of  18, we will promptly delete that information from our system.</p>
				
			<h3>Other Web Sites</h3>
			<p>This privacy statement applies only as long as you remain on the BiddingForGood Web site. Once you leave BiddingForGood to visit another site,  we have no control over your privacy or security issues even if you reached the  other site by clicking on a link within BiddingForGood.</p>
