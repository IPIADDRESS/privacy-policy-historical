Except as otherwise stated in this privacy policy, we do not provide this information to third parties, except in aggregate form. </p>
      <p>First, we or our partners or advertisers may use a feature of your browser called a cookie to assign identification to your computer. The unique user ID contained within your cookie automatically identifies your computer — but not you — to our servers every time you visit our site. Cookies by themselves cannot be used to find out the identity of any user. You can turn the cookies feature off by using your browser's preference options, but you may not be able to utilize some services properly. </p>

Your IP address is a number that identifies a computer which accesses the Internet. This address is used to gather broad demographic information about you, such as your Internet service provider and the geographic location of your IP address. Bid4Keywords.com may also collect aggregate information on how our users are utilizing the site. This might include information regarding traffic patterns through the site and search queries. </p>
      <p>Third, we log browser types, access times, URLs from which visitors came to our site and URLs viewed by visitors while on our site.
