        <h3>PRIVACY POLICY</h3>
<p><b>Effective Date:&nbsp;September 15, 2011</b></p>
<p>General Mills is committed to providing a fun, entertaining, and safe online  experience to people of all ages that may visit this site, and we take special  care to protect the privacy of children under the age of 13. &nbsp;&nbsp;We have developed our privacy practices based  on guidelines established by the Children’s Advertising Review Unit of the  better Business Bureau (CARU) and in compliance with the requirements  established by the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 (COPPA). &nbsp;We also recommend that parents monitor their  children’s internet activities and learn to employ software or other tools that  can help children enjoy the fun and entertainment of an online experience without  compromising their personal safety or allowing them to use the internet in a  manner inconsistent with their parents’ preferences.</p>
<p><b>What  information might we collect from children and how might we use it?</b><br>
  At General Mills, it is our policy to create website experiences for children  that require limited or no collection of personal information. &nbsp;Generally, we limit our collection of  information to non-personally identifiable information that is gathered through  a child’s voluntary submission to us or through the use of cookie, web beacon,  or similar technology.</p>
<p>From time to time, however, we may request limited personal information from a  child (such as name or email address) in order for that child to participate in  particular activities at this site. &nbsp;Except  in special, limited circumstances, we do not collect such information from a  child under 13 without the prior consent of a parent/guardian. &nbsp;When we ask for consent, we will tell the  parent/guardian what we will do with the information that their child provides  to us, how they can review their child's information, and how they can request  us to delete it. &nbsp;General Mills does not  condition a child's participation in any activity on the website on a child’s  disclosure of more information than is reasonably necessary to conduct the  activity.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, from time to time, we may collect information at this site from  a child under 13 without prior consent of a parent/guardian, but only in these  special, limited circumstances:</p>
<ol start="1" type="1">
  <li>We may seek a child’s name and a       parent/guardian’s email contact information to seek the parent/guardian’s       consent or to provide them with a notification. </li>
  <li>We may seek a child’s name and       email address in order to respond on a one-time basis to a specific       request of that child. &nbsp;For example,       if a child sends us an email request, we will hold their email address       long enough to respond to them and then delete it from our system after we       have provided an answer. </li>
  <li>From time to time, we may have       special online promotions or offers on this site that are open for       registration by children under the age of 13 (for example, a sweepstakes       or contest).&nbsp; If a child under the       age of 13 wishes to participate, we will ask for a parent/guardian's name       and email address so that we can notify them and give them an opportunity       to complete the registration for their child or to opt out of the activity       on behalf of their child. &nbsp;Any       information that is given to us in this circumstance is used only for the       purpose of conducting the activity and will be deleted from our system after       conclusion of the promotion and any legally required period for keeping       such information. </li>
  <li>We may seek a child’s name and       contact information to the extent reasonably necessary to protect the       safety of a child participating on our website. &nbsp;In this situation, the information will       only be used for the purpose of protecting the child’s safety and, as       above, we will provide the parent/guardian with notice of this use. </li>
  <li>We may seek a child’s name and       contact information to the extent reasonably necessary to protect the       security or integrity of our website; to take precautions against       liability; to respond to judicial process; or (to the extent permitted by       law) to provide information to law enforcement agencies or for an investigation       on a matter related to public safety. &nbsp;Such information will not be used for any       other purpose. </li>
</ol>
<p>Whenever we collect  personally identifiable information at the site, the information will be used  solely by General Mills or its agents or contractors for the purposes indicated  at the time the child (with parental/guardian notice or consent, as applicable)  provides the information. &nbsp;For example,  if a parent registers a child in a sweepstakes, we will use the information to  notify the child that he or she has won and to fulfill the sweepstakes prize. &nbsp;We also may transfer, disclose, or share such information  with third parties who are engaged by us specifically to administer or fulfill  certain online activities (e.g., conducting sweepstakes and contests). &nbsp;Such third parties have access to personal  information needed to perform their functions, but may not use it for other  purposes. &nbsp;Lastly, we may also disclose  personally identifiable information to third parties when required by law or  pertinent to judicial or government investigations or proceedings, or when otherwise  necessary to protect our website or the safety of its users.</p>
<p><b>How do we use cookie, web beacons, or similar technologies?</b><br>
  We may employ cookie  technology, web beacons, and similar devices on our site to facilitate site  administration and navigation and to provide an enhanced online experience for  our visitors.&nbsp; Information tracked  through these mechanisms includes but is not limited to (1) a user’s IP address  (e.g., yahoo.com - 192.168.1.1), (2) the type of web browser (e.g., Microsoft  Explorer) and operating system (e.g., Windows or Linux) being used, (3) the  pages of the site a user visits, and (4) other websites a user visited before  visiting our site.</p>
<p>Most browsers accept cookies automatically,  but can be configured not to do so or to notify the user when a cookie is being  sent.&nbsp; If you wish to disable cookies,  refer to your browser help menu to learn how to disable cookies.&nbsp; Cookies do not collect or contain personally  identifiable information such as your child’s name or email address.</p>
<p>Web beacons are 1x1 single-pixel graphics that  allow us to count the number of users who have visited a particular web page or  to access certain cookies.&nbsp; We may use  web beacons on our websites to count users and to recognize users by accessing  our cookies.&nbsp; Like cookies, web beacons  do not collect or contain personally identifiable information such as name or  email address.</p>
<p><b>Security</b><br>
  We have taken steps to protect the confidentiality, security, and integrity of  all information our visitors share will us. &nbsp;This includes setting up processes to avoid  any unauthorized access or disclosure of this information.</p>
<p><b>Send-to-a-friend tools</b><br>
  This site may, from time  to time, include a send-to-a-friend application that makes it easy for visitors  to forward information or materials from our site to friends or family by e-mail.&nbsp; In order to address the e-mail message, the  application will ask for the recipient’s e-mail address and/or similar  information (including the sender’s e-mail address).&nbsp; This information is only used by the  application to address the message so that it can be properly sent.&nbsp; General Mills does not retain any of this  information for any purpose.</p>
<p><b>Contacting us regarding your child’s personally identifiable  information</b><br>
  Upon providing proper identification, parents can request review, correct,  update, or have deleted their child’s personally identifiable information from  our database by&nbsp;writing to us at General Mills, Inc., Number One General Mills Boulevard, Minneapolis,   MN 55426,  Attn: Consumer Services. We can also be reached by telephone by dialing our  consumer response department at 1-800-328-8360 weekdays from 8 a.m. - 5 p.m. Central Time. &nbsp;Please feel free to use this same contact  information if at any time you have questions or concerns about our Privacy  Policy.</p>
<p><b>Changes to this policy</b><br>
General Mills reserves the right to change our practices and this site’s  Privacy Policy at any time. Any changes will be reflected on this page. &nbsp;Therefore we recommend that you visit our  Privacy Policy often so that you are always fully informed. &nbsp;In addition, we will send a notice to any  parent informing them of any material change in the collection, use, and/or  disclosure practices to which that parent previously consented.</p>
