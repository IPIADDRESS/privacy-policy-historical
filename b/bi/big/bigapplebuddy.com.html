Please read the following privacy policy (<strong>Privacy Policy</strong>) carefully as it sets out how we at BAB collect, use, disclose, transfer and store your information. This particular Privacy Policy applies to www.bigapplebuddy.com (<strong>Site</strong>) and all information collected via the Site, whether accessing or using this site through a personal computer, mobile device or other form of technology. By accessing and using the Site, you consent to the practices described in this Privacy Policy; if you do not agree, please do not access or use this Site.</p>
<p>Please note that other sites of BAB or any affiliated entities as well as any sub-sites, applications, features, programs, blogs or social networking functionality accessible through the Site, may have their own specific privacy policies. In addition, note that other websites which may link to or be accessible via the Site, including sites of BAB’s affiliated companies or third party sites, may also have their own privacy policies. BAB encourages you to review those applicable privacy policies.</p>
<p>Please note that in this Privacy Policy, the meaning of general words is not limited by specific examples introduced by including, for example, such as or similar expressions.</p>
<p><strong>1. Information We Collect</strong></p>
<p>You are free to browse through the Site to learn more about our services without providing any personal information about yourself. However, in order to participate in some activities, including for free quotes, to get more specific product or service information or availability, or to engage our services, we may ask you for information that could be used to reasonably identify or contact you personally (<strong>Personal Information</strong>).</p>
<p>Personal Information may include your first and last name, home, business or other address and zip or post code, telephone number and/or email address; if you are engaging BAB directly, including through the Site or via subsequent correspondence (including through email), additional Personal Information requested may include your shipping and billing information, as well as credit card information or other payment information necessary in order to confirm your engagement of BAB or to process your purchase.</p>
<p>At times, we may ask for employer-related information, such as company name, company contact information or market, when your activities on the Site are related to business-related products or services.</p>
<p>Other information we may also ask you to provide includes demographic information or information related to your preferences and interests.</p>
<p>If you choose not to provide this information to BAB, you may not be able to participate in certain activities, including promotions, or engaging BAB for services, or may not be able to access the full range of information regarding BAB and its services available via the Site.</p>
<p>BAB may also collect information about how you use the Site, including your search activities on the Site and preferences, information on the device you use to access and use the Site, and information on how you interact with the Site, including pages visited and the date, time and duration of your visit. This information is aggregated and used to help us provide a more user-friendly Site, as well as improve the Site’s functionality and our delivery of services or information to you. Any aggregated data that cannot be used to reasonably identify you or contact you personally is not considered Personal Information.</p>
<p>In addition to completing your engagement, purchase and/or registration, the information you provide will be used to support your customer relationship with BAB. For instance, the information may be used to provide customer support to you in the form of additional information about new or existing products and product upgrades, special offers, and/or services available from BAB; the information may also be used to otherwise enhance your experience on the Site or directly with BAB. BAB may share your information, which may include personally identifiable information, with third parties:</p>

<p>(b) to comply with applicable laws or regulations, court orders or subpoenas, to enforce our Terms and Conditions of Use or other agreements, or to protect our rights, property or safety or the rights, property or safety of our users or others (e.g., to a consumer reporting agency for fraud protection etc.);</p>
<p>(c) if the disclosure is done as part of a purchase, transfer or sale of services or assets (e.g., in the event that substantially all of our assets are acquired by another party, customer information may form part of the transferred assets); or</p>
<p>(d) as otherwise described in this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>BAB’s agents and contractors who have access to your personally identifiable information in connection with the above described activities are required to keep the information confidential and not to use it for any purpose other than to carry out the services they are performing for BAB. Further, subject to your prior approval (as set forth in the section herein entitled Opt Out), BAB may share your information, including personally identifiable information, with third parties, whereby the third parties may use your information for their own activities, including, but not limited to, market research, marketing and/or sales of product.</p>
<p><strong>2. How We Use Information Collected</strong></p>
<p>Any Personal Information or other information you provide via the Site will be used, first and foremost, to support your customer relationship with BAB, as well as to deliver information related to BAB and its products or services.</p>
<p>For instance, the information may be used to provide information or customer support to you in the form of providing you with services you are requesting from BAB, including technical support.</p>
<p>The information may also be used to process and complete any transactions you are requesting, such as direct purchases.</p>
<p>The information may also be used to communicate with you or provide you with additional information about our company, products or services, including new or existing products or services, where to purchase our products, product upgrades, special offers, marketing and advertising activities, to announce promotions, provide warranty or technical information on products obtained through BAB, as well as to deliver BAB news or information on upcoming BAB-related activities in general.</p>

<p><strong>3. Who Do We Share Your Information With</strong></p>
<p>BAB is not in the business of selling your Personal Information. However, there may be times when we share information you have provided to us or that we have collected via the Site with the following entities:</p>
<p>(a) Affiliates:&nbsp;BAB may share your Personal Information as well as other information we collect via the Site with our affiliated entities.</p>
<p>(b) Business Partners:&nbsp;We may also share your Personal Information or other information we collect with our business partners, including our authorized dealers and distributors from time to time.</p>
<p>(c) Third Party Service Providers:&nbsp;BAB may also share your Personal Information or other information we collect with third parties that provide services to or on behalf of BAB, including related to: warranty services; sales fulfillment; customer support, Site hosting, administration, support or development; data analytics; marketing initiatives or emails; and promotional communications, support or administration. Those third party service providers are only authorized by BAB to use the information to provide services on behalf of BAB and providing the use is consistent with this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>(d) Parties Involved in Corporate Transactions:&nbsp;We may disclose your Personal Information or other information collected via the Site with our affiliated entities or third parties as part of a transfer of BAB’s business assets, a merger or acquisition or a corporate reorganization.</p>
<p>(e) Parties Involved in Law Enforcement or Legal Protections:&nbsp;There may be times when BAB will disclose or share your Personal Information or other information collected via the Site in order to comply with the law, applicable regulations, court orders or subpoenas, or search warrants. Your Personal Information or other information collected via the Site may also be used to enforce our Terms and Conditions or other agreements, or to protect our rights, property or safety, or the rights, property or safety of our users or others.</p>
<p>Other than above, BAB will provide notice when Personal Information about you may be shared with third parties and you will have an opportunity to choose not to share the information. To the extent that you share your Personal Information or any other information with any of the parties referenced above in this section and such information is not in their possession through BAB sharing it with them, please refer to the privacy policies of those entities to determine how your Personal Information or other information is used. BAB’s contractors or third party service providers who have access to your Personal Information in connection with the provision of services for or on behalf of BAB are required to keep the information confidential and not use it for any purpose other than to carry out the services they are providing to or on behalf of BAB.</p>
<p><strong>4. How We Respond to Do Not Track Signals</strong></p>
<p>As there is currently no industry standard on how Do Not Track signals should be responded to or how Do Not Track functionality is activated across various web browsers, BAB does not at the present time generally respond to Do Not Track signals.</p>
<p><strong>5. Cookies</strong></p>
<p>A ‘Cookie’ is a text-only string of characters that is temporarily stored in your computer’s memory. Our Cookies are time sensitive. If the expiration of a Cookie is set to be longer than the time you spend on a site, then this string is saved in a Cookie on your hard drive for future reference, otherwise it disappears from your computer when your browser is closed. Cookies such as those we use cannot retrieve information from your computer’s hard drive, destroy files, or send viruses. When a Cookie is placed on your hard drive, it does not allow access to your personal information although it may be used to identify your computer. BAB may use Cookies to track the pages that a user visits on the Site so that information can be customized to the visitor on a session-by-session basis, and so that future visits on the Site may be enhanced. It is a quick and convenient means of keeping site content fresh and relevant to the viewer.</p>
<p>If you would prefer not to accept Cookies, most browsers will allow you to:</p>
<p>(a) change your browser settings to notify you when you receive a Cookie, which lets you choose whether or not to accept it;</p>
<p>(b) disable existing Cookies; or</p>
<p>(c) set your browser to automatically reject any Cookies.</p>
<p>Please be aware that if you disable or reject Cookies, some features and services on our Site may not work properly.</p>
<p><strong>6. Web Beacons</strong></p>
<p>In conjunction with Cookies, BAB may also, from time to time, use “Web Beacons” on the Site and in some BAB emails to monitor traffic generated from various forms of advertising such as banner ads, or to track general traffic. A Web Beacon is a graphic on a web page or in an email message designed to track pages viewed and messages opened. Web Beacons are often invisible because they are typically only 1-pixel by 1-pixel in size. In many cases, companies place Web Beacons on web pages to collect data about visitors. When a user requests a page on our Site, the Web Beacon is retrieved/activated. Once the Web Beacon is retrieved/activated, it points to an external site to retrieve the image. At that time it can also pass along information such as the IP address of the computer that retrieved the image, the time the Web Beacon was viewed and for how long, and the type of browser that retrieved the image. This information is then compiled and made available to BAB. Web Beacons, along with Cookies, enable us to enhance your experience on the Site and assess our marketing efforts; like Cookies, Web Beacons do not access your personal information.</p>
<p><strong>7. Interest-Based Marketing</strong></p>
