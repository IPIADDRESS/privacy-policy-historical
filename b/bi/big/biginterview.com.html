  <div class="width-1180 terms">
    <p>
      Thank you for using Big Interview. We are committed to protecting your
      privacy and, for that reason, we have adopted this Privacy Policy (the
      “Policy”) to memorialize our data collection and disclosure practices
      for our website and the services we provide through our website and
      underlying technology (the “Services”). This Policy applies to all of
      the products, services and websites offered by Skillful Communications,
      LLC or Big Interview or its subsidiaries or affiliated companies
      ("Big Interview").
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>Consent</strong>
        <span class="br"></span>
        By using the Services or our website, you consent to this Policy. If you do not
        agree with this Policy, you may not use the Services or our website. Information
        gathered through the Services may be transferred, used, and stored in the United
        States and in foreign jurisdictions in which we, our agents, customers and other
        users of the Services are located. If you access the Services, you consent to
        the transfer, use and storage of your Personal Information in those
        jurisdictions. The data protection and other laws of the United States and other
        countries might not be as comprehensive as those in your country. You further
        agree that all transactions relating to the Services or our website shall be
        deemed to have occurred in the United States.
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Collection of Personal Information</strong>
        <span class="br"></span>
        We collect Personal Information in connection with our Services. When we use the
        term “Personal Information” we are talking about information that can be used to
        identify an individual and may include, but is not limited to, your name,
        address, email address, phone number and any profile information you choose to
        submit through our website.
        <span class="br"></span>
        Big Interview may also collect non-Personal Information (aggregate,
        non-individually identifiable or demographic). An example of non-Personal
        Information would be system-related information such as IP addresses, use
        information, browser and browser speed, bandwidth of your internet connectivity,
        general location of your server and the pages of our site that were viewed
        during a visit. We use this information for internal purposes to help us
        diagnose problems, monitor traffic patterns and otherwise continually improve
        our Services.
        <span class="br"></span>
        Furthermore, the Services may provide links to third party sites. We are not
        responsible for the privacy policies, practices or the content of websites owned
        by others that you may link to or that may be linked from the Services.
        Accordingly, we encourage you to review the privacy policies and terms of
        service of those websites so that you understand how those websites collect, use
        and share any Personal Information.
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Use of Personal Information</strong>
        <span class="br"></span>
        Only authorized Big Interview employees and service providers and authorized
        designees have access to Personal Information. Big Interview uses the Personal
        Information to assist us in setting up accounts, improving online operations;
        processing transactions; providing customer service; providing your with
        newsletters, RSS feeds and/or other communications or services which you may
        have signed up for or otherwise agreed to receive; sending account- or
        transaction-related communications such as welcome letters and transaction
        confirmations; performing research and analysis aimed at improving our products,
        services and technologies; and managing our systems. We will only use your
        Personal Information in the way we specified when it was collected (including as
        described in this Privacy Policy). If we use Personal Information in a manner
        different than the purpose for which it was collected (including as described in
        this Privacy Policy), then we will ask for your consent prior to such use. If we
        propose to use Personal Information for any purposes other than those described
        in this Policy, we will offer you an effective way to opt out of the use of
        Personal Information for those other purposes.
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Disclosure of Personal Information</strong>
        <span class="br"></span>
        We may disclose Personal Information and non-Personal Information to other users
        of the Services and to companies, agents, contractors, service providers or
        others engaged to perform functions on our behalf (such as processing payments,
        provision of data storage, hosting of our website, marketing of our products and
        services, conducting audits and performing web analytics) or on behalf of the
        interviewing companies. We may also disclose your Personal Information to third
        parties when we believe, in good faith and in our sole discretion, that such
        disclosure is reasonably necessary to (a) enforce or apply the terms and
        conditions of the Services, including investigation of potential violations
        thereof, (b) comply with legal or regulatory requirements or an enforceable
        governmental request, (c) protect the rights, property or safety of us, our
        users or other third parties, (d) prevent a crime or protect national security,
        or (e) detect, prevent or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues.
        We may also disclose non-Personal Information to our clients, business partners,
        merchants, advertisers, investors, potential buyers and other third parties if
        we deem such disclosure, in our sole discretion, to have sound business reasons
        or justifications. We do not sell, rent, share or trade your Personal
        Information to third parties for marketing purposes unless you have granted up
        permission to do so.
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Accessing and Updating Personal Information</strong>
        <span class="br"></span>
        When you use our Services, we make good faith efforts to provide you with access
        to your Personal Information and either to correct this data if it is inaccurate
        or to delete such data at your request if it is not otherwise required to be
        retained by law or for legitimate business purposes. We ask individual users to
        identify themselves and the information requested to be accessed, corrected or
        removed before processing such requests, and we may decline to process requests
        that are unreasonably repetitive or systematic, require disproportionate
        technical effort, jeopardize the privacy of others, or would be extremely
        impractical (for instance, requests concerning information residing on backups),
        or for which access is not otherwise required. In any case, where we provide
        information access and correction, we perform this service free of charge,
        except if doing so would require a disproportionate effort. Some of our services
        have different procedures to access, correct and delete users’ Personal
        Information.
        <span class="br"></span>
        Please email us at privacy [at] biginterview.com with any questions, if you need
        assistance accessing or changing your Personal Information, or if you would like
        to have your Personal Information deleted. Please be aware that if you delete
        your Personal Information, you may not be able to continue to use the website or
        the Services.
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Cookies</strong>
        <span class="br"></span>
        Non-Personal Information (including aggregate, technical or demographic
        information) can also be collected through the standard operation of our
        internet servers and logs as well as other automatic data collection tools such
        as “cookies,” “beacons” and other similar technologies. A “cookie” is a small
        text file that is recorded either temporarily or persistently on your hard drive
        and that a website can use in order to recognize visitors who revisit a website
        so as to facilitate their ongoing access to and use of the website. “Beacons”
        are graphics designed to collect web log information such as pages viewed or
        messages opened. Cookies can be prevented by activating the facility that is
        available in most web browsers that enables the user to deny or accept cookies.
        Recognize, however, that cookies may be necessary in order to provide certain
        features such as the customized delivery of certain information. We do not use
        cookies or Beacons to collect Personal Information.
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>International Users</strong>
        <span class="br"></span>
        By visiting our website and by providing us with your Personal Information or
        data, you acknowledge and agree that due to the international dimension of Big
        Interview we may use the Personal Information or data collected in the course of
        our relationship for the purposes identified in this Policy or in our other
        communications with you, including the transmission of information outside your
        resident jurisdiction. In addition, please understand that such Personal
        Information and data may be stored on servers located in the United States. By
        providing us with your Personal Information or data, you consent to the transfer
        of such data.
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Children</strong>
        <span class="br"></span>
        We do not knowingly or specifically collect Personal Information from users
        under 13 years of age. We do not authorize users under 13 years of age to use
        the Services or our website. If we learn that we have collected Personal
        Information on a child under the age of 13, we will delete that data from our
        systems.
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Information Security</strong>
        <span class="br"></span>
        We have built our entire technology system so that users can not access data
        without an appropriate password. In addition, we utilize Secure Socket Layer
        (SSL) encryption technology when data is transmitted over the Internet, and have
        installed firewalls to help prevent external access into our network. In
        addition, our servers are hosted at a leading third-party facility for added
        security and reliability. Unfortunately, however, no data transmission over the
        Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. Therefore, while we strive to use
        commercially acceptable means to protect your Personal Information, we cannot
        guarantee its security.
        <span class="br"></span>
        We restrict access to Personal Information to Big Interview employees,
        contractors, service providers and agents who need to know that information in
        order to operate, develop or improve our Services or website. These individuals
        are bound by confidentiality obligations and may be subject to discipline,
        including termination and criminal prosecution, if they fail to meet these
        obligations.
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Sale of the Business</strong>
        <span class="br"></span>
        Big Interview reserves the right to transfer information (including your
        Personal Information) to a third party in the event of a sale, merger or
        transfer of all or substantially all of the assets of our company, or in the
        unlikely event of a bankruptcy, liquidation or receivership of our business,
        provided that the third party agrees to adhere to the terms of this Policy.
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Your California Privacy Rights</strong>
        <span class="br"></span>
        A California resident who has provided personal information to a business with
        whom he/she has established a business relationship for personal, family, or
        household purposes (“California Customer”) is entitled to request information
        about whether the business has disclosed Personal Information to any third
        parties for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes. In general, if the
        business has made such a disclosure of Personal Information, upon receipt of a
        request by a California Customer, the business is required to provide a list of
        all third parties to whom Personal Information was disclosed in the preceding
        calendar year, as well as a list of the categories of Personal Information that
        were disclosed.
        <span class="br"></span>
        However, under the law, a business is not required to provide the
        above-described lists if the business adopts and discloses to the public (in its
        privacy policy) a policy of not disclosing customer’s Personal Information to
        third parties for their direct marketing purposes unless the customer first
        affirmatively agrees to the disclosure, as long as the business maintains and
        discloses this policy. Rather, the business may comply with the law by notifying
        the customer of his or her right to prevent disclosure of Personal Information
        to third parties for direct marketing purposes and providing a cost free means
        to exercise that right.
        <span class="br"></span>
        As stated in our Policy, we do not share information with third parties for
        their own direct marketing purposes unless you affirmatively agree to such
        disclosure -- typically by opting in to receive information from a third party.
        If you do ask us to share your information with a third party for its marketing
        purposes, we will only share information in connection with that specific
        situation, as we do not share information with any third party for their own
        direct marketing purposes on a continual basis. To prevent disclosure of your
        Personal Information for use in direct marketing by a third party for its own
        purposes, do not opt in to such use when you provide Personal Information on one
        of our sites. Please note that whenever you opt in to receive future
        communications from a third party, your information will be subject to the third
        party’s privacy policy. If you later decide that you do not want that third
        party to use your information, you will need to contact the third party
        directly, as we have no control over how third parties use information. You
        should always review the privacy policy of any party that collects your
        information to determine how that entity will handle your information.
        <span class="br"></span>
        California Customers may request further information about our compliance with
        this law by e-mailing privacy[at]biginterview.com. Please note that we are only
        required to respond to one request per customer each year, and we are not
        required to respond to requests made by means other than through this e-mail
        address.
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Changes to this Policy</strong>
        <span class="br"></span>
        Big Interview reserves the right to change this Policy at any time. In
        particular, and without limiting the foregoing, we may modify this Policy to
        reflect changes in the way we collect, use or disclose information, or to
        reflect changes in privacy laws, regulations and/or industry standards. We
        encourage you to review this Policy when accessing the Services.
        <span class="br"></span>
        We will post a notice to this Policy and the home page link whenever this Policy
        is materially changed so that you are aware of what information we collect, how
        we use it and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. Your continued
        use of the Big Interview website or Services after any change will signify and
        confirm your assent to those changes. However, we will not apply any material
        changes to Personal Information collected prior to the posting of such changes
        without obtaining your affirmative consent.
        <span class="br"></span>
        You can also check the “Revised and updated” date at the top of this Privacy
        Policy to see when the Privacy Policy was last changed. We encourage you to
        check this Privacy Policy from time to time to familiarize yourself with the
        most recent version of this Policy.
