IP addresses, etc. are not linked to personally identifiable information. We may use a tracking utility that uses log files to analyze user movement.</p>

<h3 dir="ltr">Notification of Changes</h3>
<p dir="ltr">Whenever BigAppled.com &nbsp;changes its privacy policy, we will post those changes to this privacy statement, and other places we deem appropriate so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it.</p>
