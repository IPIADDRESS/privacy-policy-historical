Bigfoot Privacy Notice and Choices:</b></font></font> 
<p><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">As set forth in the Conditions 
  of Use, Bigfoot provides (a) computing and information services and (b) telecommunications 
  services (including the Bigfoot SMS Manager, Bigfoot Conference Call and Domain 
  Registration) (collectively the "Services" or the "Bigfoot Services") 
  to persons who join Bigfoot as non-paying Members or Premium Users or other 
  persons using the Services ("Members" or "Users" or "you"). 
  As part of the registration process for the Services, you are asked to provide 
  certain personal information and (if applicable) credit card or other billing 
  information. The policy of Bigfoot is to protect the privacy of Bigfoot Members 
  who are using any of the Bigfoot Services. Please be aware, however, that as 
  a condition of membership and use of the Bigfoot Services, Bigfoot requires 
  Members to select areas of interest and thereby agree to receive marketing materials 
  from Bigfoot or third parties related to those interests. Members may choose 
  at any time to opt-out of mailings on their profile, including during registration 
  and when they receive any third-party mailings from Bigfoot; however, Bigfoot 
  reserves the right to cancel the membership of Non-Premium Users in the event 
  such a Member chooses to completely opt-out of all mailings.<br>
  Please recognize that it is the policy of Bigfoot to protect the privacy of 
  its Members, and thus Bigfoot will only allow third parties to have access to 
  information concerning Users ("User Information") in the following 
  situations: <br>
  (i) Bigfoot will provide access to certain User Information to third-party suppliers 
  in order for them to perform certain functions for us as necessitated by the 
  Member's use of any of the Services -- for example, credit card numbers are 
  sent to a credit card processing company for billing. These suppliers are not 
  authorized to release this information to other third parties. <br>
  (ii) Bigfoot will disclose User Information in cases where, in its discretion, 
  it deems such disclosure required or appropriate in order to comply with applicable 
  laws and regulations. <br>
  (iii) Bigfoot is a commerce and advertising supported business and the availability 
  of the Services depends substantially on its perceived value among marketers 
  that pay for advertisements and retail opportunities through Bigfoot. Marketers 
  seek to direct advertisements and shopping opportunities to Members who have 
  expressed interest in a category relevant to the offer. Accordingly, Bigfoot 
  may provide User Information (name and email address, but never your credit/debit 
  card information or other payment information) to third parties for purposes 
  of providing you information about third party products, promotions and services 
  that are likely to be of interest to Members. If at any time you decide you 
  do not wish to receive such third-party product information, you may opt-out 
  of future mailings by sending an email to Bigfoot at </font><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif"><a href="mailto:help@bigfoot.com">help@bigfoot.com</a></font><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif"></font><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif"> 
  and Bigfoot will honor such a request without question. Bigfoot reserves the 
  right to cancel a Non-Premium User's membership in the event a Non-Premium User 
  chooses to completely opt-out of all mailings. <br>
  (iv) Bigfoot will disclose User Information if the User gives permission, requests 
  products that require identifying information for fulfillment, or we are required 
  to do so by law or regulatory authority. <br>
  (v) Notwithstanding anything else contained in this Privacy Policy, Bigfoot 
  reserves the right to sell or otherwise transfer your User Information to one 
  or more third parties in connection with a sale of all or substantially all 
  of the assets of Bigfoot or in connection with the sale of all or substantially 
  all of the stock or ownership interests in Bigfoot. <br>
  Bigfoot may send Users periodic emails containing information about Bigfoot, 
  administrative notices about a User's account (such as notices about pending 
  activities), updates on new Service features, usage tips relating to the Services, 
  information about Bigfoot or third party products and services that are likely 
  to be of interest to you, and user satisfaction questions. Bigfoot may also 
  access user information for the following administrative purposes: (a) to examine 
  system accounting logs and other company records to resolve email and other 
  system errors or problems and (b) for billing purposes. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif"><font color="#003399"><b>II. 
  Credit Card Information:</b></font> </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">If any person uses a credit 
  or debit card to pay for any of the Services offered by Bigfoot requiring payment 
  of a fee or fees (including the Premium User Service and any of the Bigfoot 
  Services), Bigfoot will continue to charge your account until you provide Bigfoot 
  notice of termination of use of the service (in accordance with the Conditions 
  of Use) and all usage fees have been paid. Notwithstanding termination by a 
  Member of the Premium User Services or of any other Bigfoot Service, Bigfoot 
  will not refund any portion of the annual fee, any prepaid fee or any charges 
  (except as may be expressly provided in the terms and conditions of use of any 
  of the Bigfoot Services). Unless you advise Bigfoot of your desire to cancel 
  the Premium User Service, your membership will be automatically renewed on quarterly 
  basis and the quarterly fee will be charged to the credit or debit card you 
  provided. As annual, quarterly, monthly or other periodic fees or charges may 
  apply to the other Bigfoot Services, you are advised to review the terms and 
  conditions of use for any of the Bigfoot Services you may use. If you give us 
  credit or debit card information for any purpose other than payment of fees 
  or charges associated with the Bigfoot Services or to pay for any other type 
  of purchase, it will be used one time only to fulfill one order, and Bigfoot 
  will not store your credit card information. Each User is responsible for all 
  charges resulting from use of the Services, including unauthorized use prior 
  to your notifying Bigfoot of such use and taking steps to prevent its further 
  occurrence. Further, each User agrees to be financially responsible for use 
  of the Services (as well as for use of your account by others, including minors 
  living with you) and to comply with your responsibilities and obligations as 
  stated in this Agreement. </font></p>

  Children May Not Use the Services Without Parental Permission:</b></font> </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">Bigfoot adheres to the requirements 
  of the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 ("COPPA"). 
  As such, children under the age of thirteen may not use the Premium User Service 
  or Bigfoot Conference Call Manager (or other Services requiring payment of a 
  fee) and must always ask parents or a legal guardian for permission, and provide 
  verifiable consent of a parent or legal guardian, before becoming a member of 
  Bigfoot and before sending any personal information to Bigfoot, or anywhere 
  on the Internet. All other children should always ask parents or a legal guardian 
  for permission before sending any personal information to Bigfoot, or anywhere 
  on the Internet. Parents are encouraged to spend time online with their children 
  to become familiar with the types of content available through Bigfoot and over 
  the Internet in general and to regularly oversee their children's use of email 
  and other online facilities. Children should check with their parents before 
  supplying any information about themselves or their likes and dislikes, before 
  they sign up for Bigfoot. Moreover, as it is a condition of membership in Bigfoot 
  (and may be a condition of use of the Bigfoot Services) that Users provide certain 
  information concerning the User's interests and agree to receive marketing materials 
  from Bigfoot or third parties related to those interests, parents or a guardian 
  of a child should contact us by sending an email to </font><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif"><a href="mailto:support@bigfoot.com">support@bigfoot.com</a></font><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif"> 
  if they would like a child's membership terminated and this information deleted 
  from our records. If Bigfoot determines that information has been provided by 
  any child without permission of a parent or legal guardian, Bigfoot will immediately 
  terminate the account and delete the information from our records. </font></p>

  Bigfoot Information Practice, Access and Security:</b></font> </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif"><b>A.</b> Please be aware 
  that use of the Bigfoot Services is subject to the Conditions of Use (as applicable 
  to the Bigfoot Site and each of the Services) as well as this Privacy Policy.<br>
  <b>B.</b> Bigfoot will limit the information we collect about Members to what 
  is needed to accurately provide the Services or products requested by Members. 
  Bigfoot will only use or release User Information in accordance with this Privacy 
  Policy (as set forth in Section I above). <br>
  <b>C.</b> We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit 
  our Site. Third-party advertising companies also separately place or recognize 
  a cookie file on your browser in the course of delivering advertisements to 
  this Site. These companies may use information about your visits to the Bigfoot 
  Site and other Web sites in order to provide advertisements about goods and 
  services of interest to you. If you would like more information about this practice 
  and to know your choices about having this information used by these companies,

  <b>D.</b> Bigfoot will be aggressive in terminating accounts of users who violate 
  Bigfoot's Conditions of Use. If we must deny a consumer's application for service 
  or terminate a consumer's relationship with us, in cases other than fraud or 
  violations of any law, rule or regulation, we will provide upon request the 
  reasons, nature, substance, and information Bigfoot used in the decision. <br>
  <b>E.</b> Bigfoot provides you access to your Profile information for the purpose 
  of reviewing and/or updating such information. In order to view or make any 
  changes to your Profile, go to the Bigfoot home page, log into your Bigfoot 
  address and click on Bigfoot Directory to update your directory information, 
  and Bigfoot Interests to update your interests' profile. <br>
  <b>F.</b> Bigfoot is concerned about protecting User Information (including 
  any credit card information) and therefore we work to protect this information 
  by utilizing all appropriate technology to prevent unauthorized access to the 
  information you provide Bigfoot. To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data 
  accuracy, and ensure the appropriate use of information, we have put in place 
  appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to protect the information 
  we collect online, including SSL security for credit card submissions. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif"><font color="#003399"><b>V. 
  Bigfoot Employee Standards</b> </font> </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif"><b>A.</b> Only those employees 
  needed to carry out the business functions may have access to information on 
  individual Bigfoot customers. We employ security techniques to safeguard User 
  Information. <br>
  <b>B.</b> Each employee has a personal responsibility for maintaining Member 
  confidence in Bigfoot. We train each employee on the Bigfoot Privacy Principles, 
  and those violating these principles will be subject to disciplinary action, 
  including dismissal in appropriate cases. Bigfoot will employ rigorous technology 
  and employee practices to ensure the highest possible standards of accuracy, 
  completeness and timeliness. </font></p>

  Conditions of Use and Revisions</b></font> </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif"><b>A.</b> Please be aware 
  that use of the Bigfoot Services is subject to the Terms and Conditions of Use 
  as pertain to each of the Bigfoot Services and this Privacy Policy. <br>
  <b>B.</b> Since offerings and technologies change, we reserve the right to change, 
  modify, add or remove portions of our Privacy Policy or Conditions of Use at 
  any time without prior notice. Please periodically review our Privacy Policy

  YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR REGULARLY REVIEWING THE BIGFOOT WEBSITE TO OBTAIN TIMELY

  and type the word "remove" in the subject line. <br>
  <b>C.</b> The internet community is a rapidly changing environment and therefore 
  Bigfoot may sell or liquidate its assets or its business or may purchase the 
  assets or business of other companies ("business transfers"). In such 
  transactions, user information generally is one of the transferred business 
  assets and therefore Bigfoot Members and Users should be aware that such business 
  transfers may occur.<br>
