				</p>
				<h4>PERSONAL INFORMATION</h4>
				<p>
					Any personal information that you provide to our Web site will stay safe, private, and secure. We will not resell your information to outside sources.
				</p>
				<p>
					We will not share your information with any third parties with the exception of verified secure ecommerce transaction providers.
				</p>
				<h4>INFORMATION THAT WE MAY COLLECT FROM OUR USERS</h4>
				<p>
					We may collect the following information when you sign up for a service:
				</p>
				<ul class="gBullets blackB">
					<li>First name, last name, e-mail, address, phone number</li>
					<li>For processing transactions, we also collect either credit card information or bank information, depending on your form of payment.  We do not store any credit card information after your transaction is complete.</li>
				</ul>
				<h5>IP Address:</h5>
				<p>
					When a user visits any Web site owned or operated by Big Fish Games, Inc., we may collect the IP address that requested the display of one of our sites. This address is collected for two purposes. The first purpose is to exercise our ability to restrict access to the site by users who have violated our Terms of Service. The second purpose is to support our advertising partners, so that the partners will be able to accurately count the number of unique visitors to our sites who may have viewed a given advertisement.
				</p>
				<h5>Sign Up and Survey information:</h5>
				<p>
					Any information you provide to us as part of your use of any Big Fish Games Web site will be stored as entered.
				</p>
				<h5>Cookies:</h5>
				<p>
					The sole purpose of cookies is to enhance your online experience. Cookies are small data files that are stored on your computer by Web sites. Through your Web browser, cookies are only used by the Web site that wrote the cookie. Data stored in a cookie from Big Fish Games is only accessible by the Big Fish Games Web sites. Personal information stored in our cookies is limited to: My Game Space affiliate identifier, Principal Network Partner affiliate identifier,you're your Username. This information enables us to run our affiliate programs, allows customized advertising, lets you automatically sign in when you visit Big Fish Games, and offers other operational site activities.

				</p>

				<p>

				</p>

				<h4>E-MAIL/OPT-OUT</h4>
				<p>
					When you sign up as a Big Fish Games user, or download any software from Big Fish Games, Inc., by default the option will be selected to allow us to communicate with you via e-mail about news, games, special offers, and events. You have the option to uncheck or check a box during the sign up process that will prevent this, although by doing so you are potentially asking us to not inform you of events and prize awards that may have tangible cash value to you.
