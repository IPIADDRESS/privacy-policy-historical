                        </ul>
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>Log Data</strong>
                        <p>The BigML Services contain functions for collecting and tracking non-personally identifiable information about you including your IP address, domain name, pages that were viewed, where you were referred from, and technical information such as locale preferences, browser type and operating system from Your Equipment as defined in the BigML Terms of Service.</p>
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>Payment Data</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>We never have access to your full card number or CVC and therefore cannot store it. Our debit and credit card processing is handed off to Stripe, Inc (“Stripe”). Stripe has been certified to <a href="https://stripe.com/docs/security" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">PCI Service Provider Level 1</a>, the most stringent level of certification available. </li>

                            <li>However, if you decide to store your payment information for further use, then BigML stores the type, the last 4 digits and the expiration date of your card. In this way, you can save more than one payment method and can decide which one to use in the future. If you use this feature, Stripe, Inc will save your full payment information for your future purchases with BigML.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>Sources, datasets, models and predictions</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>We collect and store the sources that you input, post, transmit, stream, or upload to the BigML Services (“Data”). If you create a new BigML source that has been previously created by you, we never associate all or a portion of the previous source with your  newly created source and always store a duplicate. We assign a unique identifier to every source that you create. Per our Terms of Use, you cannot download your sources from BigML. You only have access to a small portion of it that we store separately so that you can preview the content and make sure that we are parsing your source in the right way.</li>

                            <li>When you create a dataset from a previously created  dataset, we parse your source and create a summarized version containing  a statical summary of the data in it and also create a serialized version of it. BigML stores both the summarized and the serialized versions. Per our terms of use, you can get access to the summarized version of your dataset but not to the serialized version. We assign a unique identifier to every dataset that you create.</li>

                            <li>If you create a dataset using one or more previously created datasets, we use their serialized versions to create the new dataset. We also store both the summarized version of the new dataset and the serialized version of the new dataset.</li>

                            <li>When you create a model from a previously created dataset, we use the summarized version and the serialized version to create a model.  Models can be seen as sophisticated statical summaries with predictive power. We store each model that you create so that you can use them to create real-time predictions. You can download your models at any time using the BigML API or get a visual representation of them through BigML.com. We assign a unique identifier to every new model that you create.</li>

                            <li>When you create a prediction from a previously created model, we use the corresponding model and the new data that you input to create the prediction. We store the data that you input and the prediction. We assign a unique identifier to every new prediction that you create.</li>

                            <li>At your own discretion, you can delete the sources, datasets, models and predictions that you create. Upon your request we immediately delete them including their serialized versions from our front-end servers and start a batch process to fully remove them from our systems.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>Meta Data, Blind Data, Non-private or Non-Personal Information</strong>
                        <p>
                            BigML will get access and use meta level data generated during the creation of your sources, datasets, models, and predictions.  These data is collected with the only purpose of improving our service over time. For example, we measure how much time each tasks take, the size of data that you use, the type of each attribute in your dataset, the performance of the models generated but we never inspect or access any detail of your sources, datasets, models, or predictions.
                        </p>
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>Back Ups</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>We keep redundant backups of all data over multiple locations to prevent the remote possibility of data loss.</li>

                            <li>BigML keeps these backups to ensure our continued ability to provide the BigML Service to you in the event of malfunction or damage to our primary production servers.</li>

                            <li>When you request us to delete your BigML Account, your data will be permanently expunged from our primary production servers and further access to your account will not be possible. We will also promptly delete your email address from our third party newsletter provider and any payment information from our servers and our payment processor provider.</li>

                            <li>Please note, however, that there might be latency in deleting information from our servers and backed-up versions might still exist immediately after deletion. After a reasonable period of time your Data will be permanently deleted from all our backup servers.</li>

                            <li>Portions of your data, consisting of aggregate or anonymous data derived from your use of the BigML Services, may remain on our production servers indefinitely.</li>

                            <li>If you wish to cancel your account or request that we no longer use your information to provide you services, you may delete your account at <a class="js-external-link" href="/account" target="_blank">https://bigml.com/account</a>.
