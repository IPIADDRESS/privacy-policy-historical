          <li>to provide you with its products and services;</li>
          <li>to administer its customer relationship with you;</li>

        </h3>
        <p xmlns:o="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office">Generally, the Company will only disclose your Personal Information for a purpose that is related to the product or service that the Company is providing to you.&nbsp; This may include disclosures to organisations that provide the Company with professional advice, such as medical practitioners, related health service providers, dieticians, solicitors, accountants and business advisors, and to contractors to whom the Company out-sources certain functions, such as mailing houses, electronic network administrators and debt collection agencies.&nbsp; However, where possible, the Company takes contractual measures, and, in all other circumstances, takes all reasonable measures, with the Company’s contractors to ensure that they comply with the obligations set out in the Act.&nbsp; If the Personal Information that the Company is disclosing is of a highly sensitive nature, the Company may require its contractors to complete their work in-house and will not permit them to disclose that Personal Information to subcontractors.</p>
        <p xmlns:o="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office">The Company may also disclose Personal Information where it is expressly permitted under the Act, for example, where it is with your consent or where the Company is legally required to do so, such as under a court order or taxation laws.&nbsp; Also third parties may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private communications.&nbsp; As a result, while we strive to protect your Personal Information, we cannot ensure or warrant, and do not warrant, the security, privacy or confidentiality of any information, including Personal Information, that you transmit to us, and you do so at your own risk.</p>
        <p xmlns:o="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office">In the unlikely event that we need to investigate or resolve problems or enquiries, we can (and you authorise us to do so) disclose any Personal Information about you to private entities, law enforcement or other government officials as we, in our discretion or as may be required under law, believe necessary or appropriate.</p>

        <p xmlns:o="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office">We use an outside shipping company to ship orders, and a credit card processing company to bill users for goods and services.&nbsp; These companies do not retain, share, store or use Personal Information for any secondary purposes and our agreements with such providers restrict the use of that information.</p>
        <p xmlns:o="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office">From time to time, we may partner with another party to provide specific services.&nbsp; When the user signs up for these services, we will share names, or other Personal Information that is necessary for the third party to provide these services.&nbsp; These parties are not allowed to use Personal Information except for the purpose of providing these services.</p>

          <p>10.&nbsp;Your right to lodge a complaint</p>

        <p xmlns:o="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office">If you are not satisfied with how the Company has handled your Personal Information, you are entitled to lodge a complaint with the Information Commissioner.&nbsp; Information regarding how to lodge a complaint is available from the Information Commissioner's website at <a href="http://www.ico.gov.uk/"><strong>www.ico.gov.uk</strong></a>. However, before investigating a complaint, the Information Commissioner is legally required to be satisfied that you have first expressed your concern to the Company to afford it an opportunity to resolve the complaint directly, unless it is inappropriate for you to do so.&nbsp; You may lodge a complaint with the Company’s Privacy Officer either by mail to 10 John Street, London WC1N 2EB, by telephone on +61 2 9923 8222, by facsimile on +61 2 9923 8223 or by email to <a href="mailto:privacyofficer@sphealth.co.uk?subject=Privacy%20enquiry">privacyofficer@sphealth.co.uk</a>.&nbsp; The Company will inform you who will handle your complaint and you may contact the Company’s Privacy Officer to enquire about the progress of the complaint at any time.</p>

          <p>11.&nbsp;Your right of access</p>
        </h3>
        <p xmlns:o="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office">You may request access to your Personal Information at any time by sending a written request to the Company’s Privacy Officer by mail to 10 John Street, London WC1N 2EB, by telephone on +61 2 9923 8222, by facsimile on +61 2 9923 8223 or by email to <a href="mailto:privacyofficer@sphealth.co.uk?subject=Privacy%20enquiry">privacyofficer@sphealth.co.uk</a>.&nbsp; In your request, please state how you would like to obtain access.&nbsp; For example, you may like to inspect the Company’s records of your Personal Information at the Company’s premises or you may prefer to be sent a photocopy or an electronic version of your Personal Information.&nbsp; <strong>You do not need to provide a reason for your request.&nbsp; </strong>Once the Company’s Privacy Officer has verified your identity, your request will be forwarded to the Company’s information systems manager who will acknowledge receipt of your request within 14 days and arrange for access to be provided to you in an appropriate manner within a reasonable time, usually within 30 days of receipt of your request.&nbsp; The Company may charge a fee of £10 for providing access if a significant amount of time is required to locate your Personal Information or to collate or present it in an appropriate form.</p>
        <p xmlns:o="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office">In rare circumstances, and only where it is permitted under the Act, the Company may not be able to provide you with access to your Personal Information; for example, where it will have an unreasonable impact on the privacy of others, where it would put at risk a criminal investigation or catching an offender, where it relates to legal proceedings between the Company and you through which the Personal Information would not otherwise be available, where it would be prejudicial to negotiations the Company is holding with you, where the Company is required by law to withhold the Personal Information or where it would reveal information relating to the Company’s commercially sensitive decision making processes.&nbsp; If the Company is unable to provide you with the requested access, the Company will state why this is so and consider whether the use of an intermediary would be appropriate to provide you with an explanation of the Company’s position.</p>
