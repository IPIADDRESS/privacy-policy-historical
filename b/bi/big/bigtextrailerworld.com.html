 <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><strong>This Privacy Policy describes the terms of our commitment to your privacy.</strong></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><strong>PERSONS OR PARTIES COVERED</strong> This Privacy Policy is intended to cover all visitors to any of  Big Tex Trailers' (BIGTEX) website, all subscribers to  lists or newsletters whether paid or unpaid, all members or affiliates  whether paid or unpaid, and all customers. Persons, who visit or view  BIGTEX's websites, whether intentionally or unintentionally, whether  solicited or unsolicited, are described herein as "Visitors" and are  parties to this Privacy Policy. Subscribers to lists or Newsletters are  referred to herein as "Subscribers" and are parties to the Privacy  Policy. Persons who join an organization or marketing endeavor (e.g.  "affiliates") promoted by this website are called "Members" herein and  are covered by this Privacy Policy. Finally, anyone who orders,  attempts to order, or receives a product sold (recipients) or  advertised on or delivered from this website, even at no cost, is  called a "Customer" herein and is subject to this Privacy Policy not  only by passive acceptance, but by virtue of the Purchase Agreement  contract. The website, its agents, owners, operators, and employees are  referred to collectively herein as "Website," "Site," and/or "Seller".</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><strong>PERSONS EXCLUDED FROM THIS WEBSITE ARE STILL COVERED</strong></p>
    <p>In  the event that a person excluded from this website because of the Terms  of Use or from denial of service by the website, who nonetheless  unlawfully views this site, that person remains subject to the terms of  this Privacy Policy and is in violation of the Terms of Use.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><strong>PERSONS UNDER 18 YEARS OF AGE ARE EXCLUDED FROM THIS WEBSITE</strong></p>
    <p>This  website is not lawfully accessible to persons under the age of 18 or  who are otherwise covered by the provisions of the Child Online Privacy  Act of 1998 (COPA). If you are under the age of 18 you must leave this  site immediately. Fraudulent use of this website may make you subject  to civil or criminal sanctions.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>VIEWING AND/OR USE AND/OR COMMUNICATION IS CONSTRUED AS ACCEPTANCE OF THE TERMS OF THIS POLICY</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Acceptance  of the terms of this Privacy Policy is a portion of the consideration  required for your right to visit the website. If you do not accept  these terms, you have no right to visit this site and you are  fraudulently using this site.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><strong>A NOTE TO CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS (ONLINE PRIVACY PROTECTION ACT OF 2003 --OPPA)</strong></p>
    <p>It  is the intent of the Privacy Policy to comply with the California Act.  Various provisions throughout this Privacy Policy address requirements  of the act. In summary, you must presume that we collect electronic  information from all visitors. This is not usually personally  identifiable. If you purchase a product or service via this website  (and thereby become covered by the Act), the purchase agreement you  electronically sign prior to purchase allows the website to collect and  archive all the personal information you provide and to transmit and/or  transfer that personal information to third parties. There is no way  you can modify this information and you have no right to do so. Under  the terms of the purchase agreement, you have no right to view or  receive any information about our database. In the event that the  website, under advice of counsel agrees to divulge information, the  requesting party must submit whatever information is demanded by the  website in insure that the website is releasing information to the  correct party. Other provisions of the OPPA may exempt this website  from complying. While we take measures to ensure that outside parties  do not have access to any information we have about you, we do not  warranty that outside parties will not breach our system and thus have  access to your information. (You should know that merchant service  providers do not allow us access to your credit card information.) This  Privacy Policy also is subject to change without notice. You are  required to read it prior to using the website. By interacting with the  website you agree to the terms and conditions of the Privacy Policy. By  using the website or purchasing a product through this website, you  waive the right to use state or federal court systems to address  complaints and, instead, agree to use the American Arbitration  Association located in a city and county specified herein. </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><strong>ABOUT THE PERSONAL INFORMATION THIS WEBSITE COLLECTS AND HOW IT IS USED</strong></p>
    <p>This  website routinely collects information about its visitors, subscribers,  members, and customers. This information is obtained in various ways,  such as:</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><strong>VISITOR, SUBSCRIBER, MEMBER, OR CUSTOMER INFORMATION OBTAINED FROM 'REGISTRATION'</strong></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Registration  means that the Visitor, Subscriber, Member or Customer takes active,  positive steps to communicate information to this website. This can  include pages or 'pop ups' where you register for a newsletter or  subscribe to a mailing list; it can include your participation in  visitor surveys; it can include requesting information from the website  via email, mail, or courier; it may be from joining an affiliate  program or other membership organization, paid or unpaid; it may be  from ordering a product.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Occasionally  complete credit card information may be provided to the website via fax  or a fill-in form rather than regular secure merchant service  processing. This information is kept at the highest level of security  and is never divulged to anyone except the merchant service provider or  for the purpose of communication with the customer.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><strong>ONLINE ORDERING</strong></p>
    <p>Online  ordering via SSL encrypted communication provided by shopping cart  services supporting merchant service companies like Visa and Master  Card provides information to the website but does not provide complete  credit card numbers. In the process of online ordering, the customer  provides, name, address, city, state, email address, phone number, CVV2  (back of card) number, and, occasionally a member password. You should  consider all this information available to the website. This  information is used to deliver the product, but under the Purchase  Agreement you also approve its use for general solicitation purposes.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><strong>VISITOR EMAIL INQUIRIES</strong></p>
    <p>Website  visitors who wish to communicate with the website do so under two  conditions: one, they give their permission for contact by the website;  two, they are subject to any 'submission' provisions of the Terms of  Use, Purchase Agreement, or this Privacy Policy. While your email  address may or may not be used to solicit you, it is added to the  website's general solicitation database.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p align="left"><strong>CUSTOMER EMAIL OR TESTIMONIALS</strong></p>
    <p align="left">If  you are a customer and send an email to the website, or if you  communicate with the site by phone or mail, the website collects  information about your communication and by communicating with the site  you give your permission to collect, archive, retrieve, and otherwise  use any information collected as the site sees fit.</p>
  <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Any communication which, in its sole discretion, the site deems to be a testimonial, may be publicized for commercial purposes.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><strong>INFORMATION OBTAINED FROM VISITOR INTERACTION WITH BANNERS, POPUPS, OR SITE ADVERTISERS</strong></p>
    <p>Visitors  clicking on banners or pop-ups or hyperlinked advertising, appearing on  this website must assume that information is being collected about  them. This site is not responsible for the use of information collected  in such a fashion. Visitors must assume that (1) information will be  collected, (2) that 'cookies' will usually be placed on their hard  drive, (3) that website does not have any control over what happens  with this information, (4) that website takes no responsibility over  the accuracy or content of advertisers, (5) that website is not  responsible for downloads from third party advertisers that contain  viruses or worms or other computer code that causes their computer or  software harm, and (6) that website assumes no responsibility for the  data that is garnered from the click itself or that the advertiser  collects.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><strong>INFORMATION OBTAINED FROM REFERRING EMAIL OR REFERRING URLS</strong></p>
    <p>If  you send a friend an email from this site or if you send the url or one  of our web pages to a friend, you must assume that some data is  collected about your IP address or your email address and that of your  friend. You must assume that referred emails or web pages may appear to  come from your email. You must accept fully responsibility for  referring pages or email to a friend and agree to indemnify this site  for any damage, intentional or unintentional that results from said  referrals.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><strong>INFORMATION OBTAINED FROM VOLUNTARY VISITOR, SUBSCRIBER, MEMBER OR CUSTOMER SURVEYS</strong></p>
    <p>Unless  otherwise specified in the survey, you must assume that any information  provided to the website as part of a survey in which you participate  may be used for general solicitation for commercial purposes and that  such information will be shared with joint venture partners,  affiliates, marketing organization or used by the site itself for  product design or solicitation purposes.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><strong>INFORMATION OBTAINED FROM ELECTRONIC MEANS AND 'COOKIES'</strong></p>
    <p>Many  websites, including this one, collect information about your computer,  your email address, your IP address. You must assume that your  web-viewing or web-use activity is monitored, tracked, and information  collected. This information is not usually of a personal nature, but it  may help define your viewing habits and product preferences even though  the website may or may not have any idea who you are.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>"Cookies"  is web jargon for bits of computer code placed on your hard drive.  Websites use this to keep you 'logged in', to keep track of search  criteria, to monitor use, to password protect use of the site or use of  products sold by the site. Cookies can also be used to obtain  information about your computer configuration or your use of your  computer.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Cookies can be used to electronically  gather information about you. Again, it may or may not be personal  information, but it is information and by using this site you are  expressly giving permission to use 'cookies' and to use the information  gathered from their use to benefit you. You also give permission to  collect, archive, retrieve, and use any information collected for  product design, product offers to you, and general commercial  solicitation purposes by this site or joint venture partners,  affiliates, and marketing organizations.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><strong>HOW INFORMATION MAY BE USED</strong></p>
    <p>The  use of information as described below may or may not be how information  that is collected is customarily used by this site. While actual use of  any information collected may be used quite conservatively, you must  assume that it is not. You must assume that information collected is  shared with other persons or entities for commercial purposes. While  this is uncommon in practice, you must assume that it is as you make  your decision whether or not to view or interact with this website.  This type of shared information may include your name, address, phone  number, email address and buying habits, as well as other information.  This information may be used for general commercial solicitation by  this website or other persons it is sold to, rented to, or shared with.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><strong>INFORMATION THAT IS NOT SHARED</strong></p>
    <p>Credit  card information or other financial information is not usually known to  the website. However, in the event that it is made known, that  information is never revealed to anyone except to processing  authorities or law enforcement agencies. However, the provider of such  information gives express permission to use it in fraud investigation  or for litigation.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><strong>BULLETIN BOARDS AND PUBLIC FORUMS</strong></p>
    <p>Visitors,  subscribers, members, or customers who use any site provided bulletin  boards or other public forums, such as chat rooms, do so at their own  risk. You may not assume that the site monitors these services or  protects you in any manner from information you post publicly or share  with anyone else via these services.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><strong>SPAM </strong></p>
    <p>By  providing to this website information that forms the basis of  communication with you, such as an email address, you waive all rights  to file complaints concerning unsolicited email or spam from this  website since, by providing such information, you agree to receive  communication from us or other marketing organizations. However, all  email communication with you shall contain an 'unsubscribe' link where  you may notify the website that you no longer wish to receive  solicitations or information from the website and your name will be  removed from the general solicitation database.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><strong>DATA SECURITY</strong></p>
    <p>This  website takes measures to protect its data that contains information  related to you. However, as a consideration for viewing this site or  interacting with this site in any manner, you waive all claims of any  nature against this site concerning the loss, alteration, or misuse of  information. You must assume that it is possible for your personal data  to be obtained by others, such as "hackers," and used in an  inappropriate manner that may cause you harm and that you agree that  the site is not responsible for damages to you.</p>

    <p>You may direct questions, comments or reports to: <a href="mailto:webmaster@bigtextrailers.com">webmaster at BigTexTrailers.com</a></p>

    <p>This  Privacy Policy is dynamic. It will continually change. You may not  assume that it remains the same and you agree to check the policy each  time you visit the site for changes.
