<section class="copyblock"><p>This Privacy and Cookies Policy describes the privacy practices relating to information that BigSpy, Inc. (“BigSpy,” “we,” “us,” “our”) collects and uses on our websites that link to this policy, such as www.bigspy.com or any other website where this policy is displayed (collectively, our “Site”), as well as through our analytics technology services that our clients use on their websites and their mobile applications (our “Services”).</p></section><section class="copyblock">
<h1>1. Information We Collect Through Our Services and How We Use It</h1><p><!-- react-text: 20 -->Among other services, BigSpy provides analytics that allow advertisers, websites and app developers, and third party ad platforms (collectively our “Clients”) to better understand the effectiveness of their content, including online advertising. We may help Clients understand, for instance, whether their articles or ads tend to be viewed by users, and whether their articles or ads appear in a viewable manner. In providing these Services, we may work with business partners who collect and provide us with information collected from users’ browsers or devices. The information that we or they may collect through our Services (referred to in this Privacy and Cookies Policy as the “Service Information”) includes the following:<!-- /react-text --><!-- react-text: 21 --> <!-- /react-text --></p><ul><li><!-- react-text: 24 -->Log information. When users visit a website where our Services are deployed, our servers may automatically record information that each browser sends. These server logs include information such as Internet Protocol (“IP”) address (a unique number that is automatically assigned to your computer), the date and time, browser type, and users’ interactions with our Clients’ content and advertising.<!-- /react-text --><!-- react-text: 25 --> <!-- /react-text --></li><li><!-- react-text: 27 -->Mobile data. Through mobile applications on which our Services are deployed, we (or Clients and other application providers we work with) likewise may collect information about users’ interactions with those applications (including your IP address and time-stamp information), and information about users’ mobile devices (including device type, handset name, operating system information, mobile identifiers such as Apple IDFA and Android Advertising ID, app-specific identifiers, and a list of the applications devices interacts with).<!-- /react-text --><!-- react-text: 28 --> <!-- /react-text --></li><li><!-- react-text: 30 -->We, our business partners or Clients may collect information about your browser, device, and how you interact with web and mobile content, through the use of cookie IDs associated with your browser. We or they may deploy and read these unique IDs, and thus passively “collect” them, when you go to a Site where our Services are deployed or (as to our business partners) where they otherwise interact with a user’s browser.

We may use our own technology (as described in Client Services above) for that purpose, and we also may use third party services such as Google Analytics, in which case those third parties gather information such as your IP address, browser type, the webpage from which you came to our website, and the times of your access to our Site. In addition, as you browse BigSpy.com and other BigSpy URLs, advertising cookies may be placed on your computer so that we can understand what you are interested in.

<h1>4. “Cookies,” “Pixel Tags,” and “SDKs,” and How We Use Them</h1><p></p><ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;"><li>Cookies and Pixel Tags. Cookies are small data files that contain a string of characters, such as an anonymous unique browser identifier. Cookies are stored on your computer or other device and act as (usually unique) tags that identify your device. Our servers send your browser or device a cookie when you visit the Site, and Clients and partners may do likewise on their websites or through their multi-site platforms. A pixel tag (also commonly known as a web beacon or clear GIF) is an invisible 1 x 1 pixel that is placed on certain web pages. When you access these web pages, pixel tags generate a generic notice of the visit and permit us to set or read our cookies. Pixel tags are used in combination with cookies to track activity on a site by a particular device. When you turn off cookies, pixel tags simply detect a unique website visit. We (or partners we work with) may use cookies to, among other things, “remember” you (e.g., when you visit the Site), track user trends, and collect information about how you use our Clients’ sites or interact with advertising. We use cookies to provide relevant content to you and replace non-relevant ads with ads that better match your interests. We may use the following types of cookies:</li><ul><li>Strictly necessary cookies. These are cookies that are required for the operation of our Site. They include, for example, cookies that enable you to log into secure areas of our Site, or make use of e-billing services.</li><li>Analytical/performance cookies. These allow us to recognise and count the number of visitors and to see how visitors move around our Site or our Clients' websites. This helps us and our Clients to improve the way that the websites work, for example, by ensuring that users are finding what they are looking for easily.</li><li>Functionality cookies. These are used to recognise you when you return to our Site or our Clients' websites. This means that content can be personalised for you and your preferences can be remembered (for example, your choice of language or region).</li><li>Targeting cookies. These cookies record your visit to our Site or our Clients' websites, the pages you have visited and the links you have followed. This information will be used to make the websites and the advertising displayed on them more relevant to your interests. We may also share this information with third parties for this purpose.</li></ul><li><!-- react-text: 87 -->Disabling Cookies. Most Web browsers are set up to accept cookies. You may be able to set your browser to warn you before accepting certain cookies or to refuse certain cookies. However, if you disable the use of cookies in your web browser, some features of the websites you visit may be difficult to use or inoperable. For more information about cookies and how to change your browser settings, please visit<!-- /react-text --><!-- react-text: 88 --> <!-- /react-text --><a href="http://www.aboutcookies.org" target="_blank">www.aboutcookies.org</a><!-- react-text: 90 -->.<!-- /react-text --></li><li><!-- react-text: 92 -->Mobile Device Identifiers and SDKs. We also sometimes use, or partner with publishers or publisher-facing and app developer platforms that use mobile SDKs to collect information, such as mobile identifiers (e.g., IDFAs and Android Advertising IDs), and information connected to how mobile devices interact with our Services and those using our Services. A mobile SDK is in effect the mobile app version of a pixel tag or beacon. The SDK is computer code that app developers can include in their apps to enable ads to be shown, data to be collected, and related services to be implemented. We may use this technology, for instance, to analyze or measure certain advertising through mobile applications and browsers based on information associated with your mobile device. If you’d like to opt-out from having ads tailored to you in this way on your mobile device, please follow the instructions in the below Section titled<!-- /react-text --><!-- react-text: 93 --> <!-- /react-text --><a href="#your_choice">“Your Choices, and Your Opt Out Options”</a></li></ol><a name="your_choice"></a><p>Sometimes, our Clients or partners we work with may use the above technologies (sometimes, in combination with each other or other data such as IP addresses or hashed or de-identified data files) to coordinate users’ identities across platforms, browsers or devices, to more efficiently analyze online or mobile audiences, or target advertising and analyze ad performance.</p></section><section class="copyblock">
<h1>5. Your Choices, and Your Opt Out Options</h1><p><!-- react-text: 100 -->We sometimes work with companies that capture anonymous or de-identified data and create targeting attributes based on users’online browsing activities.

You may opt out of use these identifiers for purposes of interest-based advertising by accessing the settings on your phone.</p></section><section class="copyblock"><h1>6. Third Parties on BigSpy’s Own Site</h1><p><!-- react-text: 131 -->As on most websites, third parties may directly gather user information from users of our Site through automated means such as cookies or pixels.
