<p style="font-weight: bold;">At BigSpot.com we respect your privacy.</p>

<p style="font-weight: bold;">EFFECTIVE DATE:  MARCH 31, 2008</p>

<p>This privacy policy ("Privacy Policy") describes how information is collected and used on BigSpot.com (the "Website").  Your visit to the Website constitutes your acceptance of the Privacy Policy.</p>

<p style="text-decoration: underline;">Information Collected</p>

<p>You may visit the Website anonymously.  Personal information is not collected about you on the Website unless you voluntarily submit it.  For example, you may submit personal information to join the Website and learn about your eligibility to participate in certain surveys.  You may also submit your personal information to receive news about exciting offers and services.   The information requested from you may include your name, email address, age, zip code, country or gender.</p>

<p>Anonymous aggregate information about your visit to the Website may be collected via a "cookie."  A cookie is a piece of computer code that records information such as pages visited and referring websites.  You may set the settings on your internet browser to reject the use of cookies.  We caution however that by doing so the Website may lose some of its functionality.</p>

<p style="text-decoration: underline;">Use of Information</p>

<p>We use the personal information you submit to provide you with the services affiliated with the Website.  For example, if you join the Website, we will send you updates to our database or new survey offers.  You can simply unsubscribe to these updates by clicking the link at the bottom of the first email update or by clicking here.</p>

<p>Upon registration with the Website, you will be presented the opportunity to request and receive special offers provided by other companies.  You can choose some offers, all of them, or none of them - it's up to you. By choosing an offer and clicking the Submit/Continue button on the bottom of the offer page, you authorize us to pass along your email address and the information you provide to us on the sign-up form to the advertisers you select.  The privacy policies of these advertisers will be available for you to review before you select the offer.</p>

<p>If you submit information via the "Contact Us" button, we will use that information to answer your question or fulfill your request.   If you wish that we no longer maintain your personal information, please send us an email via the "Contact Us" button and request that we delete your information.  We will use best efforts to remove your information from our active database, but please understand that other copies of your information may remain in our records, for example, in backed-up versions of the Website.</p>

<p style="text-decoration: underline;">Information Sharing</p>

<p>We share the personal information that you provide on the Website with other parties on an "as needed" limited basis.  For example, we will pass along your contact information to an advertiser if you request to receive an offer from that advertiser.  You are not required to sign up for such offers to use the Website.  In other words, we do not share your information with third parties for direct marketing purposes without your consent.  In addition, we may employ service providers who may require your information to carry out their services in connection with the Website.</p>

<p>We may share your information as may be required to comply with the law or a court order.  We may also share this information in cooperation with law-enforcement or other government agencies in connection with a criminal investigation, fraud prevention or other legal action that may be necessary to protect the Website, its users, or the public.</p>

<p>In the event that all or part of the assets associated with the Website are sold, you agree that we may assign the information collected on the Website to the purchaser to be used in accordance with all other provisions of this Privacy Policy.</p>

<p>We use the anonymous aggregate information collected about your visit to the Website to improve our services.  We may share this information with third parties to help us in that determination.</p>

<p style="text-decoration: underline;">Links to Third Parties</p>

<p>As part of the services offered on the Website, you may access third-party websites via hyperlinks.   The privacy policies on those sites are likely to differ from this one.  We recommend that you review the policies posted on those Websites before submitting any personal information.</p>

<p style="text-decoration: underline;">Changes to this Privacy Policy</p>

<p>We reserve the right to change the Privacy Policy at any time.  When we materially change the Privacy Policy, we will post a new effective date.  Nevertheless, your information will be used in accordance with the version of the Privacy Policy posted at the time of submission.  Please review this Privacy Policy frequently to learn of any changes to it.</p>

<p style="text-decoration: underline;">Security</p>

<p>We take great efforts to provide security for your information.  However, no system is impenetrable and we cannot absolutely guarantee that unauthorized access will not occur.</p>

<p style="text-decoration: underline;">Questions</p>

<p>If you have any questions regarding how your information is collected or used on the Website, we can be contacted by clicking <a href="/contact">here</a>.</p>
