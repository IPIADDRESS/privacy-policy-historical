	 <p>Bigupload is committed to protecting your online privacy. The following
  policy explains how your personal information will be treated when you register
  for an Bigupload account. If we are going to use customers’ personally identifiable
  information in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection
  we will notify customers by posting a notice on our Web site for 30 days.</p>


                <p>
  This privacy statement covers the site www.bigupload.com. Because this Web site
  wants to demonstrate its commitment to our users’ privacy. </p>
<p>If users have questions or concerns regarding this statement,
  they should first contact Bigupload's Customer Support group by e-mail at <a href="http://help.bigupload.com">contact us</a>.
  </p>

<p>Simply put, we are committed to providing you with the best
  service available online or elsewhere.</p>


<a name="WHAT"></a>
<font size="-1"><b>What is Bigupload and why is my information needed?</b></font>
<p>Bigupload provides customers with online storage space which can
  be used to store, share, access, and protect important files. Bigupload is web
  based, and we require, at a minimum, a first name, last name, password, and
  valid e-mail address. </p>
  <a name="INFO"></a>
<font size="-1"><b>What personal information does Bigupload collect from me?</b></font>
<p>Bigupload collects personal information upon registration.
 When upgrading to a premium paid account, Bigupload will ask for
  your credit card information in order to provide you uninterrupted service.
  Please note that the more information you volunteer (and the more accurate it
  is), the better we are able to customize your experience. Once registered, you
  are part of the Bigupload community, a customer account is created, and you can
  take full advantage of Bigupload's services.</p>
<p>In addition to registration we may ask you for personal information
  at other times, including immediately following the registration process, when
  you enter a contest or promotion sponsored by Bigupload, and when you report a
  problem with the service or with your account. If you contact Bigupload we will
  keep a record of that correspondence. In addition, Bigupload occasionally asks
  registered users to complete surveys that we use for research purposes. A link
  is included to this Privacy Policy wherever Bigupload collects personal information.</p>
<p>Bigupload customers use our service to store files and folders
  (data). Bigupload will not review, share, distribute, print, or reference any such
  data except as outlined in the <a href="terms.php?sid=9725adf6c3337c00211cbbce9214f99e">Terms of Service</a> or
  as may be required by law.</p>
<font size="-1"><b>What are cookies and how does Bigupload use them?</b></font>
<p>In order to provide a personalized service, Bigupload uses cookies
  to store some information about your account. A cookie is a small amount of
  data that is sent to your browser from a web server that is stored on your computer's
  hard drive. Bigupload uses both session ID cookies and persistent cookies. These
  cookies are not tied to your personally identifiable information.</p>
<p>Generally, we use cookies:</p>
<ul>
  <li>To establish an authenticated session with the service
    when you login to your Bigupload account using our web interface. When you use
    Bigupload's web interface to access your account, logging in will require that
    you accept a session ID cookie. When you close your web browser, the session
    ID cookie will terminate.</li>
  <li>To remember some of your basic account preferences in order
    to deliver a better, more personalized service. A persistent cookie may be
    set when you register, "Sign In," or use the Bigupload web interface
    to record certain application settings and other preferences.</li>
</ul>
<p>Bigupload may also record your IP address for system administration,
  monitoring, and fraud prevention purposes. IP Addresses are not linked or cross-referenced
  with any personally identifiable information.</p>
<p>This privacy statement covers the use of cookies by Bigupload only
  and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers. Some of our business
  partners (e.g., advertisers) use cookies on our site. We have no access to or
  control over these cookies.</p>
<a name="USE"></a>
<font size="-1"><b>How does Bigupload use my information?</b></font>
<p>Bigupload does not provide any of your personal information to
  third parties except as outlined in this privacy policy. We do not sell or give
  access to our customer e-mail list or other customer profile information to
  anyone except as outlined.</p>
<p>Bigupload does research on customer demographics and behavior
  based on the information provided to us upon registration, during a promotion,
  or from surveys. This information is tracked using log files, tracking pixels
  and database history tables. We do this to better understand and serve our customers.
  This research is compiled and analyzed on an aggregated basis.</p>

<a name="SHARE"></a>
<font size="-1"><b>With whom does Bigupload share my information?</b></font>
<p> Bigupload will not disclose any of your personal information except
  when we have your permission or under special circumstances, such as when we
  believe in good faith that the law requires it or under the circumstances described
  below. Please see our <a href="terms.php?sid=9725adf6c3337c00211cbbce9214f99e">Terms of Service</a>
  for more detailed information about how your personal information may be shared.
  The following describes some of the ways that your information may be disclosed.</p>
<p></p><ul>
  <li><b> Data in the Aggregate</b>: Bigupload may disclose aggregated
    statistics in order to describe
    our services to prospective partners, advertisers, and other third parties,
    and for other lawful purposes.</li>
  <li><b>Special Circumstances:</b> Bigupload may also disclose
    account information in special cases when we have reason to believe that disclosing
    this information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against
    someone who may be violating Bigupload's Terms of Service
    or may be causing injury to or interference with (either intentionally or
    unintentionally) Bigupload's rights or property, other Bigupload users, or anyone
    else that could be harmed by such activities. Bigupload may disclose or access
    account information when we believe in good faith that the law requires it.</li>
    <li><b>Third Party Retail Distributors: </b>Should you signup for
    Bigupload through one of our third party retail distributors, Bigupload may disclose
    your email address to that specific third party retail distributor.</li>
</ul><p></p>
<a name="CHOICE"></a>
<font size="-1"><b>What are my choices regarding collection, use, and distribution
  of my information?</b></font>
<p>Bigupload may, from time to time, e-mail you regarding our products
  and services. Only Bigupload or agents working under confidentiality agreements
  on behalf of Bigupload will send you such e-mail.
  All announcements sent by Bigupload also include unsubscribe instructions.</p>
<p>You also have choices with respect to cookies. By modifying
  your browser preferences, you have the choice to accept all cookies, to be notified
  when a cookie is set, or to reject all cookies. If you choose to reject all
  cookies you will be unable to access your Bigupload via the web interface.</p>
<p>Bigupload does not sell or provide access to customer information
  to anyone, unless you happen to sign up for an account through a third-party
  affiliate, in which case that affiliate also has your e-mail address. If there
  is any other exception to this policy, we will notify you at the time of data
  collection or transfer if your data will be shared with a third party and you
  will always have the option of not permitting the transfer.</p>
<a name="PROTECT"></a>
<font size="-1"><b>What security precautions are in place to protect the loss, misuse,
  or alteration of my information?</b></font>
<p>Your Bigupload account information and Bigupload customer profile
  are password-protected so that you, and only you, have access to this personal
  information. You may edit your Bigupload account information by logging into our
  web interface using your Bigupload username and password.</p>
<p>We require that you do not divulge your password to anyone.
  Bigupload will never ask you for your password in an unsolicited phone call or
  e-mail. Also remember to sign out of your Bigupload account and close your browser
  window when you finish your work. This is to ensure that others cannot access
  your personal information or files if you share a computer with someone else
  or are using a computer in a public place like a library or Internet cafe.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can
  be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your
  personal information, Bigupload cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information
  you transmit to us or while using the service, and you do so at your own risk.
  Once we receive your transmission, we make our best effort to ensure its security
  on our systems.</p>
<a name="SHARING"></a>
<font size="-1"><b>What does Bigupload do with contact information that I might provide
  when sharing files or folders?</b></font>
<p>When you use Bigupload to "Send a File" with someone, you normally enter that person's e-mail address
  into the system so that a message can be sent informing him or her of the share.
  Bigupload treats any contact information that you enter while using the service
  with the same respect and confidentiality as your own information. E-mail addresses
  that you enter when using Bigupload to share information are not sold or made available
  to any 3rd parties.</p>
<p>When you use Bigupload's "Send a File" feature, you
  can elect to have the system send a notification message on your behalf by entering
  the e-mail address(es) of the person(s) with whom you want to share the file.
  If you prefer, you can instead generate a web link to the file, which can be
  sent as part of your own message. Send a File notification messages sent by
  Bigupload are one-time only messages with the sole intent of notifying the recipient
  of the shared file.</p>
  <a name="ELSE"></a>
<font size="-1"><b>What else should I know about my privacy?</b></font>
<p>Please keep in mind that whenever you voluntarily disclose personal
  information online - for example on message boards, through e-mail, or in chat
  areas - that information can be collected and used by others. In short, if you
  post personal information online that is accessible to the public, you may receive
  unsolicited messages from other parties in return.</p>
<p>This web site contains links to other sites. Please be aware
  that Bigupload is not responsible for the privacy practices of other sites. We
  encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy
  statements of each and every web site that collects personally identifiable
  information. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected
  by this web site.</p>
<p>Ultimately, you are responsible for maintaining the secrecy
  of your passwords and/or any account information. Please be careful and responsible
  online.</p>
