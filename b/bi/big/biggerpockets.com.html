<i>In General.</i> We respect your right to make choices about the ways we collect, use, and disclose your information. This Policy describes some of your choices, such as your choice to opt out of receiving “cookies” and to opt out of having your information shared with third parties for their own marketing purposes. In addition, and as required by applicable law, you can opt out of receiving promotional emails from us by clicking on the “unsubscribe” link at the bottom of each promotional email.
</p>
<p>
We may ask you to indicate your choices at the time and on the page where you provide your information. In other situations, and consistent with this Site’s purpose as a networking platform, we make certain assumptions about how you want your information shared with others. However, you can view and change certain default privacy settings at https://www.biggerpockets.com/settings. Otherwise, you can contact us at webmaster@biggerpockets.com.
</p>
<p><em> Do Not Track Mechanisms</em><br>
California law requires this policy to address how the Service responds to any “Do-Not-Track (“DNT”) signal” delivered by your browser. Because of the changing state of technology and indecision within the industry regarding the meaning of DNT signals, we currently do not make any guarantee that we will honor DNT signals.</p>
