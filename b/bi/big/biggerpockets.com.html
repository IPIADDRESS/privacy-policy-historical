</p><h2><font color="red">Our Commitment to Your Privacy</font></h2>

This policy is intended to help you understand how BiggerPockets, Inc., its subsidiaries and affiliates ("BiggerPockets.com," "BP," "we," or "us") collect, use and safeguard the information you provide on our website.
 <p>
BiggerPockets.com has become a valuable tool for millions of visitors to help educate themselves and others about real estate and real estate investing. Our social networking function, forums, and other features, are designed to further facilitate that by allowing members to share personal information, insights, and comments. We also have tools that are designed to help our members grow and manage their businesses.
 </p><p>
BiggerPockets is well aware that privacy concerns are--or should be--of paramount importance to our members; they are to us. So, this is where we tell you what we at BiggerPockets will and won't be doing with the personal information on the site; and, where we tell you the rules we expect our members to adhere to. Nothing weird or harsh; pretty much common sense. So, here goes:
 </p><p>
</p><h3>Privacy Policy</h3>

<ul>
<li>We don't ask you for personal information unless we need it, or unless it will help with your BiggerPockets experience.
</li><li>We don't share your personal information with anyone except to comply with the law, develop our products, or protect our rights.
<!-- <li>In our products, we aim to make it as simple as possible for you to control what's visible to the public, seen by search engines, kept private, and permanently deleted. -->
</li></ul>
Below is our privacy policy which incorporates these goals:
<p>
If you have questions about removing or correcting your personal data please contact our support team (see below).
</p><p>
It is BiggerPockets's policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating our websites.

</p><h3>Website Visitors</h3>

Like most website operators, BiggerPockets collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. BiggerPockets's purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how BiggerPockets's visitors use its website. From time to time, BiggerPockets may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.
<p>
BiggerPockets also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users and for users leaving comments on BiggerPockets.com blogs. BiggerPockets only discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below, except that commenter IP addresses are visible and disclosed to the administrators of the area of the site where the comment was left.
</p><p>
</p><h3>Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</h3>

Certain visitors to the BiggerPockets's website choose to interact with BiggerPockets in ways that require BiggerPockets to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that BiggerPockets gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up for an account at BiggerPockets.com to provide a username and email address, as well as their real names and other identifying information. Those who engage in transactions with BiggerPockets - by purchasing access to the BiggerPockets PRO service, for example â€“ are asked to provide additional information, including as necessary the personal and financial information required to process those transactions. In each case, BiggerPockets collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor's interaction with BiggerPockets. BiggerPockets does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.

<h3>Aggregated Statistics</h3>

BiggerPockets may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites. For instance, BiggerPockets may monitor the most popular blogs on the BiggerPockets.com site or track member site activities via various leaderboards. BiggerPockets may display this information publicly or provide it to others. However, BiggerPockets does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.

<h3>Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information</h3>

BiggerPockets discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on BiggerPockets's behalf or to provide services available at BiggerPockets's websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using BiggerPockets's websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. BiggerPockets will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, BiggerPockets discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or when BiggerPockets believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of BiggerPockets, third parties or the public at large. If you are a registered user of an BiggerPockets website and have supplied your email address, BiggerPockets may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what's going on with BiggerPockets and our products. We primarily use our various product blogs to communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. BiggerPockets takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.
<p>
<i>Word of warning:</i> If you post private information to any public forum, property listing, blog, public profile, or other public area of the site, all that information can be gotten by the public. You agree that BiggerPockets shall not be responsible for the public's sharing of this information once you make it public via these or other methods.

</p><h3>Cookies</h3>

A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor's computer, and that the visitor's browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. BiggerPockets uses cookies to help BiggerPockets identify and track visitors, their usage of BiggerPockets website, and their website access preferences. BiggerPockets visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using BiggerPockets's websites, with the drawback that certain features of BiggerPockets's websites may not function properly without the aid of cookies.

<h3>Business Transfers</h3>

If BiggerPockets, or substantially all of its assets were acquired, or in the unlikely event that BiggerPockets goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquiror of BiggerPockets may continue to use your personal information as set forth in this policy.

<h3>Ads</h3>

We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our website. These companies may use information (not including your name, address, email address, or telephone number) about your visits to this and other websites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies, <a href="http://www.google.com/privacy_ads.html">click here</a>. This Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies by BiggerPockets and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.

<h3>Links</h3>

BiggerPockets, of course, has links to other sites. In fairness...and as a matter of law, we can't be responsible for the privacy policies or content of those other sites. That means, if privacy is a concern for you, and it should be, you should read the other site's privacy policy to make sure you are comfortable with it. What you are reading here and now, only applies to BiggerPockets.

<h3>Privacy Policy Changes</h3>

Although most changes are likely to be minor, BiggerPockets may change its Privacy Policy from time to time, and in BiggerPockets's sole discretion. BiggerPockets encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to its Privacy Policy. Your continued use of this site after any change in this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such change.
