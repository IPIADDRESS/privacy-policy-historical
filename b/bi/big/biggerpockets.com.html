<h2>BiggerPockets Privacy Policy</h2>
<hr class="faded">
<p>
<em>Effective Date: November 24, 2013</em>
</p>
<p>
BiggerPockets, Inc. (“BiggerPockets,” “we,” “us,” and “our”) owns and operates this website (this “Site”). This Online Privacy Policy (this “Policy”) describes our commitment to privacy and reflects the importance we place on earning and keeping your trust.
</p>
<h3>Scope of This Policy</h3>
<p>
BiggerPockets collects certain information about or related to you through this Site. Some of the information BiggerPockets collects may be “personal information”—information that identifies you personally, alone or in combination with other information available to us. Other information may be nonpersonally identifiable, such as your IP address.
</p>
<p>BiggerPockets has provided this Policy so that you will know what information BiggerPockets collects, how BiggerPockets uses this information, the types of third parties with which BiggerPockets may share this information, and some of the choices that are available to you.
</p>
<p>
This Policy may be supplemented or amended from time to time by additional privacy notices (“Privacy Notices”), provided at the time we collect your information. For example, certain pages of this Site may contain Privacy Notices providing more details about the information we collect on those particular pages, why we need that information, and choices you may have about the ways we use that information. In other cases, specific Privacy Notices may be required to comply with the privacy laws of one of the countries, provinces, or states in which we do business.
</p>
<h3>Your Consent</h3>
<p>
By using this Site, you are consenting to the collection, use, disclosure, and transfer of your information as described in this Policy (and any Privacy Notices that apply to you). If you do not consent to the collection, use, disclosure and transfer of your information as described in this Policy (and any Privacy Notices that apply to you), you may not use this Site. If you have questions about this Policy, or any Privacy Notice, please contact us via e-mail at legal@biggerpockets.com.<script cf-hash="f9e31" type="text/javascript">

</p>
<h3>Our Terms of Use</h3>
<p>
This Policy is part of the <a href="http://www.biggerpockets.com/terms">Terms of Use</a> that govern your use of this Site. A link to our <a href="http://www.biggerpockets.com/terms">Terms of Use</a> is provided at the bottom of each page of this Site.
</p>
<h3>Your Choices</h3>
<p>
<i>In General.</i> We respect your right to make choices about the ways we collect, use, and disclose your information. This Policy describes some of your choices, such as your choice to opt out of receiving “cookies” and to opt out of having your information shared with third parties for their own marketing purposes. In addition, and as required by applicable law, you can opt out of receiving promotional emails from us by clicking on the “unsubscribe” link at the bottom of each promotional email.
</p>
<p>
We may ask you to indicate your choices at the time and on the page where you provide your information. In other situations, and consistent with this Site’s purpose as a networking platform, we make certain assumptions about how you want your information shared with others. However, you can view and change certain default privacy settings at https://www.biggerpockets.com/settings. Otherwise, you can contact us at webmaster@biggerpockets.com.<script cf-hash="f9e31" type="text/javascript">
/* <![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t="currentScript"in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName("script"),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute("cf-hash"))return t[e]}();if(t&&t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute("data-cfemail");if(a){for(e="",r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]> */</script>
</p>
<p><em> Do Not Track Mechanisms</em><br>
California law requires this policy to address how the Service responds to any “Do-Not-Track (“DNT”) signal” delivered by your browser. Because of the changing state of technology and indecision within the industry regarding the meaning of DNT signals, we currently do not make any guarantee that we will honor DNT signals.</p>
<h3>This Policy May Change</h3>
<p>
BiggerPockets reserves the right to update or modify this Policy and any Privacy Notice, at any time and without prior notice, by posting the revised version of the Policy or Privacy Notice on this Site. These changes will only apply to the information we collect after we have posted the revised Policy or Privacy Notice on this Site.
</p>
<p>
Your use of this Site following any such change constitutes your agreement that all information collected from or about you after the revised Policy is posted will be subject to the terms of the revised Policy. You may access the current version of this Policy at any time by clicking on the link marked “Privacy” at the bottom of each page of the public areas of this Site.
</p>
<h3>Information We Collect</h3>
<p>
<i>Information You Manually Provide.</i> BiggerPockets collects the information you manually provide (using your keyboard, mouse, or touchpad) when you use this Site. For example, we collect the information you provide when you contact us with questions, express interest in advertising on the Site, register with the Site and create a profile, participate in a forum discussion, or otherwise interact with this Site. Some of the information you manually provide may be personal information, such as your name and contact information.
</p>
<p>
<i>Information From Third-Party Social Media Platforms.</i> You may be able to register with, log on to, or enhance your profile on this Site by choosing to automatically populate the requested data fields with information you previously provided to a third-party social media platform (such as Facebook or Twitter). By doing this, you are asking the third-party platform to send us information, including personal information, from your profile on that platform. We treat that information as we do any other information you give to us when you register, log on, or enhance your profile.
</p>
<p>
<i>Information from your browser or device.</i> BiggerPockets collects information that is sent to us automatically by your web browser or mobile device. This information typically includes your IP address, the name of your operating system, the name and version of your browser, the date and time of your visit, and the pages you visit.
