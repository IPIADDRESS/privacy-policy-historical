				1. Introduction:</b><br>
				In connection with the registration of users ("Users") of the bigchalk Web site and affiliated sites that link to this Privacy Policy (including
				bigchalk.com, ExplorAsource.com, schools.bigchalk.com and researchpaper.com) (collectively, the "Site"), and subsequent use of the Site, bigchalk.com,
				inc. ("bigchalk") collects information from and about registered Users and uses and discloses such information in a variety of ways, as described
				below. &nbsp;Users should read this Privacy Policy to understand what information may be collected if they choose to register, how the information may be used,
				what measures are taken to protect the information, and how Registered Users can change or delete information relating to them. Parents, teachers and other
				school representatives should read this Privacy Policy also to understand the nature of the consent they are giving bigchalk when permitting children under the
				age of 13 to use the Site.This Privacy Policy applies to all registered Users of the Site. Users may become registered in one of three ways: They can physically
				sign a printed subscriber agreement for a bigchalk product or service provided by a bigchalk sales representative; they can fill out an electronic registration
				form on the Site; or their registration can be authorized and submitted by a Registered School. In each case, Users agree to be subject to this Privacy
				Policy.Registered Users fall into four categories: Unaffiliated Registered Users, Registered Schools, Registered Students, and Registered Parents, each as
				described in the next four sections.<br>
				<br>
				<b>2. Unaffiliated Registered Users and Information Collected from Them:</b><br>
				An Unaffiliated Registered User is a user who completes bigchalk's on-Site registration, but is not registered by a Registered School. Upon registration,
				bigchalk requests the birth date of any Unaffiliated Registered User for the purpose of determining age, so that bigchalk may distinguish Unaffiliated
				Registered Users under the age of 13 ("Pre-Teen Unaffiliated Registered Users") from Unaffiliated Registered Users age 13 or older ("Teen/Adult
				Unaffiliated Registered Users"). In the case of a Pre-Teen Unaffiliated Registered User, bigchalk retains birth date information in order to determine when
				such User will become a Teen/Adult Unaffiliated Registered User. However, as part of bigchalk's compliance with COPPA, bigchalk does not collect other
				information that would allow bigchalk to associate the birth date with any particular child. Instead, bigchalk registers Pre-Teen Unaffiliated Registered Users
				with only a User-selected, unique user name and password. bigchalk does not knowingly grant Pre-Teen Unaffiliated Registered Users access to any bigchalk
				services that gather their personal information or allow them to post or otherwise disclose personal information. In the case of a Teen/Adult Unaffiliated
				Registered User, bigchalk retains the birth date information in such User's Profile in order to substantiate bigchalk's classification of such User as a
				Teen/Adult Unaffiliated Registered User. Any such User is also required to create a user name and password upon registration for his or her Profile, and to
				supply his or her actual first name and last name and email address. Following registration, a Teen/Adult Unaffiliated Registered User may voluntarily provide
				other personal information to bigchalk in connection with use of particular products and services available through the Site. For example, such a User may
				create a Web page using bigchalk's community tools. ;In doing so, he or she may provide additional information to be displayed on the Web page or on other
				Users' pages, in chat rooms, bulletin boards, in threaded discussions, or in other open-ended communications technologies. Because Web pages and such other
				Internet technologies are capable of displaying any information whatsoever, information of any type can be posted by the Teen/Adult Unaffiliated Registered User
				and collected by bigchalk, including personal, sensitive or confidential information.<br>
				<br>
				<b>3. Registered Schools and Information Collected from Them:</b><br>
				A Registered School is a bona fide, lawfully accredited primary or secondary educational institution in the United States or abroad that has been registered for
				the Site by a teacher, media specialist or other authorized representative (the "Teacher"). When a Teacher registers with bigchalk, he or she must
				provide information to complete the Registered School's Profile, which contains the first and last name of the Teacher, the street address and telephone number
				of the Registered School, and the email address of the Registered School or the Teacher. As part of the Profile, the Teacher must also create a unique user name
				and password for the Registered School. Following registration, a Registered School or the Teacher may voluntarily provide other personal information to
				bigchalk in connection with use of particular products and services available through the Site. For example, the registering Teacher may create a Web page using
				bigchalk's community tools for the Registered School, for the Teacher's classroom or both. Registered Schools may disclose information using the school's Web
				page and by participating in chat rooms, bulletin boards, threaded discussions, and other open-ended communications technologies. Because Web pages and such
				other Internet technologies are capable of displaying any information whatsoever, information of any type can be posted by the Registered School, including
				personal, sensitive or confidential information. As provided in bigchalk's Terms and Conditions, each Registered School is responsible for obtaining the consent
				of the parents or legal guardians of any affiliated Registered Student (as defined below) to the collection, use and disclosure of personal information of the
				Registered Student as provided in this Privacy Policy pursuant to COPPA.<br>
				<br>
				<b>4. Registered Students and Information Collected from Them:</b><br>
				A Registered Student is a student who attends a Registered School and who uses the products or services available through Site under the supervision of and as
				authorized by the Registered School, subject to applicable parental consent. Registered Students may receive their user names from the Registered School they
				attend. Such user names and passwords may be assigned uniquely to individual Registered Students, or they may be assigned on a generic basis to multiple
				Registered Students. In the case of Registered Students with unique user names, Registered Schools are responsible for the accuracy of the required personal
				information of the Registered Student for registration, which consists of the Registered Student's user name, password, actual first name and last name, and
				email address. On the other hand, if the Registered School permits the Registered Student to access the Site using a generic username for the Registered School,
				then no individual registration occurs and bigchalk does not collect such registration information from the Registered Student. Nevertheless, for both
				Registered Students with unique user names and those with generic user names, the types of information described in the next paragraph may be collected, used
				and disclosed as described in the next paragraph in the course of such Registered Student's use of the Site.Registered Schools may allow Registered Students to
				provide other personal information to bigchalk in connection with use of particular products and services available through the Site. For example, Registered
				Students may set up and post information on a personal Web page; disclose information by participating in a chat room, bulletin board or a threaded discussion;
				or disclose information using other open-ended communications technologies. Because Web pages and such other Internet technologies are capable of displaying any
				information whatsoever, information of any type can be posted by the Registered Student including personal, sensitive or confidential information. By allowing
				Registered Students to use the products or services available through the Site, Registered Schools authorize bigchalk to collect such personal information from
				Registered Students and to use and disclose such information as described in this Policy. As authorized by the FTC, bigchalk's compliance obligations under
				COPPA relating to Registered Students are satisfied by the Registered School's promises to bigchalk to obtain parental consent as stated in bigchalk's Terms and
				Conditions, and accordingly bigchalk need not and does not obtain consent from parents for the collection, use, or disclosure of information collected from
				students who register individually or who use the Site under the supervision of Registered Schools.<br>
				<br>
				<b>5. Registered Parents and Information Collected from Them:</b><br>
				A Registered Parent is a parent or legal guardian or a student who attends a Registered School and who uses the products or services available through Site as
				authorized by the Registered School. A Registered Parent receives their user names and passwords from the Registered School their child attends. Such user names
				and passwords may be assigned uniquely to individual Registered Parents, or they may be assigned on a generic basis to multiple Registered Parents. In the case
				of Registered Parents with unique user names, Registered Schools are responsible for providing the required personal information of the Registered Parent for
				registration, which consists of the Registered Parent's first name, last name, country, zip code, birth date and email address. On the other hand, if the
				Registered School permits the Registered Parent to access the Site using a generic username for the Registered School, then no individual registration occurs
				and bigchalk does not collect such registration information from the Registered Parent. Nevertheless, for both Registered Parents with unique user names and
				those with generic user names, the types of information described in the next paragraph may be collected, used and disclosed as described in the next paragraph
				in the course of such Registered Parent's use of the Site.Following registration, a Registered Parent may voluntarily provide other personal information to
				bigchalk in connection with use of particular products and services available through the Site. &nbsp;For example, a Registered Parent may be allowed by his or
				her authorizing Registered School to set up and post information on a personal Web page; disclose information by participating in a chat room, bulletin board,
				or a threaded discussion; or disclose information using other open-ended communications technologies. Because Web pages and such other Internet technologies are
				capable of displaying any information whatsoever, information of any type can be posted by the Registered Parent, including personal, sensitive or confidential
				information.<br>
				<br>

				designate who may access information on Registered School Web pages, Registered Parent Web pages, and Registered Student Web pages, including the student, the
				student's class, the student's school, the student's parents, the student's teachers, other registered bigchalk users, and the public. Unaffiliated Registered
				Users may also designate who may have access to their Web pages. Information posted on other areas of the Site is accessible to the public. Although bigchalk
				makes commercially reasonable efforts to control access to Web pages in accordance with the preferences of Users, all Users should understand that the content
				of any information posted to the Site may be viewed by members of the public.<br>
				<br>
				bigchalk may disclose information about a User as follows:<br>
				<br>
				<ul>
					(1) In connection with a User's voluntary registration for services bigchalk distributes that are provided by unaffiliated business partners, bigchalk may
					accelerate the User's registration process by filling out part of the business partner's registration form for the User based on personal information the User
					disclosed to bigchalk. Such business partners are engaged in the following types of services: provision of online educational courses and educational reference
					materials; and other online and educational services, including provision of tutorial assistance both online and in person. In such a case, the information
					bigchalk discloses becomes subject to the privacy policy of the business partner, the terms of which respecting maintenance of the confidentiality, security
					and integrity of the personal information obtained from bigchalk vary from business partner to business partner. Such third-party privacy policies should be
					consulted for further information.

				current list of such bigchalk service providers with which bigchalk shares or may share User information is <a href="/cgi-bin/WebObjects/WOPortal.woa/wa/BCPageDA/gen~Corporates~partners.html" class="">here</a>. If you would
				like to know more about what information is passed to bigchalk service providers, send an email to <a href="mailto:help@bigchalk.com">help@bigchalk.com</a>.<br>

				information to the buyer of those assets and may assign all of bigchalk's rights and obligations under this Privacy Policy respecting such information to such
				buyer.</ul> <br>
				<br>
				bigchalk does not otherwise disclose information about a User to unaffiliated third parties (apart from the disclosures made on the Site described above unless
				(1) the User expressly authorizes bigchalk to disclose such information, (2) bigchalk is required by law to disclose such information, (3) bigchalk aggregates
				such information with information of other Users from which the certain data field(s) that bigchalk believes constitute or create personal information have been

				associated with the User's use of the Site. In addition, information bigchalk makes available to the User by means of the Site will also be available to anyone
				possessing the User's user name and password.<br>
				<br>
				bigchalk will use cookies to authenticate registered Users, to assist in the navigation of the Site, to personalize the Site for Users, to control access to
				Site content; and bigchalk may, in its sole discretion, use cookies for all other technologically possible uses of cookies.By registering for and/or using the
				Site, each User consents to all of the foregoing uses of User information, and consents to all other uses of such information reasonably necessary to facilitate
				such uses, including but not limited to trans-border transmission of such information worldwide.<br>
				<br>
				<b>8. Protection of Information:</b><br>
				Information collected from Registered Users is stored on databases and other servers kept in secure locations under the custody and control of bigchalk or its
				third party hosting services. &nbsp;bigchalk also uses technologies and processes such as encryption, access control procedures and network firewalls to protect
				such servers. &nbsp;User accounts and Profiles are password-protected using industry-standard, commercially reasonable methods. &nbsp;bigchalk makes
				commercially reasonable efforts to protect such information and to limit its use and disclosure as described herein, but cannot guarantee that such efforts will
				be successful.<br>
				<br>
				<b>9. Reviewing, Changing or Deleting Information:</b><br>
				Because most Users' opportunity to use bigchalk products and services available through the Site derives from the Registered School with which they are
				affiliated, bigchalk follows particular practices regarding reviewing, changing or deleting information that depends on the type of User.<br>
				<br>
				(1) <u>Review and Change of Profile Information</u>. Parents or legal guardians of Pre-Teen Unaffiliated Registered Users or of Registered Students may contact
				bigchalk by email at <a href="mailto:help@bigchalk.com">help@bigchalk.com</a> or as otherwise provided in Section 13 to review and make changes to their child's user name and password.
				Registered Schools, Teachers, Registered Parents and Teen/Adult Unaffiliated Registered Users may review, make changes to, or have their personal information
				deleted from, their Profiles and Web pages at any time by accessing their Profiles or Web pages with their password.<br>
				<br>
				(2) <u>Deletion of Profiles and Web Pages</u>. &nbsp;Registered Schools may delete their Profiles and Web pages, or the Profiles and Web pages of affiliated
				Registered Students or Registered Parents, by sending a request by email to <a href="mailto:help@bigchalk.com">help@bigchalk.com</a> or as otherwise provided in Section 13. Registered
				Students and Registered Parents seeking such changes should contact their affiliated Registered School. Unaffiliated Registered Users may delete their Profiles
				and Web pages by sending a request by email to <a href="mailto:help@bigchalk.com">help@bigchalk.com</a> or as otherwise provided in Section 13.<br>
				<br>
				<b>10. Revision of Privacy Policy:</b><br>
				bigchalk reserves the right to change this Privacy Policy at any time without notice and with immediate, retroactive effect on all User information previously
				collected. Each User agrees to review the Site regularly for changes in the Privacy Policy, and agrees to consent in advance to such changes or, if he or she
				does not consent to any provision in any Privacy Policy that supersedes this Privacy Policy, agrees to delete his or her User Profile and/or terminate his or
				her registration. bigchalk will post a notice of any material change in this Privacy Policy on the Site.<br>
				<br>
				<b>11. Other Web Sites:</b><br>
				The Site links to a wide variety of other unaffiliated sites. bigchalk is not responsible for the privacy policies of sites not part of the Site or how
				they treat information about their users.<br>
				<br>
				<b>12. Additional COPPA-Related Policies:</b><br>
				There are not any activities on the Site for which bigchalk requires, as a prerequisite to a User under the age of thirteen engaging in such activity, that such
				User disclose more personal information than is reasonably necessary to participate in such activity.<br>
				<br>
				Participation in the service offerings of bigchalk's business partners is optional (and in most cases provided for an additional charge). Registered Schools
				will determine which service offerings will be available to their Registered Students, and Registered Students will only be eligible to obtain and register for
				such offerings as authorized by the Registered School with which they are affiliated. Thus, registration with bigchalk does not necessitate disclosure of
				personal information of Registered Students to such business partners, unless the Registered School chooses to make those business partners' services available.
				Accordingly, as required under COPPA, a Registered School may give its consent to bigchalk's collection and use of the personal information of a Registered
				Student under the age of 13 without necessarily consenting to bigchalk's disclosure of that information to bigchalk's business partners.<br>
				<br>
				<b>13. Contact Information:</b><br>
				Inquiries about this Privacy Policy, or comments or communications regarding it, including requests for deletion or correction of user information, may be
				directed by email to <a href="mailto:help@bigchalk.com">help@bigchalk.com</a> or by mail to Privacy, c/o Customer Service, bigchalk.com, inc., 1000 Chesterbrook Blvd, Suite 111, Berwyn, PA 19312.</font><br>
