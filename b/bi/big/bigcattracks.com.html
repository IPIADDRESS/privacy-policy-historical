            <br>

            <p>We at HasOffers by TUNE (“HasOffers”, “we”, “us”, “our”) know that our clients (“you”, “your”) care about how User data is collected and treated. Please read the following to learn more about our privacy policy.<br>
            This privacy statement describes HasOffers’ use practices and policies with regard to the information that is collected through the HasOffers Platform. It does not state the use practices or policies of our clients, of the websites or apps on which ads are shown, or of other parties.<br>
            This Privacy Policy relates solely to our Hasoffers product.</p>

            <p>For privacy practices on TUNE’s corporate websites, please <a href="https://www.tune.com/resources/data-and-privacy/privacy-policies/" data-link-type="cta">CLICK HERE</a>.</p>

            <p>For the TMC’s privacy policy, please <a href="https://www.tune.com/resources/data-and-privacy/privacy-policies/tmc-privacy-policy/" data-link-type="cta">CLICK HERE</a>.</p>

            <h2>Definitions</h2>
            <p><strong>Ad Serving</strong> is the process of delivering an ad to be shown in a web page or a mobile app.</p>

            <p><strong>Advertisers:</strong> Companies (apps, brands) that have an product or service they want to promote.</p>

            <p><strong>Ad Identifiers</strong> are unique character strings associated with user devices that help monitor and measure user interactions with advertisements and apps. Examples of Ad Identifiers include IDFA (developed by Apple for the iPhone), Google Ad ID (developed by Google for Android), and Windows advertising ID (developed by Microsoft for Windows Phone). Each of these Ad Identifiers can be reset by the user.</p>
            <p><strong>Affiliate:</strong> An Affiliate is any website that displays advertisements on behalf of an Advertiser. The terms Affiliate and Publisher can be used interchangeably.</p>

            <p><strong>Clicks</strong> refers to when a User “clicks” on the advertisement and goes to the offer’s page. Learn more on the HasOffers help site, “A Primer on Offers and Tracking.”</p>

            <p><strong>Clients</strong> are HasOffers clients, and may include individual employees of a HasOffers client.</p>

            <p><strong>Conversions</strong> happen when the User completes the “offer” (e.g. making a purchase on an e-commerce site, installing a mobile app, filling out a survey, or doing some other action). Learn more on the HasOffers help site, “<a href="https://help.tune.com/hasoffers/primer-on-offers-tracking/" data-link-type="cta">A Primer on Offers and Tracking</a>.”</p>

            <p><strong>Cookies</strong> are small text image files stored on your computer either temporarily or permanently to allow websites to recognize users and keep track of their preferences.</p>

            <p><strong>Geographic Location Data </strong>can either be precise (identifying the end user’s precise location) or imprecise (identifying the end user’s city or country). In HasOffers we collect imprecise geographic data through IP address and/or wifi networks in the end user’s vicinity. We collect this data to help our clients provide more relevant advertisements and content, and to ensure we comply with country specific requirements.</p>

            <p><strong>Impressions</strong> occur when a User sees an ad for an Advertiser on a Publisher’s site or app. Ideally, they are followed by a Click and then a Conversion. Learn more on the HasOffers help site, “<a href="https://help.tune.com/hasoffers/primer-on-offers-tracking/" data-link-type="cta">A Primer on Offers and Tracking</a>.”</p>

            <p><strong>Inventory</strong> is website or mobile app traffic from Users that can be used for advertising</p>

            <p><strong>IP Address</strong> is a numerical label attached to any device that connects to the Internet. Most IP addresses are dynamic i.e. the device’s IP address changes and is not persistently tied to any one device. HasOffers clients may opt to “pseudonymize” IPs to comply with a specific jurisdiction’s laws. Learn more at: <a href="https://help.tune.com/hasoffers/ip-address-obfuscation/" data-link-type="cta">https://help.tune.com/hasoffers/ip-address-obfuscation/</a></p>

            <p><strong>Network</strong> are brokers between mobile advertisers and publishers.</p>

            <p><strong>Pixel Tags</strong> are website based and usually work in conjunction with cookies. They ,registers when the User visits a particular page.</p>

            <p><strong>Postbacks</strong>are server-to-server communications between parties (generally through an API).</p>

            <p><strong>Publishers</strong> have Inventory and display ads on behalf of Advertisers.</p>

            <p><strong>Users</strong> are end users, specifically individuals on websites or mobile apps that see and potentially interact with HasOffers.</p>

            <h2>What Is HasOffers And Why Do Our Clients Use Us?</h2>

            <p>HasOffers is the leading performance marketing platform, used by the world’s top mobile and desktop networks to manage their online advertising relationships. Clients use HasOffers to assess the effectiveness of their Affiliate and Publisher relationships – by measuring User clicks and conversions through technologies such as Cookies and Pixel Tags, and through the collection of technical identifiers from the User’s device including Ad Identifiers and IP address.</p>

            <p>The following diagram illustrates how HasOffers interacts with an Advertiser’s Users, to help identify which Users completed the action for a particular offer (known as Conversion).</p>

            <h2>How Do Clients Collect User Information Using Hasoffers?</h2>

            <p>HasOffers collects the following types of information from Users to help clients optimize and measure their advertising network, affiliate and publisher relationships:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>Ad Identifiers</li>
            <li>IP address</li>
            <li>Cookies</li>
            <li>Pixel Tags</li>
            <li>Imprecise Geographic Location Data derived from IP address and/or wifi networks.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>HasOffers also collects this information from employees of Clients who access information using their Hasoffers accounts.</p>

            <p>Clients can also choose to view and measure information provided by other third-party sources in the platform. Those sources may include: Advertisers, Publishers, Affiliates, and other Networks and analytics partners.</p>

            <p>Clients own the data that they provide to and collect through the Platform. When clients remove or export their data from the Platform, their use of data is governed by their own privacy policies and applicable laws, rules, or regulations.</p>

            <h2>How Do Clients Use Hasoffers To Collect Information From Users?</h2>

            <p>Clients use HasOffers to create Cookies and Pixel Tags that can be placed on websites to collect browsing information about Users. HasOffers also supports server-to-server measurement for some clients. With any of the mentioned methods, when an end user clicks on an advertisement, goes to a specific web page, or does any other action that a Client chooses to monitor, HasOffers collects information from the User’s computer or device, including but not limited to Cookies, Pixel Tags, and Ad Identifiers.</p>

            <h2>How Do Clients Use Hasoffers To Process Information From Users?</h2>

            <li>Measuring the performance of ad campaigns</li>

            <li>Measuring the performance of Affiliates, Publishers and Networks</li>

            <li>Creating customized performance reports (for example, how well a particular advertisement is performing in a particular geographic region)</li>

            <li>Determining when Users respond to ads</li>

            <li>Ad Serving – HasOffers uses data that does not personally identify users to target advertising for Clients. Specifically, end users can be targeted by device type (OS, Make, Model) and imprecise geographic location (state and region).</li>

            
            <h2>What Information Does Hasoffers Collect From Clients?</h2>

            <p>Signing up as a Client requires setting up a HasOffers account. To do this, we will need contact details – including mailing and/or billing address, email address, company name, and website URL. Clients will also need to provide a user name and password to set up a HasOffers account. Please note that TUNE treats all Client contact details as confidential business information that will only be used to service Client accounts and respond to Client, Affiliate or Publisher inquiries.</p>

            <h2>What Information Does Hasoffers Share With Third Parties?</h2>

            <p>HasOffers may, to operate or enhance HasOffers’ services, provide data collected on the Platform to clients, partners, and service providers, but only with the client’s consent. HasOffers may provide, or enable others to collect, information for purposes of detecting and preventing malicious activity or invalid traffic. In addition, HasOffers may disclose such information in the event we reasonably suspect malicious activity or invalid traffic, or believe that we are legally required to do so. HasOffers may also share aggregated data derived from the Platform, including, for example, statistics about Platform activity. Finally, we may transfer Platform data to a successor entity in connection with a corporate merger, consolidation, sale of assets, bankruptcy, or other corporate change.</p>

            <h2>Does Hasoffers Have A Datat Retention Term?</h2>

            <p>Clients choose their respective data retention terms when using the HasOffers platform.</p>

            <h2>What Are Hasoffers Security Practices?</h2>

            <p>HasOffers uses commercially reasonable efforts, including a variety of security technologies and procedures to secure Client and User Data from unauthorized access, use or disclosure.</p>
            <h2>Can Users Disable Cookie And Id Tracking Through Hasoffers?</h2>

            <p>You can disable cookies in most internet browsers. An overview of the process is available here: <a href="http://www.allaboutcookies.org/manage-cookies/index.html">http://www.allaboutcookies.org/manage-cookies/index.html</a>. Disabling cookies will not, however, stop you from receiving all advertisements. If you would like to opt out of a particular ad network, publisher, or advertiser’s ads, you will need to contact those companies directly to inquire whether they have an opt-out option.<br>

            You can also disable collection of Ad Identifiers for targeted advertising by enabling the Limit Ad Tracking setting on your smartphone. You can also reset your Ad Identifier altogether using your smartphone’s privacy settings.</p>
