<input type="hidden" value="4" name="page">

<p>Bigclicks.com, Inc has created this privacy statement in order to outline our online information practices. The following fully discloses what kind of information we collect from our visitors, and how we use that information at Bigclicks.com.

</p><p><font size="3"><b>WEB-BASED E-MAIL ACCOUNT</b></font>
<br>We consider our customers' mailboxes and the content of all messages to be private. We do not monitor or disclose e-mail messages unless we believe we must do so (i) to enforce our e-mail Terms and Conditions, (ii) because we are required to do so by law, or (iii) to defend Bigclicks in any legal action or to protect the property of Bigclicks. Additionally, our subscribers must agree to respect the privacy and confidentiality of others. Since privacy is, in part, a function of our customers' passwords, we encourage them to change their passwords frequently and to not share them with anyone. Bigclicks Webmail is a separate service provided by BigMailBox.com. Click on the following hyperlinks for the BigMailBox privacy policy and terms and conditions.

</p><p><font size="3"><b>WHAT INFORMATION WE COLLECT FROM OUR SUBSCRIBERS:</b></font>
<br>Our site's registration form requires users to give contact and demographic information such as name, e-mail address, age, gender, zip code and country of residence. We may use customer contact information from the registration form to send the user information about our company and promotional material from some of our partners. The customer's contact information may also be used to contact the visitor when necessary and shared with other companies who may want to contact our visitors. Demographic and profile information may also be used to tailor the visitor's experience at our site, showing them content that we think might interest them. <b>We may disclose information you enter during the join process to third parties.</b>

</p><p><font size="3"><b>DISTRIBUTION OF SUBSCRIBER INFORMATION TO THIRD PARTIES:</b></font>
<br>During the registration process, and at certain times during any member user session, we may present you with additional offers from third party service providers. These offers are optional and typically presented as "yes/accept or no/decline" questions. A checked response or yes/no button selection indicates your preference. Certain offers may be presented with a pre-checked preference/selection. If you do not deselect (opt-out) the checked boxes on our join form then we may transfer your profile information to the third party service providers. Our third party service providers have their own terms and conditions and privacy policies. We suggest that you visit their sites and review their terms and conditions and privacy policies before you "opt-in" to any offer.

</p><p><b><font size="3">CHILDREN'S PRIVACY:</font></b>
<br>We do not structure any part of our Website to attract anyone under the age of 13. Our system does not allow anyone under the age of 13 to join Bigclicks as a subscriber. If parents believe their child (any age under 18) has accessed our system without their permission, they can contact our customer service department Monday-Friday 9am-5pm PST at 213-596-5030 or by e-mail: <a href="mailto:support@bigclicks.com">support@Bigclicks.com</a>. <b>Visit <a href="http://www.ftc.gov/kidzprivacy">http://www.ftc.gov/kidzprivacy</a> for information from the Federal Trade Commission about protecting children's privacy online. </b>
