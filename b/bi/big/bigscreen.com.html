<p align="center"><span class="mainTitle">Privacy Policy</span><br>
</p><blockquote>This document explains what information we collect from you, why we 
collect it, and what we will and will not do with it. It also explains certain issues involved with advertising that appears on our site, and how that relates to privacy concerns that you may have.  Please note: We reserve the right to change the policies documented here without notice.</blockquote><p></p>

<br clear="ALL"><br>

<p><span class="subTitle">What Information We Collect When You Customize The BigScreen Cinema Guide</span><br>
In order to provide you with a customized experience, we ask you for the following items of information:<br>
</p><ul>
	<li>Your Name
	</li><li>Your E-Mail Address
	</li><li>A Password of Your Choice
	</li><li>Your ZIP Code
</li></ul><p></p>

<p><span class="subTitle">How We Collect That Information (Cookies)</span><br>
We use a technology available in every current browser, called Cookies.  When we ask for your information, we store it in our records, and assign you a unique ID.  This ID is stored on your browser using a cookie, so that when you return to The BigScreen Cinema Guide, we can retrieve your settings and use them to customize your visit with us.  The only information that is stored in your browser is the ID code, and that cookie is only accessible by this site.  If you would like to read more about cookies, and what they can and cannot do, check out a site called <a href="http://www.cookiecentral.com">Cookie Central</a>.</p>

<p>If you have chosen only to provide us with your ZIP code, instead of customizing The BigScreen Cinema Guide, we do store that ZIP code in what's called a temporary cookie.  This temporary cookie is deleted by your browser when you exit the program, and is not stored like the ID mentioned in the previous example.  The next time you run your browser and visit BigScreen, you will be asked for your ZIP code again.</p>

<p><span class="subTitle">Why We Collect That Information and What We Do With It</span><br>
We ask for your name so that we can welcome you by name when you return to the site. If you submit a Reader Review, your name is used to identify you on your review.  Take a look at our Reader Reviews section for examples of how we do this.</p>

<p>Your E-Mail address is needed so that we can contact you if we need to. If you forget your password when logging into BigScreen from another computer, we give you the option of having your password E-Mailed to the address you gave us. If we have questions about a review you submitted, we will contact you at that address so that we can post your review as soon as possible. We will not publish your E-Mail address anywhere on the site.</p>

<p>To keep others from accessing your custom settings, your settings are protected with a password that you choose. You only need to login to access your custom settings once, as we store a cookie on your browser that connects your browser to your settings.</p>

<p>Probably the most important piece of information that we can get from you is your ZIP code. We use your ZIP code to determine which theaters are closest to your location, so that you can select nearby theaters easily.</p>

<p><span class="subTitle">What We Will Not Do With Your Information</span><br>
We will not willingly share your information with any third party. We believe that your personal information is yours to share with us, and no one else needs to have access to it. We will not sell, trade, or otherwise share the information you provide to us with anyone not directly associated with The BigScreen Cinema Guide, unless required to do so by law.</p>

<p><span class="subTitle">A Special Note About the Third Party Advertising on Our Site</span><br>
We use Maxworldwide and other third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our Web site. These companies may use information (not including your name, address, email address or telephone number) about your visits to this and other Web sites in order to provide advertisements on this site and other sites about goods and services that may be of interest to you. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies, please <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/optout_nonppii.asp">click here</a>.</p>

<p><span class="subTitle">Third Party Cookies</span><br>
In the course of serving advertisements to this site, our third-party advertiser may place or recognize a unique "cookie" on your browser.</p>
