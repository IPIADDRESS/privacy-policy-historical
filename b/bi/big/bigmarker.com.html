  <li>BigMarker may disclose personal information to respond to legal requirements, exercise our legal rights or
    defend against legal claims, to protect BigMarker’s interests, fight against fraud and to enforce our policies
    or to protect anyone’s rights, property, or safety.
  </li>

  <li>In order to provide its services, BigMarker may share with its business partners, in a secure environment,
    your personal and traffic data. These business partners may include group companies, carriers, partner service
    providers and/or agents. They are required to take measures to protect your personal and traffic data in
    accordance with the law.
  </li>

  <li>BigMarker products and services may be licensed or co-branded and offered together with or directly by a
    partner company. If you register for or use such products, you consent to both BigMarker’s and the partner
    company’s use of personal data collected in connection with the licensed or co-branded product.
    BigMarker, BigMarker’s local partner, or the operator or company facilitating your communication may provide
    personal data, communications content and/or traffic data to an appropriate judicial, law enforcement or
    government authority lawfully requesting such information. BigMarker will provide all reasonable assistance
    and information to fulfill this request and you hereby consent to such disclosure.
  </li>

  <li>Your information may be stored and processed in any country in which Amazon or its affiliates, subsidiaries
    or service providers maintain facilities. BigMarker reserves the right to transfer information outside of your
    country. By using BigMarker software, products or websites, you consent to any such transfer of information
    outside of your country.
  </li>

  <li>Please note that information that you voluntarily make Public in your user profile, or which you disclose in
    a Public Community will become publicly available and viewable by others. It is up to BigMarker members to be
    aware of what information they are releasing to the public. BigMarker accepts no responsibility or liability
    for any private information that was inadvertently made public. If any information has been made public that
    was not intended to be made public, please send an email to
    <a href="mailto:Report@BigMarker.com">Report@BigMarker.com</a>.
  </li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>You have the option to provide certain personal information to BigMarker. This optional personal information
    may be required in order to receive specific services. By providing such information, you are agreeing that
    BigMarker may store, process, and review such information. BigMarker may use this information for the purpose
    for which it was collected, and this information may be stored for as long as is necessary to provide you with
    our services.
  </li>
</ul>
<br><br>
<h3>IV. Your Information Choices for Communities</h3>
<br>
<h4>Public Communities:</h4>
<br>
<ul>
  <li>If you belong to a public community, your name will automatically be made public. Further, any information
    you choose to share within your profile and within a public community will be made public.
  </li>

  <li>When you create a BigMarker account, you will automatically be entered into the BigMarker Community. The
    BigMarker Community is public, so your name, as well as any information you choose to share within your
    profile will be made public. If you do not want your name or profile information made public, you can leave
    the BigMarker Community. This can be done by navigating to the BigMarker Community page at
    <a href="/BMcommunity">bigmarker.com/BMcommunity</a>, scrolling over the “My Profile” button and clicking
    on the “Leave Community” link.
  </li>
</ul>
<br>
<h4>Private Communities:</h4>
<br>
<ul>
  <li>Information you share within a private community will only be made available to other members of such
    private community.
  </li>

  <li>If you only belong to a private community, then your name and profile information will only be made
    available to the members of those communities. However, if you also belong to a public community, your name
    and profile information will be made public.
  </li>

  <li>You may also be given a chance to provide additional profile information that is unique to a specific
    community. For a private community, any information you choose to share will only be available to other
    members of such private community. For a public community, any information you choose to share will be made
    public.
  </li>
</ul>
<br>
<h4>Groups</h4>

<p>Within a community, you can create or become a member of a sub-community, which can represent a department,
    chapter or team within the parent community. Any information you share in a parent community or any of its
    groups will be shared with members of the parent community. For example, information you choose to
    share in a sub-community will be shared with the members of the parent community.</p>


<h4>Community Partnerships</h4>


  <p>Community organizers have the opportunity to create community partnerships with other communities. Community
    partnerships can exist between public communities, private communities, and a combination of public and
    private communities. Once a community partnership is formed, each partnered community will have access to
    information shared by the other partnered communities. If you are the community organizer of a partnered
    private community with a partnership with a public community, then the information shared by the partnered
    private community will be made public, unless you choose to make the information private.
  </p>

<h3>V. Analytics</h3>


  <p>In order to improve your user experience, we use analytics partners including Google Analytics, KISSmetrics,
    and Optimizely to gather statistical and analytical information about how you use our Services.
  </p>

    offers and promotional materials likely to be of greater interest to you and to help BigMarker measure and
    improve the performance of our promotional campaigns.
