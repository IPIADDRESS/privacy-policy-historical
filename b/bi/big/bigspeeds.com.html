<h5>Website Visitors</h5>
<p>Like most website operators, BigSpeeds collects   non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and   servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language   preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor   request. BigSpeeds purpose in collecting non-personally   identifying information is to better understand how BigSpeeds's   visitors use its website. From time to time, BigSpeeds may release   non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by   publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.</p>
<p>BigSpeeds also collects potentially personally-identifying   information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. BigSpeeds does   not use such information to identify its visitors, however, and does not   disclose such information, other than under the same circumstances that   it uses and discloses personally-identifying information, as described   below.</p>
<h5>Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</h5>
<p>Certain visitors to BigSpeeds websites choose to interact   with BigSpeeds in ways that require BigSpeeds to gather   personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information   that BigSpeeds gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For   example, we ask visitors who use our forums to provide a username and   email address. In each case, BigSpeeds collects such information   only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of   the visitor's interaction with BigSpeeds. BigSpeeds does not   disclose personally-identifying information other than as described   below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying   information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in   certain website-related activities.</p>
<h5>Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information</h5>
<p>BigSpeeds discloses potentially personally-identifying and   personally-identifying information only to those of its employees,   contractors, and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that   information in order to process it on BigSpeeds behalf or to   provide services available at BigSpeeds's websites, and (ii) that   have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees,   contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your   home country; by using BigSpeeds's websites, you consent to the   transfer of such information to them. BigSpeeds will not rent or   sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying   information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors, and   affiliated organizations, as described above, BigSpeeds discloses   potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying   information only when required to do so by law, or when BigSpeeds   believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to   protect the property or rights of BigSpeeds, third parties, or the   public at large. If you are a registered user of a BigSpeeds. website   and have supplied your email address, BigSpeeds may occasionally   send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback,   or just keep you up to date with what's going on with BigSpeeds and   our products. We primarily use our blog to communicate this type of   information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If   you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our   feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to   help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other   users. BigSpeeds takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect   against the unauthorized access, use, alteration, or destruction of   potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying   information.</p>
<h5>Cookies</h5>
<p>A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a   visitor's computer, and that the visitor's browser provides to the   website each time the visitor returns. BigSpeeds uses cookies to   help BigSpeeds identify and track visitors, their usage of   BigSpeeds website, and their website access preferences. BigSpeeds visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their   computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using   BigSpeeds's websites, with the drawback that certain features of   BigSpeeds's websites may not function properly without the aid of   cookies.</p>
<h5>Privacy Policy Changes</h5>
<p>Although most changes are likely to be minor, BigSpeeds may   change its Privacy Policy from time to time, and in BigSpeeds's sole   discretion. BigSpeeds encourages visitors to frequently check this   page for any changes to its Privacy Policy. Your continued use of this   site after any change in this Privacy Policy will constitute your   acceptance of such change.</p>
