  required for your right to visit the website. If you do not accept these terms,
  you have no right to visit this site and you are fraudulently using this site.<br>
  <br>
  <strong><b>ABOUT THE PERSONAL INFORMATION THIS WEBSITE COLLECTS AND HOW IT
  IS USED</b></strong><br>
  <br>
  This website routinely collects information about its visitors, subscribers,
  members, and customers. This information is obtained in various ways, such
  as: VISITOR, SUBSCRIBER, MEMBER, OR CUSTOMER INFORMATION OBTAINED FROM 'REGISTRATION'
  Registration means that the Visitor, Subscriber, Member or Customer takes active,
  positive steps to communicate information to this website. This can include
  pages or 'pop ups' where you register for a newsletter or subscribe to a mailing
  list; it can include your participation in visitor surveys; it can include
  requesting information from the website via email, mail, or courier; it may
  be from joining an affiliate program or other membership organization, paid
  or unpaid; it may be from ordering a product.<br>
  <br>
  Occasionally complete credit card information may be provided to the website
  via fax or a fill-in form rather than regular secure merchant service processing.
  This information is kept at the highest level of security and is never divulged
  to anyone except the merchant service provider or for the purpose of communication
  with the customer.<br>
  <br>
  <strong><b>ONLINE ORDERING</b></strong><br>
  <br>
  Online ordering via SSL encrypted communication provided by shopping cart services
  supporting merchant service companies like Visa and Master Card provides information
  to the website but does not provide complete credit card numbers. In the process
  of online ordering, the customer provides, name, address, city, state, email
  address, phone number, CVV2 (back of card) number, and, occasionally a member
  password. You should consider all this information available to the website.
  This information is used to deliver the product, but under the Purchase Agreement
  you also approve its use for general solicitation purposes.<br>
  <br>
  <strong><b>VISITOR EMAIL INQUIRIES</b></strong><br>
  <br>
  Website visitors who wish to communicate with the website do so under two conditions:
  one, they give their permission for contact by the website; two, they are subject
  to any ‘submission’ provisions of the Terms of Use, Purchase Agreement,
  or this Privacy Policy. While your email address may or may not be used to
  solicit you, it is added to the website's general solicitation database.<br>
  <br>
  <strong><b>CUSTOMER EMAIL OR TESTIMONIALS</b></strong><br>
  <br>
  If you are a customer and send an email to the website, or if you communicate
  with the site by phone or mail, the website collects information about your
  communication and by communicating with the site you give your permission to
  collect, archive, retrieve, and otherwise use any information collected as
  the site sees fit.<br>
  <br>
  Any communication which, in its sole discretion, the site deems to be a testimonial,
  may be publicized for commercial purposes.<br>
  <br>
  <strong><b>INFORMATION OBTAINED FROM VISITOR INTERACTION WITH BANNERS, POPUPS,
  OR SITE ADVERTISERS</b></strong><br>
            <br>

  fashion. Visitors must assume that (1) information will be collected, (2) that ‘cookies’ will
  usually be placed on their hard drive, (3) that website does not have any control
  over what happens with this information, (4) that website takes no responsibility

            <br>
            <strong><b>INFORMATION OBTAINED FROM REFERRING EMAIL OR REFERRING
                URLS</b></strong><br>
            <br>

            <br>

                MEMBER OR CUSTOMER SURVEYS</b></strong><br>
            <br>

  design, product offers to you, and general commercial solicitation purposes
  by this site or joint venture partners, affiliates, and marketing organizations.<br>
