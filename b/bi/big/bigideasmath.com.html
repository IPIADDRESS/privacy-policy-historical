In either case, if you are a minor, your school has acted as your parent or guardian’s agent and has consented to this collection on your behalf.  If you are under 13 years old, this consent fulfills our obligation under the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act.  Our collection of personal information to set up your account is in furtherance of our performance of services otherwise performed by school employees, is under the direct control of the school with respect to the use and maintenance of educational records, and complies with use and redisclosure requirements regarding personal information from education records, all in compliance with the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act.</p>
