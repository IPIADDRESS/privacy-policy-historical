The following discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices.  <strong>By visiting Big Sea Games, you are accepting the practices described in this Privacy Notice.</strong>
				</p>
				<h2>INFORMATION THAT WE MAY COLLECT</h2>
				<ul class="gBullets blackB">
					<li><strong>Personally Identifiable Information:</strong> When you create a Big Sea Games account (a "Big Sea Games Account"), we will collect your e-mail address and ask that you create an online username.  If you contact our customer support team online, we will ask for and collect your first and last name.</li>
					<li><strong>IP Address:</strong> When a user visits Big Sea Games, we may collect the IP address that requested the display of this Web site.</li>

				</ul>
				<h2>USE OF COLLECTED INFORMATION</h2>
				<p>
					We use your username, e-mail address, and password to uniquely identify you as a Big Sea Games user.  We may use or display your username for the purposes of rankings, competitions or sweepstakes, chat identification, and/or game high scores.

				<p>
					Web sites that link to or from Big Sea Games may collect personal information about you. This Privacy Policy does not apply to, and cannot control the activities of, other Web sites.

					We will not resell your information to any third parties.

We do not control the activities of such third party vendors. While we cannot guarantee that they will adhere to the same privacy and security procedures as Big Sea Games, we will take all reasonable precautions under the circumstances to ensure the protection of your personal information.  We may also disclose your information if there is a violation of the Big Sea Games Terms of Use or if we have a good faith belief that the law requires it.  We may also provide other aggregate, non-personally identifiable information about our user community to partners with whom we do business.
