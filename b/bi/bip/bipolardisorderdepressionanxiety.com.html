<p><span style="font-size:20pt;">Our Site strives to offer its visitors the many advantages of Internet technology and to provide an interactive and personalized experience. We may use Personally Identifiable Information (your name, e-mail address, street address, telephone number) subject to the terms of this privacy policy. <b><i>We will never sell, barter, or rent your email address to any unauthorized third party.</i></b> </span><b><i><span style="font-size:20pt;">Period.</span></i></b></p>
<p><b><i><span style="font-size:20pt;">How we gather information from users</span></i></b></p>
<p><span style="font-size:20pt;">How
we collect and store information depends on the page you are visiting, the activities in which you elect to participate and the services provided. For example, you may be asked to provide information when you register for access to certain portions of our site or request certain features, such as newsletters or when you make a purchase. You may provide information when you participate in sweepstakes and contests, message boards and chat rooms, and other interactive areas of our site. Like most Web sites, Our
Site also collects information automatically and through the use of electronic tools that may be transparent to our visitors. For example, we may log the name of your Internet Service Provider or use cookie technology to recognize you and hold information from your visit. Among other things, the cookie may store your user name
and password, sparing you from having to re-enter that information each
time you visit, or may control the number of times you encounter a particular advertisement while visiting our site. As we adopt additional
technology, we may also gather information through other means. In certain cases, you can choose not to provide us with information, for example by setting your browser to refuse to accept cookies, but if you do you may be unable to access certain portions of the site or may be asked to re-enter your user name and password, and we may not be able to
customize the site`s features according to your preferences.</span></p>
<p><b><i><span style="font-size:20pt;">What we do with the information we collect</span></i></b></p>
<p><span style="font-size:20pt;">Like
other Web publishers, we collect information to enhance your visit and deliver more individualized content and advertising. We respect your privacy and do not share your information with anyone.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:20pt;">Aggregated Information (information that does not personally identify you) may be used in many ways. For example, we may combine information about your usage patterns with similar information obtained from other users to help enhance our site and services (e.g., to learn which pages are visited most or what features are most attractive). Aggregated Information may occasionally be shared with our advertisers and business
partners. Again, this information does not include any Personally Identifiable Information about you or allow anyone to identify you individually.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:20pt;">We may use Personally Identifiable Information collected on Our Site to communicate with you about your registration and customization preferences; our Terms of Service and privacy policy; services and products offered by Our Site and other topics we think you might find of interest.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:20pt;">Personally Identifiable Information collected by Our Site may also be used for other purposes, including but
not limited to site administration, troubleshooting, processing of e-commerce transactions, administration of sweepstakes and contests, and
other communications with you. Certain third parties who provide technical support for the operation of our site (our Web hosting service
for example) may access such information. We will use your information only as permitted by law. In addition, from time to time as we continue to develop our business, we may sell, buy, merge or partner with other companies or businesses. In such transactions, user information may be among the transferred assets. We may also disclose your information in response to a court order, at other times when we believe we are reasonably required to do so by law, in connection with the collection of amounts you may owe
to us, and/or to law enforcement authorities whenever we deem it appropriate or necessary. Please note we may not provide you with notice prior to disclosure in such cases.</span></p>
<p><b><i><span style="font-size:20pt;">Affiliated sites, linked sites and advertisements</span></i></b></p>
<p><span style="font-size:20pt;">Our
Site expects its partners, advertisers and affiliates to respect the privacy of our users. Be aware, however, that third parties, including our partners, advertisers, affiliates and other content providers accessible through our site, may have their own privacy and data collection policies and practices. For example, during your visit to our
site you may link to, or view as part of a frame on a Our Site page, certain content that is actually created or hosted by a third party. Also, through Our Site you may be introduced to, or be able to access, information, Web sites, features, contests or sweepstakes offered by other parties. Our Site is not responsible for the actions or policies of such third parties. You should check the applicable privacy policies of those third parties when providing information on a feature or page operated by a third party.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:20pt;">While on our site, our advertisers, promotional partners or other third parties may use cookies or other technology to attempt to identify some of your preferences or retrieve information about you. For example, some of our advertising is served by
third parties and may include cookies that enable the advertiser to determine whether you have seen a particular advertisement before. Other
features available on our site may offer services operated by third parties and may use cookies or other technology to gather information. Our Site does not control the use of this technology by third parties or
the resulting information, and is not responsible for any actions or policies of such third parties.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:20pt;">You should also be aware that if you voluntarily disclose Personally Identifiable Information on message boards or in chat areas, that information can be viewed publicly and can
be collected and used by third parties without our knowledge and may result in unsolicited messages from other individuals or third parties. Such activities are beyond the control of Our Site and this policy.</span></p>
<p><b><i><span style="font-size:20pt;">Children</span></i></b></p>
<p><span style="font-size:20pt;">Our
Site does not knowingly collect or solicit Personally Identifiable Information from or about children under 13 except as permitted by law. If we discover we have received any information from a child under 13 in
violation of this policy, we will delete that information immediately. If you believe Our Site has any information from or about anyone under 13, please contact us at the address listed below.</span></p>
<p><b><i><span style="font-size:20pt;">Changes to this Policy</span></i></b></p>
<p><span style="font-size:20pt;">Our
Site reserves the right to change this policy at any time. Please check
this page periodically for changes. Your continued use of our site following the posting of changes to these terms will mean you accept those changes. Information collected prior to the time any change is posted will be used according to the rules and laws that applied at the time the information was collected.</span></p>
