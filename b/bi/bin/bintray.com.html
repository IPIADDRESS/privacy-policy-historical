<div class="paragraph">
<p>JFrog Inc. and its affiliates ("<strong>JFrog</strong>", “<strong>Company</strong>”, "<strong>us</strong>" or “<strong>we</strong>”) respect the privacy of the users of the Company’s website available at: <a href="https://bintray.com/">https://bintray.com</a> (the “<strong>Site</strong>”) and the Services and Platform provided therein (“User” or “you”). The Company is committed to protecting the personal information that its User’s share with it. We believe that you have a right to know our practices regarding the information we may collect and use when you visit and/or use our Site and/or our Platform and/or our Services. It is hereby made clear that the term "<strong>Site</strong>" shall include the "<strong>Platform</strong>" and the "<strong>Services</strong>" provided therein.</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p><strong><u>Your consent (PLEASE READ CAREFULLY!)</u></strong><br>
BY ENTERING, CONNECTING TO, ACCESSING AND/OR USING THE SITE AND/OR ANY PART THEREOF, YOU AGREE TO THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS SET FORTH IN THIS PRIVACY POLICY (THE "<strong>PRIVACY POLICY</strong>"), INCLUDING TO THE COLLECTION AND PROCESSING OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION (AS DEFINED BELOW). <strong>IF YOU DISAGREE TO ANY TERM PROVIDED HEREIN, PLEASE DO NOT ACCESS AND USE THE SITE</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><u>Which information may we collect on our Users?</u></strong><br>
We collect two types of data and information from our Users:<br></p>
<div class="olist loweralpha">
<ol class="loweralpha" type="a">
<li>
<p>The first type is non-identifiable and anonymous information ("<strong>Non-personal Information"). We are not aware of the identity of the User from whom we have collected the Non-personal Information</strong>. Non-Personal Information is any unconcealed aggregated information which does not enable identification of an individual User, and which is available to us while such User is visiting and/or using the Site. Non-personal Information which is being gathered consists of technical information and behavioral information, such as, type of operating system, type of browser/user agent, screen resolution, browser and keyboard language, flash version, type of build technologies, type of build server as well as the number of servers you are using, etc.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The second type of information is individually identifiable information (“<strong>Personal Information”). This information may identify an individual or may be of a private and/or sensitive nature</strong>.
Users of the Site automatically provide their IP address mainly for enhancing the User’s experience and for geolocation and security purposes as further detailed below.<br></p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Users who are only interested in viewing our Site and/or downloading Contributions and/or downloading Premium Content from our Site are not required to provide additional Personal Information (except for downloading Contributions and/or downloading Premium Content from a Restricted Repository which requires opening an Account, as detailed below).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>However, Users who wish to receive additional services such as the ability to upload Contributions must open an Account and provide voluntarily the following information via the registration form available on the Site: full name, e-mail address and password. In addition, a User can optionally provide his/her social platforms profiles, place of work, membership in organizations and location. Alternatively, Users can open an Account and signup to our Site via the Users existing third party social network account, for example Twitter, Github, Google, Bitbucket accounts ("<strong>Social Network Account</strong>"). In the event that a User registers to the Site through his/her existing Social Network Account, then such Social Network Account provides us, by default, with certain information about such User as is stored in his/her Social Network Account. For example, the User’s full name, profile picture, gender, e-mail address and any other information which the User made public, is automatically provided to us when opening an Account is conducted via the User’s Social Network Account. Nevertheless, we DO NOT keep all of this information. We only store in our databases the following: name and e-mail address and OAuth token. All other User information provided via the Social Network Account is promptly deleted.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A User who has opened an Account may also voluntarily provide the Company with additional information, such as his/her GPG key pair.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Furthermore, in the event that you would like to receive Premium Services, then you will be required to register for our Premium Services. During such registration process you will be required to use certain online payment methods which will require you to provide to such online payment service providers certain Personal Information (such as, a credit card number and other related billing information) (see section 7 below regarding the payment method). <br>
<br>
For avoidance of doubt, any Non-Personal Information connected or linked to any Personal Information shall be deemed as Personal Information as long as such connection or linkage exists.<br>
<br>
<strong>We do not collect any Personal Information from you or related to you without your approval, which is obtained, inter alia, through your acceptance to the TOS and this Privacy Policy.</strong><br>
