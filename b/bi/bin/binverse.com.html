                    many visitors to our site are concerned about how we treat any information that

                    (the "Site"), why we gather customer information, what we use the information for,
                    under what circumstances we may disclose such information, and how you can instruct
                    us to limit the use of that information. We may update our Privacy Policy from time
                    to time, so you should review it periodically.

                    To use Binverse’s services, you must register as a user of the site. During the
                    registration process we require you to provide us with information that personally
                    identifies you, such as your name, address, telephone number, e-mail address and
                    an account password. This information is collectively referred to as “personal information”.
                    We also ask that you provide us with credit card or other payment account information
                    (“payment information”) which we maintain in encrypted form on secure servers.

                    Additionally, we automatically receive and record information on our server logs

                Binverse processes personal information and/or payment information only for the
                purposes for which it was collected and in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
                We review our data collection, storage and processing practices to ensure that we

                <p class="text_box">
                    A “cookie” is a small file stored on your hard drive containing information about
                    you. Binverse, like many other companies, uses cookies to collect information
                    <br>

                    <br>
                    Binverse uses cookies to uniquely identify your browser, store your preferences
                    and “remember” you. Cookies can also help Binverse see which areas of the site are
                    popular and which are not, allowing Binverse to improve and update the site based
                    on data such as total number of visitors and pages viewed.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    We do not store any personal information or payment information in cookies.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Most web browsers automatically accept cookies but allow you to instruct your browser
                    to prevent the use of cookies. (The “Help” portion of the toolbar on most browsers
                    will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting cookies, how to have the
                    browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether).
                    If you disable cookies, you may still use our site, but certain aspects of the experience
                    may be impacted.

                    Examples include sending postal mail and e-mail, and processing credit card payments.
                    These third parties have access to information needed to perform their functions,
                    but may not use it for other purposes. We may terminate our relationship or take
                    other appropriate action if we determine they are using information improperly.

                    Binverse restricts access to personal information and payment information to its
                    employees, contractors and agents who need to know that information to operate,
                    develop or improve our services. These parties are bound by confidentiality obligations

                    if they fail to meet those obligations.
