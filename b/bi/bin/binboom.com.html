                <strong><u>Use of cookies</u></strong><br>
                <br>
                'Binary Boom' may use cookies to personalize or enhance your user experience. A cookie is a small text file that is placed on your hard disk by a Web page server to identify that specific user the next time he or she visits the website.

                <br>
                <br>
                One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to save you time. For example, if you personalize a web page, or navigate within a site, a cookie helps the site to recall your specific information on subsequent visits. Hence, this simplifies the process of delivering relevant content and eases site navigation by providing and saving your preferences and login information as well as providing personalized functionality.
                <br>
                <br>

                <br>
                This Site may contain electronic images known as "Web Beacons" (also called single-pixel gifs) that allow the owners and publishers of the Site to count users who have visited those pages and to deliver similar services.

                Some Web Beacons may be placed by third party service providers to help us determine the effectiveness of our advertising campaigns or e-mail communications. These Web Beacons may be used by these service providers to place a persistent cookie on your computer, for the benefit of 'Binary Boom'.
