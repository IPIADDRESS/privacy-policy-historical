		  </p><h1><a name="privacy"></a>Privacy Policy</h1>
			<p>
		  Bin Weevils is the place in cyberspace where kids can play games, enter competitions, win prizes, chat to friends and watch favourite cartoons. Bin Weevils believes in the power of kids 
            and we urge both them and their parents to use and enjoy our Site. 
            Whilst we encourage the interactive nature of online media, we strive 
            to educate parents and kids about how to appropriately safeguard their 
            privacy when travelling on the web. Our information collection practices 
            are described below. We urge kids to check with their parents before 
            entering any information on any website and we urge parents to discuss 
            with their kids restrictions regarding the online release of personal 
            information to anyone they don't know. </p>
            <p>What Information Is Collected?</p>
          <p>At Bin Weevils Limited, it is our 
            policy to create website content which requires minimum collection 
            of information from our visitors. Generally, Bin Weevils limits 
            collection of information to what is known as non-personally identifiable 
            information (e.g. first name, age,  gender, city or town). 
            This information is collected so kids can participate in activities 
            without giving out unnecessary personal information. Where we need 
            extra information, e.g. kids/'parents' email addresses, telephone 
            numbers (as explained below) to run competitions or to offer extra 
            on-line activities, we let kids know the reason for which we are collecting 
            the information and what we will do with it. We do not as a condition 
            to a kid's participation in any of our on-line activity require the 
            disclosure of more information than is reasonably necessary. </p>
          <p>The data controller for the 
            purposes of UK data protection legislation is Bin Weevils Limited (“we” 
            or “us” or “our”). The ways we collect user’s 
            (“you” or “your” or “user”) personal 
            information and how we use it on the Site are as follows:</p>
          <p>1. Registration </p>
          <p>The main way we collect personally 
            identifiable information is through our registration process. In order 
            to take part in our registered member activities, we only ask kids to submit 
            their age and email address. If the child is under 12, then we also ask for their parents/guardians email so we can also send them a confirmation email. We ask each kid if they wish to opt-in to receiving emails 
            from us as part of our activities for registered members e.g. our 
            newsletter. We remind them to ask a parent/guardian for permission 
            first. The information is used to allow kids to take part in registered 
            member activities such as message boards, newsletters, any special 
            member competitions and send e-cards. Registered kids can unsubscribe 
            at any time. To unsubscribe, please contact us at the following email 
            address: help@binweevils.com. </p>
          <p>All such personal information 
            collected during the registration process is used only for the purpose 
            of providing kids with access to our registered member activities. 
            It is not currently our policy to use such information for general 
            marketing purposes or to share such information with third parties 
            (except in relation to competitions as set out below or where we are 
            required to do so by law or in the context of a business transfer). 
            Should our policy on this change, we will let you know and give you 
            the choice to be included. </p>
          <p>We do not obtain or require 
            disclosure of sensitive personal data (such as ethnic origin or religion) 
            but if you choose to provide us with such sensitive personal data, 
            we may assume such sensitive personal data is provided with your express 
            consent for processing by us for the purposes for which such personal 
            data was provided by you unless otherwise notified by you to us in 
            writing at the following email address: help@binweevils.com . </p>
          <p>2. Competitions</p>
          <p>We offer the opportunity for 
            all kids to enter competitions on-line. In order to run competitions 
            and send out prizes, it is necessary to collect some personally identifiable 
            information from kids. This can include name, address and telephone 
            number. As a matter of policy, we keep such information only for the 
            purposes of administering the competition and do not disclose such 
            information to third parties except where necessary to fulfill the 
            prizes (e.g. it may be shared with fulfillment houses for processing 
            purposes). We may from time to time offer competitions sponsored by 
            third party businesses and may share entrant information with such 
            businesses in order to fulfill the competition only. We will provide 
            potential entrants with the opportunity to opt-in to such third party 
            sponsored competitions. Once a competition is finished, we will delete 
            any personal information collected via on-line entry forms from our 
            systems and it is not kept for any longer than is necessary. </p>
          <p><br>
            3. Electronic Cards </p>
          <p>We may give kids the option 
            to send "electronic card " to their friends. We do not 
            collect our visitors' full names, but we do collect email addresses 
            during this process in order to inform the user that their e-card 
            has been read. We also ask users to submit their friends' email addresses 
            so we can send them these e-cards. We think it would be disproportionate 
            to inform user’s friend(s) about our privacy policy and how 
            we will be using their personal data beforehand because it would spoil 
            the surprise of receiving the friend’s electronic card. 
            However, we can reassure users that this data is not transferred to 
            a third party or used for marketing purposes and it is not kept for 
            any longer than is necessary. </p>
          <p>4. Feedback</p>
          <p>We provide kids with the opportunity 
            to email us with their opinions and comments. We request no personally 
            identifiable information unless the kid indicates that he or she wants 
            us to reply. In these circumstances, we ask for a first name and email 
            address. This information is used solely by us in order to give requested 
            feedback and is then deleted from our system periodically. </p>
          <p>5. Cookies and Log Data</p>
          <p>Cookies are information files

            information about the number of visits to different pages on our Site. 
            We use this information only for improving our Site. We do not link 
            the "log data" collected to personally identifiable information

            of personal data to us through use of this Site is understood by us 
            to constitute consent to such transfer unless you inform us of your 
            wish not to transfer your personal data in this manner at the following 
            email address: help@binweevils.com .</p>
          <p>7. Monitoring of Communications</p>
          <p>We may record or monitor your 
            telephone conversations and email correspondence with our staff for 
            security, compliance with the law, training purposes and to maintain 
            and improve the quality of our services.</p>
          <p>8. Security</p>
          <p>We have taken steps to ensure 
            that all personally identifiable information that we collect is secure, 
            including limiting the number of people who have physical access to

          <p>We provide a "bumper page"

            know they are going to an advertiser's site and reminds them not to 
            give out information online without getting permission from their 
            parents. Kids and their parents should be aware that other sites have 
            different policies on collection of information to us, so it is important 
            to check their Privacy Policies before submitting any personally identifiable 
            information. </p>
