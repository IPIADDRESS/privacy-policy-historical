<!-- ngIf: meta.metaDescription --><meta ng-if="meta.metaDescription" name="description" content="Welcome to Biography, a Website operated by Say Media,
Inc. (“Say Media”) on behalf of its client A+E
Television Networks, LLC (“A+E”). This privacy policy covers how Say Media
collects and uses information on the Site.Say Media, Inc. (“Say Media,” “we” or “us”) knows that you care how information about you is used and shared. This Privacy Policy (the “Policy”) explains how information that directly identifies you (“personal information”) is collected, used and disclosed by Say Media in connection with our website at www.saymedia.com (the “Site”) and at third party websites and mobile services powered by Say Media (“Network Websites”). This Policy also explains how Say Media collects and uses information received in connection with third party advertisements placed by Say Media on the Network Websites and on third party websites as part of the Say Media Ad Platform Online Program (the “Program”) (the Network Websites and Program are collectively referred to as the “Say Media Services”). The Policy also may describe some of our practices for information that we collect or obtain that does not directly identify you. While this information is not personal information under this Policy, we may choose to treat as personal information in our sole discretion. By visiting or providing information through the Site or Network Websites, you signify that you have read, understood and agree to the collection, storage, use and disclosure of your personal information as described in this Policy.1. Information We Collect, and How We Collect ItWe collect information and personal information in connection with your visits to and use of the Site and Network Websites. This collection includes information that you provide in connection with the Site and Network Websites, information we receive from third parties, and information that is collected automatically such as through the use of cookies and other technologies. We also collect information in connection with your visits to websites that use the Program, which is typically collected automatically such as through the use of cookies and other technologies.Information That You ProvideWe collect information and personal information that you provide in connection with the Site and Network Websites. The categories of information we collect can include:Registration information. We collect personal information that you provide when you register on a Site or Network Website, such as for a subscription or membership. If you use a social media or other third party service account to register, this information may include your name, user ID, profile picture, and other profile information that the social media account or third party service shares with us. If you do not use a social media or other third party service account to register, and you register directly with the Site or Network Website, we may collect information such as your name, username, email address, password, and other information you provide.Paid subscriptions and memberships. If you sign up for a paid subscription or membership, we and/or our service providers may collect your payment information.Mailing List Information. We will collect your email address if you provide it through a Site or Network Website, such as to receive newsletters, updates, or promotions.Inquiries and Feedback. If you contact us, we will collect the information that you provide us, such as your contact information and the contents of your communication with us.You generally are not able to provide personal information to us in connection with the Program, though some information may be automatically collected from you, including as described below in this Policy. Occasionally, ads we transmit in the Program may offer the ability to interact, including by playing a game or viewing a video. The ads may also give you the opportunity to provide the advertiser with information about yourself. This may be done directly by the advertiser, but in some instances if you choose to interact with an advertisement or provide an advertiser with information about yourself, Say Media may collect information on behalf of the advertiser. In that case, the advertiser's privacy policy (and not this Policy) applies to the data collected.Information from Third PartiesWe also collect and receive information about you from third parties, including the following:Information we receive from social networking sites. When you interact with the Site or Network Websites through social media websites and services like Facebook, such as when you login to the Site or Network Websites using your social media credentials, share content from the Site or Network Websites with your social media accounts, use plugins or widgets we may receive information from those websites and services. The information we receive may include your public profile information, profile picture, user name, user ID associated with your social media account, email address, and any other information you permit the social media website or service to share with us or third parties generally. The data we receive may depend upon your privacy settings with the social media website or service, though we do not control those settings or promise they will be effective. You should always review and customize your privacy settings with social media websites and services before linking or connecting them to our Site or the Network Websites.Information we receive from third parties. We may receive information about you from third parties like Krux (www.krux.com) and other companies like ad networks, data brokers, and others that sell or license data about people. This information may include demographic data (age range, gender, etc.), interests (e.g. shopping categories or topics of interest), ZIP Code or other similar location level data, IP addresses or unique device identifiers, and other information that they make available. We may also collect information about you from public records or that is otherwise publicly available.Information That Is Automatically Collected (Cookies and Other Technologies)We also automatically collect information about you and any computer or device you use to access the Site, Network Websites, or websites that use the Program. Some of the information we collect, and ways we collect it, on the Site, Network Websites, and websites that use the Program include:Cookies. We may send one or more cookies — small text files containing a string of alphanumeric characters — to your computer or device that allows us to uniquely identify your browser, computer, or device. A cookie may also convey other information to us, such as your Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, unique device identifiers, your browser settings and specifications, and information about how you use the Site, Network Websites, or websites that use the Program (e.g., the pages you view, the links you click, how frequently you access it, and other actions you take on it). Cookies also allow us to track your usage of the Site, Network Websites, and websites that use the Program over time.Scripts. We may use scripts—short segments of computer code included in a web page or other content that can be used to set and access a cookie on your computer and to record your activity on a website.Log Files.

A unique identifier may be data stored in connection with the device hardware, data stored in connection with the device's operating system or other software, or data sent to the device by Say Media. A unique identifier may convey information to us about how you browse the Site, Network Websites, or websites that use the Program. A unique identifier may remain persistently on your device, and some features of the Say Media Services may not function properly if use or availability of unique identifiers or location data are impaired or disabled.When you visit third party sites that use the Program, those third parties or other third parties may automatically collect information about you and any computer or device you use to access such sites, and this Policy does not describe the information collection or use practices that occur on those sites (other than our practices with respect to the Program).2.

Inc. (<strong>“Say Media”</strong>) on behalf of its client A+E
Television Networks, LLC (<strong>“A+E”</strong>). This privacy policy covers how Say Media
collects and uses information on the Site.</p><p>Say Media, Inc. (<strong>“Say Media,” “we”</strong> or <strong>“us”</strong>) knows that you care how information about you is used and shared. This Privacy Policy (the <strong>“Policy”</strong>) explains how information that directly identifies you (<strong>“personal information”</strong>) is collected, used and disclosed by Say Media in connection with our website at www.saymedia.com (the <strong>“Site”</strong>) and at third party websites and mobile services powered by Say Media (<strong>“Network Websites”</strong>). This Policy also explains how Say Media collects and uses information received in connection with third party advertisements placed by Say Media on the Network Websites and on third party websites as part of the Say Media Ad Platform Online Program (the <strong>“Program”</strong>) (the Network Websites and Program are collectively referred to as the <strong>“Say Media Services”</strong>). The Policy also may describe some of our practices for information that we collect or obtain that does not directly identify you. While this information is not personal information under this Policy, we may choose to treat as personal information in our sole discretion. By visiting or providing information through the Site or Network Websites, you signify that you have read, understood and agree to the collection, storage, use and disclosure of your personal information as described in this Policy.</p><h2><strong>1. Information We Collect, and How We Collect It</strong></h2><p>We collect information and personal information in connection with your visits to and use of the Site and Network Websites. This collection includes information that you provide in connection with the Site and Network Websites, information we receive from third parties, and information that is collected automatically such as through the use of cookies and other technologies. We also collect information in connection with your visits to websites that use the Program, which is typically collected automatically such as through the use of cookies and other technologies.</p><h3><strong>Information That You Provide</strong></h3><p>We collect information and personal information that you provide in connection with the Site and Network Websites. The categories of information we collect can include:</p><ul><li><strong></strong><strong>Registration information.</strong> We collect personal information that you provide when you register on a Site or Network Website, such as for a subscription or membership. If you use a social media or other third party service account to register, this information may include your name, user ID, profile picture, and other profile information that the social media account or third party service shares with us. If you do not use a social media or other third party service account to register, and you register directly with the Site or Network Website, we may collect information such as your name, username, email address, password, and other information you provide.</li><li><strong>Paid subscriptions and memberships.</strong> If you sign up for a paid subscription or membership, we and/or our service providers may collect your payment information.</li><li><strong>Mailing List Information.</strong> We will collect your email address if you provide it through a Site or Network Website, such as to receive newsletters, updates, or promotions.</li><li><strong>Inquiries and Feedback.</strong> If you contact us, we will collect the information that you provide us, such as your contact information and the contents of your communication with us.</li></ul><p>You generally are not able to provide personal information to us in connection with the Program, though some information may be automatically collected from you, including as described below in this Policy. Occasionally, ads we transmit in the Program may offer the ability to interact, including by playing a game or viewing a video. The ads may also give you the opportunity to provide the advertiser with information about yourself. This may be done directly by the advertiser, but in some instances if you choose to interact with an advertisement or provide an advertiser with information about yourself, Say Media may collect information on behalf of the advertiser. In that case, the advertiser's privacy policy (and not this Policy) applies to the data collected.</p><h3><strong>Information from Third Parties</strong></h3><p>We also collect and receive information about you from third parties, including the following:</p><ul><li><strong>Information we receive from social networking sites.</strong> When you interact with the Site or Network Websites through social media websites and services like Facebook, such as when you login to the Site or Network Websites using your social media credentials, share content from the Site or Network Websites with your social media accounts, use plugins or widgets we may receive information from those websites and services. The information we receive may include your public profile information, profile picture, user name, user ID associated with your social media account, email address, and any other information you permit the social media website or service to share with us or third parties generally. The data we receive may depend upon your privacy settings with the social media website or service, though we do not control those settings or promise they will be effective. You should always review and customize your privacy settings with social media websites and services before linking or connecting them to our Site or the Network Websites.</li><li><strong>Information we receive from third parties.</strong> We may receive information about you from third parties like Krux (www.krux.com) and other companies like ad networks, data brokers, and others that sell or license data about people. This information may include demographic data (age range, gender, etc.), interests (e.g. shopping categories or topics of interest), ZIP Code or other similar location level data, IP addresses or unique device identifiers, and other information that they make available. We may also collect information about you from public records or that is otherwise publicly available.</li></ul><h3><strong>Information That Is Automatically Collected (Cookies and Other Technologies)</strong></h3><p>We also automatically collect information about you and any computer or device you use to access the Site, Network Websites, or websites that use the Program. Some of the information we collect, and ways we collect it, on the Site, Network Websites, and websites that use the Program include:</p><ul><li><strong>Cookies.</strong> We may send one or more cookies — small text files containing a string of alphanumeric characters — to your computer or device that allows us to uniquely identify your browser, computer, or device. A cookie may also convey other information to us, such as your Internet Protocol (<strong>“IP”</strong>) address, unique device identifiers, your browser settings and specifications, and information about how you use the Site, Network Websites, or websites that use the Program (e.g., the pages you view, the links you click, how frequently you access it, and other actions you take on it). Cookies also allow us to track your usage of the Site, Network Websites, and websites that use the Program over time.</li><li><strong>Scripts.</strong> We may use scripts—short segments of computer code included in a web page or other content that can be used to set and access a cookie on your computer and to record your activity on a website.</li><li><strong>Log Files.</strong> We may record log file information which may include information such as your web request, IP address, browser type, unique device identifiers, information about your device, referring / exit pages and URLs, number of clicks and how you interact with links, domain names, landing pages, pages viewed, and other such information.</li><li><strong>Clear GIFs and Click-Stream Data.</strong> We may employ clear GIFs (also known as web beacons or pixel tags) which may collect information about you, your computer or device such as your web request, IP address, unique device identifiers, browser type, information about your device, pages viewed, and information about cookies, all of which can show your usage patterns for the Site, Network Websites, and websites that use the Program. We also use clear GIFs in conjunction with cookies to collect click-stream data which allows us to understand how visitors move from page to page within websites.</li><li><strong>Mobile Device Information, Identifiers and Location Data.</strong> When you use a mobile device, we may collect and store a unique identifier associated with your device (including, for example, a UDID, Unique ID for Advertisers (<strong>“IDFA”</strong>), Google Ad ID, or Windows Advertising ID), mobile carrier, device type, model and manufacturer, mobile device operating system brand and model, phone number, and, depending on your mobile device settings, your geographical location data, including GPS coordinates (e.g. latitude and/or longitude) or similar information regarding the location of your mobile device.
