                    <h5 class="heading">Information You Provide to Us</h5>
                    <p>We receive and store any information you enter on the Sites or through the Services or provide to us in 
                        any other way. You can choose not to provide us with certain information, but then you may not be able to 
                        take advantage of many of our features.  The personal information you provide is used for such purposes as 
                        responding to your requests for certain services, customizing the advertising and content you see, 
                        communicating with you about our products, and marketing our Services and those of our partners to you.</p>
                    <p>In order for you to use all of our features, you must register with BDS.  We require your name, e-mail 
                        address and certain demographic information, such as location, during the registration process.  
                        We may also request optional demographic information and unique identifiers to provide you with a more 
                        personalized service. You may also provide personal information to us when you create public bookmarks 
                        or take quizzes on the Sites or using the Services. We store individual users' quiz results as well as 
                        aggregate results to compare our users' performance over time and with each other.</p>
                    <p>You may register for the Sites and the Services through a third-party service (e.g., Facebook or 
                        Twitter), in which case the third-party service through which you register will state the access we have 
                        to your personal information.</p>
                    <p>Further information may be required if you choose to purchase paid components of the Services, such as 
                        a physical address, order information, and billing information. BDS uses a third party partner, Braintree, 
                        for credit card processing, who may require and store your credit card and billing information. 
                        You can find <a href="https://www.braintreepayments.com/privacy">Braintree's privacy policy here</a>. We do not store your credit card information on the Sites 
                        but we may receive and store information from Braintree regarding a portion of your credit card number 
                        and other identifiers to identify your transaction through Braintree.</p>

                    <h5 class="heading">Automatic Information</h5>
                    <p>We receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact with us.  BDS automatically receives 
                        and records "traffic data" on our server logs from your browser including your IP address, date and time of your 
                        visits to our Sites, your geographic location, BDS cookie information, and pages you request.  BDS uses this traffic 
                        data to analyze trends and administer the Sites.  Our service automatically collects usage information, such as the 
                        numbers and frequency of visitors to our Sites and their components.  This data is only used in the aggregate.  
                        This type of collective data enables us to figure out how often users use different parts of the Sites and Services.  
                        In addition, we may provide statistical collective user information, not information about you personally, to our 
                        partners so that they understand how often people use specific components of our Sites and Services.</p>

                        you provide us in your message to respond to you. We may receive a confirmation when you open an e-mail from BDS.</p>
                    <p>We may also send e-mails with news,promotions, service updates, or customer service communications.  
                        If you do not want to receive e-mail from us, please contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@biodigital.com?subject=BioDigital Human Stop Emails&amp;">support@biodigital.com</a>. If you do not 
                        want to receive legal notices from us, such as this Privacy Policy, those legal notices will still govern your use 
                        of the Sites and Services.</p>
                    <p>If your organization has an enterprise account with BDS, we will communicate with your designated 
                        contact person through e-mail or phone calls.</p>

                    <h5 class="heading">Information From Other Sources</h5>
                    <p>To improve our Services, we may receive information about you from other sources and add it to our account information.

                    <p>Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer's hard drive through your Web browser to 
                        enable our systems to recognize your browser and tell us how and when pages in our Sites are visited and by how many 
                        people.  BDS cookies do not collect personal information, and we do not combine information collected through cookies 
                        with other personal information to tell us who you are or what your name or e-mail address is.</p>
                    <p>Most browsers allow you to prevent the browser from accepting new cookies, to be notified when you receive a new cookie, 
                        or to disable cookies. If you disable cookies, you may not be able to take advantage of some of BDS's features. Some of our 
                        business partners may use cookies on our Sites.  However, we have no access to or control over these cookies.</p>

                            <li><strong>Affiliated Businesses We Do Not Control</strong>
                                <p>BDS may provide services or sell products jointly with affiliated businesses.  
                                    We will share customer information that is related to such transactions with those 
                                    affiliated businesses. We require our affiliates to provide the same level of privacy protection 
                                    that we do and they do not have the right to share or use personal information for any purpose 
                                    other than for an authorized transaction. BDS may share aggregated demographic information 
                                    with business partners.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Agents</strong>
                                <p>We employ other companies and people to perform tasks on our behalf and need to share your information with them to provide products and services. Examples include billing, processing payments, providing marketing assistance, and providing customer service.  Our agents subscribe to the same level of privacy protection as we do. Unless we tell you differently, BDS's agents do not have any right to use the personal information we share with them beyond what is necessary to assist us.</p>
                                <p>Financial and billing information collected through the Sites and Services is used solely 
                                    to check the qualifications of prospective partners and customers and to bill for the Services. 
                                    BDS may transmit this information to independent contractors who are bound to us by written 
                                    confidentiality agreements. This billing information is not used by BDS for marketing or 
                                    promotional purposes. BDS uses a third-party intermediary to manage credit card processing 
                                    who may store, retain, and use the information provided solely for the purpose of credit card 
                                    processing.</p>
                            </li>

                                <p>We may send offers to certain users on behalf of other businesses or provide our partners with the opportunity to notify users directly of promotions.  
                                    If you do not wish to receive these offers, please e-mail us at <a href="mailto:privacy@biodigital.com?subject=BioDigital Human Stop Emails&amp;">support@biodigital.com</a></p>

                            <li><strong>Information You Post</strong>
                                <p>When you post information on the Sites or through the Services, your username and certain profile information are visible to other users.  
                                    BDS or other parties may use information posted by you, along with your profile information, in any medium now existing or 
                                    developed in the future. BDS will use commercially reasonable efforts to attempt to notify you before using information posted 
                                    by you along with your profile in other media.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Business Transfers</strong>
                                <p>In some cases, we may choose to buy or sell assets.  In these types of transactions, user information is typically one of the business assets that 
                                    is transferred. Moreover, if BDS, or substantially all of its assets, were acquired, or in the unlikely event that BDS 
                                    goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is reviewed and transferred 
                                    or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of BDS may continue 
                                    to use your personal information as set forth in this policy.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Protection of BDS and Others</strong>
                                <p>We may release personal information when we in our sole discretion believe in good faith that release is 
                                    necessary or appropriate to comply with the law, enforce or apply our conditions of use and other agreements, 
                                    or protect the rights, property, or safety of BDS, our employees, our users, or others.</p>

                            <li><strong>With Your Consent</strong>
                                <p>Except as set forth above, you will be notified when your personal information may be shared with third parties.</p>
