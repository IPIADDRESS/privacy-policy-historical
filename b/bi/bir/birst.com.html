  </strong>Success Metrics Inc. is committed to customer
    privacy. This Privacy Policy communicates our customer information gathering
    and dissemination practices. We reserve the right to change our Privacy Policy
    at any time and will provide notification of changes by posting the revised

  <p><span class="subheaders">When Information Is Collected: </span><strong><br>
  </strong>We require customers who
    register to use the online service offered on our website (the "Online
    Service") to give us contact information,
    such as their name, company name (if applicable), address, phone number,
    and e-mail address. For those using our paid services, we will also require
    the customer's financial qualification and billing information, such as billing
    name and address, credit card number, and the number of users that will be
    using the Online Service. Separately, customers are also asked to provide
    an email address when registering for the Online Service, in order to receive
    a username and password. At the time you express interest in attaining additional
    information, or when you register for the Online Service, we may also ask
    for additional personal information, such as title, department name, or additional
    company information. Customers can opt out of providing this additional information
    by not entering it when asked. Customers can update their personal information
    at any time by logging into our website and editing their information. </p>
  <p><span class="subheaders">How the Collected Information Is Used: </span><strong><br>
  </strong>Success Metrics

    and their organizations. We may also use the information to contact customers
    to further discuss customer interest in our company, the Online Service that
    we provide, and updates and enhancements made to it, as well as to send information
    regarding our company's or our partners' offerings, such as promotions and
    events. We also use this information to administer our website, improve our
    Online Service and to communicate with our customers regarding account administration
    issues. Customer email addresses and any personal customer information will
    not be distributed or shared with third parties except for the purposes described
    above. Customers can opt out of receiving any marketing communication by
    changing their account settings, emailing us, or at the time any customer
    registers for the Online Service. All financial and billing information that
    we collect through our website is used solely to check the qualifications
    of prospective customers and to bill for the Online Service. This billing
    information is not used by Success Metrics for marketing or promotional purposes.
    Success Metrics Inc. uses a third-party intermediary to manage the credit
    card processing. This intermediary is solely a link in the distribution chain,
    and is not permitted to store, retain, or use the information provided, except
    for the sole purpose of credit card processing. Success Metrics does not
    hold or retain any of the credit card information. We may also track and
    analyze non-identifying and aggregate usage and volume statistical information
    from our visitors and customers.</p>
