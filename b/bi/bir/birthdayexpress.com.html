<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="2"><b>Online Contests and Sweepstakes -</b> Birthday Express occasionally offers parents the opportunity to enter contests and sweepstakes. Birthday Express may ask for information such as parent's name, street address, e-mail address, child's first name and birth date, and in some instances, Birthday Express may collect telephone numbers for a specific contest. Birthday Express uses this information for the purpose of conducting the contests and sweepstakes and does not (except as set forth herein) disclose such information externally to third parties. Entrants of Birthday Express contests and sweepstakes have the opportunity to opt-in (by indicating so on the entry form) to be added to our mailing list and/or e-mail list to receive catalogs and/or e-mail special announcements. The personal information collected from those entrants who have chosen to opt-in to the mailing list and/or e-mail list shall be maintained by Birthday Express. For those who elect not to opt-in, and/or entrants who have not been selected as winners, Birthday Express will delete personal information collected on the online entry forms from its system. However, personal information collected online from contest and sweepstakes winners may be maintained by Birthday Express, in accordance with the official rules of the contest or sweepstakes. Entrant's decision not to opt-in will not affect eligibility for contests and sweepstakes and will not impact your chances of winning.
