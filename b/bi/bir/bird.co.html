Rider is solely and fully responsible for the safe operation of the Vehicle at all times. Rider agrees that Vehicles are machines that may malfunction, even if the Vehicle is properly maintained, and that such malfunction may cause injury. Rider agrees that riding a Vehicle and the Services involve many obvious and not-so-obvious risks, dangers, and hazards, which may result in injury or death to Rider or others, as well as damage to property, and that such risks, dangers, and hazards cannot always be predicted or avoided. Rider agrees that such risks, dangers, and hazards are Rider\u2019s sole responsibility, including, but not limited to, choosing whether to wear a Vehicle helmet as required by law or utilize other protective gear. Rider agrees that if Rider\u2019s use of any of the Services causes any injury or damage to another person or property, then Rider may be liable for all resulting injuries, damages, and related costs. By choosing to ride a Vehicle, Rider assumes full and complete responsibility for all related risks, dangers, and hazards, and Rider agrees that Bird and all other Released Persons are not responsible for any injury, damage, or cost caused by Rider with respect to any person or property, including the Vehicle itself.\u003c\/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align: left;\" class=\"s-text-color-gray\"\u003e\u00a0\u003c\/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align: left;\" class=\"s-text-color-gray\"\u003e3.5 Indemnification. You will indemnify and hold the Released Persons harmless from all losses, suits, claims or other proceedings arising out of or relating to Your use of Vehicles and any breach of the terms of this Agreement; provided, however, that Released Persons must notify You as soon as practicable after the date notice of such loss, suit, claim or other proceeding is served on Released Persons directly (as opposed to service on a statutory agent for service of process) or otherwise brought to the attention of Released Persons.\u003c\/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align: left;\" class=\"s-text-color-gray\"\u003e\u00a0\u003c\/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align: left;\" class=\"s-text-color-gray\"\u003e4 Additional Terms of Use.\u003c\/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align: left;\" class=\"s-text-color-gray\"\u003e\u00a0\u003c\/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align: left;\" class=\"s-text-color-gray\"\u003e4.1 Safety Check. Before each use of a Vehicle, Rider shall conduct a basic safety inspection of the Vehicle, which includes inspecting the following: (i) trueness of the wheels; (ii) safe operation of all brakes and lights; (iv) good condition of the frame; (v) sufficient battery charge power; and (vi) any sign of damage, unusual or excessive wear, or other mechanical problem or maintenance need. Rider agrees not to ride the Vehicle if there are any noticeable issues, and to immediately notify customer service to alert Bird of any problems.\u003c\/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align: left;\" class=\"s-text-color-gray\"\u003e\u00a0\u003c\/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align: left;\" class=\"s-text-color-gray\"\u003e4.2 Lost or Stolen Vehicle. A Vehicle may be deemed lost or stolen if (a) Vehicle is not returned within 24 consecutive hours, (b) Vehicle\u2019s GPS unit is disabled, (c) Vehicle is parked on private property, in a locked area, or in any other non-public space for more than ten minutes after a ride ends, (d) Vehicle moves more than thirty feet after a rental has ended and Bird believes such movement was not caused by another Rider or authorized third party, or (d) other facts and circumstances that suggest to Bird in its reasonable, good faith determination that a Vehicle has been lost or stolen. Bird and You agree that the last Rider of a Vehicle shall be responsible for a lost or stolen Vehicle unless facts and circumstances suggest otherwise to Bird in its reasonable, good faith determination. If Bird deems a Vehicle lost or stolen, Bird shall have the authority to take any and all actions it deems appropriate (with respect to the last Rider of a Vehicle or otherwise), including (without limitation) obtaining restitution and other appropriate compensation and damages and filing a police report with local authorities. The data generated by the Service\u2019s computer is conclusive evidence of the period of use of a Vehicle by a Rider. Rider must report Vehicle disappearance or theft to Bird immediately or as soon as possible.\u003c\/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align: left;\" class=\"s-text-color-gray\"\u003e\u00a0\u003c\/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align: left;\" class=\"s-text-color-gray\"\u003e4.3 Helmets; Safety. Bird recommends that all Riders wear a Snell, CPSC, ANSI or ASTM approved helmet that has been properly sized, fitted and fastened according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Rider agrees that none of Bird and its Released Parties are liable for any injury suffered by Rider while using the Service, whether or not Rider is wearing a helmet at the time of injury. Rider may need to take additional safety measures or precautions not specifically addressed in this Agreement.\u003c\/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align: left;\" class=\"s-text-color-gray\"\u003e\u00a0\u003c\/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align: left;\" class=\"s-text-color-gray\"\u003e4.4 Vehicle Routes. Rider agrees that Bird does not provide or maintain places to ride Vehicles, and that Bird does not guarantee that there will always be a safe place to ride a Vehicle. Roads, sidewalks, Vehicle lanes, and Vehicle routes may become dangerous due to weather, traffic, or other hazards.\u003c\/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align: left;\" class=\"s-text-color-gray\"\u003e\u00a0\u003c\/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align: left;\" class=\"s-text-color-gray\"\u003e4.5 Limitations on Vehicle Rental. Rider agrees that Bird is not a common carrier. Alternative means of public and private transportation are available to the general public and to Rider individually, including public buses and rail service, taxis, and pedestrian paths. Bird provides Vehicles only as a convenience, and such rental availability is intended to be used only by those persons who are able and qualified to operate a Vehicle on their own and who have agreed to all terms and conditions of this Agreement.\u003c\/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align: left;\" class=\"s-text-color-gray\"\u003e\u00a0\u003c\/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align: left;\" class=\"s-text-color-gray\"\u003e4.6 Limitations on Availability of Service. Bird makes every effort to provide the Service 365 days per year, but does not guarantee that the Service will be available at all times, as force majeure events or other circumstances might prevent Bird from providing the Service. Access to the Service is also conditioned on the availability of Vehicles. Bird does not represent or warrant the availability of any Service or the availability of any Vehicle at any time. Rider agrees that Bird may require Rider to return a Vehicle at any time.\u003c\/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align: left;\" class=\"s-text-color-gray\"\u003e\u00a0\u003c\/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align: left;\" class=\"s-text-color-gray\"\u003e5 Term and Termination.\u003c\/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align: left;\" class=\"s-text-color-gray\"\u003e\u00a0\u003c\/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align: left;\" class=\"s-text-color-gray\"\u003e5.1 Term.

Rider may terminate Rider\u2019s use of the Service at any time; provided, however, that (i) no refund will be provided by Bird, (ii) the term of this Agreement continues in accordance with this Agreement, (iii) Rider may still be charged any applicable additional fees in accordance with this Agreement.
