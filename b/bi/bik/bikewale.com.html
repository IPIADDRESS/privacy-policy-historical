		<p>
		When you use our Site, we collect and store your personal information provided by you. Our primary goal in doing so is to provide a safe, 
		efficient, smooth and customized experience. This allows us to provide services and features that most likely meet your needs, and to customize 
		our Site to make your experience safer and easier. Importantly, we only collect personal information about you that we consider necessary for

		and promote trust and safety. "Cookies" are small files placed on your hard drive that assist us in providing our services. We offer certain 
		features that are only available through the use of a "cookie". We also use cookies to allow you to enter your password less frequently during 
		a session. Cookies can also help us provide information that is targeted to your interests. Most cookies are "session cookies," meaning that they 
		are automatically deleted from your hard drive at the end of a session. You are always free to decline our cookies if your browser permits, 
		although in that case you may not be able to use certain features on the Site and you may be required to reenter your password more frequently 
		during a session.<br>

		<p>
		We may also use your information to deliver information to you that, in some cases, are targeted to your interests, such as new services and 
		promotions. The following are examples of some categories of persons to whom we would share your information with from time-to-time.

				The information is used by bikewale.com in accordance with the terms of this  Privacy  Policy and is used by the advertiser as per the advertisers 
				prevalent privacy policies. Because we do not control the privacy practices of these advertisers, you should evaluate their practices before 
				deciding to provide the said information.
			</p>
			<p>
				b. bikewale.com may also aggregate (gather up data across all user accounts) personally identifiable information and disclose such information 
				in a non-personally identifiable manner to advertisers and other third parties for other marketing and promotional purposes.
			</p>
		</blockquote>
		<br>
		<p>2. Classifieds Listings</p>

				interested user will be provided the contact information of the user listing the advertisement as provided in that user's registration form.
			</p>

				b. When a user expresses an interest in a classifieds advertisement, the user who has listed the advertisement will be provided the contact 
				information of the interested user as provided in the interested user's registration form.
			</p>
		</blockquote>
		<br>
		<p>
			3. Bikes and Services offered on the Site are by third parties<br>
			There are certain bikes and services for which third parties request for information before the service is listed on the Site (example: application 
			for bike loan). The information provided by the user for such purposes is simultaneously collected by bikewale.com and the respective third party. 
			This information is utilised by the third party in accordance with its privacy policy and the terms of the offer. Because we do not control the 
			privacy practices of these third parties, you should evaluate their practices before deciding to use their services. 
		</p>
		<br>
		<p>
			4. Internal Service Providers <br>
			We may use third parties that we refer to as internal service providers to facilitate or outsource one or more aspects of the business, 
			product and service operations that we provide to you on the Site (e.g., search technology, discussion boards, bill collection, affiliate 
			and rewards programs) and therefore we may provide some of your personal information directly to these internal service providers. These 
			internal service providers' are subject to confidentiality agreements with us and other legal restrictions that prohibit their use of the 
			information we provide them for any other purpose except to facilitate the specific outsourced Site related operation, unless you have 
			explicitly agreed or given your prior permission to them for additional uses. In some instances, the internal service provider may collect 
			information directly from you (such as for Site surveys). In these cases, you will be notified of the involvement of the internal service 
			provider, and all additional information you provide them and their additional uses will be strictly up to you. If you provide additional 
			information to an internal service provider directly, then their use of your personal information is governed by their applicable privacy policy.
		</p>
		<br>
		<p>
			5. Other Corporate Entities <br>
			We share much of our data, including personal information about you, with our parent, affiliates, subsidiaries, and joint ventures that 
			are committed to serving your online trading needs and related services, throughout the world. To the extent that these entities have 
			access to your information, they will treat it at least as protectively as they treat information they obtain from their other users. 
			Our parent, affiliates, subsidiaries, and joint ventures follow privacy practices no less protective of all users than our practices 
			described in this document, to the extent allowed by applicable law. bikewale.com, its parent, affiliates, subsidiaries, its joint ventures, 
			or any combination of such, will share some or all of your personal information with another business entity should we plan to, merge with, 
			or be acquired by that business entity. Should such a combination occur, we will require that the new combined entity follow this  Privacy  
			Policy with respect to your personal information.
		</p>
		<br>
		<p>
			6. Legal Requests <br>
			We cooperate with law enforcement inquiries, as well as other third parties to enforce laws, such as: intellectual property rights fraud and 
			other rights, to help protect you and the community from bad actors. Therefore, in response to a verified request by law enforcement or other 
			government officials relating to a criminal investigation or alleged illegal activity, we can (and you authorize us to) disclose your name, 
			city, state, telephone number, email address, User ID history, fraud complaints, and bike listing history without a subpoena or summon. Without 
			limiting the above, in an effort to respect your privacy and our ability to keep the community free from bad actors, we will not otherwise 
			disclose your personal information to law enforcement or other government officials without a subpoena, court order or substantially similar 
			legal procedure, except when we believe in good faith that the disclosure of information is necessary to prevent imminent physical harm or 
			financial loss; or report suspected illegal activity. Further, we can (and you authorize us to) disclose your name, street address, city, state, 
			zip code, country, phone number, email, and company name to  intellectual  property rights owners under confidentiality agreement, as we in our 
			sole discretion believe necessary or appropriate in connection with an investigation of fraud, intellectual property infringement, piracy, or 
			other unlawful activity. <br>
			Due to the existing regulatory environment, we cannot ensure that all of your private communications and other personal information will never be 
			disclosed in ways not otherwise described in this Privacy Policy. By way of example (without limiting the foregoing), we may be forced to disclose 
			personal information to the government or third parties under certain circumstances, third parties may unlawfully intercept or access 
			transmissions or private communications, or users may abuse or misuse your personal information that they collect from the Site. Therefore, 
			although we use industry standard practices to protect your privacy, we do not promise, and you should not expect, that your personal information 
			or private communications will always remain private.
