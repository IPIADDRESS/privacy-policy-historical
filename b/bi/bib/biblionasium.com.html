<h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
<p>BiblioNasium is a fun and engaging website to excite and encourage kids to read. On BiblioNasium, kids can connect to their friends, log their reading, and get rewards for completing challenges.  Parents and teachers can also participate, creating challenges for their kids and helping them meet their reading goals.  We take all of our users’ privacy very seriously.  Because our users are under the age of 13, we take extra precautions to keep everyone on BiblioNasium safe and protected.  Our Privacy Policy will help you understand the different measures we take to help create a safe and fun place for kids to learn and play.</p>
<p>Please read through this Privacy Policy, and take some time to talk with your child about the importance of being safe on the Internet.  We believe the Internet is a special tool that can open up a world of great opportunities for kids, but not everyone on the web has good intentions.  Remember to stay involved in your kid’s activity on BiblioNasium and any other sites they visit as they explore the World Wide Web.</p>
<h3>Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA):</h3>
<p>
The Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) is a piece of legislation passed on April 21, 2000 to help keep children safe on the Internet. In compliance with COPPA, BiblioNasium does not allow children under the age of 13 to have an account until their parent,legal guardian, or teacher creates one for them.  If you are under the age of 13, you may not sign up for BiblioNasium on your own.  A parent or legal guardian must provide a valid email and home address, and after confirming that information, we allow them to open an account for a child under the age of 13. Teachers with verified email addresses, can also register their students. Teachers however, do not enter any personal information about their students. We only request a first name and last name initial to generate unique and anonymous user ids for the students.  To find out more about COPPA, please visit
<a href="http://www.ftc.gov/privacy/coppafaqs.shtm" target="_blank">http://www.ftc.gov/privacy/coppafaqs.shtm</a>.
</p>
<h3>What kind of information we receive and how we use it</h3>
<p>In order to create a better user experience, we ask a parent to provide information such as the  child’s name, birthday, gender, grade and school. Parents are NOT required to provide this information for their child to use the site.  All information is optional. We only require a parent to select a unique userid and password for their child. Parents must provide their home address to help confirm their identity and email to receive updates pertaining to their or their kids’ accounts.  We may use the information you provide to help us continue to make the site the best it can be. Non-personal data about a child’s activity also may be stored to help enhance the site and their user experience. Once in the site, kids are not asked to provide any personal information about themselves to BiblioNasium.</p>
<p>Teachers may also signup the students in their classrooms.  Teachers only enter a first name and can choose to provide a last name or just a last name initial. We use that information to automatically generate a random and unique user id for each student.  We do not ask teachers for any personal information about a student.  That information is only obtained from a registered parent or legal guardian, and only after we have verified the account.</p>
<h3>Cookies</h3>
<p>We use cookies to help us keep track of your data.  Cookies are small files that carry non-personal information that you provide to a website.  They are like a cheat-sheet for your computer--on its own, your computer does not remember who you are as you move throughout a website.  Cookies store that information and provide it every time the information is needed.  Without cookies, you would have to sign in with your username and password every time you went to a different page of our site!</p>
<h3>IP Information</h3>
<p>When you browse onto a website, your Internet Protocol (IP) address is automatically shared with that site.  Other information such as where you arrived to the site from, what type of browser you are using, and your general region could also be shared.  Like many websites on the Internet, we keep track of this information to help us better understand how people are using BiblioNasium.</p>
<h3>How we keep your information safe:</h3>
<p>BiblioNasium has taken several measures to keep your information safe.  Our data is stored on a secure servers and we use all industry standards to protect against hacking.</p>
<h3>How we keep kid’s information safe:</h3>
<p>If a child is registered by a parent and they have provided us with any personal information about that child, then only friends and family who are approved by that parent, can see those pieces of information.  Other signed in users may be able to see their anonymous username, books, reviews, anonymous names of their friends. People who are not signed in to BiblioNasium are not able to see any user information on our site.  A verified parent must authorize all users who see any of the child's personal information through BiblioNaisum.</p>
<p>When a teacher registers a student, we only require a first name and a last name initial.  We use this information to generate a unique and anonymous userid. All students registered by a teacher and belonging to a unique classroom, are able to see only each other’s bookshelves.  If they want to recommend books or see each other’s awards, they must have their parents join the website and give specific authorization to connect them as friends.  There is no dialogue, conversation or exchange between members of a classroom.  In order to establish the connection, we require parental authorization.</p>
<p>
However, it is important to remember that any information that you put on the Internet could become public.  There is no such thing as “fail-safe” on the Internet, and we are not responsible for any 3rd party distribution of the information you provide.  Please talk to your children or students about the importance of being safe while using the Internet.  For more information about how to help kids socialize responsibly on the Internet, please visit
