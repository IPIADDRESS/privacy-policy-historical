	<h1 class="intro">Bible.is Privacy Policy</h1>
	<p>Bible.is  Limited ("Bible.is" or "we" "our" or "us") owns or controls, and provides  access to the Bible.is website, currently located at <a href="http://www.bible.is/">www.Bible.is</a> (the "Website").</p>
	<ul>
		<li>The entry of personal data  on this site is completely optional and will require you to setup an account  with a password and an email address. Please choose a password that is not easy  for someone else to guess, such as birthday, national identification number and  phone number.</li>
		<li>If you want to, you can also  submit additional personal information (including on your profile and on  message boards). Please remember that any information you submit becomes public  information that can be viewed by others.</li>
		<li>Certain third parties may  have access to your data (which may include personal information, but not your  email contact information) via our API and web services or arrangements with  our business partners. These people may use this information for their own  purposes, which may be either commercial or non-commercial in nature and may  include targeted advertising or direct marketing. These third parties may be  based in the United States or elsewhere in the world.</li>
		<li>We may use the email address  provided by you to contact you from time to time about the Bible.is service. We  won't pass your email address on to anyone to contact you directly about their  own products or services, unless you have provided your prior consent to do so. </li>
		<li>Your pseudonymous listening  habit data will be available to other Bible.is users for non-commercial use and  to third parties via our API for their own commercial and/or non-commercial  purposes. This statistical information is used to help third parties understand  the likes and dislikes of Bible.is fans.</li>
		<li>We may display links to third  party sites which allow you to provide personal information to them directly.  We advise you to check their terms of use and privacy policies of these sites  to find out how they are treating your personal information.</li>
		<li>We use cookies (which can  only be read by us) to collect data that we can use to improve the efficiency  and quality of our service to you. If you want, you can turn these cookies off,  but it may mean that the Bible.is service doesn't function quite as well. Third  party advertisement companies may also collect information (which is generally  not personally identifiable) from you via cookies about the websites that you  visit and your other activities on the Bible.is service. We encourage you to  read these businesses' privacy policies if you are concerned about how they  will handle your information.</li>
		<li>Children under the age of 13  are not eligible to use our service and must not attempt to register with us  and/or submit any personal information to us. Young people between 13 and 17  should not send any information about themselves to anyone over the Internet  (including to us) without asking their parents/legal guardians for permission  beforehand.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>The  Policy explains how Bible.is collects and uses information. We hope that our  candor will remove any concerns you may have and will make visiting the Website  a rewarding experience.</p>
	<p><strong>If you would like to obtain information  about how we may have shared your information with third parties for their  direct marketing purposes, you may send such requests to us via postal mail at:  Bible.is c/o Faith Comes By Hearing, 2421 Aztec Rd, Albuquerque, NM 87107, or  contact us via email at: <a href="mailto:support@bible.is?subject=">support@Bible.is</a>.</strong></p>
	<p>Although  we endeavor to keep you up-to-date on all changes made to the Website, this  Policy may be amended from time to time without notice to you. It is your  responsibility to read the Policy carefully and review any changes that may  have been made.</p>
	<h2>1. Personal Information</h2>
	<p>In  order to use certain features of the Website, you will need to register. When  registering you will be asked to provide an email address and create a username  and password. You may also choose to create a more detailed profile of yourself  on the Website by submitting additional personal information. <strong>Please note that even if you do not provide  any additional personal information to the Website (e.g., by adding it to your  user profile), if you choose a username that includes or reveals your name or  any other personal information, such information may be available to other  users of the Website and to the general public.</strong></p>
	<p>Where  you upload photographs or other content as part of your user profile, you  should be aware that Bible.is is entitled to use those photographs and content  in accordance with our Terms of Use. Bible.is discourages users from uploading  photographs of friends or other people without their permission.</p>
	<h2>2. Scripture Recordings</h2>
	<p>From  the moment you register and begin listening to scripture on Bible.is, our  Profile Navigation software will begin to create and maintain your record  collection. This is accomplished by monitoring your activity on the website  (i.e. which songs you listen to, which scriptures you skip, and the degree of  difference or similarity you request when you choose to skip a particular book,  chapter or verse). All of the information that is generated by your activity on  the website is fed back for the purpose of monitoring user trends. Bible.is  makes some of this information available to third parties to undertake  development of new products and services via the API.</p>
	<p>Bible.is  does not process any personally identifiable information related to your  scripture preference and/or profile in any manner other than as described in  this Policy.</p>
	<h2>3. Location-based Information</h2>
	<p>We  keep track of the domains from which people visit Bible.is, but we cannot see a  user's zip code, post code, city or country unless the user chooses to  explicitly provide this information to us. If you do choose to include  information about your city or country of residence when setting up your user  profile, please be aware that such information may be available for viewing by  other users of the Website and to the general public.</p>
	<h2>4. Browser Information</h2>
	<p>We  collect data regarding the users of Bible.is, including: (i) The Internet  Protocol (IP) address of the user's computer. This may or may not be associated  with a particular Internet Service Provider (ISP); (ii) The referring URL, if  any; (iii) The browser software identification (i.e. the brand and version of  your browser software).</p>
	<h2>5. Statistical Information</h2>
	<p>We  log certain information concerning the listening, skipping and  scripture-sharing activities of users and other activities whilst they use the  Website, and we may match such information with personally identifiable  information concerning such users. For example, it is possible for us to know  which books, chapters and verses you listen to, which you skip, and which you  recommend to other users. However, information related to your listening,  skipping and scripture-sharing activities may be viewed by all other users (who  may include other organizations or representatives of other organizations who  have registered as Bible.is users) in conjunction with your Bible.is username  and by third parties who have access to this information via Bible.is's API and  web services, as further explained in this Policy.</p>
	<h2>6. Use of Personal Information</h2>
	<p><strong>We will use the email address provided  by you when you register to contact you from time to time. This may be for  security reasons (so that we can check that you are who you say you are), to  ask your opinion about the Website, or it may be to keep you updated on the  services currently available on the Website and any changes to those services  and those that we intend to launch in the future. We may also use such personal  information to send you notices, on behalf of others and ourselves, regarding  products and services that we think may be of interest to you.</strong></p>
	<p><strong>Your username, together with other  information concerning your use of the Bible.is Website, as well as any  personal information included in your user profile, will be made available via  Bible.is's open application interface (the "API"). See section 11 below for  further details.</strong></p>
	<p><strong>We will not permit any third parties to  contact you directly on an unsolicited basis in relation to their own products  or services, unless you have provided your express prior consent when signing  up on the Website. You may withdraw your consent by notifying us at <a href="mailto:support@bible.is?subject=">support@Bible.is</a>.</strong></p>
	<h2>7. Blogs / Chat / Communications  With Other Users</h2>
	<p>We  currently offer a blog and in the future we may offer other interactive  features, such as instant messaging and chat. Please note that all personal  information you display or communicate using such functionality becomes public  information and we are not responsible for any information you choose to make  public. We may, but have no obligation to, monitor such traffic via electronic  software or otherwise in order to check for obscenity, defamation or abusive  language, which we reserve the right to remove at any time. In addition, if you  choose to personally communicate or meet with any other Bible.is user by  exchanging postal/email addresses, telephone numbers or otherwise via the  interactive functionality of Bible.is, you do so at your own risk.</p>
	<h2>8. Software Updates</h2>
	<p>In  order to ensure that Bible.is is functioning at its best, from time to time we  may ask you to upgrade to a newer version of our software. In addition, we may  find it necessary to send you automatic fixes or support files. If we make a  modification that materially affects your privacy, we will endeavor to notify  you of such modification and we will update this Privacy Policy accordingly.</p>
	<h2>9. Links</h2>
	<p>We  may display links to third party sites. However, we cannot control and cannot  be held responsible for those other sites, their privacy policies or how they  treat information about their users.</p>
	<h2>10. Personally Identifiable  Information</h2>
	<p>Bible.Is complies  with all standards of disclosure as it pertains to your personal identifiable  information. You have the right to be informed of, and to have access to, all  of the personally identifiable information we hold about you, and you may do so  by visiting your user profile when logged in to your account on the Website, or  by emailing us at: <a href="mailto:support@bible.is?subject=">Support@Bible.is</a>.</p>
	<h2>11. Bible.is Software and transfers  of your information</h2>
	<p>If  you choose to download the Bible.is software, it will monitor all the scripture  you listen to on your computer. It will then send this information to Bible.is.  This information will then be integrated into Bible.is to improve our product.  The Bible.is software cannot and will not collect and transfer any other  information from your computer other than as described above. Bible.is cannot  be liable for any damage which may occur to your computer as a result of  downloading the Bible.is software, nor shall it be liable for any invasion of  privacy related to the same.</p>
	<p>We  may use third-party partners to help operate our Website, and we may share your  information with our affiliates, service providers and other third parties that  provide products or services for or through this Website or for our business  (such as Web site or database hosting companies, address list hosting  companies, e-mail service providers, analytics companies, distribution  companies, fulfillment companies, and other similar service providers that use  such information on our behalf).</p>
	<p>Bible.is  operates an 'open API' and web services program, which enables developers and  other third parties to freely use statistics and data collected by Bible.is to  create programs and other interesting services which help develop the Bible.is  community.</p>
	<p>Certain  third party individuals or organizations may have access to your personal  information (excluding your email contact information) via Bible.is's API and  web services or as a result of agreements between Bible.is and its preferred  partners.</p>
	<p>Certain  third-party advertisements on the Website may enable you to submit your  username and/or other personal information within the advertisement in order to  receive information or services provided by third parties. Such advertisements  are provided by third parties, and thus, the collection and use of information  submitted via the advertisements is by such third parties and is subject to  their privacy policies.</p>
	<p>Bible.is  cannot guarantee that all third parties will abide by such restrictions. Where  we deem it appropriate, we will take appropriate action against such third  party, which may include terminating their access to personal information.</p>
	<h2>12. Does Bible.is use cookies?</h2>
	<p>We  use cookies to help you use Bible.is to collect data that we can use to improve  the efficiency and quality of our service. We use these cookies to identify you  as a valid user and to help personalize your Bible.is experience in conjunction  with your profile. We currently employ persistent cookies which stay on your  computer after you have gone offline. Persistent cookies remain in the  "cookies" folder after you have closed your web browser.</p>
	<p>Most  browsers have cookies turned on as a default, but you can always disable  cookies or only allow non-persistent cookies via your browser preferences. If  you choose to disable cookies, however, you won't be able enjoy a significant  proportion of Bible.is's functionality. Please remember that cookies cannot  read your hard drive or give any information collected to any third party. A  cookie can only be read by the organization that sets it.</p>
	<h2>13. Third-Party Ad Servers</h2>
	<p>We  may use third-party advertising companies to target and serve ads when you  visit our Website. These companies may use information (generally not including  your name, address, e-mail address or telephone number) about your visits to  this and other Web sites in order to provide advertisements about goods and  services of interest to you. These companies may employ cookies and other  tracking technologies to measure advertising effectiveness. Any information  that these third parties collect via cookies is generally not personally  identifiable (unless, for example, you provide personal information to them  through an ad or e-mail message). We encourage you to read these businesses'  privacy policies if you should have any concerns about how they will care for  your information. If you would like more information about this practice and to  know your choices about not having this information used by these companies,  see the Network Advertising Initiative's consumer Web site at <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/consumer">http://www.networkadvertising.org/consumer</a>.</p><p>
	</p><h2>14. Security</h2>
	<p>Bible.is  endeavors to protect the security of your information as much as we endeavor to  protect our own information and network. We employ firewalls and store all of our files and information on terminals which require password access.</p>
	<p>You  should never disclose your account password to unauthorized people. We use  certain security measures to help keep your personal information safe, but we  cannot guarantee that these measures will stop any users try to get around the  privacy or security settings on the Website through unforeseen and/or illegal  activity. Consequently, you acknowledge that there are circumstances in which  your personal information may be accessed by unauthorized persons.</p>
	<p>In  the event that we believe that the security of your personal information in our  possession or control may have been compromised, we may seek to notify you. If  a notification is appropriate, we would endeavor to do so as promptly as  possible under the circumstances, and, to the extent we have your e-mail  address, we may notify you by e-mail. <strong>You  consent to our use of e-mail as a means of such notification. If you prefer for  us to use another method to notify you in this situation, please e-mail us at </strong><a href="mailto:support@bible.is?subject="><strong>support@</strong><strong>Bible.is</strong></a><strong>. with the alternative contact information you wish to be used.</strong></p>
	<h2>15. Bible.is Policy for Young  People</h2>

If you  have reason to believe that this has occurred, please contact us at <a href="mailto:support@bible.is?subject="><strong>support@</strong><strong>Bible.is</strong></a><strong>.</strong>, and we will delete all relevant information.</p>
	<h2>16. Legally-Compelled Disclosures</h2>
	<p>We  believe in privacy and therefore will take all reasonable measures to ensure  that your personally identifiable information remains private. However, in the  event that we are required to disclose personally identifiable information by a  court, the police or other law enforcement bodies for their investigations,  regulation or other governmental authority we will make such a disclosure  without being in violation of this Policy.</p>
	<h2>17. Consent</h2>
	<p><strong>By disclosing any information to  Bible.is through the Website and by using the Bible.is Website as a registered  user, you are consenting to the collection, storage and use of your personal  information by Bible.is as set out in this Policy and the Terms and Conditions,  and you understand and consent to the collection, maintenance, processing and  transfer of such information in and to the United States and other countries  and territories. </strong></p>
	<p><strong>When you give your personally  identifiable information to Bible.is, it may be used by Bible.is and its direct  and indirect consolidated subsidiaries for the purposes of, for example,  providing you services and sending you correspondence, and additionally may be  transferred to entities other than Bible.is's affiliates, which entities may be  located in countries outside the United States. Each of these countries has  different privacy laws that afford varying levels of protection for your  personally identifiable information, and such laws may not be as comprehensive  as those that exist in the United States. By registering with Bible.is, you  consent to Bible.is's and its direct and indirect consolidated subsidiaries'  transmission to, and processing of your information in, any jurisdiction, in  accordance with its Privacy Policy.</strong></p>
	<h2>18. Changes to the Privacy Policy</h2>
	<p>If  Bible.is makes any changes to this Policy these changes will be detailed on  this page in order to ensure that you are fully aware of what information is  collected, how it is used and under what circumstances it will be disclosed..  If you have any specific concerns not addressed in the Policy, please contact  us using the feedback page on the website.</p>
	<p>If  you decide that you do not want your personal information to be used in the way  described in this Policy, you can send us a notice that you wish to withdraw  your consent as set out above by emailing <a href="mailto:support@bible.is?subject="><strong>support@</strong><strong>Bible.is</strong></a><strong>.</strong>. Because the Bible.is community relies on users sharing  information, withdrawing your consent will mean that you are not able to  receive the full benefits of Bible.is's service as a user. <strong>Additionally, if you do not provide your consent, or if you withdraw  your consent, you should not use the Website as a registered user, which means  that many features will be unavailable to you.</strong></p>
