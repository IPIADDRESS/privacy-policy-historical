We recognise our responsibility to keep confidential at all times any information about you which we acquire in connection with your application. Bibit is owned by The Royal Bank of Scotland Group plc. We protect your personal information to an equivalent high standard to that which you would experience through any other channels of the bank, such as bank branches, cash machines or on the telephone. Please note however that our responsibility is necessarily limited to protection by us of information which we obtain.</p>
		<p><b>Collection of Information</b></p>
		<p>To enable us to process your application we will typically acquire information which includes your name, your e-mail and business addresses, and other relevant business details.</p>
		<p><b>Use and disclosure of Information</b></p>

			<li>prevent and detect crime;</li>
			<li>understand our customers' requirements;</li>
			<li>develop and test products and services</li>

		<p>We do not disclose your information to anyone outside the Group except:</p>
		<ul class="bulletwhite">
			<li>where we have your permission; or</li>
			<li>where we are required or permitted to do so by law; or</li>
			<li>to other companies who provide a service to us or you </li>
			<li>where we may transfer rights and obligations under this agreement.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>We may transfer your information to other countries. If we do this we will ensure that anyone to whom we pass it provides an adequate level of protection.</p>
		<p>From time to time we may change the way we use your information. Where we believe you may not reasonably expect such a change we shall write to you. If you do not object to the change within 60 days, you consent to that change.</p>
		<p>If you would like a copy of the information we hold about you, please write to: The Royal Bank of Scotland plc, 36 St Andrew Square, Edinburgh, EH2 2YB. A fee may be payable.</p>
