<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

</div>

<div class="main_content">
	<p>Effective Date of Current Policy: 3/15/2011</p>
	<h3>OVERVIEW</h3>
	
	<p>Socialwise®, Inc. (owners and operators of www.BillMyParents.com) is committed to respecting and protecting the privacy rights of all users of our websites and services (collectively the “Service”). Please read this Privacy Policy carefully to understand how we collect and use information in connection with the Service.</p> 
	<p style="float:right;margin: 15px;"><a href="//privacy-policy.truste.com/click-with-confidence/ctv-coppa/en/www.billmyparents.com/seal_m" title="Validate TRUSTe children privacy certification" target="_blank"><img style="border: none" src="//privacy-policy.truste.com/certified-seal/ctv-coppa/en/www.billmyparents.com/seal_m.png" alt="Validate TRUSTe children privacy certification"></a> <a href="//privacy-policy.truste.com/click-with-confidence/ctv/en/www.billmyparents.com/seal_m" title="Validate TRUSTe privacy certification" target="_blank"><img style="border: none" src="//privacy-policy.truste.com/certified-seal/ctv/en/www.billmyparents.com/seal_m.png" alt="Validate TRUSTe privacy certification"></a></p>

	<h3>HOW IT WORKS</h3>
	<p>The Service enables children to shop online and choose things they would like to purchase. Rather than borrowing a parents’ credit card, or having to have their parents shop with them, BillMyParents enables the child to choose the item and have their Parent or other trusted party (collectively, the “Giver”) receive a purchase interest notification. The parent or legal guardian (hereafter “Parent”) can then decide whether or not to approve and finalize the purchase. With BillMyParents, sensitive information like credit card data is handled securely by giving Parents an easy and convenient way to control how and when purchases are made. </p>
	<p>SocialWise has been awarded TRUSTe’s Privacy Seal signifying that this privacy policy and practices have been reviewed by TRUSTe for compliance with <a href="http://www.truste.com/privacy_seals_and_services/consumer_privacy/privacy-programs-requirements.html" target="_blank">TRUSTe’s program requirements</a> including transparency, accountability and choice regarding the collection and use of your personal information.  The TRUSTe program covers the site www.BillMyParents.com.   TRUSTe’s mission, as an independent third party, is to accelerate online trust among consumers and organizations globally through its leading privacy trustmark and innovative trust solutions. If you have questions or complaints regarding our privacy policy or practices, please contact us at info@BillMyParents.com.  If you are not satisfied with our response you can contact <a href="http://watchdog.truste.com/pvr.php?page=complaint" target="_blank">TRUSTe here</a>.</p>

	<h3>Parents:</h3>
	<p>We are dedicated to providing a safe environment for your children. As such, we feel it is best that you know who is giving your child money, and in what amounts. To that end, Parents of children under 13 must set up a Giver account and register as the Parent and/or guardian of your child in order for your child to have full access to their account. Credit card collection in conjunction with a transaction is necessary to create such an account. Once a Parent account is established and you have provided your consent, your child may choose to add other Givers. With a Parent account, you will be able to see who is paying for orders your child places online, and in what amounts. If you see the name of a person you do not recognize or whom your child should not be contacting, please talk to your child immediately. If you find that a Giver is incorrectly listed as your child’s parent or guardian, or if you need to block a Giver, please contact us immediately at info@BillMyParents.com. </p>
	<h3>Mobile Messaging Service</h3>
	<p>BillMyParents.com uses the information collected from your interaction with us by Text Messaging Service (SMS) (“SMS Service”) solely for the purposes of sending you service related texts and improving the SMS Service. The information will not be provided, sold, licensed, rented, assigned or disclosed to Third Parties, except as required by law, nor will we use your phone number to initiate a call or SMS text message to you without your express prior consent. Your wireless carrier and other service providers also collect data about your SMS Service usage, and their practices are governed by their own privacy policies. You may opt-out from receiving SMS messages at any time by replying “STOP” to the message. </p>
	<p>BillMyParents.com collects your mobile phone number in order to send you a transactional text messaging as part of our prepaid card service. You may also reply to the text message in order to perform basic account functions such as lock/unlock card and load funds on a card.</p>
	<h3>A SPECIAL NOTE TO CHILDREN UNDER 13 (the “REQUESTOR”)</h3>
	<p>Account creation requires Parent approval.</p>
	<p>In order to set up an account, you need permission from your Parent. If you are under 13 years old, please send your first BillMyParents request to your Parent or no account will be created for you.  Please only include your first name, email address, and a brief message in your first request. DO NOT include your age, address, telephone number, or any other information about yourself in the message body of the request. NEVER send a BillMyParents request to someone you and your Parents do not know. If you are under 13 years old, you MUST have your Parent make any changes to your profile, or to the information you have given us in the past. If you are ever unsure about anything you see when using the Service, ask your Parent for help. </p>
	<p>We will not collect more personal information than is reasonably necessary for your child to participate in the site or its activities. Parents have the right to consent to the site’s collection and use of the child’s personal information without having to consent to the site’s disclosure to third parties, other than service providers.</p>
	<h3>Parents</h3>
	<p>When setting up an account for your child you will be asked for your email address, name, address, mobile number and social security number.  Once you have provided us with your information we will then ask for your child’s information such as their name, email address, address and mobile phone number. </p>
	<p>If you wish to add bank account information we will collect the account type, routing and account number, name on the account, driver’s license number and bank name.  We will use this information for the purpose of loading your child’s prepaid card at your convenience.  You may store this information within your account and delete it at any time.  We will not use this information for any other purpose than to fulfill your request. If you wish to lock a card to prevent your child from using it you may do so at any time within the control panel.</p>
	<p>We use email addresses to respond to your requests and to provide the Service.</p>
	<p>If you are under 13 years old, we may use your email address, which is considered personally identifiable information (“Personally Identifiable Information”), as further explained in this policy, WITH YOUR PARENT’S PERMISSION. We currently use your email address to track and complete orders placed through the Service, to help Givers identify you, and to send one or more newsletters to you, as approved by your Parent. </p>
	<p>If you are over 13 we will use your email address for the purposes stated above.</p>
	
	<h3>A SPECIAL NOTE TO PARENTS OF CHILDREN UNDER 13 YEARS OF AGE </h3>
	
	<p>We take very seriously the safety of children, especially those under the age of 13. We comply with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act of 2000 (“COPPA”). Although more information about COPPA may be found at http://www.coppa.org/, please read the following information regarding our information practices for children we know to be under 13 and their Parents. </p>
	<p>Why do we collect information from children and how do we use it? </p>
	
	<ul>
		<li>Obtaining parental consent. We may collect online contact information from your child, who is under the age of 13, in order to obtain parental consent from you, the child’s Parent, and/or to provide parental notice by providing a link to this Privacy Policy wherever we have requested Personally Identifiable Information from children under the age of 13. </li>
		<li>Account creation, service activation and provision. Children who sign up for the Service are asked to supply an email address of a Parent, in which case the Parent will receive an email message containing instructions on how to activate the child’s registration. If we believe a child is under 13 years of age, the child’s account will remain disabled until the Parent activates the child’s registration. The account, along with all information provided by the child, will be deleted from our records if we have not obtained consent from a Parent within a reasonable period of time. If and when we have obtained consent from a Parent, we ask for and collect from children under the age of 13 Personally Identifiable Information that is reasonably necessary to provide the Service to the child.</li> 
		<li>We use the information a parent provides us to for verification purposes and to create an account for their child who will be able to access their account once the parent has provided consent.</li>
	</ul>
	<h3>Accessing and deleting children’s information.</h3>
	<p>Please note that you can always ask us to review or delete any of your child’s information and you can refuse to permit further collection or use of your child’s information at any time by logging into your account and selecting “edit accounts”, sending an email to info@billmyparents.com or written request to the contact information listed below. However, if you ask us to delete your child’s information, your child may not be able to participate further with the Service. You may contact us by any means listed below and we will work hard to respond promptly. </p>

	<h3>DATA COLLECTION AND USE </h3>
	<p>The following information describes the ways in which we share Personally Identifiable Information collected through the Service. We do not share your Personally Identifiable Information in ways other than described in this Privacy Policy. </p>
	
	<h3>Personally Identifiable Information</h3>
	<p>Personally Identifiable Information refers to information that can be used to identify, contact, or locate a child, Parent, or other Giver (collectively the “Users”) and may include name, mailing address, telephone number, mobile phone number, email address, and other identification and contact information. Some Personally Identifiable Information is requested upon registration when a User makes a request, makes a payment through BillMyParents, corresponds with us, or otherwise volunteers information. We may also collect certain financial information such as a credit card number and billing address. When we do so, we generally attempt to provide a link to this Privacy Policy so the User can understand how this information will be used. BillMyParents does not collect payment information from children. We do collect a child’s first name, last name, birth date, and email address so that we can activate the Service with parental consent. </p>
	<p>Non-Personally Identifiable Information</p>
	<p>Non-Personally Identifiable Information refers to information that does not identify a specific individual by him/herself or in combination with other information. Non-Personally Identifiable information may include information such as age, date of birth, and gender that is not linked to an identified individual. We may also gather consumer purchasing information based upon purchases using the Service. This information may be compiled and analyzed on an individual de-identified basis as well as on an aggregated basis. This information may include: </p>
	<ul>
		<li>The website’s Uniform Resource Locator (“URL”), which is the location of where the User just came from, </li>
		<li>Which URL the User will next go to, </li>
		<li>What browser the User is using, and </li>
		<li>The User’s Internet Protocol (“IP”) address. </li>
	</ul>
	<p>A URL is the global address of documents and other resources on the Internet. An IP address is an identifier for a computer or device on a Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (“TCP/IP”) network, such as the Internet. Networks use the TCP/IP protocol to route information based on the IP address of the destination. In other words, an IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you are surfing the Internet, allowing Internet servers to locate and identify the User’s computer. Computers require IP addresses in order for Users to communicate on the Internet, browse, and shop. </p>
	<p>Where we collect your information and how we use it.</p>
	<p>Our primary purpose for collecting information is to provide the Service. Among other things, we use Personally Identifiable Information to process payments, contact Users about the status of an order, and to remind customers of upcoming events and promotions. </p>
	<p>We may also use information we collect to: </p>
	<ul>
		<li>Provide the Service by including the display of customized content which includes advertising; </li>
		<li>Conduct audits, research, and analysis in order to maintain, protect, and improve the Service; </li>
		<li>Ensure the technical functioning of the Service; and </li>
		<li>Develop new services. </li>
		<li>Import Contacts</li>
		<li>Editing Account</li>
		<li>Edit Givers</li>
		<li>Invite a Friend</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Payment Request– Children using the Service</p>
	<p>We collect and maintain the Requestor’s Personally Identifiable Information when the Requestor places an order through us. To complete an order we will require the Requestor’s first name, email address, and the Giver’s name and email address. We collect this information in order to contact the Giver and fulfill the order. We also use this information to update the Requestor regarding the status of the request. </p>
	<p>If you sign up for our newsletter on our website or when completing an order, we may use the Personally Identifiable Information the Requestor provided us to send promotional materials and updates for the Service. To unsubscribe, follow the unsubscribe link provided in the communication, or write to unsubscribe@BillMyParents.com. If you unsubscribe, we will discontinue sending the Requestor promotional information about our Service. </p>
	<p>Orders – Givers</p>
	<p>We collect and maintain your Personally Identifiable Information when the Requestor places an order through us. To complete an order we will require the Giver’s name, and email address from the Requestor, and then seek the billing address and credit card information from the Giver. We will also attempt to collect the Giver’s phone number. We collect this information in order to fulfill the Giver’s payment authorization, and will share the Giver’s address, phone number, and credit card number to fulfill the Requestor’s order. We do not share the Giver’s credit card information with the Requestor or other Givers. However, YOUR CONTRIBUTION AMOUNT, NAME, AND COMMENTS MAY NOT BE CONFIDENTIAL.</p>
	<p>The Requestor’s Parents may view the Giver’s name and email address, as well as how much money the authorizations were for, and where they were placed. Again, the Parent will never be able to view credit card information of other Givers but will have access to Giver contact information. We make the transaction history available to Parents only so they can know what their children want to purchase and who they have asked to pay for it. If you are a Parent of a Requestor, the Service operates so that you control whether your transaction history may be shared with other Givers. All Givers to an account can view each Giver’s name and email address associated with accounts of Requestors. </p>
	<p>Invite a Friend</p>
	<p>If you choose to use the invite a friend feature on our site, we will ask for your friends email address.  We will automatically send your friend a one-time email inviting him or her to visit the site.  BillMyParents.com stores this information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email and crediting you or your child’s account once someone you have invited to the site becomes a member.  The invite a friend feature is hosted by a third party, all information collected within this form is collected by our third party service provider on behalf of BillMyParents.com.  They will share back with us the email address of the recipient so that we may keep track of who joins our site and compensate you. </p>
	<p>Import Contacts</p>
	<p>We allow you to use the import contacts feature in order to invite your friends to the site, we will ask for you for your account login and password in order to import contacts from either a personal email account or social networking site.  We store this information for the purpose of crediting you once someone you have invited to the site becomes a member.  We will delete the information once we have ensured that you have been credited.</p>
	
	<p>Testimonials</p>
	<p>We post customer testimonials on our Web site which may contain personally identifiable information.  We do obtain the customer’s consent via email prior to posting the testimonial to post their name along with it.  If you are under the age of 13 and we post a testimonial from you we will not post any personal information along with the testimonial. </p>
	<p>Contacting Us</p>
	<p>We will attempt to collect the User’s Personally Identifiable Information when contacting us regarding an order. This information is used to follow up with the User, such as calling or emailing the User to update the User on the status of an order. </p>
	<p>Surveys</p>
	<p>We sometimes use email information to send surveys. If we use a vendor to help us, we do not permit them to use this information other than to manage the survey for us.</p>
	<p>We may ask the User to fill out an online survey so we can improve the Service. The User’s Personally Identifiable Information will be kept confidential, but the feedback the User provides in the survey is not confidential and may be used by Socialwise®, Inc. or others. </p>
	<p>Shopping</p>
	<p>When the User browses our websites or uses the Service, we will collect the User’s IP address for the purposes of system administration, to gather broad demographic information, and to monitor the level of activity on our website. We collect information from visitors to our websites regarding the referring URL, the User’s IP address, which browser the User used to come to our website, the country, state, and telephone area code where the User’s server is located, and the pages of our websites that the User viewed during the User’s visit. We do not collect Personally Identifiable Information from the User simply because the User visited our websites. </p>
	<p>Cookies and Clear Gifs</p>
	<p>A cookie is a small data file that is placed on the hard drive of the User’s computer when the User visits a website. Cookies are used to identify the User to us, and can be used to save the User’s IP address and website preferences. Clear Gifs are small strings of code that can be used to track the User’s movements on the Service, such as which categories and products the User views. Clear Gifs are not connected to the User’s Personally Identifiable Information. </p>
	<p>If the User registers with the Service, the User’s cookie allows us to recognize the User when the User returns to our websites and provides the User with access to the User’s account information. If the User saves their information with us, or places any orders from the Service, we may also use cookies to monitor and maintain information about the User’s use of the Service. If the User has not saved their information with us or placed any orders from the Service, we may monitor and maintain information about the User’s use of the Service in a manner that does not identify the User. The User can disable cookies at any time by using their browser options; however, if the User disables cookies, we will not be able to track the User’s order, enable the User to make a purchase from the Service, or recognize the User as a registered user to allow the User access to their account information. </p>
	<p>Online behavioral analytics.</p>
	<p>We may use third-party companies to serve ads or analyze behavior patterns when the User visits our websites. These companies may place or provide ads (such as banner ads) on our websites that might also place cookies. These companies may use information (not including Personally Identifiable Information) about the User’s visit to our websites in order to help us improve our user experience and/or provide advertisements about goods and services that may be of interest to the User. In the course of providing these services or placing these ads, these third-party companies may place or recognize a unique”cookie” on the User’s computer and each of these companies use this cookie information according to their own privacy and security policies.  The use of cookies by third parties is not covered by our privacy policy.  We do not have access or control over these cookies.</p>
	<p>Clear Gifs (Web Beacons/Web Bugs)</p>

	<p>We employ [or our third party advertising partner employs] a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs), that help us better manage content on our site by informing us what content is effective.  Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users.  In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on Web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. We do not tie the information gathered by clear gifs to our customers’ personally identifiable information. </p>

	<p>DATA SHARING </p>
	<p>Disclosures of Personally Identifiable Information with others.</p>
	<p>At times, we may share information with other carefully selected companies and organizations that are not part of Socialwise®, Inc. These companies and organizations may use the information we send them to provide special opportunities and offers to the Requestor. It is not our policy to share the Requestor’s shipping address, billing information, or telephone numbers with any of these organizations. For Requestors whom we know to be under 13 years old, we will not knowingly share your Personally Identifiable Information with such third parties unless approved by the Parent. If you wish to opt-out from third party sharing you may contact us at info@BillMyParents.com.  If you no longer wish to be contacted by such third parties you must contact that third party directly.</p>
	<p>Additionally, we may sometimes use certain vendors and suppliers  such as a credit card processing company to bill you for goods and services, a third party customer service company to help you with your customer service requests, and a third party tracking utility company to analyze trends.  We also work with other partners such as PacSun, Industrial Ride Shop and Amazon in connection with the provision of the Service. When we do, we make efforts to ensure that these parties treat information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.  These third parties are only allowed to use your personal information to provide you with the service you have requested. </p>
	<p>In addition to disclosures, as required to provide the Service or as otherwise set out in this Privacy Policy, BillMyParents may also disclose Personally Identifiable Information (including the information of children under the age of 13) if it believes that doing so is: </p>
	<ul>
		<li>required by law and when we believe that such disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on our Web site; </li>
		<li>appropriate to respond to any claims; or </li>
		<li>to protect the rights, property, or personal safety of BillMyParents, its subsidiaries and affiliates or others. </li>
