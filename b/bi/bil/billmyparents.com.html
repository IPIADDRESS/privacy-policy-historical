<div class="main_content">

		<p>
		<strong>Effective Date of Current Policy: April 30, 2010</strong>
	</p>
	<p>
		OVERVIEW<br>
		Socialwise®, Inc. (owners and operators of <a href="http://www.BillMyParents.com">www.BillMyParents.com</a>) is committed to respecting and protecting the privacy rights of all users of our websites and services (collectively the “Service”). Please read this Privacy Policy carefully to understand how we collect and use information in connection with the Service.
	</p>
	<p>
		HOW IT WORKS<br>
		The Service enables children to shop online and choose things they would like to purchase. Rather than borrowing a parents’ credit card, or having to have their parents shop with them, BillMyParents enables the child to choose the item and have their Parent or other trusted party (collectively, the “Giver”) receive a purchase interest notification. The parent or legal guardian (hereafter “Parent”) can then decide whether or not to approve and finalize the purchase. With BillMyParents, sensitive information like credit card data is handled securely by giving Parents an easy and convenient way to control how and when purchases are made.
	</p>
	<p>
		Parents:<br>
		We are dedicated to providing a safe environment for your children. As such, we feel it is best that you know who is giving your child money, and in what amounts. To that end, we strongly encourage Parents of children to set up a Giver account and register as the Parent and/or guardian of your child. No purchase is necessary to create such an account; however, we may require your credit card information to verify your identity. Once a Parent account is established, your child may choose to add other Givers. With a Parent account, you will be able to see who is paying for orders your child places online, and in what amounts. If you see the name of a person you do not recognize or whom your child should not be contacting, please talk to your child immediately. If you find that a Giver is incorrectly listed as your child’s parent or guardian, or if you need to block a Giver, please contact us immediately at <a href="mailto:info@billmyparents.com">info@billmyparents.com</a>.
	</p>
	<p>
		A SPECIAL NOTE TO CHILDREN (the “REQUESTOR”)<br>
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong>Account creation requires Parent approval.</strong><br>
		In order to set up an account, you need permission from your Parent. If you are under 13 years old, please send your first BillMyParents request to your Parent <strong>BEFORE</strong> sending it to anyone else (including other family members). Please only include your first name, email address, and a brief message in your first request. <strong>DO NOT</strong> include your age, address, telephone number, or any other information about yourself in the message body of the request. <strong>NEVER</strong> send a BillMyParents request to someone you and your Parents do not know. <strong>If you are under 13 years old</strong>, you <strong>MUST</strong> have your Parent make any changes to your profile, or to the information you have given us in the past. If you are ever unsure about anything you see when using the Service, ask your Parent for help.
	</p>
	<p>
		<a name="email_use"></a>
		<strong>We use email addresses to respond to your requests and to provide the Service.</strong><br>
		If you are under 13 years old, we may use your email address, which is considered personally identifiable information (“Personally Identifiable Information”), as further explained in this policy, <strong>WITH YOUR PARENT’S PERMISSION</strong>. We currently use your email address to track and complete orders placed through the Service, to help Givers identify you, and to send one or more newsletters to you, as approved by your Parent.
	</p>
	<p>
		A SPECIAL NOTE TO PARENTS OF CHILDREN UNDER 13 YEARS OF AGE
	</p>
	<p>
		We take very seriously the safety of children, especially those under the age of 13. We comply with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act of 2000 (“COPPA”). Although more information about COPPA may be found at <a href="http://www.coppa.org/" target="_blank">http://www.coppa.org/</a>, <strong>please read the following information regarding our information practices for children we know to be under 13 and their Parents</strong>.
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong>Why do we collect information from children and how do we use it?</strong>
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			<strong>Obtaining parental consent</strong>. We may collect online contact information from your child, who is under the age of 13, in order to obtain parental consent from you, the child’s Parent, and/or to provide parental notice by providing a link to this Privacy Policy wherever we have requested Personally Identifiable Information from children under the age of 13.
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>Account creation, service activation and provision.</strong> Children who sign up for the Service are asked to supply an email address of a Parent, in which case the Parent will receive an email message containing instructions on how to activate the child’s registration. If we believe a child is under 13 years of age, the child’s account will remain disabled until the Parent activates the child’s registration. The account, along with all information provided by the child, will be deleted from our records if we have not obtained consent from a Parent within a reasonable period of time. If and when we have obtained consent from a Parent, we ask for and collect from children under the age of 13 Personally Identifiable Information that is reasonably necessary to provide the Service to the child.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		<strong>Accessing and deleting children’s information.</strong><br>
		Please note that you can always ask us to review or delete any of your child’s information and you can refuse to permit further collection or use of your child’s information at any time by sending a written request to the contact information listed below. However, if you ask us to delete your child’s information, your child may not be able to participate further with the Service. You may contact us by any means listed below and we will work hard to respond promptly.

	<p>
		DATA COLLECTION AND USE
	</p>
	<p>
		The following information describes the ways in which we share Personally Identifiable Information collected through the Service. We do not share your Personally Identifiable Information in ways other than described in this Privacy Policy.
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong>Personally Identifiable Information</strong><br>
		Personally Identifiable Information refers to information that can be used to identify, contact, or locate a child, Parent, or other Giver (collectively the “Users”) and may include name, mailing address, telephone number, mobile phone number, email address, and other identification and contact information. Some Personally Identifiable Information is requested upon registration when a User makes a request, makes a payment through BillMyParents, corresponds with us, or otherwise volunteers information. We may also collect certain financial information such as a credit card number and billing address. When we do so, we generally attempt to provide a link to this Privacy Policy so the User can understand how this information will be used. <strong>BillMyParents does not collect payment information from children. We do collect a child’s first name, last name, birth date, and email address so that we can activate the Service with parental consent.</strong>
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong>Non-Personally Identifiable Information</strong><br>
		Non-Personally Identifiable Information refers to information that does not identify a specific individual by him/herself or in combination with other information. Non-Personally Identifiable information may include information such as age, date of birth, and gender that is not linked to an identified individual. We may also gather consumer purchasing information based upon purchases using the Service. This information may be compiled and analyzed on an individual de-identified basis as well as on an aggregated basis. This information may include:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>the website’s Uniform Resource Locator (“URL”), which is the location of where the User just came from,
		</li>
		<li>which URL the User will next go to,
		</li>
		<li>what browser the User is using, and
		</li>
		<li>the User’s Internet Protocol (“IP”) address.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		A URL is the global address of documents and other resources on the Internet. An IP address is an identifier for a computer or device on a Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (“TCP/IP”) network, such as the Internet. Networks use the TCP/IP protocol to route information based on the IP address of the destination. In other words, an IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you are surfing the Internet, allowing Internet servers to locate and identify the User’s computer. Computers require IP addresses in order for Users to communicate on the Internet, browse, and shop.
	</p>
	<p>
		<a name="where_we_collect"></a>
		<strong>Where we collect your information and how we use it.</strong><br>
		Our primary purpose for collecting information is to provide the Service. Among other things, we use Personally Identifiable Information to process payments, contact Users about the status of an order, and to remind customers of upcoming events and promotions.
	</p>
	<p>
		We may also use information we collect to:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>provide the Service by including the display of customized content which includes advertising;
		</li>
		<li>conduct audits, research, and analysis in order to maintain, protect, and improve the Service;
		</li>
		<li>ensure the technical functioning of the Service; and
		</li>
		<li>develop new services.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		<a name="payment_request"></a>
		<strong>Payment Request– Children using the Service</strong><br>
		We collect and maintain the Requestor’s Personally Identifiable Information when the Requestor places an order through us. To complete an order we will require the Requestor’s first name, email address, and the Giver’s name and email address. We collect this information in order to contact the Giver and fulfill the order. We also use this information to update the Requestor regarding the status of the request.
	</p>
	<p>
		If you sign up for our newsletter on our website or when completing an order, we may use the Personally Identifiable Information the Requestor provided us to send promotional materials and updates for the Service. To unsubscribe, follow the unsubscribe link provided in the communication, or write to <a href="mailto:unsubscribe@billmyparents.com">unsubscribe@billmyparents.com</a>. If you unsubscribe, we will discontinue sending the Requestor promotional information about our Service.
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong>Orders – Givers</strong><br>
		We collect and maintain your Personally Identifiable Information when the Requestor places an order through us. To complete an order we will require the Giver’s name, and email address from the Requestor, and then seek the billing address and credit card information from the Giver. We will also attempt to collect the Giver’s phone number. We collect this information in order to fulfill the Giver’s payment authorization, and will share the Giver’s address, phone number, and credit card number to fulfill the Requestor’s order. We do not share the Giver’s credit card information with the Requestor or other Givers. However, YOUR CONTRIBUTION AMOUNT, NAME, AND COMMENTS MAY NOT BE CONFIDENTIAL.<br>
		The Requestor’s Parents may view the Giver’s name and email address, as well as how much money the authorizations were for, and where they were placed. Again, the Parent will never be able to view credit card information of other Givers but will have access to Giver contact information. We make the transaction history available to Parents only so they can know what their children want to purchase and who they have asked to pay for it. If you are a Parent of a Requestor, the Service operates so that you control whether your transaction history may be shared with other Givers. All Givers to an account can view each Giver’s name and email address associated with accounts of Requestors.
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong>Contacting Us</strong><br>
		We will attempt to collect the User’s Personally Identifiable Information when contacting us regarding an order. This information is used to follow up with the User, such as calling or emailing the User to update the User on the status of an order.
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong>Surveys</strong><br>
		We sometimes use email information to send surveys. If we use a vendor to help us, we do not permit them to use this information other than to manage the survey for us.<br>
		We may ask the User to fill out an online survey so we can improve the Service. The User’s Personally Identifiable Information will be kept confidential, but the feedback the User provides in the survey is not confidential and may be used by Socialwise®, Inc. or others.
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong>Shopping</strong><br>
		When the User browses our websites or uses the Service, we will collect the User’s IP address for the purposes of system administration, to gather broad demographic information, and to monitor the level of activity on our website. We collect information from visitors to our websites regarding the referring URL, the User’s IP address, which browser the User used to come to our website, the country, state, and telephone area code where the User’s server is located, and the pages of our websites that the User viewed during the User’s visit. We do not collect Personally Identifiable Information from the User simply because the User visited our websites.
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong>Cookies and Clear Gifs</strong><br>
		A cookie is a small data file that is placed on the hard drive of the User’s computer when the User visits a website. Cookies are used to identify the User to us, and can be used to save the User’s IP address and website preferences. We may link a cookie to the User’s email address after the User places an order with us. Clear Gifs are small strings of code that can be used to track the User’s movements on the Service, such as which categories and products the User views. Clear Gifs are not connected to the User’s Personally Identifiable Information.
	</p>
	<p>
		If the User registers with the Service, the User’s cookie allows us to recognize the User when the User returns to our websites and provides the User with access to the User’s account information. If the User saves their information with us, or places any orders from the Service, we may also use cookies to monitor and maintain information about the User’s use of the Service. If the User has not saved their information with us or placed any orders from the Service, we may monitor and maintain information about the User’s use of the Service in a manner that does not identify the User. The User can disable cookies at any time by using their browser options; however, if the User disables cookies, we will not be able to track the User’s order, enable the User to make a purchase from the Service, or recognize the User as a registered user to allow the User access to their account information.
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong>Online behavioral analytics.</strong><br>
		We may use third-party companies to serve ads or analyze behavior patterns when the User visits our websites. These companies may place or provide ads (such as banner ads) on our websites that might also place cookies. These companies may use information (not including Personally Identifiable Information) about the User’s visit to our websites in order to help us improve our user experience and/or provide advertisements about goods and services that may be of interest to the User. In the course of providing these services or placing these ads, these third-party companies may place or recognize a unique”cookie” on the User’s computer and each of these companies use this cookie information according to their own privacy and security policies.
	</p>
	<p>
		DATA SHARING
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong>Disclosures of Personally Identifiable Information with others.</strong><br>
		At times, we may share information with other carefully selected companies and organizations that are not part of Socialwise®, Inc. These companies and organizations may use the information we send them to provide special opportunities and offers to the Requestor. It is not our policy to share the Requestor’s shipping address, billing information, or telephone numbers with any of these organizations. <strong>For Requestors whom we know to be under 13 years old, we will not knowingly share your Personally Identifiable Information with such third parties unless approved by the Parent.</strong>
	</p>
	<p>
		Additionally, we may sometimes use certain vendors and suppliers or work with other partners in connection with the provision of the Service. When we do, we make efforts to ensure that these parties treat information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
	</p>
	<p>
		In addition to disclosures, as required to provide the Service or as otherwise set out in this Privacy Policy, BillMyParents may also disclose Personally Identifiable Information (including the information of children under the age of 13) if it believes that doing so is:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>required by law;
		</li>
		<li>reasonably necessary to comply with legal processes;
		</li>
		<li>appropriate to respond to any claims; or
		</li>
		<li>to protect the rights, property, or personal safety of BillMyParents, its subsidiaries and affiliates or others.
		</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>In the event of a merger, all information previously collected by BillMyParents will be transferred to the merging company. In such a case, customers may contact BillMyParents to have their information deleted from our records. In the event that BillMyParents discontinues business operations, all customer information previously collected will be destroyed.</p>
	
	<p>
		DATA INTEGRITY AND SECURITY
	</p>
	<p>
		We take reasonable precautions to keep the User’s Personally Identifiable Information secure. We have put in place physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard the confidentiality and integrity of the information we collect. All information submitted to BillMyParents through the website is secured by 2048-bit Secure Socket Layer (SSL) data encryption. The information is stored on computer servers which are separate from other corporate information and systems, and in compliance with Payment Card Industry (PCI) security requirements. Our efforts include procedures designed to avoid unauthorized access, alteration, misuse, or disclosure of Personally Identifiable Information.
	</p>
	<p>
		Our websites and our third-party service providers which collect sensitive financial information, such as credit/debit card information, use encryption and other security measures in the collection and transfer of such information.
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong>Notice of Security Breaches</strong>
	</p>
	<p>
		If we learn of a security systems breach we may attempt to notify the User electronically so that you can take appropriate protective steps. However, by using our websites or providing Personally Identifiable Information to us, the User agrees that we can communicate with you electronically regarding security, privacy, and administrative issues relating to the User’s use of our websites. We may post a notice on our websites if a security breach occurs. If this happens, the User will need a web browser enabling the User to view our websites. We may also send an email to the User at the email address the User has provided to us in these circumstances. Depending on where you live, the User may have a legal right to receive notice of a security breach in writing. To receive free written notice of a security breach (or to withdraw your consent from receiving electronic notice) the User should notify us in writing by contacting us at the contact information provided below.
	</p>
	<p>
		LINKS AND OTHER PARTIES’ WEBSITES
	</p>
	<p>
		Although we do not provide any Personally Identifiable Information about children under the age of 13 to any “independently-operated websites” (that is, websites not owned, operated, and controlled by us), such websites may solicit Personally Identifiable Information from children under the age of 13. Please be aware that we do not control and are not responsible for the actions, privacy policy(ies), or terms of use of such independently-operated websites, nor are we responsible for any content appearing on their websites linked to or from our website, or for any Personally Identifiable Information gathered at those websites. IF YOU ARE UNDER THE AGE OF 13, YOU SHOULD GET YOUR PARENT’S PERMISSION BEFORE LINKING TO THESE OTHER INDEPENDENTLY-OPERATED WEBSITES OR PROVIDING ANY OF YOUR PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION TO THESE OTHER WEBSITES.
	</p>
	<p>
		INTERNATIONAL VISITORS AND CUSTOMERS
	</p>
	<p>
		Our websites are hosted in the United States. If Users are visiting from the European Union or any other region or country with laws governing data collection and use which may differ from U.S. law, please note that Users are transferring their personal data to the United States which does not have the same data protection laws as the region or country they are visiting from and by providing the User’s personal data you consent to:
	</p>
	<ol>
		<li>the use of the User’s personal data for the purposes identified above in accordance with this Privacy Policy; and
		</li>
		<li>the transfer of the User’s personal data to the United States as indicated above.
		</li>
	</ol>
	<p>
		CHANGES
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong>Changes in this Privacy Policy</strong><br>
		We reserve the right to amend this Privacy Policy at any time, both for non-material clarifications and for material changes in response to changes in the industry, the law, or our own practices. Any changes to the Privacy Policy are effective immediately upon their posting here. However, Personally Identifiable Information collected previously from Users will continue to be subject to the version of the Privacy Policy in effect at the time of the last usage of the Service. If we change our Privacy Policy or <a href="/terms-of-use" target="_blank">Terms of Use</a>, we will ask Users to review and accept the changes before they can continue to use our Service. <strong>PLEASE READ THIS PRIVACY POLICY CAREFULLY. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH IT, YOU SHOULD LEAVE OUR WEBSITES AND DISCONTINUE USE OF OUR WEBSITES IMMEDIATELY.</strong>
	</p>
	<p>
		For children who are registered Users, if we desire to change our use of Personally Identifiable Information collected from children under the age of 13, we will obtain parental consent prior to implementing such changes. If we do not receive such consent we will not use the child’s Personally Identifiable Information in the new manner.
	</p>
	<p>
		ACCESS, PREFERENCES AND MARKETING CONTROLS
	</p>
