<p>The policies below are applicable to Billboard Online (the "Service") produced and maintained by BPI Communications, Inc. ("BPI").</p>

<font size="-1">

<p>For each visitor to the Service, our web server automatically recognizes only the consumer's domain name, but not the e-mail address (where possible).</p>

<p>BPI collects only the domain name, but not the e-mail address of visitors to the Service, the e-mail addresses of those who communicate with BPI via e-mail, aggregate information on what pages consumers access or visit and information volunteered by the consumer, such as survey information and/or site registrations.</p>

<p>The information BPI collects is used for internal review and is then discarded, used to improve the content of the Service, used to notify consumers about updates to the Service, shared with other reputable organizations to help them contact consumers for marketing purposes and used by BPI to contact consumers for marketing purposes.</p>

<p>If you do not want to receive e-mail from BPI in the future, please let BPI know by sending email to BPI at the above address and telling BPI that you do not want to receive e-mail from BPI.</p>

<p>From time to time, BPI may make the e-mail addresses of those who access the Service available to other reputable organizations whose products or services BPI believes you might find interesting. If you do not want BPI to share your e-mail address with other companies or organizations, please let BPI know by sending email to BPI at the above address and telling BPI that you do not want BPI to share your e-mail address with other companies.</p>

<p>From time to time, BPI may make our customer e-mail list available to other reputable organizations whose products or services BPI may think you might find interesting. If you do not want BPI to share your e-mail address with other companies or organizations, please let BPI know by sending email to BPI at the above address.</p>

<p>If you supply BPI with your postal address on-line you will only receive the information for which you provided BPI your address. You may receive mailings from other reputable companies. You can, however, have your name put on our do-not-share list by sending email to BPI at the above address.</p>

<p>Please provide BPI with your exact name and address. BPI will be sure your name is removed from the list BPI share with other organizations.</p>

<p>Persons who supply BPI with their telephone numbers on-line may receive telephone contact from BPI with information regarding orders they have placed on-line. Please provide BPI with your correct phone number. BPI will be sure your name is removed from the list BPI share with other organizations.</p>

<p>Users also should be aware that non-personal information and data may be automatically collected through the standard operation of BPI's internet servers or through the use of "cookies." "Cookies" are small text files a web site can use to recognize repeat users, facilitate the user's ongoing access to and use of the site and allow a site to track usage behavior and compile aggregate data that will allow content improvements and targeted advertising. Cookies are not programs that come onto a user's system and damage files. Generally, cookies work by assigning a unique number to the user that has no meaning outside the assigning site. Users should be aware that BPI cannot control the use of cookies or the resulting information by advertisers or third parties hosting data for BPI. If a user does not want information collected through the use of cookies, there is a simple procedure in most browsers that allows the user to deny or accept the cookie feature; however, users should note that cookies may be necessary to provide the user with certain features (e.g., customized delivery of information) available on the BPI Site.</p>

<p>Persons under the age of 18 should receive permission from the parents before supplying name, address, e-mail, phone number or any other personal information to BPI. </p>
