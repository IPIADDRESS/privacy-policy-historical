        Hi there. We realize legal documents like these are mostly never read but since you
        cared enough to click over, we want to take the opportunity to thank you and to tell
        you that your privacy and security are our top priorities at BillGuard. No, really.
        We're in the business of protecting you and that all starts with ensuring that your
        <a href="secure">financial data is safe.</a> We do not sell your personal
        information to any third party, for any reason.
    </p>

    <p class="yaron-text-section">We also go out of our way to request only the minimal
        information needed in order to notify you when BillGuard finds Grey Charges
        on your accounts. The text below explains how we use the information you provide us
        in as clear terms as possible but if anything is confusing or you'd just like to
        chat about it, please feel free to email me personally at yaron@billguard.com. I
        look forward to your email and thank you for the opportunity to earn your trust. We
        truly are safer together.</p>
