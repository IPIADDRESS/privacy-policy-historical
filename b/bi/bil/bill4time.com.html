<h3>Bill4Time.com Privacy Statement:</h3>
<p>Bill4Time.com has created this privacy statement ("Statement")             in order to demonstrate our commitment to customer privacy.   Privacy on           the Bill4Time.com web site (the "Site") is of great   importance           to us. Because we gather important information   from our visitors and customers,           we have established this   Statement as a means to communicate our information           gathering   and dissemination practices. We reserve the right to change             this Statement and will provide notification of the change at least   thirty           (30) business days prior to the change taking effect.   To be effective,           the change must first also be approved by   TRUSTe, and will include directions           on how users may respond   to the change. If we decide to change our privacy           policy, we   will post those changes to this privacy statement, the home             page, and other places we deem appropriate so that you are aware of what             information we collect, how we use it, and under what   circumstances, if           any, we disclose it.</p>
<p>We reserve the right to modify this privacy statement at any   time, so           please review it frequently. If we make material   changes to this policy,           we will notify you here, by email, or   by means of a notice on our home           page.</p>
<h3>Collected Information:</h3>
<p>We require customers who register to use the services offered on   our Site           (collectively, the "Service") to give us contact   information,           such as their name, company name, address, phone   number, and e-mail address,           and financial qualification and   billing information, such as billing name           and address, credit   card number, and the number of users within the organization             that will be using the Service. At the time you express interest in   attaining           additional information, or when you register for the   Service, we may also           ask for additional personal information,   such as title, department name,           fax number, or additional   company information, such as annual revenues,           number of   employees, or industry. Customers can opt out of providing this             additional information by not entering it when asked. Customers can   update           or remove their personal information at any time by   logging into the Website           and editing their Personal   Information within user management. Customers           can view their   updated profile to confirm their edits have been made.</p>
<p>Bill4Time.com uses the information that we collect to set up the   Service           for individuals and their organizations. We may also   use the information           to contact customers to further discuss   customer interest in our company,           the Service that we provide,   and events which may affect the Service.           Customers are   invited to receive an email newsletter by providing an email             address. Customer email addresses and any personal customer information             will not be distributed or shared with third parties.   Customers can opt           out of being contacted by us, or receiving   such information from us, at           any time by sending an email to   support@Bill4Time.com. Separately, customers           are also asked to   provide an email address when registering for the Service,           in   order to receive a username and password. We may also email information             regarding updates to the Service or company, and will send a   Customer           Newsletter. Again, email will not be distributed or   shared and customers           can opt out of receiving any   communication by emailing support@Bill4Time.com           at the time it   is distributed, or at the time any customer registers for           the   Service.</p>
<p>Except as we explicitly state at the time we request information,   or           as provided for in the Bill4Time.com Master Subscription   Agreement,           we do not disclose to third parties the information   provided. All financial           and billing information that we   collect through the Site is used solely           to check the   qualifications of prospective customers and to bill for the             Service. This billing information is not used by Bill4Time.com for   marketing           or promotional purposes. Bill4Time.com uses a   third-party intermediary           to manage the credit card processing.   This intermediary is solely a link           in the distribution chain,   and is not permitted to store, retain, or use           the information   provided, except for the sole purpose of credit card processing.             Other third parties, such as content providers, may provide content   on           the web Site but they are not permitted to collect any   information nor           does Bill4Time.com share user information with   these parties.</p>
<p>Customers of the Service will be using the Site to host data and   information           ("Data"). Bill4Time.com will not review, share,   distribute,           print, or reference any such Data except as   provided in the Bill4Time.com           Master Subscription Agreement,   or as may be required by law. Individual           records may at times   be viewed or accessed only for the purpose of resolving           a   problem, support issue, or suspected violation of the Master   Subscription           Agreement, or as may be required by law. Of   course, customers are responsible           for maintaining the   confidentiality and security of their user registration           and   password.</p>
<p>Bill4Time.com may also collect certain information from visitors   to           and customers of the Site, such as Internet addresses. This   information           is logged to help diagnose technical problems,   and to administer our Site           in order to constantly improve the   quality of the Service. We may also           track and analyze   non-identifying and aggregate usage and volume statistical             information from our visitors and customers and provide such information             to third parties.</p>
<h3>Cookies:</h3>

When you come to our   Web site, our Web           server sends a cookie to your computer.   Cookies are files that Web browsers           place on a computer's hard   drive and are used to tell us whether customers           and visitors   have visited the Site previously.</p>

Cookies             come in two flavors: session and persistent-based. Session cookies   exist           only during an online session. They disappear from your   computer when           you close your browser software or turn off your   computer. Persistent           cookies remain on your computer after   you've closed your browser or turned           off your computer. They   include such information as a unique identifier           for your   browser.</p>

We are especially careful   about the security and confidentiality           of the information   stored in persistent cookies. For example, we do not           store   account numbers or passwords in persistent cookies. Users who disable             their Web browsers' ability to accept cookies will be able to   browse our           Website but will not be able to successfully use   our Service.</p>
