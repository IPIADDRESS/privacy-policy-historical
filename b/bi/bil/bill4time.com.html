    <h1>Bill4Time Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Effective:</strong> January 2006</p>
    <p>Bill4Time.com has created this privacy statement ("Statement")           in order to demonstrate our commitment to customer privacy. Privacy on           the Bill4Time.com web site (the "Site") is of great importance           to us. Because we gather important information from our visitors and customers,           we have established this Statement as a means to communicate our information           gathering and dissemination practices. We reserve the right to change           this Statement and will provide notification of the change at least thirty           (30) business days prior to the change taking effect. If we decide to change our privacy           policy, we will post those changes to this privacy statement, the home           page, and other places we deem appropriate so that you are aware of what           information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if           any, we disclose it.</p>
    <p>We reserve the right to modify this privacy statement at any time, so           please review it frequently. If we make material changes to this policy,           we will notify you here, by email, or by means of a notice on our home           page.</p>
    <h3>Collected Information:</h3>
    <p>We require customers who register to use the services offered on our Site           (collectively, the "Service") to give us contact information,           such as their name, company name, address, phone number, and e-mail address,           and financial qualification and billing information, such as billing name           and address, credit card number, and the number of users within the organization           that will be using the Service. At the time you express interest in attaining           additional information, or when you register for the Service, we may also           ask for additional personal information, such as title, department name,           fax number, or additional company information, such as annual revenues,           number of employees, or industry. Customers can opt out of providing this           additional information by not entering it when asked. Customers can update           or remove their personal information at any time by logging into the Website           and editing their Personal Information within user management. Customers           can view their updated profile to confirm their edits have been made.</p>
    <p>Bill4Time.com uses the information that we collect to set up the Service           for individuals and their organizations. We may also use the information           to contact customers to further discuss customer interest in our company,           the Service that we provide, and events which may affect the Service.           Customers are invited to receive an email newsletter by providing an email           address. Customer email addresses and any personal customer information           will not be distributed or shared with third parties. Customers can opt           out of being contacted by us, or receiving such information from us, at           any time by sending an email to support@Bill4Time.com. Separately, customers           are also asked to provide an email address when registering for the Service,           in order to receive a username and password. We may also email information           regarding updates to the Service or company, and will send a Customer           Newsletter. Again, email will not be distributed or shared and customers           can opt out of receiving any communication by emailing support@Bill4Time.com           at the time it is distributed, or at the time any customer registers for           the Service.</p>
    <p>Except as we explicitly state at the time we request information, or           as provided for in the Bill4Time.com Master Subscription Agreement,           we do not disclose to third parties the information provided. All financial           and billing information that we collect through the Site is used solely           to check the qualifications of prospective customers and to bill for the           Service. This billing information is not used by Bill4Time.com for marketing           or promotional purposes. Bill4Time.com uses a third-party intermediary           to manage the credit card processing. This intermediary is solely a link           in the distribution chain, and is not permitted to store, retain, or use           the information provided, except for the sole purpose of credit card processing.           Other third parties, such as content providers, may provide content on           the web Site but they are not permitted to collect any information nor           does Bill4Time.com share user information with these parties.</p>
    <p>Customers of the Service will be using the Site to host data and information           ("Data"). Bill4Time.com will not review, share, distribute,           print, or reference any such Data except as provided in the Bill4Time.com           Master Subscription Agreement, or as may be required by law. Individual           records may at times be viewed or accessed only for the purpose of resolving           a problem, support issue, or suspected violation of the Master Subscription           Agreement, or as may be required by law. Of course, customers are responsible           for maintaining the confidentiality and security of their user registration           and password.</p>
    <p>Bill4Time.com may also collect certain information from visitors to           and customers of the Site, such as Internet addresses. This information           is logged to help diagnose technical problems, and to administer our Site           in order to constantly improve the quality of the Service. We may also           track and analyze non-identifying and aggregate usage and volume statistical           information from our visitors and customers and provide such information           to third parties.</p>
    <h3>Cookies:</h3>
    <p>When you interact with the Bill4Time.com Website we strive to make that           experience easy and meaningful. When you come to our Web site, our Web           server sends a cookie to your computer. Cookies are files that Web browsers           place on a computer's hard drive and are used to tell us whether customers           and visitors have visited the Site previously.</p>
    <p>We do not link the information we store in cookies to any personally           identifiable information you submit while on our site.</p>
    <p>Standing alone, cookies do not identify you personally. They merely recognize           your browser. Unless you choose to identify yourself to Bill4Time.com,           either by responding to a promotional offer, opening an account, or registering           for a 30-day Test Drive, you remain anonymous to Bill4Time.com. Cookies           come in two flavors: session and persistent-based. Session cookies exist           only during an online session. They disappear from your computer when           you close your browser software or turn off your computer. Persistent           cookies remain on your computer after you've closed your browser or turned           off your computer. They include such information as a unique identifier           for your browser.</p>
    <p>Bill4Time.com uses session cookies containing encrypted information           to allow the system to uniquely identify you while you are logged in.           This information allows Bill4Time.com to process your online transactions           and requests. Session cookies help us make sure you are who you say you           are after you've logged in and are required in order to use the Bill4Time.com           application. Bill4Time.com uses persistent cookies, that only Bill4Time.com           can read and use, to identify the fact that you are a Bill4Time.com           customer or prior Bill4Time.com Website visitor (whatever the case may           be). We are especially careful about the security and confidentiality           of the information stored in persistent cookies. For example, we do not           store account numbers or passwords in persistent cookies. Users who disable           their Web browsers' ability to accept cookies will be able to browse our           Website but will not be able to successfully use our Service.</p>
    <p><strong>Third Party Cookies:</strong> We may from time to time engage third parties to           track and analyze non-personally identifiable usage and volume statistical           information from visitors to our website to help us administer our website           and improve its quality. Such third parties may use cookies to help track           visitor behavior. Such cookies will not be used to associate individual           website visitors to any personally identifiable information. All data           collected by such third parties on behalf of Bill4Time.com is used only           to provide us with information on site usage and is not shared with any           other third parties.</p>
    <h3>Third-Party Sites:</h3>

    <h3>Security:</h3>
    <p>Our Site has security measures in place to help protect against the loss,           misuse, and alteration of the Data under our control. When our Site is           accessed using Netscape Navigator, or Microsoft Internet Explorer versions           5.5 or higher, Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology protects information           using both server authentication and data encryption to help ensure that           Data is safe, secure, and available only to you. Bill4Time.com also           implements an advanced security method based on dynamic data and encoded           session identifications, and hosts the Site in a secure server environment           that uses a firewall and other advanced technology to prevent interference           or access from outside intruders. Finally, Bill4Time.com provides unique           user names and passwords that must be entered each time a customer logs           on.
