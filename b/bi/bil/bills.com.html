          <p>Last updated: November 15,  2006.</p>
          <p>Bills.com recognizes your expectation of privacy and security, and we  greatly respect your privacy concerns.&nbsp; Your security and the security of your  personal information is a top priority for Bills.com.&nbsp; This privacy policy applies to the  information you submit on the <a href="http://www.bills.com/">www.bills.com</a> website, and outlines how we  gather information and how bills.com maintains your private data to ensure our  goal of satisfied and trusted users.&nbsp;  This Privacy Policy does not apply to websites maintained by other partners  or companies that we link to or that we work with – for information on other partners’  policies, please refer to their own privacy policies.&nbsp; If you have questions or concerns regarding  this Privacy Policy, you contact Bills.com at customercare@bills.com.</p><p>
            By  participating in the Council of Better Business Bureau's BBBOnLine®  Reliability Program, we have made a commitment to meet the program's strict  requirements regarding how we treat your information and have our practices  approved by BBBOnLine. </p>
          <!-- <p align="left">Bills.com is a licensee of the TRUSTe  Privacy Program.&nbsp; TRUSTe is an  independent, non-profit organization whose mission is to build user&rsquo;s trust and  confidence in the Internet by promoting the use of fair information practices.&nbsp; This privacy statement covers the site  www.bills.com .&nbsp; Because this Web site  wants to demonstrate its commitment to your privacy, it has agreed to disclose  its information practices and have its privacy practices reviewed for  compliance by TRUSTe.</p>

              </p>-->
           <p align="left">   <strong>Information Collection</strong><br>
            In order  to operate the Bills.com service and to provide to you the valuable services  that you request through this website, Bills.com, Inc. ("Bills.com"  or "we") must ask you to provide us information about yourself.&nbsp; </p>
          <p align="left">The information we collect may  be from the following sources:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Information       provided by you in connection with obtaining financial products or       services that you have requested; this may include, but not limited to,       the following: full name, address, city, state, zip code, work phone, home       phone, email address, home type, current home value, loan amount requested,       1st mortgage balance, rate and payment, estimated credit rating, employment       status, yearly income and bankruptcy history.</li>
            <li>Information you       provide us when you register (such as your email address).&nbsp; Personally Identifiable Information       given to <a href="http://www.bills.com/">www.bills.com</a> is retained in our database for future use.&nbsp; We will not use your provided PII       without first obtaining your consent.</li>
            <li>Information,       including your email address, when you ask a question in the “Ask Bill”       section of the website (so that we can respond and post our answer to your       question). </li>
          </ul>
          <p align="left"><strong>Information Sharing, Use and Disclosure</strong><br>
            If  you apply for any services offered through the Bills.com Web site that are  provided or fulfilled by third parties, those third parties will have their own  privacy policies governing the use of the information that you have requested  for Bills.com to provide or transfer to them.&nbsp;  You authorize Bills.com to exchange the information you provide in the  application forms with the third party service providers.&nbsp; These third-parties are prohibited form using  this information for any other purposes, including marketing other offers  directly to you. <br>
            We do not share personal information about you with other  people or nonaffiliated companies except to provide product or services you  have requested or under the following circumstances:<br>
            <br>
  <strong>Products or Service Requests<br>
  </strong> If you  submit a request for a product or service such as debt consolidation, debt  management, mortgage, bill pay, loans, credit products, insurance or other  services we may offer, we will share the personal information contained in your  request form such as your full name, telephone number and email address with  our business partners to process and fulfill your request. Our business  partners may contact you by telephone, email, or mail based on the information  you provided to us, even if you have opted into the National Do Not Call List  administered by the Federal Trade Commission, any state equivalent Do Not Call  List, or the Do Not Call List of an internal company. If one of our partners  contacts you by telephone and you wish not to be contacted again by that  business partner with respect to your inquiry, then you should specifically  make a request to that partner not to contact you again. <br>
  <strong><br>
  As Permitted by Law -</strong> We may be  required to share your personal information with law enforcement or government  agencies in response to subpoenas, court orders, federal/state audits or  similar circumstances. We believe it is necessary to share information in order  to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected  fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any  person, violations of Bills.com's <u>Terms of Use</u>, or as  otherwise required by law.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>Business Transfer -</strong> As with any  other business, it is possible that Bills.com in the future could merge with or  be acquired by another company. If such an acquisition occurs, the successor  company would have access to the information maintained by Bills.com, including  customer account information, but would continue to be bound by this privacy Policy  unless you consent otherwise. <br>
  <strong><br>
  Framing  &amp; Masking</strong> <br>
            Bills.com frames and masks certain business partners’ urls, to help you  more easily return to Bills.com’s site.&nbsp;  One way we do this is when Bills.com directs you to the website of a  recommended business partner – for example, when you want to apply for a health  insurance quote through our business partner eHealthInsurance.com –&nbsp; Bills.com will take you to their page to  complete the application. &nbsp;&nbsp;In this  scenario, &nbsp;the  information these providers request and make available is presented in a “framed"  format, where Bills.com’s &nbsp;border will  surround the pages served by the service provider.&nbsp; Another way we do this - for example – is  when you request our Bill Pay service, you will be directed to to a page where Bills.com’s  branding is framing the site and masking the url&nbsp; which gives the user the look and feel of  Bills.com’s site, when they are actually on <a href="http://www.ehealthinsurance.com/">www.ehealthinsurance.com</a> or other  business partner site. &nbsp;This helps the  user to easily return to Bills.com’s site.&nbsp;  In either scenario, the trusted service provider is prominently  identified&nbsp; and you will be told in the  header that a third party is collecting your data and their privacy policy  governs this colletion and use.&nbsp; Please  be aware that any information you provide on these framed or masked pages is  provided directly to those service providers and is subject to their security  and privacy policies. We encourage you to read the privacy policies of these  outside service providers’ sites, &nbsp;because their privacy practices may differ  from ours <br>
            <br>
            &nbsp;The information transmitted to third parties  or business parties may include your name, telephone number, street address,  email address and information that you provide about your specific financial  situation.<br>
  <strong><br>
  Advertisements &amp; Pop Up Windows</strong><br>
            On occasion, you may receive advertisements for Bills.com from third parties.  For instance, when visiting a third party website, you may receive a "pop  up" window advertising Bills.com. Please note that such advertisements are  served by the third party website that you have visited and are not controlled  by Bills.com. In addition, such advertisements may be placed by third party ad  servers or ad networks. We maintain relationships with a number of the third  party ad networks currently operating. <br>
  <strong><br>
  Anti-Spam Policy</strong><br>
            You will not receive Bills.com email communications unless you submit your  email address to us and register to receive them. Additionally, you may also  receive emails that advertise Bills.com's services from third party publishers.  We have established firm ground rules for dealing with any third party email  services to ensure that advertisements for Bills.com are not sent out through a  "Spam" mailing -- ensuring that our offers are sent only to those  individuals who have given their permission to the third party email service to  receive email communications. If any third party email publisher refuses to  abide by Bills.com's anti-Spam policy, we will not use that publisher's  services. If you want to stop receiving emails from a third party, you should  follow the opt-out instructions included in the third party email so that you  will not be included in any future mailings. An "unsubscribe" link  should appear within or at the top or bottom of the email you received. However  if for any reason it does not work, please bring that to our attention by  emailing us at <a href="mailto:customercare@bills.com">customercare@bills.com</a>.<br>
  <strong><br>
  Testimonials</strong> <br>
            If you submit a testimonial to us, we will ask for your  permission to post your testimonial prior to posting on the Web site. We will  post your first name and last initial.&nbsp;  We may post a photo of you or use a stock photo.&nbsp; Please be aware that any personally  identifiable information you submit as a testimonial to be posted can be read,  collected, or used by the general public, and could be used to send you  unsolicited messages.&nbsp; We are not responsible  for the personally identifiable information you choose to submit to us as a  testimonial.&nbsp; If you would like to your  testimonial removed at any time, please contact us at <a href="mailto:customercare@bills.com">customercare@bills.com</a>. <br>
            <br>
  <strong>Log Files</strong><br>
            As is true of most Web sites, we gather certain information  automatically and store it in log files.&nbsp;  This information includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser  type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time  stamp, and clickstream data.&nbsp; We use this  information, which does not identify individual users, to analyze trends, to  administer the site, to track users’ movements around the site and to gather  demographic information about our user base as a whole.&nbsp; We do not link this automatically-collected  data to personally identifiable information.&nbsp;  IP addresses are tied to personally identifiable information to help us  remember your information during your visit to the Bills.com Web site.&nbsp; We use an internal program that uses log  files to track non-personally identifiable information about visitors (what  pages were visited, for how long and in what order) to our site in the  aggregate to assist us in analyzing user behavior and to improve the layout of  the website to make it easier to use.<br>
  <strong><br>
  Web Beacons</strong><br>
            We employ a software technology called Web Beacons, that  help us better manage content on our site by informing us what content is  effective.&nbsp; Clear gifs are tiny graphics  with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track  the online movements of Web users.&nbsp; In  contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, clear  gifs are embedded invisibly on Web pages and are about the size of the period  at the end of this sentence. We tie the information gathered by clear gifs to  our customers’ personally identifiable information in order to track 1) which  website the customer came from and 2) which form the customer may have  completed.&nbsp; This tracking helps us to  improve the website for the benefit of future website visitors. <br>
            <br>
            <strong>Cookies and  IP Addresses</strong><br>
            To serve you faster and with better quality, we use "cookies"  technology. "Cookies"  are small files of data that reside on your computer and allow us to recognize  you as a Bills.com customer if you return to the Bills.com site using the same  computer and browser. We send a "session cookie" to your computer if  and when you log in to your Bills.com account by entering your e-mail address  and password. These cookies allow us to recognize you if you visit multiple  pages in our site during the same session, so that you don't need to re-enter  your password multiple times. Once you log out or close your browser, these  session cookies expire and no longer have any effect. Some of our business  partners (e.g., advertisers) use cookies on our site.&nbsp; We have no access to or control over these  cookies. See “Third Party Links.”</p>
          <p align="left"><strong>Third  Party Advertisers<br>
          </strong>We allow some of our business partners to  use cookies and clear GIFs on this site, allowing them to track a successful  completion of a form when a user visits this site. The information collected through  this technology is not personally identifiable.<br>
            <strong><br>
            Confidentiality and Security</strong><br>
          The security of your personal information is very important at Bills.com and we  take a number of steps to safeguard it. For example: </p>
          <ul type="disc">
            <li>We limit access to       personal information to those employees or agents who assist us in       providing requested products and services to you. Employees are required       to comply with our strict policies and procedures regarding the handling       of your personal information. Employees who violate these policies are       subject to our normal disciplinary process. </li>
            <li>We maintain       physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards that comply with federal       standards to guard personal information about you. </li>
            <li>We use industry       standard data encryption technologies when transferring and receiving       consumer data on the Bills.com website. </li>
            <li>We have partnered       with VeriSign to protect against the loss, misuse or alteration of       information that we collect from you. </li>
          </ul>
          <p align="left"><strong>Opting-Out</strong><br>
            If you do not want us to share your information with our partners, do not  submit your information on the loan request or other forms on our Web site.  Information submitted on our site is shared with our trusted third parties, in  order to provide you with the specific services or information that you  requested.&nbsp; If you no longer wish to  receive communications from these third parties, please contact them  directly.&nbsp; Third party advertisers that maintain  their own mailing lists may send communications that  advertise our services, and you may need to contact these parties directly in  order to stop receiving their email communications. <br>
  <strong><br>
  Third Party Links</strong><br>
            This Privacy Policy applies to all information that you provide to Bills.com.  However, when you visit websites to which Bills.com provides a link, keep in  mind you will be interacting with a third party that operates under its own  privacy and security policy. If you choose to obtain certain services through a  third party site, the data collected by the third party is governed by that  third party's privacy policy. A third party site will also have its own policy  regarding the use of cookies and clear gifs. We encourage you to review the  privacy policies of any other service provider from whom you request services.<br>
  <br>
            If Bills.com receives personal information from a third party that is not in  conjunction with a service offered on our site, the use and disclosure of such  information is governed by the agreement (if any) between Bills.com and such  third party. <br>
