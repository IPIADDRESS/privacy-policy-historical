<strong>Bill Me Later Shopping Privacy Policy</strong>
<p>This Privacy Policy is provided by Bill Me Later Marketing LLC, ("Bill Me Later Marketing", "Bill Me Later Shopping", "we", "us" or "our").</p>

<p>This Privacy Policy applies to any information you provide on the Bill Me Later Shopping websites, including <a href="http://shopping.billmelater.com">http://shopping.billmelater.com</a> that will be held by Bill Me Later Marketing.  Please read this Privacy Policy carefully and keep it for your records.  If you already have a customer relationship with Bill Me Later Marketing or Bill Me Later, Inc. the Privacy Policy governing that relationship may be different.</p>

<p><strong>Our Commitment:  Protecting the privacy of the nonpublic personal information ("Information") you share with us is one of our top priorities. We value your trust and want you to understand what Information we collect, how we keep it safe, and how we use it.</strong></p>

<p>This Privacy Policy includes examples of the types of Information we collect and the kind of companies with which we may share such Information. We give you these examples to help you understand our Privacy Policy; they are not a complete listing of our Information collection, use and sharing practices.</p>

<p>You may have other privacy rights in some states, such as Vermont and California. To the extent state laws apply, we will comply with them when we share Information about you. For example, if you provide us with a Vermont address, we will not share credit report information about you with our related family of companies unless you permit us to do so or as otherwise permitted by law.</p>

<p>Please note, if you provide Information to other companies from whom you purchase products and services, this Privacy Policy will not apply to the Information those companies collect. Those companies privacy policies will govern how they collect, use and share Information that you allow them to access.</p>

<strong>Collection of Information</strong>

<p>In order to give you products and services you request, and as we believe is helpful to decide your eligibility for products or services, we may collect the following types of Information about you from the following sources:</p>

<ul>
<li>Information we receive from you (or is given to us on your behalf) in an application and on forms, such as your name, address, telephone number, social security number, email address, employer and income;</li>
<li>Information about your transactions with us or others.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Information We May Share and With Whom We May Share Information</strong></p>

<p><strong>We do not sell your Information to any outside organization without your consent.  We do not disclose your Information to any of our related companies or outside organizations other than as described in this Policy.</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Disclosures by Bill Me Later Marketing Among Companies in Its Corporate Family.</strong>Bill Me Later Marketing may disclose all the Information described above among companies within its corporate family (related or affiliated companies), which may include financial institutions (such as banks or finance companies) or nonfinancial institutions (such as online retail companies).</li>

<li><strong>Additional Disclosures Permitted by Law.</strong>We may share all of the Information described above, as permitted by law. For example, we may disclose Information to related or affiliated companies that perform services for us, such as taking customer calls, processing your Account, preparing your Account statements, processing your payments and providing software for us.  We also may disclose Information to unrelated companies that perform such services for us.  We may share Information to answer questions from law enforcement agencies or state and federal banking regulators, or to respond to a subpoena or protect against fraud.  We may also share Information with your consent.</li>
<li><strong>Disclosures for Joint Marketing and Servicing.</strong>We may share all of the Information described above with companies that provide marketing services for us (for example, affiliates and unrelated companies, including financial companies such as banks and insurers; non-financial companies, such as direct marketers and mail houses; and others) or with other financial companies, such as insurers, banks and securities broker-dealers with which we have joint marketing agreements.</li>
</ul>

<strong>Information Regarding Former Customers</strong>
<p>We share Information about former customers with inactive or closed Accounts only as described in this Privacy Policy.</p>

<strong>Our Security Procedures</strong>
<p>We limit use of Information about you to those employees, agents or contractors who we believe have a legitimate business purpose to access such Information. We maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards that comply with or exceed federal standards to keep Information about you safe.  We require companies working for us to protect Information.  They agree to use it only to provide the services we ask them to perform for us.</p>

<strong>Changes to This Privacy Policy</strong>
<p>We may change or replace this Privacy Policy at any time. If we make material changes, we will provide current customers with a revised notice that describes our new practices or a link to the new privacy policy.</p>

<strong>Website Privacy Statement</strong><br><br>

<strong>Online Consumer Information Practices</strong>
<p>Bill Me Later Marketing LLC, ("Bill Me Later Marketing", "Bill Me Later Shopping", "we", "us", "our"), are committed to your privacy and security online.  We want to satisfy you and provide a superior online experience while respecting your privacy.</p>

<strong>Visiting Our Web Site</strong>

<p>You can browse our site anonymously without identifying yourself during your visit. We will obtain information that personally identifies you when you specifically choose to provide it.</p>
<p>For example, during your visits to our web sites, you may request information, contact us, apply for Bill Me Later products or services or conduct transactions online. You will then need to give us certain personal information just as you would if you were communicating with us in person, by mail or by telephone. Be assured that we maintain electronic security safeguards to help protect personal information about you that we obtain via the Internet. </p>
<p>By providing information about yourself and your preferences, you can enhance your online experience with us. And, we will be able to better service your requests and/or inquiries.</p>

<strong>How We Collect Information Online</strong>
<p>When you visit our site we may ask you to "sign-in," complete a survey, or answer simple questions. These may include questions such as where you live, your e-mail address and your interest in receiving e-mail on new products and services. We collect this information so that we can determine what kinds of products and services are of most interest to you. </p>

<strong>Online Tracking </strong>
<p>We may track activity and transactions on an individually identifiable basis if you use the Bill Me Later Shopping services. We may use identification information we collect in order to protect against actual or potential fraud. In order to constantly improve our web site and better serve our customers online, we may use various tracking methods (such as cookies and other technologies, etc.) to gather information about site visitors' browsing activities.</p>

<strong>Cookies</strong>
<p>"Cookies" are small amounts of data that a web site can send to a web browser on a visitor's computer. The cookie is stored on a visitor's computer. A cookie may enable the site holder to track how a visitor navigates through its site and the areas in which they show interest. This is similar to a traffic report: it tracks trends and behaviors, but does not identify individuals. Information gathered may include date and time of visits, pages viewed, time spent at the site, and the site visited just before and just after the Bill Me Later Shopping site. </p>

<strong>Types of Cookies</strong>
<p>Cookies can be set to expire: </p>

<ul>
<li>on a specified date</li>
<li>after a specific period of time</li>
<li>when a transaction has been completed</li>

<li>or when a user turns off his/her browser.</li>
</ul>

<p>A cookie that is erased from memory when a visitor's browser closes is called a "session" cookie. Cookies that expire based on a time set by the Web server are called "persistent" cookies. </p>
<p>Persistent cookies may be used in some cases, for example, to recognize when a visitor returns to a web site. The web browser will send the cookie information from the initial visit back to the web site. This is useful to the visitor if he or she has established a username or preferences at a particular web site and wants to be identified by that site to perform a function or transaction. </p>
<p>To browse anonymously, you may set your browser to disable cookies or delete cookies. See Refusing Cookies below. Please note that disabling cookies for some services will impact ability to use that service. </p>

<strong>Refusing Cookies on the Bill Me Later Web sites</strong>
<p>Customers may choose not to accept cookies. Your web browser may alert and permit you to refuse cookies. When you receive an alert, you may choose at that time to refuse that cookie. If the use of cookies is a concern to you, then please make sure your browser has this capability, and that you set your browser to alert you accordingly. Newer browser versions allow you to be alerted or to automatically refuse cookies. You may need to download a more current version of your web browser from your service provider in order to obtain this option. The Bill Me Later Shopping websites require the acceptance of cookies to function properly. </p>

<strong>Online Advertising</strong>

<p>We use cookies to evaluate our web site and to track advertising leads and campaigns from banner Ads, opt in e-mails and through third party ad services.  We may hire companies such as third party ad services to track and report performance of advertising and marketing campaigns to and from Bill Me Later Shopping and third party web sites. We permit certain of these companies to set cookies and use related technology, such as tracking pixels. </p>
<p>These tracking pixels (also known as action tags, web beacons, or transparent GIF files) and other similar tracking technologies may be used to collect and store information about user visits, such as the user's anonymous cookie ID, page visits and duration, and the specific ad or link(s) that the user clicked on to visit the site. No personally identifiable information is stored on these cookies or web pixels. This user activity information is reported to us in aggregate and is anonymous. We use this information in aggregate to understand, for example, the effectiveness of our advertising and marketing. </p>

<strong>E-mail Communications</strong>
<p>If you choose to send us an e-mail message, we may retain the content of the e-mail, your e-mail address, and our response in order to service your needs. </p>
<p>If you agree to receive e-mail offers or e-mail messages from Bill Me Later Shopping, we may use the data that you provide to send you e-mail offers that may be of special interest to you. If you unsubscribe from these e-mail messages, you will not receive these messages from Bill Me Later Shopping via e-mail. See E-mail Opt Out below for more details. </p>
<p>Please note that some of our services including the Bill Me Later Shopping website require a valid e-mail address in order to register and/or continue use of the service. You will receive e-mail alerts or notification messages from these programs unless you un-enroll from these services. </p>

<strong>E-mail Opt Out </strong>
<p>If you no longer wish to receive e-mail offers or solicitations from Bill Me Later Shopping, you may unsubscribe by following the instructions in the original e-mail you received. The instructions are generally located at the bottom of the e-mail. If you receive e-mails from third parties or program partners on behalf of Bill Me Later Shopping, please be sure to unsubscribe through the instructions in the e-mail or contact these third parties directly. </p>

<p>If you opt out of e-mail solicitations, Bill Me Later Shopping reserves the right to contact you via e-mail to service and maintain your relationship. </p>

<strong>E-mail Tips </strong>
<p>Do not provide your e-mail address to third party web sites without reading the privacy and security policies and terms and conditions of these sites to ensure you understand the circumstances in which your e-mail address will be used. </p>
<p>If you suspect suspicious or fraudulent activity related to your account(s), please let your account provider know right away. You should also contact your Internet Service Provider so they may block suspicious messages from your e-mail inbox. To learn more about how to control and manage your incoming e-mails, please refer to your Internet Service Providers' online resources. You may also visit the Federal Trade Commission's web site on spam at <a href="http://www.ftc.gov/spam">http://www.ftc.gov/spam</a>.</p>

<strong>Links to Third Party Sites</strong>
<p>Bill Me Later Marketing is not responsible for the information practices employed by sites linked to or from our web site. In most cases, links to non-Bill Me Later Shopping web sites are provided solely as pointers to information on topics that may be useful to the users of the Bill Me Later Shopping web site. Since third party web sites may have different privacy policies and/or security standards governing their sites, we advise you to review the privacy policies and terms and conditions of these sites prior to providing any personal information.</p>

<strong>Children's Online Privacy </strong>
<p>Protecting children on the Internet is very important to us. For that reason, Bill Me Later Marketing does not intentionally collect information at our web sites from those we actually know are under 13, and no part of our web site is intended to attract anyone under 13. Parents can be proactive and limit web site access to their children by installing filtering software. </p>
<p><strong>Children's access to the Internet can permit them to visit inappropriate web sites and be exposed to unnecessary risks. The Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) protects children under the age of 13 from the online collection of personal information. Learn more about COPPA at the Federal Trade Commission's web site for children's privacy at <a href="http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/conline/edcams/kidzprivacy/index.html">http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/conline/edcams/kidzprivacy/index.html</a> and by viewing the following link on How to Protect Kids' Privacy Online.</strong></p>
