You can browse our site anonymously without identifying yourself during your visit. We will obtain information that personally identifies you when you specifically choose to provide it. <br>
<br>
For example, during your visits to our web sites, you may request information, contact us, apply for Chase products or services or conduct transactions online. You will then need to give us certain personal information just as you would if you were communicating with us in person, by mail or by telephone. Be assured that we maintain electronic security safeguards to help protect personal information about you that we obtain via the Internet. </p>
                <p>By providing information about yourself and your preferences, you can enhance your online experience with us. And, we will be able to better service your requests and/or inquiries.</p>

                  <br>
When you visit our site we may ask you to "sign-in," complete a survey, or answer simple questions. These may include questions such as where you live, your e-mail address and your interest in receiving e-mail from Chase on new products and services. We collect this information so that we can determine what kinds of products and services are of most interest to you. </p>

                    <br>
                    We may track activity and transactions on an individually identifiable basis if you apply for or use a Chase product or service online. We may use identification information we collect in order to protect against actual or potential fraud. In order to constantly improve our web site and better serve our customers online, Chase may use various tracking methods (such as cookies and other technologies, etc.) to gather information about site visitors' browsing activities.</p>
                  <p> <b>Cookies</b> <br>
                    <br>
"Cookies" are small amounts of data that a web site can send to a web browser on a visitor's computer. The cookie is stored on a visitor's computer. A cookie may enable the site holder to track how a visitor navigates through its site and the areas in which they show interest. This is similar to a traffic report: it tracks trends and behaviors, but does not identify individuals. Information gathered may include date and time of visits, pages viewed, time spent at the site, and the site visited just before and just after the Chase site. </p>
                  <p><b>Types of Cookies <br>
                    <br>
                  </b>Cookies can be set to expire: </p>

                <p>                  A cookie that is erased from memory when a visitor's browser closes is called a "session" cookie. Cookies that expire based on a time set by the Web server are called "persistent" cookies. <br>
                  <br>
                  Persistent cookies may be used in some cases, for example, to recognize when a visitor returns to a web site. The web browser will send the cookie information from the initial visit back to the web site. This is useful to the visitor if he or she has established a password at a particular web site and wants to be identified by that site to perform a function or transaction. <br>

Customers may choose not to accept cookies. Your web browser may alert and permit you to refuse cookies. When you receive an alert, you may choose at that time to refuse that cookie.

  <b>E-mail Tips </b><br>
  <br>
  Do not provide your e-mail address to third party web sites without reading the privacy and security policies and terms and conditions of these sites to ensure you understand the circumstances in which your e-mail address will be used. <br>
  <br>
  If you suspect suspicious or fraudulent activity related to your account(s), please let your account provider know right away. You should also contact your Internet Service Provider so they may block suspicious messages from your e-mail inbox. To learn more about how to control and manage your incoming e-mails, please refer to your Internet Service Providers' online resources.

In most cases, links to non-Chase web sites are provided solely as pointers to information on topics that may be useful to the users of the Chase web site.

                  <br>
Protecting children on the Internet is very important to us. For that reason, Chase does not intentionally collect information at our web sites from those we actually know are under 13, and no part of our web site is intended to attract anyone under 13. Parents can be proactive and limit web site access to their children by installing filtering software. </p>
                Children's access to the Internet can permit them to visit inappropriate web sites and be exposed to unnecessary risks. The Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) protects children under the age of 13 from the online collection of personal information.

            </blockquote>            <p> <b>Encryption/Browser Check</b> <br>
              <br>
Encryption is the scrambling of data into a code that is unreadable to anyone who does not have the key that deciphers it. Only you and Chase have the key to unlock your code. With Bill Me Later, all your account information is protected by 128-bit encryption to maintain the privacy and confidentiality of your data. To take advantage of strong encryption technology, you will need to obtain a secure browser, one that supports 128-bit encryption. </p>
