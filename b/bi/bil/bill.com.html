</p><h3>Our Security Procedures</h3><br>
<p>
We design and maintain security procedures that protect your information on-line and off-line. We support 256-bit Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology. We encrypt all sensitive data in our database. We use firewalls to prevent unauthorized electronic access to the servers where your information is stored. The servers are in a secure environment to prevent unauthorized physical access. Our employees may access your information only to help us provide you with our service. We educate all of our employees about the importance of keeping our customers' information confidential and secure.
We will make any legally required disclosures of any breach of the security, confidentiality, or integrity of your unencrypted electronically stored personal information to you via email or conspicuous posting on this Site without unreasonable delay, insofar as consistent with (i) the legitimate needs of law enforcement or (ii) any measures necessary to determine the scope of the breach and restore the reasonable integrity of the data system.<br>
<br>
When you sign up for Bill.com, you provide an email address and password to access our web site. You can help protect your information by keeping your password secret and by changing it from time-to-time.<br>
<br>
We will retain your information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you services. Please contact us if you wish to cancel your account or request that we no longer use your information to provide you services.  We will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.<br>
<br>

<strong>What Information Bill.com Collects, and How It Is Used</strong><br>
<br>
In order to provide Bill.com's service, our web site asks you to provide personally identifiable information about you, your employees and anyone you sign up on Bill.com. This information includes your company's name, address, phone number and your business tax identification number, and your employees' names and email addresses. We will also ask for a credit card to pay for your subscription to Bill.com. If you enroll others on Bill.com, we will ask them to provide a name and email address. If you elect to use Bill.com's payment service, Bill.com will also collect your company's bank account details. Bill.com will use this and other information collected about you to verify your identity and your company's creditworthiness.<br>
<br>
Bill.com asks you to provide information about how to contact you by telephone, fax and e-mail. We will use this information to provide you with updated information and service your account in other ways. We may also use this information to contact you about additional products or services that may be of interest to you. You will have an opportunity to "opt out" of such offers in the future, if you so choose, by following the instructions set forth in the offer that we send you.<br>
<br>
If you sign up your accountant, he or she may use Bill.com to process payables and receivables for you. Accordingly, your accountant may enter the foregoing types of personally identifiable information on behalf of you. Bill.com will use this information for the purposes of verifying identity and creditworthiness, as described above. When you send emails or otherwise communicate with Bill.com, we may retain those communications in order to process your requests and inquiries and improve the quality of our Site.<br>
<br>
We use a technology called "cookies" to keep track of who visits our site. A cookie is an element of data that a web site can send to your browser, which may then store it on your system. You can set your browser to notify you when you receive a cookie, giving you the chance to decide whether to accept it. If you do not accept cookies from Bill.com, you will not be able to use our site. Usage of a cookie is in no way linked to any personally identifiable information while on our site.
The use of third party cookies by our partners, affiliates, tracking utility company, service providers is not covered by our privacy statement. We do not have access or control over these cookies. Our partners, affiliates, tracking utility company, service providers use session ID cookies to make it easier for you to navigate our site.<br>
<br>
In addition to cookies, we collect the following information from all visitors to our site: the name of the domain through which you access the internet; the date and time you access our site; the internet address from which you linked to our site; and the individual address of the computer you used to access our site. We use this information in the aggregate to administer our web site, to help diagnose and trouble shoot potential server malfunctions, and to gather broad demographic information about usage of our web site.<br>
<br>
We may also collect other information as part of the registration and personalization process (e.g., zip code and individual preferences). Certain non-identifying information would be considered a part of your personal information if it were combined with other identifiers (e.g., combining your zip code with your street address) in a way that enables you to be identified. However, the same pieces of information are considered non-identifying information when they are taken alone or combined only with other non-identifying information (e.g., your viewing preferences). We may combine your personal information with non-identifying information and aggregate it with information collected from other users to attempt to provide you with a better experience, to improve the quality and value of the Site and to analyze and understand how the Site is used.<br>
<br>
Bill.com does not share, rent, or trade Personally Identifiable Information with third parties for their promotional purposes. <br>

We may track whether these links have been followed to improve the quality of the Site and Bill.com's partnership activities.

We do not exercise control over third party sites. These other sites may place their own cookies or other files on your computer, collect data or solicit personal information from you. This privacy policy addresses the use and disclosure of information that we collect from you through this Site. Other sites follow different rules regarding the use or disclosure of the personal information you submit to them. We encourage you to read the privacy policies or statements of the other sites you visit.<br>

<strong>International Transfer</strong><br>
<br>
Your information may be transferred to and maintained on computers located outside of your state, province, country or other governmental jurisdiction where the privacy laws may not be as protective as those in your jurisdiction. If you are located outside the United States and choose to provide information to us, Bill.com transfers personal information to the United States for processing. Your submission of such information represents your agreement to that transfer.<br>
