For example, a Service Provider may be asked to serve as a Vault Operator, operate a Verification Network, process transactions, provide credit reports or assessments, verify customer identities, detect suspicious transactions, perform security services, and manage or audit our operations. In some cases, as described in Section 3, a Service Provider will be collecting your personal information from other sources on our behalf to fulfill the purposes set out in Section 4. We also may use a Service Provider to host and administer one or more of our BitGold Sites, process and store data, and fulfill similar technology-related functions on our behalf. In these circumstances, the personal information that the Service Provider receives is limited to the personal information needed to render their service to us.</span></p><p><span class="section-number">5.2</span> <span class="section-content">In certain cases, we may also share some of the personal information we collect with carefully selected business partners, who are first required to sign an agreement that obligates them to keep the information confidential and secure and prohibits them from using it for unauthorized purposes.</span></p><p><span class="section-number">5.3</span> <span class="section-content">We may disclose personal information without notice to you if a law, regulation, search warrant, subpoena, court order, or regulatory notice permits or requires us to do so.

You agree that all telephone calls and electronic communications may be recorded and kept by us as a record of your instructions. You also agree that we may contact you electronically in response to a request, inquiry, or complaint, as otherwise solicited by you, or as permitted or required by law.</span></p><p><span class="section-number">6.2</span> <span class="section-content">We may also communicate with you from time to time electronically about news, promotions, special offers and other information from BitGold, regarding either BitGold or its selected partners.
