        <li>
          <h4>2.1. EU-US and Swiss-US Privacy Shield Frameworks</h4>
          <p>Bitium adheres to the EU-US and Swiss-US Privacy Shield Frameworks as set forth by the US Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use and retention of personal information from European Union member countries and Switzerland. Bitium Services are certified for both Privacy Shield frameworks under the self-certification of Google LLC, which wholly owns Bitium, Inc.. More information about Google’s certification is available at <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy/frameworks" target="_blank">https://policies.google.com/privacy/frameworks</a>, and you can view Google’s certification on the Privacy Shield website at <a href="https://www.privacyshield.gov" target="_blank">www.privacyshield.gov</a>.</p>
          <p>Bitium remains responsible for any of your personal data that is shared under the Onward Transfer Principle with third parties.</p>
          <p>If you have an inquiry regarding our privacy practices in relation to our Privacy Shield certification, we encourage you to contact us at <script type="text/javascript">eval(decodeURIComponent('%64%6f%63%75%6d%65%6e%74%2e%77%72%69%74%65%28%27%3c%61%20%68%72%65%66%3d%5c%22%6d%61%69%6c%74%6f%3a%62%69%74%69%75%6d%2d%64%70%74%40%67%6f%6f%67%6c%65%2e%63%6f%6d%5c%22%3e%62%69%74%69%75%6d%2d%64%70%74%40%67%6f%6f%67%6c%65%2e%63%6f%6d%3c%5c%2f%61%3e%27%29%3b'))</script><a href="mailto:bitium-dpt@google.com">bitium-dpt@google.com</a>. Bitium is subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC). You may also refer a complaint to your local data protection authority and we will work with them to resolve your concern. In certain circumstances, the Privacy Shield Framework provides the right to invoke binding arbitration to resolve complaints not resolved by other means, as described in Annex I to the Privacy Shield Principles.</p>

          <p>We collect and store any information you enter when asking for more information about Bitium Services, registering for and using Bitium Services, or provide to us in any other way. For example, when registering for a user account, we request your name and email address, among other information. You will also be asked to choose a unique username and a password, which will be used solely for the purpose of providing access to your user account.

By selecting ‘keep me signed-in’ or related options in Bitium Services, a permanent cookie will be stored in your computer and you will not be required to sign-in by providing complete login information each time you return to certain parts of our website.

      <p>We may from time to time employ the services of a third party agent to analyze statistical and aggregate data about our Bitium Websites content and user base. This aggregated information is not personally identifiable and is employed in improving website functionality and offerings.

      <h3>5. Links from Bitium Websites</h3>
      <p>
        Some pages of Bitium Websites contain external links. You are advised to verify the privacy practices of any other websites you access while using the Bitium Services. We are not responsible for the manner of use or misuse of information made available by you at such other websites. We encourage you not to provide Personal Information, without assuring yourself of the Privacy Policy of other websites.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3>6. Sharing Information</h3>
      <p>We may need to disclose Personal Information to our affiliates, service providers and business partners solely for the purpose of providing Bitium Services to you. In such cases Bitium will also ensure that such affiliates, service providers and business partners comply with this Privacy Policy and adopt appropriate confidentiality and security measures. We will obtain your prior specific consent before we share or disclose your Personal Information to any person outside Bitium for any purpose that is not directly connected with providing Bitium Services to you. We may share generic aggregated demographic information not linked to any Personal Information regarding users with our business partners and advertisers. Please be aware that laws in various jurisdictions in which we operate may obligate us to disclose user information and the contents of your user account to the local law enforcement authorities under a legal process or an enforceable government request. In addition, we may also disclose Personal Information and contents of your user account upon a lawful request by government authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements if disclosure is determined to be necessary by Bitium in our sole and absolute discretion for protecting the safety of our users, employees, or the general public.</p>
      <p>Bitium shall remain liable under the Privacy Shield Principles for onward transfers to its agents, if its agent processes Privacy Shield information in a manner inconsistent with the Principles, unless Bitium can prove that it is not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3>7. Legal Requests</h3>
      <p>
        Bitium requires appropriate legal process (i.e., subpoena, court order, or other valid process) before disclosing non-public user account information. In the United States, this means Bitium requires a search warrant before disclosing to law enforcement the contents of non-public user communications. Bitium will not provide any non-public user information to non-U.S. law enforcement agencies without a valid U.S. court order (via the mutual legal assistance treaties or letter rogatory). Bitium will attempt to notify users of law enforcement requests for information except where (1) we are legally prohibited from providing notice (e.g. by an order under 18 U.S.C. 2705(b)); (2) an emergency situation exists involving a danger of death or serious physical injury to a person; or (3) we have reason to believe notice wouldn’t go to the actual account holder (e.g. an account has been hijacked).
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3>8. Security</h3>
      <p>
        We follow industry appropriate data collection, storage and processing practices and security measures, as well as physical security measures to protect against unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure or destruction of your Personal Information, username, password, transaction information and data stored in your user account. Access to your name and email address is restricted to our employees who need to know such information in connection with providing Bitium Services to you and are bound by confidentiality obligations.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3>9. Information Choices</h3>
      <p>
        You will be required to register for our Bitium Services by providing Personal Information. If you choose not to provide your Personal Information, you will not be able to access the Bitium Services. We provide you with the option of opting out from receiving non-transactional mail from us. In the event we decide to use your Personal Information for any purpose other than as stated in this Privacy Policy, we will offer you an effective way to opt out of the use of your Personal Information for those other purposes. You may opt out of receiving newsletters and other secondary messages from Bitium by selecting the ‘unsubscribe’ function present in every message we send.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3>10. Accessing, Updating and Removing Personal Information</h3>
      <p>
        We provide users with access to their Personal Information.

      <h3>11. Legal Requests and Investigation</h3>
      <p>
        We may need to provide access to your Personal Information and the contents of your user account to our employees and service providers for the purpose of investigating any suspected illegal activity or potential violation of the terms and conditions for use of Bitium Services.

If at any point we decide to use Personal Information in a manner different from that stated at the time it was collected, we will notify you by email and provide you with the ability to opt out of these new uses unless you have opted out from receiving all email notifications from us.

      <h3>14. User-Generated Content</h3>
      <p>We may provide the capacity for users to post information in public spaces on the Bitium Websites (for example, in our customer support repository). This information may be publicly available to all users and visitors to Bitium. We require registration to publish information, but given the public nature of these spaces, any Personal Information disclosed within these forums may be used to contact users with unsolicited messages. We encourage users to be cautious in disclosure of Personal Information in public forums, as Bitium is not responsible for the Personal Information users elect to disclose.</p>
