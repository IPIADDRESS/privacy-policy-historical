<h3>Last Update and Your Duty to Inform Us of Changes&nbsp;</h3>
<p>This Policy was last updated on November 1, 2018. &nbsp;</p>
<p>It is imperative that the personal data we hold about you is accurate and current at all times. Otherwise, this will impair our ability to provide you with the availability of our Platform (amongst other potential and salient issues). Please keep us informed if your personal data changes during your relationship with us.</p>
<h3>Third-Party Links</h3>
<p>Our Site may include links to third-party websites, plug-ins and applications. Clicking on those links or enabling those connections may allow third parties to collect or share data about you. We do not control these third-party websites and are not responsible for their privacy notices, statements or policies.</p>
<p>We encourage you to read the privacy Policy of every website you visit.</p>
<h2>2. KEY DEFINITIONS</h2>
<p>Set out below are key definitions of certain data protection terms which appear in this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>“<strong>Consent Form</strong>” refers to separate documents which we might from time to time provide you where we ask for your explicit consent for any processing which is not for purposes set out in this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>“<strong>Data subjects</strong>” means living individuals (i.e. <strong>natural persons</strong>) about whom we collect and process personal data.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“<strong>Data controller</strong>” or “<strong>controller</strong>” means any entity or individual who determines the purposes for which, and the manner in which, any personal data is processed.</p>
<p>“<strong>Data processor</strong>” or “<strong>processor</strong>” means any entity or individual that processes data on our behalf and on our instructions (we being the data controller).</p>
<p>“<strong>Personal data</strong>” means data relating to a living individual (i.e. <strong>natural person</strong>) who can be identified from the data (information) we hold or possess. This includes, but is not limited to, your name and surname (including maiden name where applicable), address, date of birth, nationality, gender, civil status, tax status, identity card number &amp; passport number, contact details (including mobile and home phone number and personal email address), photographic image, bank account details, emergency contact information as well as online identifiers. The term “<strong>personal information</strong>”, where and when used in this Privacy Policy, shall be taken have the same meaning as personal data.</p>
<p>“<strong>Processing</strong>” means any activity that involves use of personal data. It includes obtaining, recording or holding the data, or carrying out any operation or set of operations on the data including, organizing, amending, retrieving, using, disclosing, erasing or destroying it. Processing also includes transferring personal data to third parties.</p>
<p>“<strong>Sensitive personal data</strong>”, “<strong>sensitive data</strong>” or “<strong>special categories of personal data</strong>” includes information about a person's racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or similar beliefs, trade union membership, physical or mental health or condition or sexual life, or about the commission of, or proceedings for, any offence committed or alleged to have been committed by that person, the disposal of such proceedings or the sentence of any court in such proceedings. This type of sensitive data can only be processed under strict conditions.</p>
<p><strong>Note that personal data does not include information relating to a legal person (for example, a company or other legal entity). In that regard, information such as a company name, its company number, registered address and VAT number does not amount to personal data in terms of both the Act and the GDPR. Therefore, the collection and use of information strictly pertaining to a legal person does not give rise to data controller obligations at law. </strong><strong>Naturally, we will still treat any and all such information in a confidential and secure manner. </strong></p>
<h2>3. THE PERSONAL DATA WE COLLECT ABOUT YOU</h2>

<p>We make sure we consider and balance any potential impact on you (both positive and negative) and your rights before we process your personal data for our legitimate interests.

<h3>Marketing</h3>
<p>We strive to provide you with choices regarding certain personal data uses in relation to your account. Through your <strong>Account, Identity, Contact, Technical, Usage and Marketing and Communications Data</strong>, we can form a view on what we think you may want or need. We will send details as to how you may enhance your trading activity in relation to the account.</p>
<p>Where permitted by applicable law and in accordance with your advertising / marketing preferences, you may receive marketing communications from us (which may consist of newsletters, industry updates, mailshots, publications, promotional materials and/or information about our events) where:</p>
<ul>
<li>you provide your consent to receiving such marketing material; or</li>
<li>you have an ongoing commercial or contractual relationship with us (e.g. where we consider you to be an active customer and user of the Platform); and</li>
<li>provided you have not opted out of receiving marketing from us (see <strong>Your right to object</strong> below).<u> </u></li>
</ul>
<h3>Third-Party Marketing</h3>
<p>We will get your express opt-in consent before we share your personal data with any third parties (including our associated or related corporate entities) for marketing purposes.</p>
<h3>Opting Out&nbsp;</h3>
<p>You can ask us to stop sending such advertising and marketing communications at any time by:</p>
<ul>
<li>following the opt-out links on any marketing message sent to you;</li>
<li>contacting us at any time at <a style="background-color: transparent; color: #0066cc; font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 13px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: left; text-decoration: underline; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; white-space: normal; word-spacing: 0px;" href="mailto:privacy@bittrex.com">privacy@bittrex.com</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Where you opt out of receiving such communications, this will not apply to personal data processed or provided to us as a result of your entry into a customer relationship with us and our Platform.</p>
<h3>Change of Purpose</h3>
<p>We will only use your personal data for the purposes for which we collected it, unless we reasonably consider that we need to use it for another reason and that reason is compatible with the original purpose, or we are obliged to process your data by applicable laws or court or other enforceable orders.</p>
<p>If you wish to get an explanation as to how the processing for the new purpose is compatible with the original purpose, please contact us at&nbsp;<a style="background-color: transparent; color: #0066cc; font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 13px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: left; text-decoration: underline; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; white-space: normal; word-spacing: 0px;" href="mailto:privacy@bittrex.com">privacy@bittrex.com</a>.</p>
<p>If we need to use your personal data for an unrelated purpose, we will notify you and we will explain the legal basis which allows us to do so.</p>
<p>Please note that we may process your personal data without the need to obtain your consent, in compliance with the above rules, where this is required or permitted by law.</p>
<h2>6. DISCLOSURES OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA</h2>
<p>We may have to share your personal data with the parties set out below for the purposes set out in the table in Section 5 above.</p>
<ul>
<li>External third parties.</li>
<li>Suppliers and external agencies that we engage to process information on our and/or your behalf, including to provide you with the information and/or materials that you have requested.</li>
<li>Our subsidiaries, associates and agents where necessary to facilitate your relationship with us.</li>
<li>Regulators, law enforcement agencies, and other authorities who require reporting of processing activities, or may request information from us, in terms of applicable law and in certain circumstances.</li>
<li>Professional advisers such as consultants, bankers, professional indemnity insurers, brokers and auditors.</li>
<li>Other organizations where exchange of information is for the purpose of fraud protection or credit risk reduction.</li>
<li>Debt recovery agencies who assist us with the recovery of debts owed to us.</li>
<li>Third parties to whom we may choose to sell, transfer, or merge parts of our business or our assets (successors in title). Alternatively, we may seek to acquire other businesses or merge with them. If a change happens to our business, then the new owners may use your personal data in the same way as set out in this Notice.</li>
</ul>
<p>We require all third parties to respect the security of your personal data and to treat it in accordance with the law (including applicable data protection and privacy law). We do not allow our third party business partners or service providers to use your personal data for their own purposes and only permit them to process your personal data for specified purposes and in accordance with our documented instructions. Furthermore, these third parties access and process your data on the basis of strict confidentiality and subject to the appropriate security measures and safeguards.</p>
<p>We may also disclose your data:</p>
<ul>
<li>if we are under a duty to disclose or share your personal data to comply with any legal obligation, judgment or under an order from a court, tribunal or authority, or</li>
<li>if we believe your actions are inconsistent with our user agreements or policies, or to protect the rights, property and safety of Bittrex or others, or</li>
<li>in connection with, or during negotiations of, any merger, sale of company assets, financing or acquisition of all or a portion of our business by another company; or</li>
<li>if we have your consent or at your direction.</li>
</ul>
<p>We may also share aggregated or de-identified information, which cannot reasonably be used to identify you.</p>
<h2>7.&nbsp;INTERNATIONAL TRANSFERS (APPLICABLE TO E.U. RESIDENTS ONLY)</h2>
<p>You consent to the transfer of data to entities outside the European Economic Area (“<strong>EEA</strong>”), and acknowledge such transfers, which will only take place for the purposes set forth in Section 5, are necessary for the performance of a contract between the data subject and the controller or the implementation of pre-contractual measures taken at the data subject's request. Such transfers may take place to countries for which the there is no adequacy decision pursuant to Article 45 of the GDPR and may lack EU-type privacy protections.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>8. DATA SECURITY</h2>
<p>While no online or electronic system is guaranteed to be secure, we take reasonable measures to help protect information about you from loss, theft, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction.</p>
<p>We have put in place appropriate security measures to prevent your personal data from being accidentally lost, used or accessed in an unauthorized way, altered or disclosed. In addition, we limit access to your personal data to those employees, agents, contractors and other third parties who have a business need to know. They will only process your personal data on our instructions and they are subject to a duty of confidentiality.</p>
<p>We have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected personal data breach and will notify you and any applicable regulator of a breach where we are legally required to do so.</p>
<h2>9.&nbsp;DATA RETENTION</h2>
<h3>How long will you use my personal data for?<strong>&nbsp;</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Please note that we consider our relationship with you to be an ongoing and continuous customer relationship, until terminated.</strong></p>
<p>We will only retain your personal data for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it for (i.e. the ongoing service provision) and, <strong><u>thereafter</u></strong>, for the purpose of satisfying any legal, accounting, tax and reporting requirements or obligations to which we may be subject and/or to the extent that we may also need to retain your personal data to be able to assert, exercise or defend possible future legal claims against or otherwise involving you.</p>
<p>By and large, our retention of your personal data shall not exceed the period of <strong><u>seven (7) years</u></strong> from the date of the termination of your relationship with us (which would typically arise from the closure/de-registration of your account on the Platform). This period of retention enables us to use the data in question for the possible filing, exercise or defense of legal claims (taking into account the timeframe of applicable statutes of limitation and prescriptive periods). In certain cases though, we may need to retain your data for a period of up to <strong><u>ten (10) years</u></strong> in order to comply with applicable accounting and tax laws (this will primarily consist of your Transaction Data).</p>
<p>In the event that Bittrex’s activities are held by competent legislators and regulators to amount to a ‘relevant activity’ at law, we will retain your AML and KYC Data for the duration of your business relationship with us and for a further period of five years following its termination and, in certain instances, for a maximum period of ten (10) years post-termination if mandated by the FIAU or other applicable competent authority. We may need to revise this AML retention period in the event of applicable legal or regulatory developments, but we will notify you if this is the case at the time.</p>
<p>In some circumstances, you can ask us to delete your data. See below for further information.</p>
<p><strong>Kindly contact our DPCP for further details about the retention periods that we apply.</strong></p>
<h3>Data Minimization</h3>
<p>Whenever and to the extent possible, we anonymize the data which we hold about you when it is no longer necessary to identify you from the data which we hold about you (<strong>anonymous data</strong>).</p>
<p>In some circumstances, we may even anonymize your personal data (so that it can no longer be associated with you) for research or statistical purposes, in which case we may use this information indefinitely without further notice.</p>
<h2>10. YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS</h2>
<p>Under certain circumstances, you have rights under certain data protection laws in relation to your personal data.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Request access to your personal data.</em></li>
<li><em>Request correction of your personal data.</em></li>
<li><em>Request erasure of your personal data.</em></li>
<li><em>Object to processing of your personal data.</em></li>
<li><em>Request restriction of processing your personal data.</em></li>
<li><em>Request transfer of your personal data</em>.</li>
<li><em>Right to withdraw consent</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you wish to exercise any of the rights set out above, please contact us at <a style="background-color: transparent; color: #0066cc; font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 13px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: left; text-decoration: underline; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; white-space: normal; word-spacing: 0px;" href="mailto:privacy@bittrex.com">privacy@bittrex.com</a>. These rights are explained below.</p>
<h3>No Fee usually required</h3>
<p>You will not normally have to pay a fee to exercise your data subject rights.</p>
<p>However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive. Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with your request in the above circumstances.</p>
<h3>What we may need from you</h3>
<p>We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your personal data (or to exercise any of your other data subject rights). This is a security measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response.</p>
<h3>Time limit to Respond</h3>
<p>We try to respond to all legitimate requests within the period of one month from receipt of the request.</p>
<p>Occasionally it may take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this case, we will notify you and keep you updated.</p>
<h3>Your Legal Rights</h3>
<p>You have the right to:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Request access </strong>to your personal data (commonly known as a “<em>data subject access request</em>”). This enables you to receive a copy of the personal data we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it. You may send an email to&nbsp;<u><a href="mailto:privacy@bittrex.com">privacy@bittrex.com</a></u> requesting information as the personal data which we process.</li>
<li><strong> Right to information</strong> when collecting and processing personal data about you from publicly accessible or third party sources. When this takes place, we will inform you, within a reasonable and practicable timeframe, about the third party or publicly accessible source from which we have collected your personal data.</li>
<li><strong>Request correction or rectification </strong>of the personal data that we hold about you. This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you corrected and/or updated, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide to us. As mentioned, it is in your interest to keep us informed of any changes or updates to your personal data which occur during the course of your relationship with us.</li>
<li><strong>Request erasure </strong>of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal data where:<br>
<ul>
<li>there is no good reason for us continuing to process it;</li>
<li>you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below);</li>
<li>we may have processed your information unlawfully; or</li>
<li>we are required to erase your personal data to comply with local law.</li>
</ul>
Note, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request. These may include instances where continued processing is necessary in order to be able to:
<ul>
<li>comply with a legal or regulatory obligation to which we are subject; or</li>
<li>establish, exercise or defence of legal claims.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong> Object to processing </strong>of your personal data where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms. You also have the right to object where we are processing your personal data for direct marketing purposes (see <strong>Marketing </strong>in Section 5 above).<br><br>In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which override your rights and freedoms.</li>
<li><strong> Request restriction of processing </strong>of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal data in the following scenarios:
<ul>
<li>if you want us to establish the data's accuracy;</li>
<li>where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it;</li>
<li>where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims; or</li>
<li>you have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Request the transfer (data portability) </strong>of your personal data to you or to a third party. We will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Note that this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you.</li>
<li><strong>Withdraw consent at any time </strong>where we are relying on consent to process your personal data (which will not generally be the case). This will not however affect the lawfulness of any processing which we carried out before you withdrew your consent. Any processing activities that are not based on your consent will remain unaffected.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Kindly note that none of these data subject rights are absolute and must generally be weighed against our own legal obligations and legitimate interests. If a decision is taken to override your data subject request, you will be informed of this by our data protection team along with the reasons for our decision.</strong></p>
