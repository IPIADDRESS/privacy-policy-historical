  periodically visiting our site and this Online Privacy Statement to check for any changes. You may access the current
  version of this Online Privacy Statement at any time by clicking on the link marked "Privacy Statement" at the bottom

  example, the information you provide when you register, sign-in, search, purchase products, participate in a contest
  or questionnaire, submit product reviews, sign up for our e-mails, communicate with customer service, etc.). Depending
  on how you use this site, you may supply us with information such as your name, address, phone number, email address,
  credit card information, or browse history.</p><p class="sub-heading">Information Sent to Us by Your Web Browser</p><p>We collect information that is sent to us by your web browser, including but not limited to your IP address, the
  address of the web page you were visiting when you accessed Bitesquad.com, the date and time of your visit, and
  information about your computer's operating system or mobile device. Please check your browser or mobile device if you
  want to learn what information your browser or mobile device sends or how to change your settings. The information
  provided by your browser or mobile device does not identify you personally. We use this non-personal information
  primarily to create statistics that help us improve this site and make it more compatible with the technology used by
  our visitors. However, if you have created a user identity on one of your visits to this site or if you access this
  site by clicking on a link in an email we have sent you, we may combine the information provided by your browser to
  information that identifies you personally.</p><p class="sub-heading">Information We Collect Using Cookies and Other Web Technologies</p><p>We use "cookies" and other web technologies to collect information and support certain features of this site. For
  example, we use these technologies to collect information about the ways visitors use our site (e.g., which pages they
  visit, which links they use, and how long they stay on each page). Cookies and other web technologies are also used to
  support the features and functionality of our site (e.g., to track the contents of your shopping cart as you move from
  page to page, etc.). These technologies also permit us to keep a record of your previous choices and preferences so
  that we can personalize your shopping experience and save you the trouble of reentering information already in our
  database. Generally, the information we collect using these web technologies does not identify you personally. It may,
  however, be linked to information that does identify you personally, such as the information you provide when you make
  a purchase or register to use a special feature of this site. If you do not wish to receive cookies, you may set your
  browser to reject cookies or to alert you when a cookie is placed on your computer. You may also delete our cookies as
  soon as you leave Bitesquad.com. Although you are not required to accept our cookies when you visit Bitesquad.com, if
  you set your browser to reject cookies, you will not be able to use all of the features and functionality of this
  site.</p><p class="sub-heading">Information We Collect From Other Sources</p><p>We may supplement the information collected through this site with information we collect in other ways. For example,
  if you call customer support number, we may collect your telephone number and add it to our database. We may also
  supplement the information collected through this site with information from third parties, including data brokers. By
  supplementing your profile with information from other sources, we are better able to provide product recommendations
  and special offers that will be of genuine interest to you. We may also use this additional information to further
  personalize our site and improve your shopping experience.</p><p class="sub-heading">Use of Cookies and Similar Technologies by Our Advertising Agents</p><p>A “Web Beacon” is an object that is embedded in a web page that is usually invisible to the user and allows website
  operators to check whether a user has viewed a particular web page or an email. Bite Squad may use Web Beacons on the
  Website and in emails to count users who have visited particular pages, viewed emails, and to deliver co-branded
  services. Web Beacons are not used to access users’ Personally-Identifying Information; they are a technique Bite
  Squad may use to compile aggregated statistics about Website usage. Web Beacons collect only a limited set of
  information including a Web Cookie number, time and date of a page or email view, and a description of the page or
  email on which the Web Beacon resides. You may not decline Web Beacons, however, they can be rendered ineffective by
  declining all Web Cookies or modifying your browser setting to notify you each time a Web Cookie is tendered and
  permit you to accept or decline Web Cookies on an individual basis.</p><p class="sub-heading">How Do We Use Your Personal Information?</p><p>We may use the personal information we collect through Bitesquad.com</p><ul><li>to fulfill your order;

  notices.</p><p class="sub-heading">Our Corporate Affiliates</p><p>We may share your personal information with our subsidiaries and parent and sister corporations (our "corporate
  affiliates"), who may use this information to contact you with information and offers they believe will be of interest
  to you. The corporate affiliates' use of your personal information shall be subject to this Online Privacy
  Statement.</p><p class="sub-heading">Our Service Providers.</p><p>We may share your personal information with companies that perform services on our behalf. Our service providers are
  required by contract to protect the confidentiality of the personal information we share with them and to use it only
  to provide services on our behalf.</p><p class="sub-heading">Other Business Partners and Selected Vendors</p><p>We work closely with certain business partners and carefully selected vendors to provide you with access to their
  product offerings. We may share personally identifiable information about you with these business partners or selected
  vendors, and they may use this information to offer you products and/or services that they believe will be of interest
  to you.</p><p class="sub-heading">Business Transfers</p><p>Information submitted to Bite Squad or Bitesquad.com is an asset of Bite Squad and will become part of our normal
  business records. Your personal information may be transferred to another company (either a corporate affiliate or an
  unrelated third party) that has acquired substantially all the stock or assets of Bite Squad, one of our corporate
  affiliates, or one of our operating divisions (e.g., as the result of a sale, merger, reorganization, dissolution or
  liquidation, etc.). Bite Squad or Bitesquad.com shall provide notice of such transfer by sending you an email to the
  email address in your Bite Squad account settings.</p><p class="sub-heading">Contests, Giveaways and Surveys</p><p>From time to time, Bite Squad may offer Website users the opportunity to participate in contests, giveaways and other

  Bite Squad improve the Website. Any Personally-Identifying Information provided to Bite Squad in connection with any
  survey will be used only in relation to that survey, and will be disclosed to third parties not bound by this Privacy
  Policy only in non-personally-identifying, aggregated form.</p><p class="sub-heading">Email to Friends Feature and Referral Program</p><p>Bite Squad may offer users the ability to send friends emails about the Website. If users choose to use this feature,
  be assured that Bite Squad only uses friends’ email addresses on a one-time basis to send the requested email.</p><p class="sub-heading">Government and Legal Disclosures</p><p>We may disclose the personal information we collect through Bitesquad.com when we, in good faith, believe disclosure
  is appropriate to comply with the law (or a court order or subpoena); to prevent or investigate a possible crime, such
  as fraud or identity theft; to enforce the Terms of Use or other agreements that govern your use of this site; to
  protect the rights, property or safety of Bite Squad, our users or others; or to protect your vital interests. If you
  have purchased products from us on extended payment terms, it may be necessary for us to file certain information
  about you with state or local government offices to protect our security interest in those products or to provide
  certain information about you to collection agencies in the event of non-payment or a payment dispute.</p><p class="sub-heading">What Choices Do You Have?</p><p>Bite Squad respects your right to make choices about the ways we collect, use and disclose your personal information.
  We generally ask you to indicate your choices at the time that you register as a user of Bitesquad.com or on the page
  where you provide your personal information. You may browse Bitesquad.com or Bite Squad Mobile Applications without
  providing any information that identifies you personally and may choose not to provide the information we request,
  although this may mean that you cannot make a purchase or take advantage of other Bitesquad.com or Mobile Application
  features. When you register as an Bitesquad.com or Mobile Application user, you automatically start to receive
  information and product promotions periodically via e-mail. You may "opt-out" of receiving our promotional emails at
  any time by following the instructions contained at the end of the particular email. You may also manage your
  subscription and email preferences by clicking on "My Account" on Bitesquad.com, Bite Squad’s Mobile Application or by
  sending us an email. To send us an email, please <a href="mailto:support@bitesquad.com">click here</a></p><p class="sub-heading">How Can You Update or Correct Your Personal Information?</p><p>You may update your "account settings" information, including your name, contact information, credit card

  Instructions for updating your information are provided under "Account Settings." You can change your account settings
  at any time and as often as necessary.</p><p class="sub-heading">Special Notice to California Residents</p><p>We may share some of your information with third-party companies with whom we have contracts to provide products and
  services and/or with companies that use the information for their marketing purposes. The California Civil Code
  Section 1798.83 permits you to request information regarding to whom the business has disclosed personal information
  within the previous calendar year, along with the type of personal information disclosed to third-parties' direct
  marketing purposes. Please note that under this law, we are not required to respond to a customer's request more than
  once in a calendar year; furthermore we are only required to respond to requests sent to Bite Squad-Privacy, 6740
  Shady Oak Road, Eden Prairie, MN 55344.</p><p class="sub-heading">Security</p><p>Bite Squad has implemented measures designed to secure your personal information from accidental loss and from
  unauthorized access, use, alteration, and disclosure with industry standard measures in place to protect the security
  of the personal information we collect through Bitesquad.com. For example, we use Transport Layer Security (“TSL”) to
  encrypt your credit card information as it travels over the Internet, and no credit card information is stored in Bite
  Squad’s infrastructure.  It is important that you understand, however, that no website or database is completely secure
  or "hacker proof." You are also responsible for taking reasonable steps to protect your personal information against
  unauthorized disclosure or misuse, for example, by protecting your passwords.  Although we use commercially reasonable efforts to protect your
  personal information, we cannot guarantee the security of your personal information transmitted to our site. Any
  transmission of personal information is at your own risk. We are not responsible for the circumvention of any privacy
  settings or security measures contained on the site.</p><p class="sub-heading">Links to Other Web Sites</p><p>Bitesquad.com contains links to other websites that are owned and operated by unrelated third parties. This Online
  Privacy Statement applies only to personal information collected through Bitesquad.com. It does not apply to personal
  information collected on any other website operated by Bite Squad or its corporate affiliates, nor to any website
  operated by any third party. These web sites have their own policies regarding privacy. We recommend you review the
  privacy policy posted on any site you visit before using the site or providing any personal information about
  yourself.</p><p class="sub-heading">Children and Minors</p><p>Bitesquad.com is not directed at nor targeted to children. We do not use this site to knowingly solicit personal
