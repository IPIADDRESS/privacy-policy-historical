            <p>
                Capitalized terms not otherwise defined in this Privacy Policy have the meaning as they defined in the

            </p>
            <h4>1. Collection and use of PERSONAL INFORMATION</h4>

            <p>The types of information we may collect, including but not limited to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>contact information, such as your name, home address, telephone number, and email address;</li>

            <h5>2.1 Disclosures to third parties</h5>
            <p>While processing your transactions, we may share some of your personal information with third party service providers who help with our business operations. Your information will not be sold, exchanged, or shared with any third parties without your consent, except to provide the Service or as required by law.</p>
            <p>Non-personally identifiable user information may be provided to third parties for marketing, advertising, or other uses.</p>
            <p>Our third party service providers are contractually bound to protect and use such information only for the purposes for which it was disclosed, except as otherwise required or permitted by law. We ensure that such third parties will be bound by terms no less protective those described in this Privacy Policy, or those we are subject to under applicable data protection laws.</p>
            <h5>2.2. Disclosures to legal authorities</h5>
            <p>We may share your personal information with law enforcement, data protection authorities, government officials, and other authorities when:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>compelled by subpoena, court order, or other legal procedure;</li>

                <li>disclosure is necessary to report suspected illegal activity;</li>
                <li>disclosure is necessary to investigate violations of this Privacy Policy, our Terms of Use or any of our policies and regulations.</li>
            </ul>
            <h5>2.3. International transfers of personal information</h5>
            <p>We store and process your personal information in data centres around the world, wherever Bitok.com facilities or service providers are located. As such, we may transfer your personal information outside of the European Economic Area (EEA). Such transfers are undertaken in accordance with our legal and regulatory obligations.</p>
            <h4>3. RETENTION OF PERSONAL INFORMATION</h4>
            <p>We are required by law to retain certain records for a period of at least five (5) years after termination of your Account which may include your personal information such as your name, contact details, contact number, transaction history etc. Otherwise, we will delete and destroy all personal information that we hold about you when you (or we) terminate your Account.

            <h4>4. LINKS TO OTHER WEBSITES</h4>
            <p>Our Site contains links and references to other websites. You should be aware that this Privacy Policy does not apply to those websites and we encourage you to read privacy policy of every website you visit.</p>
            <h4>5. COOKIES</h4>
            <p>We use a browser feature known as a “cookie”, which assigns a unique identification to your computer. Cookies are typically stored on your computer’s hard drive. Information collected from cookies is used by us to evaluate the effectiveness of the Site and/or the Service. The information collected from cookies allows us to determine such things as which parts of our Site are most visited and difficulties our visitors may experience in accessing the Site and/or the Service. With this knowledge, we can improve the quality of your experience on the Site and/or the Service.</p>
            <h4>6. SECURITY OF PERSONAL INFORMATION</h4>
            <p>We are committed to ensuring that your information is secure. To prevent unauthorized access or disclosure of information we have physical, electronic and managerial procedures in place to keep your personal information safe. Once logged into your Account, all internet communication is secured using Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology with high security 128bit encryption.</p>
            <p>However, this high level of protection can only be effective if you follow certain security practices yourself. You must never share your Account login details with anyone. If you are concerned that any of your login details have been compromised, you can change them any time once you are logged on but you should always also immediately contact us and tell us why you think your login details have been compromised. Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the Internet is not completely secure. Although we will do our best to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee the security of your data transmitted to the Site. Any transmission is at your own risk. Once we have received your personal information, we will use strict procedures and security features to try to prevent unauthorized access.</p>
            <p>BITOK.COM WILL NOT BE RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY LEAK OF PERSONAL INFORMATION CAUSED BY HACKING OR ANY OTHER CYBERCRIME.</p>
            <h4>7. AMENDMENTS AND MODIFICATIONS</h4>
            <p>This Privacy Policy may be revised, modified, or amended at any time, at the sole discretion of Bitok.com. You acknowledge and agree that it is your own responsibility to review the Privacy Policy periodically and become aware of amendments and modifications.</p>
            <p>If you do not wish to accept the revised/modified/amended Privacy Policy, you should not continue to use the Service. Your continued use of the Site and/or the Service following the posting of changes to the Privacy Policy will be deemed as your acceptance of those changes.</p>

            <h4>8. ACCESSING AND UPDATING YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION</h4>
            <p>If your personal information (such as your name, address, or telephone number) changes, you should update it. We shall not be liable for any loss arising out of your failure to keep your personal information up to date.</p>
            <p>NOTE: You have the right to access information that we hold about you. To do so, please contact our <a href="https://support.bitok.com/hc/en-us">support</a>. Access may be subject to a fee.</p>
            <h4>9. YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF THIS PRIVACY POLICY</h4>
            <p>By using the Site and/or the Service, you signify your acceptance of the Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to the Privacy Policy, please, do not use the Site and/or the Service. Your continued use of the Site and/or the Service following the posting of changes to the Privacy Policy will be deemed as your acceptance of those changes.</p>
