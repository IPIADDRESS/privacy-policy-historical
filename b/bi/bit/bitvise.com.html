<a id="orders"></a>
<h1>Orders and licensing</h1>
<p><b>Data collected</b></p>
<p>Bitvise is a small company that specializes in software development. We do not have the capacity to process orders directly. Any orders you place related to our software will be processed by an e-commerce provider. The e-commerce provider has their own separate data handling, privacy policy, and associated terms of use. Please consult those documents for information about how your data is handled by the e-commerce provider.</p>
<p>The e-commerce provider will share with us detailed information about your order. This can include:</p>
<ul>
<li>The internet address the order was received from.</li>
<li>Any activation account or page from which you started the order.</li>
<li>Almost all information you submit as part of the order, except sensitive credit card or payment details.</li>
</ul>
<p>We can receive information from the e-commerce provider in two ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>We receive information when you place an order. We may store some or all of this information in an activation account.</li>
<li>We can request information from the e-commerce provider again later.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to the above, we may also receive information directly from you or another person associated with you. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>You may log in and change or enter information in our activation system.</li>
<li>We may receive information such as your user agent, internet address, and the page you arrived from when you log in.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Purpose of processing</b></p>
<p>We process the information in this section to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Deliver software activation information and allow you to manage licenses. In <a href="#gdpr">GDPR</a>, the legal basis for this processing is Article 6, section 1(b).</li>
<li>Improve our software, website, and services. In GDPR, the legal basis for this processing is Article 6, section 1(f).</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Our policies</b></p>

<ul>
<li>Any information from an e-commerce provider will be received <b>encrypted</b>.</li>
<li>We will <b>not</b> sell this information or make it available to third parties, except if we have a compelling reason to outsource specific actions to a third party under appropriate protections.</li>
<li>To the extent we store and use this information, it will be made available to Bitvise officers, employees, agents, or contractors only on a need-to-know basis under appropriate protections.</li>
<li>We may contact you at any email address you provide with information relevant to your order, or an inquiry you make. We will <b>not</b> subscribe such addresses to other mailings. However, we <i>may</i> subscribe them, one time, to important security <a href="#notifications">notifications</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The following are our additional policies with respect to information stored in activation accounts:</p>
<ul>
<li>One purpose of the information in your activation account is so that you can see it on demand. Such information will be accessible to you and to anyone you grant access. If an unauthorized person is able to obtain or guess access credentials, they will also have access.</li>
<li>We may store this information as long as the activation account it is associated with remains <i>active</i>.</li>
<li>We may consider an activation account active until the latest of:
<ul><li>10 years after upgrade access last expired for any license associated with the activation account.</li>
<li>5 years after the customer or end user last accessed the activation account.</li>
<li>5 years after installed software last made an activation check associated with the activation account.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>The reason for these durations is that customers periodically contact us to locate old licenses. As a rule, such customers request to search for licenses based on information such as names and email addresses. We must maintain this information to answer such inquiries.</p>
<p>The following are our additional policies with respect to information we request from the e-commerce provider at later times:</p>
<ul>
<li>We will request such information if it's necessary in the process of providing support, notifying users, or for compliance with requirements imposed on us by governments, courts, and financial institutions.</li>
<li>We may store this information for up to 3 years to facilitate auditing or investigation of actions taken. We may destroy this information sooner.</li>
</ul>

<a id="contact"></a>
<h1>Contact</h1>
<p><b>Data collected</b></p>
<p>The main way to contact Bitvise is through our case management system. The information we receive may include:</p>
<ul>
<li>The internet address from which you accessed the case management system.</li>
<li>Any email addresses you provide.</li>
<li>Any content in messages you post or send us.</li>
<li>Any information in email messages you send to us, including detailed technical information in email headers.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Purpose of processing</b></p>
<p>We process the information in this section to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Respond to your inquiries. In <a href="#gdpr">GDPR</a>, the legal basis for this processing is Article 6, section 1(a).</li>
<li>Improve our software, website, and services. In GDPR, the legal basis for this processing is Article 6, section 1(f).</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Our policies</b></p>
<p>The following are our policies with respect to this information:</p>
<ul>
<li>We will <b>not</b> sell this information or make it available to third parties, except if we have a compelling reason to outsource specific actions to a third party under appropriate protections.</li>
<li>Anything you send may potentially be readable by anyone who works for Bitvise, now or in the future.</li>
<li>We may, but are not obligated to, store such information indefinitely. The reason is that when we reply to communications, this can create informal contracts which may be referenced later. We may therefore store the context of communications that may be referenced.</li>
<li>Any case you open will normally be private between you, Bitvise, and any additional correspondents. However, you may receive a link which may grant access to the case to anyone who receives it. If you or another correspondent shares this link, anyone who receives it will be able to see the information.</li>
<li>We may reply to any email address you provide. If you misspell it or forget to include it, but you appear to expect a reply, we may try to guess the correct address or try to contact you in another way.</li>
<li>We will <b>not</b> subscribe an email address to other mailings. However, we <i>may</i> subscribe it, one time, to important security <a href="#notifications">notifications</a>.</li>
<li>Email is encrypted opportunistically. Any information sent by email <i>may</i> be transferred unencrypted. Email interception is possible by well-positioned third parties.</li>
</ul>

<a id="notifications"></a>
<h1>Notifications</h1>
<p><b>Data collected</b></p>
<p>Bitvise may operate systems to send email notifications to subscribers about events such as new versions of our software or security updates. The information we store for this purpose may include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your email address.</li>
<li>Technical information about past deliveries.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Purpose of processing</b></p>
<p>We process the information in this section to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Send notifications on mailing lists you subscribed to. In <a href="#gdpr">GDPR</a>, the legal basis for this processing is Article 6, section 1(a).</li>
<li>Send notifications about security issues in software you may be using. In GDPR, the legal basis for this processing is Article 6, section 1(f).</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Our policies</b></p>
<p>The following are our policies with respect to this information:</p>
<ul>
<li>We will <b>not</b> sell this information, or otherwise make it available to third parties, unless we have a compelling reason to outsource delivery to a trusted third party. We will prefer to keep data in-house to avoid such situations.</li>
<li>To the extent we store and use this information, it will be made available to Bitvise officers, employees, agents, or contractors only on a need-to-know basis under appropriate protections.</li>
<li>If we believe you to be a user of our software, we <i>may</i>, but are not obligated to, add you to our mailing list for <b>important security notifications</b>.</li>
<li>We will <b>not</b> add you to any other mailing lists unless you take affirmative action to subscribe.</li>
<li>If you unsubscribe from all of our mailing lists, we will delete your email address and information about past deliveries. However, we may continue to store a one-way cryptographic hash of your email address indefinitely, so that we can honor your preference to not receive notifications.</li>
</ul>

<a id="backup"></a>
<h1>Audit logs and backups</h1>
<p>All of our systems may maintain audit logs or backups which may be preserved for a period of time, either together or apart from the source systems. Any data that is deleted from source systems may be preserved in audit logs and backups.</p>
<p>We may store audit logs and backups of any of our systems for up to 3 years. We may destroy any information stored in them sooner, or not collect it in the first place. We will take equal or greater measures to protect information in audit logs and backups as we do for the source systems.</p>

<a id="cloud"></a>
<h1>Cloud services</h1>
<p>The small size of our business, and the availability of reputable cloud services, mean that operating our own separate data center would be costlier, more time-consuming, and less reliable. Throughout decades, we have used reputable cloud providers to host our website, store our data, and provide services.</p>

<a id="finance"></a>
<h1>Financial institutions</h1>
<p>We may reveal information to which we have access, or relevant parts of it, to financial institutions, if we believe appropriate data protections are in place and that revealing this information is necessary to comply with legal requirements or for the financial institution to perform due process necessary to conduct business.</p>

<a id="law"></a>
<h1>Law enforcement</h1>
<p>We may reveal information to which we have access, or relevant parts of it, to law enforcement agencies, if we believe that:</p>
<ul>
<li>this is needed to protect our business or our users; or that</li>
<li>it serves the greater public good; or that</li>
<li>we are legally compelled to reveal it.</li>
</ul>

<a id="nsa"></a>
<h1>National security orders</h1>
<p>We believe it is questionable policy to force private companies to cooperate with government security agencies, and to comply with national security orders which are not subject to meaningful democratic oversight, outside of a time of total war.</p>
<p>Bitvise will not willingly compromise the security and privacy of our users based on a government's request, unless such a request is coercive. However, a national security order may involve prison terms or other penalties for non-compliance. We may not be able to refuse such an order, or reveal its existence if it is secret.</p>
<p>At the time of this sentence being written, Bitvise has not received a government order. However, we may not be able to reveal if we receive an order, even by removing the preceding sentence. Our cloud infrastructure is US-based, and we would not know if our cloud provider received an order.</p>
<p>If you find this situation disconcerting, <b>contact your representatives</b> and ask them to reverse policies that undermine international commercial trust and put dents into public safety in exchange for narrow advantages in state control that do not justify the long-term economic damage.</p>

<h1>GDPR</h1>
<p>As used in this Privacy policy, GDPR refers to the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) (EU) 2016/679. GDPR references apply only to EU residents.</p>

<a id="rights"></a>
<h1>Your rights</h1>
<p>You have a right to request us to review, correct, block, or delete any personal information about you, or if you would like to know the categories of personal information that we disclosed to any third party or our associates. If you would like to exercise any of your rights, please <a href="https://fogbugz.bitvise.com/?pg=pgPublicEdit&amp;ixProject=2">contact us</a>.</p>
<p>Upon request, we will provide you with information about whether we hold any of your personal information. If, despite our efforts to maintain correct and up-to-date information, we have any incorrect information about you, we will change it upon your request.</p>
<p>If you think our processing of your personal data infringes your rights under applicable law, in particular under <a href="#gdpr">GDPR</a>, you have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority, such as the public authority which is established in the EU member state of your habitual residence, place of work, or place of the alleged infringement.</p>
