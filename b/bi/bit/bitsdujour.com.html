<br><h4>Your Email Address</h4>
<p>Bits du Jour will <b>NOT</b> sell, trade, give away, or
be careless with your email address. We're every bit as tired of
spam as we bet you are.</p>
<p>We will send you our newsletter only if
you explicitly <a href="news.php">request it</a>. If you contact us using any
of our forms, you will <b>not</b> be added to the Newsletter list
unless you also request to be.</p>

<h4>Cookies</h4>
<p>Cookies are small information files 
stored by your browser on your hard drive. They're commonly used
to allow websites to provide features like site personalization and 
shopping carts. Bitsdujour.com may set a cookie only
if you buy one of our Featured Items using a link on bitsdujour.com.
We use the cookie in this case to track the <b>total number of sales</b> made 
from our links. We do
<b>not</b> use it for tracking any
individual sale information. The cookie is set by the item vendor, not by
bitsdujour.com. In most cases, these cookies are erased as soon as you
complete your purchase. You can buy our Featured Items even if you 
have cookies disabled. 


</p><h4>Phishing and Identity Theft</h4>
<p>Bits du Jour 
will <b>never</b> send you emails asking
you to send personal, financial, or credit card information.
We will <b>never</b> send you emails asking you to 
log in to what looks like a legitimate URL and confirm that kind of 
information. </p>
<p>
If you get an email that looks like it's from us and asks for that kind of info, 
<b>do NOT respond</b> to it or click on
any of its links, no matter how official or convincing it looks.
If you get anything except one of our newsletters that claims to be sent
from bitsdujour.com, please <a href="contact.php">send it to us</a>.</p>

<p>Emails like that&nbsp;-&nbsp;from any site&nbsp;-&nbsp;are almost 
always fraudulent attempts to get your information ("phishing"). We strongly 
recommend <b>never</b> filling in any information on a web page you've gotten to
by clicking an email link, and being very careful in general about clicking
email links. If you'd like to learn more about phishing and how to protect
yourself, 
<a href="http://www.antiphishing.org/consumer_recs.html">the Anti-Phishing
Working Group</a> has some useful information.</p>
