<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If we ask you to provide personal information to comply with a legal requirement or to perform a contract with you, we will make this clear at the relevant time and advise you whether the provision of your personal information is mandatory or not (as well as of the possible consequences if you do not provide your personal information).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Similarly, if we collect and use your personal information in reliance on our legitimate interests (or those of any third party), we will make clear to you at the relevant time, or upon request, what those legitimate interests are.</p>

				<p><b>How Long we Retain Your Information:</b> We will retain personal information we collect from you where we have a justifiable business need to do so and/or for as long as is needed to fulfil the purposes outlined in this Privacy Notice, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax, legal, accounting or other purposes). You can request deletion of your personal information at any time (see "Your Privacy Rights and Choices" section for further information) and we will consider your request in accordance with applicable laws.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When we have no justifiable business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymize it, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Children:</b> Our Properties are not directed to individuals under the age of 16. We do not knowingly collect personal information from such individuals. If you become aware that a child has provided us with personal information, please contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@vmware.com">privacy@vmware.com</a> . If we become aware that a child under the age of 14 has provided us with personal information, we will take steps to delete such information.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Automated Decision-making:</b> We do not employ solely automated decision-making, as a matter of course, that results in automated decisions being taken (including profiling) that legally affect you or similarly significantly affect you. Automated decisions mean that a decision concerning you is made automatically on the basis of a computer determination (using software algorithms), without our human review. If you are to be subject to automated decision making, we will make it clear at the time and you have the right to contest the decision, to express your point of view, and to require a human review of the decision.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>External Links and Social Media Features:</b> Our Properties may provide links to or the ability to connect with third party websites, services, social networks, applications or social media features such as "Share" or "Like" buttons. Visiting those sites or clicking on those links may allow the third party to collect and use information about you. Further, the personal information you choose to give to these third parties is not covered by this Privacy Notice. We encourage you to review the privacy notices and terms of use of such third parties prior to interacting with them or providing them with your personal information to understand how your information may be collected and used. VMware does not control the privacy practices of such third parties, nor do we endorse or make any representations about these third party websites, services, social networks or applications.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Do Not Track:</b> Some Internet browsers - like Internet Explorer, Firefox, and Safari - include the ability to transmit "Do Not Track" or "DNT" signals. Since uniform standards for "DNT" signals have not been adopted, our online Properties do not currently process or respond to "DNT" signals. VMware takes privacy and meaningful choice seriously and will make efforts to continue to monitor developments around DNT browser technology and the implementation of a standard. To learn more about "DNT", please visit "<a href="https://allaboutdnt.com/" target="_blank">All About Do Not Track</a>".</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Changes to this Privacy Notice:</b> VMware will review and update this Privacy Notice periodically in response to changing legal, technical and business developments. When we update this Privacy Notice we will note the date of its most recent revision above. If we make material changes to this Privacy Notice, we will take appropriate measures to inform you in a manner that is consistent with the significance of the changes we make and is in accordance with applicable law. We encourage you to review this Privacy Notice frequently to be informed of how VMware is protecting your information.</p>
