<p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style="color: #000000;">Bitifeye Digital Test
Solutions GmbH (also referred to in this document as "BitifEye")
provides this Privacy Statement to make you aware of our privacy practices and
the choices you can make about how your personal information is collected and
used, both on-line and off-line. To make this notice easy to access, it is

<p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style="color: #000000;"><br></span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style="color: #000000;">We've structured our web

<p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style="color: #000000;"><br></span></span></p>

statement covers 9 main areas: <strong>Notice</strong><strong>, Choice</strong><strong>, Access &amp; Accuracy</strong><strong>, Onward Transfer</strong><strong>, Security</strong><strong>, Tailoring Email Communications and Web

<p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style="color: #000000;"><br></span></span></p>
<h3><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style="color: #000000;"><a name="notice"></a>1.
Notice</span></span></h3>
<h4><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style="color: #000000;">What information we
collect</span></span></h4>
<p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style="color: #000000;">During the
course of your relationship with us, we may collect personal information to
enable you to order products or services, download software updates, make
requests, and register for customized communications programs. We may collect
such personal information as your name, contact and billing information,
transaction and credit card information. To tailor our subsequent communications
to you and improve our products and services, we may ask you to provide
information regarding your personal or professional interests, demographics,
experience with our products and contact preferences. Personal information may
be required to determine access eligibility for certain restricted parts of our
site. Data collected on-line may be combined with information provided
off-line. </span></span></p>
<h4><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style="color: #000000;">How we use the information</span></span></h4>
<p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style="color: #000000;">BitifEye
uses your personal information to better understand your needs and provide you
with better service. Specifically, we use your personal information to help you
complete a transaction, to communicate back to you, provide updates on service
and benefits, and to personalize our web sites and communications with you.
Credit card numbers are used only for payment processing and are not retained
for other purposes. From time to time, we may also use your information to
contact you for market research or to provide you with marketing information we
think would be of particular interest. We will always give you the opportunity
to opt-out of receiving such contact. If you would like to read more about how
to opt-out, please follow the directions given below in the "Choice"
section of this document. In addition, we will also follow local requirements
where applicable. </span></span></p>
<h4><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style="color: #000000;">Whom we share the
information with</span></span></h4>
<p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style="color: #000000;">BitifEye
does not sell, rent, or lease your personal information to others. Unless we
have your permission or are required by law, we only share your personal
information with other BitifEye entities or business partners who are acting on
our behalf for the uses described above. Such BitifEye entities and business
partners are governed by our privacy policies with respect to the use of this
data and are bound by the appropriate confidentiality agreements. </span></span></p>
<h3><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style="color: #000000;"><a name="choice"></a>2.
Choice</span></span></h3>
<p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style="color: #000000;">BitifEye will not use or
share your personal information in ways unrelated to the ones described above
without first notifying you and offering a choice. We will also provide you the
opportunity to let us know if you wish to opt-out at any time of certain or all
contact from BitifEye, and we will do everything we can to honor such requests.
This choice may be offered at the bottom of our on-line or off-line
communications to you as well as on many of our web registration pages. If you
have any difficulty exercising your choices, please send your request to info@bitifeye.com</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style="color: #000000;"><br>
Your permission will always be secured first, should we ever decide to share
your personal information with third parties that are not acting on our behalf
and governed by our privacy policy. </span></span></p>
<h3><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style="color: #000000;"><a name="onward"></a>3.
Onward Transfer</span></span></h3>
<p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style="color: #000000;">Subject to
your permission or as permitted by law, the personal information that you
provide to us may be transferred within BitifEye across state or country
borders. This may be done to consolidate data storage or to simplify the
management of customer information. </span></span></p>
<h3><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style="color: #000000;"><a name="access"></a>4.
Access and Accuracy</span></span></h3>
<p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style="color: #000000;">BitifEye
strives to keep your personal information accurate. We will provide you with
access to your personal information, including making every effort to provide
you with online access to your registration data so that you may review, update
or correct your information at the BitifEye site where it was submitted. To
protect your privacy and security, we will also take reasonable steps to verify
your identity before granting you access or enabling you to make corrections.
To access your personal information, return to the web page where you
originally entered it and follow the instructions on that web page. If you
cannot access your information on the web page, please telephone BitifEye for
assistance, or send your request to info@bitifeye.com</span></span></p>
<h3><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style="color: #000000;"><a name="security"></a>5.
Security</span></span></h3>
<p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style="color: #000000;">BitifEye is
committed to ensuring the security of your personal information. To prevent
unauthorized access or disclosure, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the
appropriate use of personal information, we have put in place appropriate
physical, electronic and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure it. </span></span></p>
<h3><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style="color: #000000;"><a name="email"></a>6.
Tailoring E-Mail Communications and Web Experiences</span></span></h3>
<p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style="color: #000000;">On occasion
BitifEye may employ technologies that enable us to review which recipients have
opened our e-mail communications and which links they have accessed in the
message. This helps us to tailor our communications in our attempts to send you
the most relevant information, as local laws and your preferences and permissions
allow. As a registered user, we may also monitor your web browsing session
while you are logged-in to BitifEye.com. In this way we will try to improve our
web site through personalization to better meet your needs. Any such monitoring
is done in accordance with local laws. </span></span></p>
<h3><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style="color: #000000;"><a name="cookies"></a>7. How
BitifEye Uses Cookies</span></span></h3>
<p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style="color: #000000;">A cookie is a piece of
information either stored temporarily in your browser's memory space (session
cookie) or placed on your computer's hard drive (stored cookie). Cookies allow
a web application to respond to you as an individual, but without the need to
identify you explicitly. Session cookies are destroyed when you terminate your
browsing session by shutting down your browser. Stored cookies often have a
predetermined expiration date after which they disappear from your hard drive.
Cookies can be removed explicitly through functionality built into most web
browsers. You may also set your web browser (e.g. Microsoft Internet Explorer
or Netscape Navigator) to notify you of cookie placement requests, ask for
permission to accept them, or decline cookies completely.</span></span></p>
<h4><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style="color: #000000;">Adjusting Browser Cookie
Settings</span></span></h4>
<p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style="color: #000000;">For information on how to
adjust your browser regarding cookies, please visit</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style="color: #000000;"><br><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/info/cookies.htm">here</a></span>
<span style="color: #000000;"> for Microsoft Internet Explorer or<br><a href="http://wp.netscape.com/legal_notices/cookies.html">here</a></span>
<span style="color: #000000;"> for Netscape Navigator. </span></span></p>
<h4><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style="color: #000000;">Cookie Usage</span></span></h4>
<p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style="color: #000000;">On occasion BitifEye may
use cookies to help us analyze web traffic or to improve your web navigation
experience. To facilitate the analysis, an ID is assigned to help us uniquely
identify you each time you return to our web site. One of the major concerns
about stored cookies is the fear that they contain personal information and
information identifying you that could be accessed by other web sites. BitifEye
only stores a randomly chosen unique ID number and a context, both of which are
meaningless to others, but help us uniquely identify you. </span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style="color: #000000;"><br></span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style="color: #000000;">By gathering and
remembering information about your preferences, the web application can: </span></span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style="color: #000000;">Tailor its operation to your needs, likes
     and dislikes</span></span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style="color: #000000;">Provide an automated log-in process as a
     convenience for previously registered customers. This insures that you
     will be accurately identified and linked with your registration data.</span></span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style="color: #000000;">Be placed on your computer to ensure you
     are not surveyed multiple times during your visit(s) to an BitifEye web
     site. This cookie has a limited life span and will not personally identify
     you.</span></span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style="color: #000000;">Cookies
help us provide a better web experience by letting us monitor what's working
and what isn't through site traffic analysis. BitifEye wants to be sure you
understand that accepting a cookie in no way gives us access to your computer
or any personal information about you, other than the data you chose to share
with us. This practice is strictly enforced. While acknowledging the concerns
that some visitors have about cookie usage, we believe that the benefit our
webpage visitors gain from the use of cookies is worthwhile. </span></span></p>
<h3><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style="color: #000000;"><a name="additional"></a>8.
Additional Information</span></span></h3>
<h4><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style="color: #000000;">Links to Third Party Web
Sites</span></span></h4>
<p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style="color: #000000;">Links to
third party web sites are provided solely as a convenience to you. If you use
these links, you will leave the BitifEye site. BitifEye has not reviewed all of
these third party sites; does not control and is not responsible for any of
these sites, their content or their privacy policies. Thus, we do not endorse

Statement</span></span></h4>

material changes to our Privacy Policy and practices will be posted on this
page. The revision date shown at the top of the page will be updated
