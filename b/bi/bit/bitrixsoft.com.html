				<p>The Website does not collect personally identifiable information from your computer when you browse the Website and request pages from our servers. 
				This means that, unless you voluntarily and  knowingly provide us with your personally identifiable information, Bitrix24 will  not know your name, your 
				e-mail address, or any other personally identifiable  information. When you request a page from our Website, our servers log the information provided 
				in the HTTP request header, JavaScript or similar technical tools, including the IP number, the  time of the request, the URL of your request and other 
				information. We collect this information in order to make the  Website function correctly and provide you the functionality that you see on the Website. 
				We also use this information to  better understand how visitors use the Website and how we can better adjust the  Website, its contents, and functionality 
				to meet the needs of our users.</p>	
			<h4 id="b2">Third Party Websites</h4>
				<p>The Website may contain links to websites owned and operated by third parties. Such links are present for your convenience and information. 
				Bitrix24 does not control these third party websites and is not responsible for their  privacy practices or content. Bitrix24 does not control 
				the information collection and distribution policies on such websites other than those that are under the control of Bitrix24 itself. Content on 
				third party websites may not reflect products, services, or information provided by Bitrix24. Third parties may also set their own  cookies 
				and/or use web beacons (defined below), which may be used to identify some of your preferences or to recognize you if you have previously had contact 
				the third parties. Bitrix24 does not control the use of such technology by third parties, the information they collect, or how they use such  information. 
				You should direct all concerns regarding any third party website to the site administrator or webmaster of such sites.</p>
				<p>Bitrix24  also uses third party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit the  Website. These companies may use general information about 
				your visits to the  Website as well as other websites in order to provide advertisements about  goods and services of interest to you. If you would like 
				more information about  this practice and your choices as to not having your information used by these  companies, 
				please<a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/optout_nonppii.asp" target="_blank"> direct such concerns to the respective company's 
				administrator or webmaster</a>.</p>		
			<h4 id="b3">Third Party Applications</h4>
				<p>Bitrix24 may make available to you third party  applications through the Website or its Products and Services. 
				The information collected by Bitrix24 when  you enable a third party application is processed under this Privacy Policy. 
				Information collected by the third party application provider is governed by the provider's privacy policies.</p>
			<h4 id="b4">Information We Collect</h4>
				<p>Most of the Products and Services offered to visitors of the Website require you to register for a user account with Bitrix24 
				("User Account"). When registering for a User Account, Bitrix24 will ask you to voluntarily supply Bitrix24 
				with certain information about yourself by filling out and submitting an online  form.  Such information may include your  name, phone number, 
				credit card or other billing information, email address and  home and business postal addresses. It is completely optional for you to register 
				for a User Account or engage in  activities requiring a User Account.</p>
				<p>When ordering Products and Services via the Website, you  may be asked to provide a credit card number, account and/or billing and 
				shipping information enabling the consummation of the transaction. The foregoing information is collected and  processed by online payment services, 
				including but not limited to merchant  accounts services, which we may utilize for payment processing, including  automatic subscription renewals. In 
				addition, as noted below, minimum information is requested if you choose to  subscribe to product updates.</p> 
				<p>You never have to answer any questions, and you can decline this exchange of information at any time. However, if you should choose to withhold 
				requested information, we may not be able to provide you with some or all of  the Products and Services.  Depending  upon the activity, some of the 
				information that we ask you to provide is  identified as mandatory and some as optional. If you do not provide the mandatory information with respect 
				to a  particular activity or purchase, you will not be able to engage in that activity or make such a purchase. Bitrix24 will inform you of the 
				mandatory and/or optional character of the requested  and/or required information.</p>
				<p>Bitrix24 will only share your  information with outside parties in ways that are described in this Privacy Policy or if we are required to do 
				so by law or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary in order to  conform to the edicts of the law, cooperate with law enforcement 
				agencies, or comply with a legal process served on the Website.</p>
				<p>When you use the Website, Bitrix24 or trusted third parties authorized by Bitrix24 may also collect certain technical and routing information 
				about your computer (also known as  environmental variables) to facilitate your use of the Website and its  services. When you browse the Internet,
				 your Internet browser (such as Mozilla Firefox or Microsoft Internet Explorer)  automatically transmits some information to Bitrix24 every time 
				 you access content on one of our internet domains. Examples of such information include the URL of the particular Web page you visited, 
				 the IP (Internet Protocol) address of the computer you are using,  or the browser version that you are using to access the Website. 
				 All of this information may be collected by Bitrix24  and used to help improve our offerings to you.</p>
				<p>We use such data to facilitate and track your use of the Website and its services.  Bitrix24 also uses environmental variables to measure 
				traffic patterns on the Website. Without expressly informing you in each particular circumstance, we do  not match such information with any 
				of your personal information.</p>
				<p>You may be provided an opportunity to subscribe to a periodic newsletter and product updates.  This newsletter is a marketing tool that 
				allows Bitrix24 to inform you of new Products and Services, updates, as well as  other news relevant to the company. The  subscription service 
				requires you to provide your first and last name, your email address, and other information. Optionally, you are asked to provide the name of 
				the company you  represent.  You are given the opportunity  to choose the type of information Bitrix24 will provide to you and you will be  provided
				 with an opportunity to opt-out from receiving such information by  either making appropriate choice in your User Account or by writing to 
				 <a href="mailto:privacy@bitrix24.com">privacy@bitrix24.com</a>.</p>
				<p>When you submit personal information to Bitrix24 through the Website, you understand and agree that this  information may be transferred 
				across international boundaries and may be stored and processed in any of the countries in which Bitrix24 and its  affiliates and subsidiaries 
				maintain offices or web hosting servers. You also acknowledge that in certain  countries or with respect to certain activities, the collection, 
				transferring,  storage, and processing of your information may be undertaken by trusted  vendors of Bitrix24.  Such vendors are  bound by contract 
				not to use your personal information for their own purposes  or provide it to any third parties.
				</p>
				<p>Bitrix24 may establish relationships with various service providers whose services may  become available to you via the Website or via other 
				websites that are linked  to the Website. Typically, these  providers will offer services that Bitrix24 customers might find useful, such  as 
				those that can be used in conjunction with Bitrix24 Products and Services.  In order to use these third party services,  you may be required to
				 provide personal information to such providers.  Unless expressly provided to the contrary,  personal information that you provide while you 
				 are visiting a provider's  Website will be subject to the privacy policy posted on that site, and personal  information that you provide while 
				 on this Website in conjunction with a  provider's service will be subject to this Privacy Policy.  For instance, the credit card and/or PayPal® 
				 information entered as part of the filling out a purchase form or registration  process collected by a third party's registration and/or merchant services
				 is  subject to that third party's privacy policies. You should be aware that Bitrix24's agreements with these service  providers often provide that 
				 they will share with Bitrix24 personal information  collected from you. In such instances, Bitrix24  may use this information in a manner consistent
				 with this Privacy Policy.</p>
 
			<h4 id="b5">Files</h4>
				<p>Bitrix24 collects and stores the files you upload, download, or access via the Products  and Services offered through the Website. 
				We understand that these files may be confidential or contain sensitive information. Accordingly, Bitrix24 does  not share or permit third 
				parties to access such files. However, no password-protected system of data  storage and retrieval can be made entirely impenetrable. 
				Although Bixtrix24 uses a number of security technologies and procedures to make sure that the data on the Website is secure, it may be possible 
				for an unauthorized third party to access, view, copy, modify and distribute the data and files you store on the Website or via Products and 
				Services despite Bitrix24's efforts.</p>			
			<h4 id="b6">User Account</h4>
				<p>As described above, you will be given an opportunity to create a User Account containing your personal information. A User Account is 
				required for using most Products and Services offered on the Website. Once the User Account is created, you will be able to access, 
				review and  update your User Account information online via the Website.</p>
				<p>If you wish to deactivate your User Account, you can do so through the User Account interface or by contacting Bitrix24 
				at <a href="mailto:privacy@bitrix24.com">privacy@bitrix24.com</a>. When you deactivate your User  Account, all information stored and 
				maintained as part of your account will be  deleted from our servers, including the files you stored via the Website or its  Products 
				and Services. The archived backup of your data will be eliminated over  the course of the ensuing regular backup cycle of Bitrix24. 
				If  you create an account, then you have the right to access and change your  personal information and privacy preferences at any time 
				by logging into your User  Account, where you can view and make changes to your personal information.  You may also access and change 
				your personal  information and privacy preferences by contacting us at <a href="mailto:privacy@bitrix24.com">privacy@bitrix24.com</a>.</p>
			<h4 id="b7">Information Relating to Children</h4>
				<p>The Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) was passed by the U.S. Congress in November 1998. COPPA provides parents with specific rights 
				regarding their children's privacy. For additional information and resources on  COPPA, please visit the Federal Trade Commission Web site at 
				<a href="http://www.ftc.gov/" target="_blank">http://www.ftc.gov/</a>. The Website and any products or services available  on the Website are not
				 directed at children under 13 years of age and,  therefore, COPPA does not apply.   However, we recognize that children under the age of 13 may 
				 access this  Website or purchase products and services.   The collection of this information is covered above.  Parents and Legal Guardians may 
				 request from  us to review, delete or stop the collection of the personally identifiable  information of their child.  You may do  so by contacting 
				 us by letter (using the address information provided at the  bottom of this page) or email to <a href="mailto:privacy@bitrix24.com">privacy@bitrix24.com</a>.</p>

			<h4 id="b8">Securing the Transmission and Storage of Information</h4>
				<p>Bitrix24 is committed to  protecting the security of your personal information. We use a variety of security technologies and procedures to help 
				protect your personal information. Bitrix24 operates secure data networks  protected by industry standard firewall and password protection systems. 
				Our security and privacy policies are periodically  reviewed and enhanced as necessary, and only authorized individuals have access  to the information 
				provided by our users.   Bitrix24 takes steps to ensure that your information is treated securely  and in accordance with this Privacy Policy. 
				Unfortunately, no data transmission  over the Internet can be guaranteed secure. As a result, while we strive to  protect your personal information, 
				we cannot guarantee the security of any  information you transmit to us or from our online products or services, and you  use these services at your own risk.</p>
				<p>We treat the information you  provide to us, including the Files, as confidential information; it is,  accordingly, subject to our company's security
				 procedures and corporate  policies regarding protection and use of confidential information. After  personally identifiable information reaches Bitrix24, 
				 it is stored on a server  with physical and electronic security features as customary in the industry,  including utilization of login/password procedures 
				 and electronic firewalls  designed to block unauthorized access from outside of Bitrix24. Because laws  applicable to personal information vary by country, 
				 our offices or other  business operations may put in place additional measures that vary depending on  the applicable legal requirements.  Information  
				 collected on the sites covered by this Privacy Policy is processed and stored  in the United States and possibly other jurisdictions and also in other 
				 countries where Bitrix24 and its service providers conduct business.  All Bitrix24 employees are obligated by our  privacy and security policies.  Your 
				 information is only accessible to those employees who perform technical support  of the service.</p>
				<p>If a  password is used to help protect your accounts and personal information, it is  your responsibility to keep your password confidential. 
				Do not share this  information with anyone. If you are sharing a computer with anyone you should  always log out before leaving any site or service 
				to protect access to your  information from subsequent users.</p>
			<h4 id="c">C. USE AND DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION</h4>
			<h4 id="c1">How Your Personal Information Is Used</h4>
				<p>Bitrix24 collects your information in order to record and support your participation in the activities  you select. We may use your e-mail 
				address to send a confirmation e-mail and, if necessary, may use other  information you provide to contact you for help to process the purchase or 
				service you have selected. If you  subscribe to a service or register a product, for example, such information is  used to register your rights, if 
				any, to technical support or other benefits  that may be made available to registered users. Unless you opt-out, your personal information also may 
				be used to keep  you informed about new products, product upgrades, patches, special offers, and  other products and services of Bitrix24 and selected
				 third parties if you have  so opted to receive such communications.</p>
				<p>Bitrix24 may collect information  about the use of the Website, such as the types of services used and how many  users we receive daily.
				 This information  is collected in aggregate form, without identifying any user individually. Bitrix24  may use this aggregate, non-identifying 
				 statistical data for statistical  analysis, marketing, or similar promotional purposes.</p>
				<p>Bitrix24 recognizes and appreciates the importance of responsible use of information  collected on this Website. Without your  consent, 
				Bitrix24 will not communicate any information to you regarding  products, services, or special offers available from Bitrix24 or its affiliates, 
				although we may find it necessary to communicate with you regarding  your use of the services on this Website. Except in the particular circumstances
				 described in this Privacy Policy,  Bitrix24 will also not provide your name to other companies or organizations without your consent.</p>
			<h4 id="c2">Disclosure of Information to Third Parties</h4>
				<p>Bitrix24 uses services of third parties, such as e-mail service providers, voice and messaging application ("VMA"), purchase, shipping and order processing merchants 
				and marketing companies that act as independent contractors on behalf of Bitrix24. These parties are contractually prohibited from using personally identifiable 
				information for any purpose other than for the purpose Bitrix24 specifies or as otherwise allowed by the laws of applicable jurisdiction. We do provide non-personally 
				identifiable information to certain service providers for their use on an aggregated basis for the purpose of performing their contractual obligations to us. 
				We prohibit the sale or transfer of personal information to entities outside of the Bitrix24's affiliates for their use without your approval. Notwithstanding 
				anything to the contrary herein, you hereby acknowledge and agree that third party services described in this paragraph are subject to such party's terms of 
				services and privacy policies, links to which can be provided to you upon request as set forth in Section D of this Privacy Policy.</p>
				<p>Bitrix24 may disclose your  personally identifiable information if we believe in good faith that we are  required to do so in order to comply 
				with applicable law, a subpoena, or other  legal process.  Bitrix24 may also  disclose personally identifiable information when we have reason 
				to believe  that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact or bring  legal action against someone who may be violating this 
				Privacy Policy, the  terms of your agreements with the Company (such as the Terms of Service) or to  protect the safety of our users and the public 
				or under confidentiality and  licensing agreements with certain third parties which assist us in developing,  operating and maintaining the Website 
				and its content.</p>
				<p>In the event  that all or substantially all of Bitrix24's stock and/or all or substantially  all assets are transferred or sold to another entity, 
				Bitrix24 may transfer  personally identifiable information to the acquiring entity.  If, as a result of such a business  transition, your personally 
				identifiable information will be used in a  materially different manner, you will be given choice consistent with our  policy regarding notification of changes.</p>
			<h4 id="c3">Choices Available to You</h4>
				<p>You can always choose whether or  not to disclose personally identifiable information and that choice will not  prevent you from using the Website. 
				Please note, however, if you should choose  to withhold requested information, we may not be able to provide you with some  of the services dependent 
				upon the collection of this information and you will  be given an opportunity to "opt-in" and make your preference choices for any  items 
				that are optional and which are not prerequisite for our rendering such  services. </p>
				<p>You can choose at anytime to opt  out of receiving emails from Bitrix24 or from having your personally  identifiable information shared with 
				selected companies. If you wish to opt  out, you can do so by editing your User Account preferences with respect to  e-mail or the sharing of information. 
				If you elect to "opt out" we will not, as  applicable, share your personal information with third parties or send you  emails.  However, 
				we may continue to use  your personal information for internal purposes, to enhance your user  experience or as necessary to administer the site or 
				comply with applicable law.</p>
				<p>We reserve the right to send a  one-time registration confirmation email, and infrequent service alert messages  to users to inform them 
				of specific changes that may impact their ability to  use a service they have previously signed up for, regardless of email contact  opt-in status.
				 We also reserve the right  to contact you if compelled to do so as part of a legal proceeding or if there  has been a violation of any applicable 
				 licensing, warranty and purchase  agreements. </p>
				<p>Bitrix24 is retaining these  rights because in limited cases we feel that we may need to contact you as a  matter of law or regarding matters 
				that will be important to you. These rights  do not allow us to contact you to market a new or existing service if you have  asked us not to do 
				so, and issuance of these types of communications is rare. </p>
				<p>When you create a User Account  with Bitrix24 and/or provide your e-mail address and other personal  identification information, based on your 
				personal preferences, we may  periodically contact you via e-mail and provide information about special  offers and promotions that may be of interest to you. 
				These communications will  relate to Bitrix24 offers and/or the promotions of select, reputable third  parties with whom Bitrix24 has a strategic marketing 
				relationship because they  offer products or services that we believe would be of interest to you.  We may use a third party e-mail service  provider to 
				send e-mails to you. This service provider is prohibited from using  your e-mail address for any purpose other than to send Bitrix24 related  e-mail. 
				If you do not wish to receive  e-mails with updates and information please unsubscribe by sending email to: 
				<a href="mailto:unsubscribe@bitrix24.com">unsubscribe@bitrix24.com</a>.  In addition,  every time you receive an e-mail you will be provided the choice 
				to opt-out of  future e-mails by following the instructions provided in the e-mail.  You may also opt-out online by updating your User  Account as 
				described in the User Account section of this Privacy Policy (above).</p>
				<p>If you wish to opt out of  receiving emails, the sharing or retention of any personal identification  information, or otherwise change your personal 
				preferences, you may contact Bitrix24  by email at <a href="mailto:privacy@bitrix24.com">privacy@bitrix24.com</a>.</p>
				<p>To ensure  that your request is honored, you must provide Bitrix24 with information sufficient for us to  accurately identify and access your records. 
				The information we require is your full name, address and the email  address you provided to Bitrix24 when you requested services or products.
				 Bitrix24 reserves the right to contact you to verify that we have  accurately identified your record.</p>
			<h4 id="c4">Cookies and Web Beacons</h4>
				<p>The Website uses "cookie" and  "web beacon" technology.  "Cookies" are  short pieces of data generated by a web 
				server that a website stores on a  user's computer.  Certain pages on our  Website may require the use of a cookie for purposes of keeping 
				information you  enter on multiple pages together.   Cookies also enable us to customize our Website and offerings to your  needs and provide
				 you with a better online experience with us.  In addition, cookies are used to: </p>
				<ul>
				<li>measure usage of various pages on our Website to help us make our information; more pertinent to your needs and easy for you to access; </li>
				<li>identify and categorized the internet webpages from which the visitor came to the Website and observe the browsing patterns;  and </li>
				<li>provide functionality such as online orders, Bitrix24 services and other functionality that we believe would be of interest and value to you. </li>
				</ul>

				<p>The types of cookies that we use  are referred to as "session" cookies and "persistent" cookies.  Session cookies are temporary and are  automatically deleted once you leave the Website.  Persistent cookies remain on your computer  hard drive until you delete them.  We do  not use cookies to gather information concerning your visits to other websites,  nor ascertain any personally identifiable information about you apart from what  you voluntarily provide us in your dealings with Bitrix24.  Cookies do not, under ordinary circumstances,  corrupt or damage your computer, programs, or computer files.</p>

				<p>  In addition, the service  providers we use to serve and host our advertisements, and/or deliver our  e-mails use session and persistent cookies, to track the number of times the  Website is accessed and whether the site was accessed from an advertisement.  There are no cookies in the advertisements or  e-mails.  A cookie is placed on your  computer only if and when you click on an advertisement or open the  e-mail.  The cookie generated from the  advertisement or e-mail does not contain any personally identifiable  information and will remain on your hard drive until you delete it.</p>
				  
				<p>  You may set your browser to block  cookies (consult the instructions for your particular browser on how to do  this), although doing so may adversely affect your ability to perform certain  transactions, use certain functionality and access certain content on our  Website.</p>
				  
				<p>  Web beacons  are used in combination with cookies to help website operators understand how  visitors interact with their websites. A web beacon is typically a transparent  graphic image (usually 1 pixel x 1 pixel) that is placed on a site. In contrast  to cookies, which are stored on a user's computer hard drive, web beacons are  embedded invisibly on Web pages and are about the size of the period at the end  of this sentence. These web beacons are not tied to personally identifiable  information. The use of a web beacons allows the site to measure the actions of  the visitor opening the page that contains the web beacon. It makes it easier  to follow and record the activities of a recognized browser, such as the path  of pages visited at a website.  Bitrix24  uses the information provided by web beacons to develop a better understanding  of how the Website's visitors use the Website, and to facilitate those  visitors' interactions with the Website. Bitrix24 may make the aggregate data  obtained from web analytics (including from our third party analytics  providers, if applicable) publicly available. If this data is made available,  none of the information will be personally identifying information or  potentially-personally identifying information.</p>
				  
			<h4 id="d">D. PRIVACY-RELATED INQUIRIES AND COMPLAINTS</h4>

				<p>Bitrix24 takes and addresses its  users' privacy concerns with utmost respect and attention.  If you believe that there was an instance of  non-compliance with this Privacy Policy with regard to your personal  information or you have other related inquiries or concerns, you may write or  contact Bitrix24 at email: <a href="mailto:privacy@bitrix24.com">privacy@bitrix24.com</a>.</p>

				<p>In your message, please describe  in as much detail as possible the nature of your inquiry or the ways in which  you believe that the Privacy Policy has not been complied with.  We will investigate your inquiry or complaint  promptly.</p>
				  
				<p>Please note that if you provide Bitrix24  with inconsistent privacy preferences (for example, by indicating on one  occasion that third parties may contact you with marketing offers and  indicating on another occasion that they may not), Bitrix24 cannot guarantee  that your most recent privacy preference will be honored.</p>
