is meant to inform our users of how we define, gather and utilize 
personally identifiable information. bitpipe will take reasonable steps to 
protect user privacy consistent with the guidelines set forth in this 
policy and the law. 
<p></p><b> Information Collected</b>
<br>As a standard practice, bitpipe assigns a random number to each user 
for anonymously tracking content preferences and traffic patterns. This 
random number lets us keep track of "how many" times folks are doing 
specific things - like visiting our site each month - without really 
knowing who those folks are. We analyze this data for trends and 
statistics, such as which parts of our site users are visiting
and how long they spend there. We also gather information about what 
folks are searching for. We use all this information in order to 
improve our content, plan site enhancements, and measure overall 
site effectiveness, and therefore to make the site better and more 
hopefully fitting to your needs.
<p></p><ol type="A"></ol><b>Cookies</b>
<br>This random number is kept in a file on your computer called 
a "cookie." Cookies, by themselves, cannot be used to determine the 
identity of any user: unless you specifically tell us (e.g. when you sign
up for <i>KnowledgeAlert!</i>), bitpipe will 
not know who you are even though we assign a cookie to your computer. 
You can set your browser to notify you when you receive a cookie, 
giving you the chance to decide whether or not to accept it.  
(However, by not accepting cookies, some of our web pages may not 
display properly or you may not be permitted to access certain 
information.)
<p></p><b>Sharing Information</b><br>We provide summary reports to the companies that put information 
into our database. The type of information included in a summary report 
is "5,000 people looked at your information this week, and of those 
people 25% clicked through to read the full report." The folks that put 
content into the database need this information to determine how 
effective their content is. We don't tell the content companies specifically
who it was that saw or clicked on their reports unless you 
have specifically told us this is acceptable. 
<p>bitpipe discloses aggregated user statistics (for example, 25% of our users are interested in Networking)
in order to describe our services to prospective partners, and other third parties, and for other lawful purposes. 
</p><p><b></b></p><b>Partners and Other Sites</b><br>bitpipe does not control the information collection and distribution 
policies on sites outside of bitpipe.com, although we do encourage our 
co-branding partners to adopt privacy policies similar to this one.
<p><b></b></p> <i><b>KnowledgeAlert!</b></i>
<br><i>KnowledgeAlert!</i> is a customizable email delivery system for keeping you 
up to date on your areas of interest. The quality of the information and 
services that bitpipe can provide depends on the accuracy and depth of 
information that you supply. bitpipe uses this data to provide a 
customized, personalized email service. 
You may edit your <i>KnowledgeAlert!</i> Information at any time by using your 
email address and password. Your <i>KnowledgeAlert!</i> account can be deleted or individual subscriptions deactivated, but doing so will result in you not receiving emails on your topics of interest.
<p>Summary reports of content accessed via KnowledgeAlert are provided to 
the companies that put content in our database. We do not give these 
companies individual details except as noted below under KnowledgeAlert partners. 
</p><ol type="A"></ol><p></p><b><i>KnowledgeAlert!</i> Partners</b><br>If you initially sign on to <i>KnowledgeAlert!</i> through a partner's website 
(ie other than on bitpipe.com)  we will share your name, email address 
and your interest in that partner's offerings with that partner. We 
encourage our co-branding partners to adopt privacy policies similar to 
this one but ultimately they control their use of your information. You 
should contact these partners directly if you have any questions about 
their use of this information. If you subsequently sign up for other 
information via <i>KnowledgeAlert!</i> that is not related to the original 
source partner we do not share those individual details with the original 
partner or anyone else.

Since <i>KnowledgeAlert!</i> is customizable by you, you may opt out of (delete or make "inactive") any of your <i>KnowledgeAlert!</i> subscriptions at any time.
<p><b></b></p> <i><b>KnowledgeAlert! </b></i><b>Password</b>
<br>Your <i>KnowledgeAlert!</i> Account Information is password-protected  
so that you and only you have access to this personal information. 
<p>We recommend that you do not divulge your password to anyone. bitpipe 
never asks for passwords in unsolicited phone calls or unsolicited emails. Remember to sign out of your <i>KnowledgeAlert!</i> account and close your browser window when you have finished. This is to ensure that others cannot access your personal information if you share a computer with someone else, or are using a computer in a public place such as a library or Internet cafe. </p><p></p><b>And Finally</b><br>bitpipe may disclose Personal Information if required to do so by law. 
<p></p>
bitpipe may modify, alter or otherwise update this policy at any time, so we encourage you to review this
policy from time to time.
<p></p>
If you have any queries about this policy please feel free to contact our <a href="mailto:webmaster@bitpipe.com">webmaster</a>.
