			<p>BitRhymes Inc (“BitRhymes” or “we”) is dedicated to protecting the  privacy rights of our online users (“users” or “you”). This Online  Privacy Policy (“Privacy Policy”) has been crafted to inform you as to  the ways we collect, store, use, and manage the information you provide  in connection with any BitRhymes game or application (“Service”). Please  note that the scope of this Privacy Policy is limited to only  information collected from BitRhymes through use of the Service.</p>
<p>By using the Service, you are agreeing to the collection and use of your  personal information as outlined in this Privacy Policy. We may amend  the Privacy Policy from time to time, and we encourage you to consult  the Privacy Policy regularly for changes.</p>
<h3>Information Collected and Used</h3>
<p>BitRhymes’s primary objective in collecting user information is to  provide and enhance the Service and to enable users to easily navigate  and enjoy the Service.</p>
<p>When you install any of the BitRhymes games or applications, we may  collect and record the information you provide us voluntarily through  www.facebook.com (“Facebook”) in accordance with the policies and terms  of Facebook.</p>
<p>The types of personal information collected in accordance with the  activities listed above may vary depending on the activity. This  “personal information” is defined as information about you that can be  used to contact or identify you. Personal information may include: (1)  your name, (2) Facebook user identification number, (3) or email  address. Additionally, we may acquire information from you through (1)  your access and participation in message boards on the Service (2) your  email of a question to our customer support or (3) your purchase of a  virtual product of any type.  Please note that because a third party  site manages the purchases of virtual goods offered by the Service, we  do not have access to your credit card details and billing information.</p>
<p>BitRhymes may also invite you to share non-personal information about  yourself which may include but is not limited to: (1) your age or date  of birth; (2) your gender; (3) information about the hardware you may  own; (4) your favorite websites, friend information and fan pages  (collectively referred to as “non-personal information”).  If  non-personal information is collected for an activity that also requires  personal information, BitRhymes may combine your non-personal  information with your personal information in an attempt to provide you  with a better user experience, to improve the quality and value of the  Services and to analyze how our Service is used.</p>
<p>The Service will also record game play information such as your high scores or game session duration.</p>
<p>In addition to information collected as described above, you may choose  to share additional information about yourself throughout the Service,  such as in games or on message boards. Any action you perform with other  players are considered public, and are your sole discretion.</p>
<p>Finally, any time you access the Service, we may collect aggregate  information including but not limited to internet protocol addresses,  browser type, browser language, referring / exit pages and URLs,  platform type, number of clicks, domain names, landing pages, pages  viewed and the order of those pages, the amount of time spent on  particular pages, and the date and time of this activity. We use this  information to better tailor the Service to your interests, to provide  you more efficient customer support, and to overall enhance the Service.</p>
<p>In all cases of data access and collection, the information you provide  will not be disclosed, rented, leased, loaned, sold, or otherwise  voluntarily distributed to unaffiliated third parties and will be used  solely for the purpose of providing you with and improving the Service.</p>
<h3>Other Disclosure of Your Personal Information</h3>
<p>You understand and agree that we may be required to disclose any  personal information if required to do so by law or in the good faith  belief that such disclosure is reasonably necessary to avoid liability,  to comply with legal process, including but not limited to a search  warrant, subpoena, statute, or court order, or to protect our rights and  property, or that of the public. Note that BitRhymes is not required to  question or contest the validity of any search warrant, subpoena or  other similar governmental request that BitRhymes may receive.</p>
<p>Additionally, in the event of a merger, acquisition, reorganization,  bankruptcy, or other similar event, customer information may be  transferred to BitRhymes’s successor or assignee, if permitted by and  done in accordance with applicable law.</p>
<h3>Cookies</h3>
<p>A cookie is a small data file that we transfer to your computer’s hard  disk, generally to quickly identify a user’s computer and to “remember”  things about the user’s visit, such as your preferences or a user name  and password. The Service sends cookies to your computer when you access  or view content of a BitRhymes game.  Information contained in a cookie  may be linked to your personal information for purposes such as  improving the quality of our service, tailoring recommendations to your  interests, and making the Service easier to use.  You can disable  cookies at any time, although you may not be able to access or use  features of the Service.</p>
<h3>Links</h3>
<p>The Service may contain links to other websites.  The fact that the  Service links to a website or presents a banner ad or other type of  advertisement does not mean that BitRhymes endorses or authorizes that  third party, nor is it a representation of our affiliation with that  third party. BitRhymes is in no way responsible for the privacy policies  of these other websites to which you chose to access from the Service.   Please be sure to read the privacy policies of those websites when  exiting the Service.</p>
<h3>Changing or Deleting Your Information</h3>
<p>You may review, update, correct or delete any personal information by  changing the applicable information by changing the applicable  information in your Facebook profile page. If you completely delete all  this information, your account may become deactivated. If you would like  us to delete your record in our system, please contact us and we will  attempt to accommodate your request if we are not legally obligated to  retain the record.</p>
<h3>Security</h3>
<p>We have put in place reasonable technical and organizational measures  designed to secure your personal information from accidental loss and  from unauthorized access, use, alteration or disclosure. However, we  cannot guarantee that unauthorized third parties will never be able to  overcome those measures or use your personal information for improper  purposes. Also please note that email and messaging systems are not  considered secure, so we discourage you from sending us personal  information through these mediums.</p>
<h3>Policy Regarding Children</h3>
<p>The Service is not geared toward children under the age of 13 and we do  not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age  of 13. If we learn that a child under 13 has provided us with personal  information we will delete such information from our files as quickly as  possible.</p>
<h3>Contacting Us</h3>
<p>If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please <a title="Contact Us" href="http://www.bitrhymes.com/wordpress/contact/">contact us</a>.</p>
