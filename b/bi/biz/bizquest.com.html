        </p>
        <p>
            BizQuest shares member information in the following areas on the site: Business
            and Franchise Listing Service, Saved Search Email Alerts, BizQuest Blog and the
            Broker Directory. When a member enters a business or franchise listing in the Listing
            Service, listing contact information is also entered. In addition, members searching
            BizQuest can view contact information when they view a listing profile. BizQuest
            allows users to share contact information with one another via its Saved Search
            Email Alert service. With Saved Searches users can save their business search criteria
            to have information about businesses that match the specified criteria emailed to
            them. When selecting this service, users are given the option of releasing their
            contact information to other users who have business listings that match their criteria.
            This contact information is then shared with the users who have business listings
            that match the buying or leasing criteria. Unless required by law as detailed in
            this section or a user specifically takes action as discussed in this paragraph,
            BizQuest does not share individual user search activity information and such activity
            information remains private to the individual user and to BizQuest. Broker Members
            agree to share their contact information and allow all BizQuest users to view their
            contact information via the BizQuest Business Broker Directory or via links made
            available to users on a listing or in an email. BizQuest users who do not opt out
            of the Broker Directory service during registration with BizQuest (or anytime thereafter)
            also agree to share their contact information via the BizQuest Broker Directory.
        </p>
        <p>
            BizQuest shares information with its partners for the purpose of providing related
            services in which we deem our users have interest. The use that BizQuest's partners
            make of customer information will not exceed BizQuest's use of the data. Key billing
            information (such as credit card number, expiration date and dollar amount) gathered
            from users making online purchases of products or services is shared with PayPal or CyberSource,
            our credit card processing partners, in order to authorize charges to the credit
