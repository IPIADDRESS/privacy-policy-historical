<h2><strong>BizQuest's  Privacy Statement</strong></h2>
<p>  This privacy statement covers the  website <a href="http://www.BizQuest.com/" title="Franchises for sale on BizQuest">http://www.BizQuest.com/</a>.  By accessing, using or registering with BizQuest's web site, you accept and  agree to BizQuest's Privacy Policy. BizQuest provides a variety of online  services to assist individuals and brokers with buying and selling businesses  and franchises. BizQuest values your privacy, feedback and candor very highly.  Any user information we collect is considered private and we do not use it or  share it except as permitted herein, without the user's permission. We use this  personal information at BizQuest to provide the best quality service possible.  The following privacy statement summarizes BizQuest's protection and use of any  personal information provided by visitors to the BizQuest site. </p>
<p> This policy does not apply to any  public area of BizQuest's web site or services. In the event you submit  personally identifiable information to contact another member, contact a lister  about a listing, create a listing, add a contact on a listing, the BizQuest Blog  or Broker Directory, such information becomes publicly available and BizQuest  is not responsible for the personally identifiable information you choose to  submit to these services, forums, listings, or persons.</p>
<p>  <strong>Information  Collected by BizQuest: </strong></p>
<p> BizQuest collects user information  from several areas of the BizQuest site including products; business services;  the adding and editing of business and franchise listings; the adding and  editing of Broker Directory Listings; email forms; the BizQuest Blog; and any  surveys or contests that BizQuest may sponsor. BizQuest collects individual  user search activity for statistical, archival, and business purposes. BizQuest  collects financial information (such as billing address, credit card number,  expiration date) for billing payment and credit card authorization purposes. BizQuest  may track the IP address of a user's computer or place a "cookie" in  the browser files of a user's computer. This is required by BizQuest services  to provide automated features.</p>
<p>  <strong>Use  of Information Collected: </strong></p>
<p>  Collected information helps BizQuest  better understand its users' needs in order to improve its product and service  offerings. Email addresses are used to communicate with members through the BizQuest  Buyer, Broker and Franchise Newsletters (weekly or bi-weekly email news  summaries); Promotional emails; Partner emails and for site administration  purposes. Users may be deleted from Newsletters, Promotional email and Partner  email lists at their request. Personal information may be used to contact users  for the purpose of research, product development, marketing, or customer  service, if the user has opted to receive such communication. User search  activity is collected and analyzed and may be utilized by BizQuest in the  aggregate or in the abstract for a variety of business purposes. Financial  information is used to bill users for products and services purchased. Within BizQuest,  only accounting managers have access to the credit card account information.  This information is not shared with anyone outside of BizQuest. IP address and  cookie log data is analyzed to better understand traffic flows and user  preferences.</p>
<p>  <strong>Use  of Email Tools: </strong></p>
<p>  You may NOT use the Email the  Broker, Email a Listing service or other email services that we offer to send  spam (i.e. unsolicited commercial email) or otherwise send content that would  violate BizQuest's Terms and Conditions. We may monitor, track or save the use  of this feature, but will be under no obligation to monitor, track or save  these email messages sent from these tools. If you send an email using the  Email a Listing to a Friend service to an email address that is not registered  in our system, we do not use that email address for any purpose other than to  send your email, and for us to automatically send your friend a one-time email  inviting him or her to visit the site. BizQuest stores this information for the  sole purpose of sending this one-time email and for tracking the success of our  referral program. We also do not rent or sell these email addresses of  un-registered users.</p>
<p>  <strong>Shared  information: </strong></p>
<p>  Though BizQuest makes every effort  to preserve user privacy, we may need to disclose personal information when  required by law wherein we have good faith belief that such action is necessary  to comply with a current judicial proceeding, a court order or legal process  served on our Web site. </p>
<p> BizQuest shares member information  in the following areas on the site: Business and Franchise Listing Service, Saved  Search Email Alerts, BizQuest Blog and the Broker Directory. When a member  enters a business or franchise listing in the Listing Service, listing contact  information is also entered. In addition, members searching BizQuest can view  contact information when they view a listing profile. BizQuest allows users to  share contact information with one another via its Saved Search Email Alert  service. With Saved Searches users can save their business search criteria to  have information about businesses that match the specified criteria emailed to  them. When selecting this service, users are given the option of releasing  their contact information to other users who have business listings that match  their criteria. This contact information is then shared with the users who have  business listings that match the buying or leasing criteria. Unless required by  law as detailed in this section or a user specifically takes action as  discussed in this paragraph, BizQuest does not share individual user search  activity information and such activity information remains private to the  individual user and to BizQuest. Broker Members agree to share their contact  information and allow all BizQuest users to view their contact information via  the BizQuest Business Broker Directory or via links made available to users on  a listing or in an email. BizQuest users who do not opt out of the Broker  Directory service during registration with BizQuest (or anytime thereafter)  also agree to share their contact information via the BizQuest Broker  Directory. </p>
<p> BizQuest shares information with its  partners for the purpose of providing related services in which we deem our  users have interest. The use that BizQuest's partners make of customer  information will not exceed BizQuest's use of the data. Key billing information  (such as credit card number, expiration date and dollar amount) gathered from  users making online purchases of products or services is shared with PayPal,  our credit card processing partner, in order to authorize charges to the credit  card. BizQuest also uses third party providers to perform email and postal  mailings on behalf of BizQuest, but this information (such as name, address and  email) is confidential and is not used by the provider for any other purpose. </p>
<p> BizQuest does not rent or lease user  information to any third party, except as disclosed here. From time to time, BizQuest  may obtain information (such as electronic mail addresses) from third party  providers. It is our goal to only contact individuals who we believe may have a  legitimate business interest in BizQuest based on their membership or  participation in other organizations or web sites, and who have indicated a  willingness to be contacted for this purpose. While BizQuest endeavors to work  with other sites and companies with a similar respect for user privacy, BizQuest  cannot be responsible for the privacy practices of other sites. </p>
<p> Please be aware that in the event BizQuest  merges with a third party, or in the event all or substantially all of BizQuest's  assets are acquired by a third party, customer information, including  personally identifiable information, will be shared and/or transferred to such  third party. The information may only be used or shared by such third parties  for the primary purpose for which the information was originally collected. If  such third parties, or if BizQuest for its own business needs, desire to use  the personally identifiable information for another purpose, you will be  notified prior to the information being used for a new purpose, and you will  have the opportunity to opt out of such new use of your personally identifiable  information.</p>
<p>  <strong>Security  of personal information: </strong></p>
<p>  BizQuest's clients and their  personal information are considered to be BizQuest's greatest asset and thus  their privacy is treated with the utmost regard and respect. BizQuest takes  every reasonable precaution to secure personal information within both its  computers and its physical premises. </p>
<p> The security of your personal  information is important to BizQuest. When you enter sensitive information  (such as a credit card number) on our registration or order forms, we encrypt  that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). [To learn more  about SSL, follow this link <a href="http://www.verisign.com" title="VeriSign" target="_blank">http://www.verisign.com</a>]. </p>
<p> We follow generally accepted  industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both  during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the  Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore,  while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal  information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. </p>
<p> If you have any questions about  security on our Web site, please <a href="http://www.bizquest.com/support/contact.asp" title="Contact Us">contact us</a>.</p>

<p> We use third-party advertising  companies to serve ads when you visit our Web site. The third-party advertising  technology that we use on this Web site uses information derived from your  visits to this site to target advertising within this site. In addition, our  advertisers may use other third-party advertising technology to target  advertising on this site and other sites.

<p>  <strong>Testimonials: </strong></p>
<p>  We post customer testimonials on our  web site which may contain personally identifiable information such as the  customer's name. We do obtain the customer's consent to post their name along  with their testimonial prior to any posting of such testimonial.</p>
<p>  <strong>Opting-out,  editing, updating or deleting personal information: </strong></p>
<p>  BizQuest utilizes email as a vital  and primary communication channel with registered users and customers. As a  registered user/customer, you hereby acknowledge and grant BizQuest the  permission to communicate with you via email (as well as other communication  channels such as phone and fax) for any purposes BizQuest determines to be  relevant including, but not limited to, system messages, product updates,  service announcements and other marketing messages. BizQuest will use best  efforts to honor customers request to opt out of marketing messages, but under  no circumstances will BizQuest have any liability for sending any email to its  registered users/customers. </p>
<p> Users who do not wish to receive  marketing emails including the BizQuest Newsletters, BizQuest Promotional  Emails, or Sponsor Emails are requested to contact <a href="http://www.bizquest.com/support/contact.asp" title="BizQuest Client Services">BizQuest  Client Services</a>, or select the opt-out option that  is available on all email correspondence. Additionally, users may also opt out  of Saved Search Email Alerts by returning to the Saved Search section and  clicking on the "Remove this Search" button. We also send our users  site and service announcement updates. Members are not able to un-subscribe  from service announcements, which contain important information about service  notices and responsibilities. BizQuest occasionally communicates with its users  via email and phone to provide information about requested services and  regarding issues related to their account. It is important to note that this  communication is not used for marketing or promotional purposes. Requesting the  deletion of certain types of user information may prevent users from accessing  some web site features. </p>
<p> You may correct or update your  personally identifiable information by going to the area of the site where you  submitted the information, and following the instructions to view, change or  delete the information. </p>
<p> Credit card information submitted to  BizQuest is typically used for a one-time charge to your account, and  subsequent orders for renewals require users to resubmit the credit  information. (An exception: Broker Membership accounts and Franchise Directory  advertising are automatically renewed each month, using the original credit  information submitted.) Therefore, for added security, any credit card  information submitted to BizQuest is not accessible for review or modification  by signing on to your ad. If you have questions regarding the credit card  information used in ordering your products or services, please <a href="http://www.bizquest.com/support/contact.asp" title="Contact Us">contact us</a> or at 888-280-3815.</p>

<p>  If BizQuest decides to change its  privacy policy, we will post those changes to this privacy statement, the  homepage, and other places we deem appropriate so that you are aware of what  information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we  disclose it. </p>
<p> BizQuest reserves the right to  modify this privacy statement at any time, so please review it frequently. If BizQuest  makes material changes to this policy, we will notify you here, by email, or by  means of a notice on our home page.</p>
