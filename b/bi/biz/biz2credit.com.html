privacy policy (“Privacy Policy”) describes:</p>
<ul>
<li> the information we collect about you</li>
<li> how we use that information</li>
<li> with whom we share that information</li>
<li> how we protect that information</li>
<li> your choices about what information you provide to us, and our use and ability to transfer this information</li>
<li> how you can access that information</li>
<li> how you can contact us with any questions you have relating to privacy or our use of your information, and</li>
<li> other information regarding our privacy practices and procedures.</li></ul>
<p>
  This Privacy Policy applies to all information collected on the Biz2Credit.com website and other primary
  Biz2Credit websites. Some Biz2Credit-branded websites or other websites we operate may be governed
  by different privacy policies, which will be clearly indicated by links on the footer of the pages on those
  sites. The policy that applies on any of our domains or sub-domains is always the policy that appears in
the footer of each website page.</p>
<p>
  <em><strong>By using this website and by accepting the Privacy Policy, Terms of Use and the User Agreement, as
  you are required to do in registration, you expressly consent to the terms and conditions set forth in
this Privacy Policy.</strong></em></p>

  personal information shared. We may share all types of personal information with:</p>
<ul>
<li>Authorized service providers: If you request a loan, we may share your personal information with our authorized service providers that perform certain services on our behalf in connection with this request. These service providers include credit bureaus, title companies, insurance providers, attorneys, appraisal companies, escrow companies, closing agents and other financial institutions. Authorized service providers may also include marketing and customer services firms and credit card payment processors. As discussed below, aggregated, non-personal information may be provided to companies that conduct surveys, or other features offered through our website, or that provide business analysis or website support. These service providers may have access to personal information as needed to perform their functions, but are not in any case permitted to share, disclose, sell or use such information for any other purpose.</li>
<li>Business partners : When you express interest in promotions offered on our website, we may share your expression of interest with the businesses with which we partner to offer you those products, services, and/or promotions.

The lenders with whom you are matched, with whom Biz2Credit has shared your information, will in each case be disclosed to you. Biz2Credit will not share information with any other prospective lender not disclosed to you. These lenders or other financial institutions on the Biz2Credit network may retain or use your personal information whether or not you qualify for, or obtain, a loan from them, subject to the requirements that Biz2Credit imposes on them.</li>
<li>Biz2Credit.com users. Your User ID may be displayed throughout Biz2Credit and is therefore available to the public. All of your activity on our website is traceable to your User ID.

  about you and other customers collectively, but not specifically identifiable to you) and other non-personal
  information we collect from registration, applications or other use of our website or services in
  order to develop and/or deliver targeted advertising on our website and on website of third parties. We
  may also combine non-personal information we collect with additional non-personal information
  collected from other sources. In addition, we may share aggregated information with third parties,
  including advisors, advertisers and investors, for the purpose of conducting general business analysis
  and developing site metrics. For example, we may tell our advertisers the number of visitors to our
  website and the most popular features or services accessed or use such aggregated, non-personal
  information to develop website content and services that we hope you and other users will find of
  interest and to target content and advertising.</p>
<p> <strong>Third-party websites</strong>. There are a number of places on our website where you may click on a link to
  access other websites, each of which operates under its own privacy policy and not Biz2Credit’s Privacy
  Policy. For example, if you click on an advertisement or a search result on our website, you may be
  taken to a website that we do not control. These third-party websites may independently solicit and
  collect information, including personal information, from you and, in some instances, provide us with
  information about your activities on those websites. While Biz2Credit will only directly transfer data to
  other websites that have adequate data protection and privacy policies Biz2Credit cannot control such
  uses or use by companies whose links you click on. We therefore recommend that you consult the
  privacy statements of all third-party website you visit by clicking on the "privacy" link typically located at
the bottom of the webpage you are visiting.</p>

<ul>

<li>To comply with applicable law or cooperate with law enforcement; or to enforce our website terms and conditions or other agreements or policies.</li>
<li>In connection with a substantial corporate transaction, such as the sale of our business, a divestiture, merger, consolidation or asset sale. In this event, you will be afforded the opportunity to opt out of any further promotional or other communications.</li>
</ul>
<p> <strong>Third-party use of your information.</strong>Biz2Credit seeks to ensure that all third parties to whom we
  transfer data maintain appropriate data protection protocols and privacy policies. Accordingly,
  Biz2Credit contractually requires its vendors and affiliates to maintain appropriate security and privacy
  policies, and we will not transfer personal information to any entity whose policy would permit the sale
  or other redistribution of personal information. However, Biz2Credit does not control the actual use of
  transferred data by such third parties, which are governed by their internal policies and procedures.
  These entities or their servers may be located either inside or outside the United States, in which case
they may be governed by different privacy laws or policies.</p>
<p> <em><strong>By disclosing your information to Biz2Credit through registration, the loan application process or
  otherwise on our website, you expressly consent to any transfer of your information as described
above and in this Privacy Policy.</strong></em></p>
<h3>HOW WE PROTECT YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION</h3>

  We have therefore implemented panoply of industry-security measures (including physical, electronic
  and procedural measures) to help safeguard your personal information from unauthorized access and
  disclosure. Only authorized employees and authorized third-party service providers are permitted to
  access personal information, and they may do so only for specified and limited business functions. In
  addition, we use encryption in the transmission of your sensitive personal information between your
  system and ours, and we use firewalls to help prevent unauthorized persons from gaining access to your
  personal information. We want you to feel confident using our website for business transactions.
  However, no system can be completely secure. Therefore, we do not promise, and you should not
  expect, that your personal information, searches, or other communications will always remain secure in
all cases.</p>
<p> <strong>DocVault</strong> : Biz2Credit’s Doc Vault system allows only authorized users to upload the documents.
  Biz2Credit does not allow any documents to be edited while being in Doc Vault and maintains a log of
every document uploaded, tagged and shared. DocVault’shistory feature also tracks every document
  which is shared by time and date and also time stamped when the link is clicked and document
downloaded.</p>
<p><strong>Other Business Tools</strong> :  Biz2Credit’s other proprietary Business Tools also allow only authorized users to
  access information input into our Business Tools such as BizAnalyzer, Financial Calculator and
  BizConnect. Personal information input into BizConnect will only be shared with prospective lenders
with the express consent of our customer.</p>
<p> <strong>Account security : </strong> We have also implemented the following additional features to help strengthen the
security of your user account:</p>
<ul>
<li>Session Timeout. A session timeout has been implemented so that the maximum specified period of user inactivity does not exceed 25 minutes.</li>
<li>Temporary Account Lockout. Access is locked for 30 minutes by the system if a 3 or more consecutive unsuccessful login attempts are made regardless of session or time frame. User may not log back in, re-authenticate online, create a new account, order products, view products or use login help when the account is locked out. However, the user can contact the call center/help desk to activate account when the account is locked.</li>
<li>Long Term Account Lockout. Access to accounts will be locked indefinitely (until manually unlocked by a Call Center/Help Desk Agent) if the user attempts to use login help unsuccessfully 3 or more times regardless of session or time frame. User may not login, create a new account, reauthenticate online, order products, view products or use login help when the account is locked out. As above, the user can contact the Call Center/Help Desk to activate account when account is locked out. </li>
</ul>
<p>For a more detailed description of these security measures, please refer to our Terms of Use, “Security
  Measures”.  </p>
<h3>YOUR CHOICES ABOUT COLLECTION AND USE OF YOUR INFORMATION</h3>
<ul>
<li>When you initially use our website, you will be given a choice as to whether you want to receive email messages or newsletters from Biz2Credit and certain of its partners or affiliates. You may at any time modify your choice through Settings in your user account. You also will be given the opportunity, in any commercial email that we send to you, to opt out of receiving such messages in the future. It may take up to 10 business days for us to process an opt-out request.</li>
<li>We may send you other types of transactional and relationship email communications, such as loan offers, requests for additional information, service updates or announcements, administrative notices, and surveys, without offering you the prior opportunity to opt out of receiving them (thereafter you may always opt out as provided directly above). If we have already provided your information to a third party before you have changed your preferences, opted out or updated your information, you may have to change you preferences directly with that third party.</li>
<li>You may instruct us not to call you for marketing purposes through Settings in your user account. We will implement your instructions within 10 business days. Please note that we may still need to call you for servicing or other non-marketing purposes.</li>
<li>If you do not want us to send you postal mail for marketing purposes, you may remove your name from current and future mailing lists through Settings in your user account.</li>
<li>Federal and state regulations require that we store completed loan questionnaire forms for various periods of time. In order to comply with these requirements, we may be unable to delete your information within a specified time period from the Biz2Credit database or servers.</li>
</ul>
