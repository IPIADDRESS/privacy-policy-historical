		<h1>				Privacy Policy				</h1>        
        <h3>Last Updated:  April 18th, 2012</h3>
<h3><strong>OUR POLICY</strong> </h3>
<p>We value your business and contributions to the global Biz2Credit community, so we are committed to informing you how we use, maintain, and share the information that you share with us. This information handling policy ("Policy") applies to your use of all products, services and websites offered by Biz2Credit, Inc or its subsidiaries or affiliated companies. Some Biz2Credit-branded websites or other websites we operate may be governed by different privacy policies, which will be clearly indicated by links on the footer of the pages on those sites. The policy that applies on any of our domains or subdomains is always the policy that appears in the footer of each website page.</p>
<p> If you have any questions about our Policy, you can contact us through our website: <a href="mailto:privacy@biz2credit.com">privacy@biz2credit.com</a>, or you can write to us at the address posted at the end of this policy. </p>
<p>This Policy will describe: </p>
<ul><li>the information we collect</li>
<li>how we use that information </li>
<li>who we share information with</li>
<li>how we protect your information</li>
<li> your choices about our use and transfer of your information</li>
<li>how you can access your information</li>
<li>how you can contact us with any questions you have relating to privacy or our use of your information</li>
<li>how we enforce our Policy, and</li>
<li>other information regarding our privacy practices and procedures.</li>
</ul>
<p><em><strong> You agree to this Policy by accepting the Terms of Use Agreement and also by using or browsing this website. You may review our Terms of Use Agreement at <a href="terms-of-use.html" target="_blank">http://www.biz2credit.com/terms-of-use.html</a></strong></em></p>
<p><strong>THE INFORMATION WE COLLECT</strong></p>
<p><em><strong>In General.</strong></em> We collect information that can identify you such as your name and email address, as well as other information that does not identify you. When you provide information through our website, this information will be sent to Biz2Credit servers located in the United States.</p>
<ul><li><em>Information you provide.</em> We may collect and store any information you enter on our website during registration, applications or provide to us in some other manner. This includes identifying information such as your name, home or mailing address, email address, and telephone number); information about your business or prospective business; your financial information (such as your income, assets, or debts), or other personal information. We may also periodically obtain both personal and non-personal information about you from business partners, contractors and other third parties. </li>
  
<li><em>Information we may request.</em> Examples of information that we may request and/or receive about you include credit reports, information about your business and additional demographic information. However, Biz2Credit will not request or access any credit bureau reports or other credit information without your express prior permission in connection with a business loan. </li>

<li><em>DocVault.</em> Subscribers and customers also have the ability to store and access other documents and information on DocVault, Biz2Credit's information management system. These documents are protected by Biz2Credit's  <a href="terms-of-use.html#websecuritysystem" target="_blank" style="color: #82AE01;">web security system</a> and only the user has password-protected access. No third party has access to these documents, and Biz2Credit will only access content stored in DocVault for site maintenance and technical support purposes. Biz2Credit reserves the right to remove any content that contains a virus or other malicious code, or that otherwise violates any term of this Privacy Policy or <a href="terms-of-use.html" target="_blank" style="color: #82AE01;">Terms of Use</a>.</li>

<li><em>Other business tools.</em> Biz2Credit offers other proprietary Business Tools to our subscribers and customers, including BizAnalyzer, and <a href="terms-of-use.html#FinancialCalculator" target="_blank" style="color: #82AE01;">Financial Calculator</a>. All information input by our subscribers and customers into these Business Tools are protected by Biz2Credit's <a href="terms-of-use.html#websecuritysystem" target="_blank" style="color: #82AE01;">web security system</a> and only the user has password-protected access to any Business Tool where they can input information. No third party has access to any such information input into our Business Tools, other than Biz2Credit for site maintenance and technical support purposes.

<li><em>Mobile applications.</em> Biz2Credit also offers its BizAnalylzer service via Android mobile telephones, which mobile service is protected by both the Biz2Credit security features described above and those of the Android service provider.

The identities of the lenders with whom you are matched, and with whom Biz2Credit has shared your information, will in each case be disclosed to you. Biz2Credit will not share information with any prospective lender not disclosed to you. These lenders or other financial institutions on the Biz2Credit network may retain or use your information whether or not you qualify for, or obtain, a loan from them, subject to the requirement that this information is used only for loan application and <a href="privacy-policy.html#&#10;process" style="color: #82AE01;">process</a></li>
<li> <em>Authorized service providers:</em> Once you submit a completed Biz2Credit Get a Loan Qualification Form, we may also share your information with authorized service providers that perform certain services on our behalf. These service providers include credit bureaus, title companies, insurance providers, attorneys, appraisal companies, escrow companies, closing agents and other financial institutions. Authorized service providers may also include marketing and customer services firms and credit card payment processors. These service providers may have access to information as needed to perform their functions, but are not in any case permitted to share, disclose, sell or use such information for any other purpose.</li> 
<li> <em>Biz2Credit Partners and Affiliates.</em> When you express interest in promotions or third party services, offered on our website, we may share your expression of interest with the partner or affiliate you have selected to offer you those products, services, and/or promotions. When you elect to engage in a particular offer or program, you authorize us to provide your email address and other business and contact information to that business, and in certain cases noted above, other sensitive personal information to our Partners and/or Affiliates sponsoring the products, <a href="privacy-policy.html#&#10;Affiliates" style="color: #82AE01;">services and/or promotions</a>.  As provided above, you always have the right to opt out or unsubscribe from any transfer of your personal information to third parties or otherwise in connection with partner or affiliate offerings or <a href="privacy-policy.html#&#10;General" style="color: #82AE01;">promotional uses</a>.</li> 
<a name="process"></a>
<li><em>Biz2Credit.com users.</em> Your User ID may be displayed throughout Biz2Credit and is therefore available to the public. All of your activity on our website is traceable to your User ID. Other people can see your feedback, businesses, products, classified ads or services that you have posted in the Community. However, no other registration or other information is displayed on the site unless you choose to post it yourself. We send notices to members regarding suspicious activity and policy violations on our sites and refer to User IDs and specific items.</li>
</ul>
 <p><em><strong>Aggregated, non-personal information.</strong></em> We may also share aggregated information (i.e., information about you and other customers collectively, but not specifically identifiable to you) and other non-personally identifiable information we collect from registration, applications or other use of our website or services in order to develop and/or deliver targeted advertising on our website and on website of third parties. We may also combine non-personally identifiable information we collect with additional non-personally identifiable information collected from other sources. In addition, we may share aggregated information with third parties, including advisors, advertisers and investors, for the purpose of conducting general business analysis and developing site metrics. For example, we may tell our advertisers the number of visitors to our website and the most popular features or services accessed or use such aggregated, non-personal information to develop website content and services that we hope you and other users will find of interest and to target content and advertising. </p>
 <p><em><strong>Third-party websites.</strong></em> There are a number of places on our website where you may click on a link to access other websites, each of which operates under its own Policy and not Biz2Credit's Policy. For example, if you click on an advertisement or a search result on our website, you may be taken to a website that we do not control. These third-party websites may independently solicit and collect information, including personal and business information, from you and, in some instances, provide us with information about your activities on those websites. While Biz2Credit will only directly transfer data to other websites that have adequate data protection and  <a href="privacy-policy.html#&#10;privacypolicies" style="color: #82AE01;">privacy policies</a>, Biz2Credit can not control such uses or use by companies whose links you click on. We therefore recommend that you consult the privacy statements of all third-party websites you visit by clicking on the "privacy" link typically located at the bottom of the webpage you are visiting.</p>
 <p> <em><strong>Other circumstances.</strong></em> We also may disclose your information:</p>
<ul><li>In response to a subpoena or similar investigative demand, a court order, or a request for cooperation from a law enforcement or other government agency;</li>
<li>to establish or exercise our legal rights; to defend against legal claims; or as otherwise required by law; </li>
<li>when we believe disclosure is appropriate in connection with efforts to investigate, prevent, or take other action regarding illegal activity, suspected fraud or other wrongdoing; </li>
<li>to protect and defend the rights, property or safety of our Biz2Credit, our users, our employees, or others;</li> 
<li> to comply with applicable law or cooperate with law enforcement; or to enforce our website terms and conditions or other agreements or policies.</li>
<li>In connection with a substantial corporate transaction, such as the sale of our business, a divestiture, merger, consolidation or asset sale. In this event, you will be afforded the opportunity to opt out of any further promotional or other communications.</li>
</ul>
<a name="privacypolicies"></a>
 <p><em><strong>Third-party use of your information.</strong></em>Biz2Credit seeks to ensure that all third parties to whom we transfer data maintain appropriate data protection protocols and privacy policies. Accordingly, Biz2Credit contractually requires its vendors and affiliates to maintain appropriate security and privacy policies, and we will not transfer personal information to any entity whose policy would permit the sale or other redistribution of personal information for any reason other than the purpose for which we provided the information to the third party. However, Biz2Credit does not control the actual use of transferred data by such third parties, which are governed by their internal policies and procedures. These entities or their servers may be located either inside or outside the United States, in which case they may be governed by different privacy laws or policies.</p>
 <p><em><strong> By disclosing your information to Biz2Credit through registration, the selection of services offered by Biz2Credit partners, affiliates and other third parties, the loan application process or otherwise on our website, you expressly consent to any transfer of your information as described above and in this Policy.</strong></em></p>
<a name="HOWWEPROTECTYOURINFORMATION"></a>
 <p> <strong>HOW WE PROTECT YOUR INFORMATION </strong> </p>
 <p><em><strong>In General.</strong></em> We are committed to protect the security and integrity of all information you share with us. We have therefore implemented a number of industry-standard security measures (including physical, electronic and procedural measures) to help safeguard your information from unauthorized access and disclosure. Only authorized employees and authorized third-party service providers are permitted to access personal information, and they may do so only for specified and limited business functions. In addition, we use encryption in the transmission of certain sensitive information between your system and ours, and we use firewalls to help prevent unauthorized persons from gaining access to your information. We want you to feel confident using our website for business transactions. However, no system can be completely secure. Therefore, we do not promise, and you should not expect, that your personal information, searches, or other communications will always remain secure in all cases. </p>
 <p><em><strong>DocVault.</strong></em> Biz2Credit's Doc Vault system allows only authorized users to upload documents. Biz2Credit does not allow any documents to be edited while in Doc Vault and maintains a log of every document uploaded, tagged and shared. DocVault's history feature also tracks every document which is shared by time and date and also time stamps when the link is clicked and <a href="terms-of-use.html#documentdownloaded" target="_blank">document downloaded</a>.</p>
 <p><em><strong>Other Business Tools.</strong></em> Biz2Credit's other proprietary Business Tools, such as BizAnalyzer, Financial Calculator and BizConnect, also allow only authorized users to <a href="terms-of-use.html#accessinformation" target="_blank">access information</a>. Information input into BizConnect will only be shared with prospective lenders with your express consent. </p>
 <p><em><strong>Account security.</strong></em> We have also implemented the following additional features to help strengthen the security of your user account:- </p>
 <ul><li> <em>Session Timeout.</em> A session timeout has been implemented so that the maximum specified period of user inactivity does not exceed 25 minutes.</li>
 
<li> <em>Temporary Account Lockout.</em> Access is locked for 30 minutes if three or more consecutive unsuccessful login attempts are made, regardless of session or time frame. User may not log back in, re-authenticate online, create a new account, order products, view products or use login help when the account is locked out. However, the user can contact the call center/help desk to activate account when the account is locked. </li>

 
<li><em> Long Term Account Lockout.</em> Access to accounts will be locked indefinitely (until manually unlocked by a Call Center/Help Desk Agent) if the user attempts to use login help unsuccessfully three or more times, regardless of session or time frame. User may not login, create a new account, re-authenticate online, order products, view products or use login help when the account is locked out. As above, the user can contact the Call Center/Help Desk to activate account when account is locked out.</li>

 </ul>
<p>For a more detailed description of these security measures, please refer to our Terms of Use, "<a href="terms-of-use.html#websecuritysystem" style="color: #82AE01;" target="_blank">Security Measures</a>".</p>

 <a name="information-sharing"></a>
 <p>You can at any time choose not to provide us with certain information by modifying the "Settings" in your user account. However, if you do so, this may result in your being ineligible or unable to use certain features of our website if such information is required in order for you to obtain services.</p>
 <ul><li>After you register, you will automatically receive our Biz2Credit e-Newsletter [and other communications from Biz2Credit from time to time] unless you choose to unsubscribe. If you authorize any of these communications from Biz2Credit, you will also be given the opportunity, in any commercial email that we send to you, to opt out of receiving such messages in the future. While we will attempt to implement changes to your user settings as quickly as possible, please note that it may take up to 10 business days for us to process an opt-out request.

<li> Biz2Credit may directly send you other types of transactional and relationship email communications, such as loan offers, e-Newsletters, requests for additional information, service updates or announcements, administrative notices, and surveys, without offering you the prior opportunity to opt out of receiving them. However, you may always thereafter opt out as provided directly above. In addition, we will not provide any of your information to Biz2Credit partners or affiliates unless you specifically request that particular service or promotion, and if you fail to opt out within the stated period of time. As stated directly above, you are always free to opt out at any time by modifying the "Settings" in your user account. </li>
<li>You may also instruct us not to call you for marketing, promotional or other commercial purposes through "Settings" in your user account. We will implement your instructions as promptly as possible, and in any case within 10 business days. Please note that we may still need to call you for servicing or other non-marketing purposes.</li>
<li> If you do not want us to send you postal mail for marketing purposes, you may remove your name from current and future mailing lists through "Settings" in your user account.</li>
<li>Federal and state regulations may require that we store completed loan questionnaire forms for various periods of time. In addition, other regulatory document and information storage guidelines may apply. In order to comply with these requirements, we may be unable to delete your information within a specified time period from the Biz2Credit database or servers.</li>
