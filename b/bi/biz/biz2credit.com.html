<p id="howwecollectanduseinformation"><strong>1.  HOW WE COLLECT AND USE INFORMATION</strong></p>
<p>Capitalized terms that are not defined in this Privacy Policy have the meaning given them in our <a href="/terms-of-use.html">Terms of Use</a>.</p> 
<p>We collect the following types of information about you:</p>
<p><strong>Information you provide us directly:</strong> We ask for certain information such as your phone number, email address, home or mailing address, your financial information (such as your income, assets, or debts), or other personal information when you register for a Biz2Credit account, or if you correspond with us.  We may also retain any messages you send to us.  We use this information to operate, maintain, and provide to you the features and functionality of the Service.  We may also use this information to send you a text message or an email to confirm you registration with us.</p>
<p><strong>Information we may ask you to provide us directly or we may receive about you from third parties:</strong> We may request or receive information such as credit reports, credit score, credit history, investigative reports, consumer reports, statements from creditors or financial institutions, Social Security Number or Tax Identification Number, tax returns and credit card statements when you complete a Funding Qualification Form or our online application for business fundings or other funding products ("Request for Funding").  Pursuant to our Terms of Use and <a href="https://www.biz2credit.com/bfs-tc.html">Business Finance Terms and Conditions</a> , you authorize Biz2Credit and/or Funders (as defined) to do (i) one or more hard pulls of your credit score in connection with any submission of a Request for Funding to any Funder and (ii) soft pulls of your credit score in connection with your Request for Funding and at any time thereafter.</p>
<p><b>Information we may receive from third party contacts:</b> If you access our websites or Service through a third-party connection or log-in, for example, through Facebook Connect, by "following," "liking," adding the Biz2Credit application, linking your account to the Biz2Credit Service, etc., that third party may pass certain information about your use of its service to Biz2Credit.  This information could include, but is not limited to, the user ID associated with your account (for example, your Facebook UID), an access token necessary to access that service, any information that you have permitted the third party to share with us, and any information you have made public in connection with that service.  You should always review, and if necessary, adjust your privacy settings on third-party websites and services before linking or connecting them to the Biz2Credit Service.  You may also unlink your third party account from the Service by adjusting your settings on the third party service.</p>  
<p><strong>Analytics information:</strong> We may directly collect analytics data, or use third-party analytics tools, to help us measure traffic and usage trends for the Service.  These tools collect information sent by your browser or mobile device, including the pages you visit and other information that assists us in improving the Service.  We collect and use this analytics information in aggregate form such that it cannot reasonably be manipulated to identify any particular individual User.</p>

The information is allows for more accurate reporting and improvement of the Service.</p>

We may send you emails containing newsletters, promotions and special offers.  If you do not want to receive such email messages, you will be given the option to opt out or change your preferences.
