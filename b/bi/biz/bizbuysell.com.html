					BizBuySell's Privacy Statement
				</h2>
				<p>
					This privacy statement covers the website 
					<a href="http://www.bizbuysell.com/" title="Franchises for sale on BizBuySell.com">http://www.bizbuysell.com/</a>. By accessing, using or 
					registering with BizBuySell's web site, you accept and agree to BizBuySell's Privacy Policy. BizBuySell provides a 
					variety of online services to assist individuals and brokers with buying and selling businesses and franchises. 
					BizBuySell values your privacy, feedback and candor very highly. Any user information we collect is considered private 
					and we do not use it or share it except as permitted herein, without the user's permission. We use this personal 
					information at BizBuySell to provide the best quality service possible. The following privacy statement summarizes 
					BizBuySell's protection and use of any personal information provided by visitors to the BizBuySell site.
				</p>
				<p>
					This policy does not apply to any public area of BizBuySell's web site or services. In the event you submit personally 
					identifiable information to contact another member, contact a lister about a listing, create a listing, add a contact 
					on a listing, the BizBuySell Community or BrokerWorks Broker Directory, such information becomes publicly available and 
					BizBuySell is not responsible for the personally identifiable information you choose to submit to these services, forums, 
					listings, or persons.
				</p>
				<h2>
					Information Collected by BizBuySell:
				</h2>
				<p>
					BizBuySell collects user information from several areas of the BizBuySell site including products; business services; 
					the adding and editing of business and franchise listings; the adding and editing of BrokerWorks Profiles; email forms; 
					the BizBuySell Community; and any surveys or contests that BizBuySell may sponsor. BizBuySell collects individual user 
					search activity for statistical, archival, and business purposes. BizBuySell collects financial information (such as 
					billing address, credit card number, expiration date) for billing payment and credit card authorization purposes. 
					BizBuySell may track the IP address of a user's computer or place a "cookie" in the browser files of a user's computer. 
					This is required by BizBuySell services to provide automated features.
				</p>
				<h2>
					Use of Information Collected:
				</h2>
				<p>
					Collected information helps BizBuySell better understand its users' needs in order to improve its product and service 
					offerings. Email addresses are used to communicate with members through the BizBuySell Buyer and Broker Bulletins 
					(monthly email news summaries), Promotional emails, Partner emails and for site administration purposes. Users may be 
					deleted from Bulletins, Promotional email and Partner email lists at their request. Personal information may be used to 
					contact users for the purpose of research, product development, marketing, or customer service, if the user has opted to 
					receive such communication. User search activity is collected and analyzed and may be utilized by BizBuySell in the 
					aggregate or in the abstract for a variety of business purposes. Financial information is used to bill users for products 
					and services purchased. Within BizBuySell, only accounting managers have access to the credit card account information. 
					This information is not shared with anyone outside of BizBuySell. IP address and cookie log data is analyzed to better 
					understand traffic flows and user preferences.
				</p>
				<h2>
					Use of Email Tools:
				</h2>
				<p>
					You may NOT use the Email the Broker, Email a Listing service or other email services that we offer to send spam 
					(i.e. unsolicited commercial email) or otherwise send content that would violate BizBuySell's Terms and Conditions. We 
					may monitor, track or save the use of this feature, but will be under no obligation to monitor, track or save these email 
					messages sent from these tools. If you send an email using the Email a Listing to a Friend service to an email address 
					that is not registered in our system, we do not use that email address for any purpose other than to send your email, 
					and for us to automatically send your friend a one-time email inviting him or her to visit the site. BizBuySell stores 
					this information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email and for tracking the success of our referral program. 
					We also do not rent or sell these email addresses of un-registered users.
				</p>
				<h2>
					Shared information:
				</h2>
				<p>
					Though BizBuySell makes every effort to preserve user privacy, we may need to disclose personal information when 
					required by law wherein we have good faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with a current judicial 
					proceeding, a court order or legal process served on our Web site.
				</p>
				<p>
					BizBuySell shares member information in the following areas on the site: Business and Franchise Listing Service, 
					Listings by Email, BizBuySell Community and the BrokerWorks Directory. When a member enters a business or franchise 
					listing in the Listing Service, listing contact information is also entered. In addition, members searching BizBuySell 
					can view contact information (name and phone number) when they view a listing profile. BizBuySell allows users to share 
					contact information with one another via its Listings by Email service. With Listings by Email users can save their 
					business search criteria to have information about businesses that match the specified criteria emailed to them. When 
					selecting this service, users are given the option of releasing their contact information to other users who have 
					business listings that match their criteria. This contact information is then shared with the users who have business 
					listings that match the buying or leasing criteria. Unless required by law as detailed in this section or a user 
					specifically takes action as discussed in this paragraph, BizBuySell does not share individual user search activity 
					information and such activity information remains private to the individual user and to BizBuySell. BrokerWorks members 
					agree to share their contact information and allow all BizBuySell users to view their contact information via the 
					BizBuySell BrokerWorks Business Broker Directory or via links made available to users on a listing or in an email. 
					BizBuySell users who do not opt out of the BrokerWorks Directory service during registration with BizBuySell (or anytime 
					thereafter) also agree to share their contact information via the BizBuySell BrokerWorks Directory.
				</p>
				<p>
					BizBuySell shares information with its partners for the purpose of providing related services in which we deem our users 
					have interest. The use that BizBuySell's partners make of customer information will not exceed BizBuySell's use of the 
					data. Key billing information (such as credit card number, expiration date and dollar amount) gathered from users making 
					online purchases of products or services is shared with PayPal, our credit card processing partner, in order to authorize 
					charges to the credit card. BizBuySell also uses third party providers to perform email and postal mailings on behalf of 
					BizBuySell, but this information (such as name, address and email) is confidential and is not used by the provider for 
					any other purpose.
				</p>
				<p>
					BizBuySell does not rent or lease user information to any third party, except as disclosed here. From time to time, 
					BizBuySell may obtain information (such as electronic mail addresses) from third party providers. It is our goal to only 
					contact individuals who we believe may have a legitimate business interest in BizBuySell based on their membership or 
					participation in other organizations or web sites, and who have indicated a willingness to be contacted for this purpose. 
					While BizBuySell endeavors to work with other sites and companies with a similar respect for user privacy, BizBuySell 
					cannot be responsible for the privacy practices of other sites.
				</p>
				<p>
					Please be aware that in the event BizBuySell merges with a third party, or in the event all or substantially all of 
					BizBuySell's assets are acquired by a third party, customer information, including personally identifiable information, 
					will be shared and/or transferred to such third party. The information may only be used or shared by such third parties 
					for the primary purpose for which the information was originally collected. If such third parties, or if BizBuySell for 
					its own business needs, desire to use the personally identifiable information for another purpose, you will be notified 
					prior to the information being used for a new purpose, and you will have the opportunity to opt out of such new use of 
					your personally identifiable information.
				</p>
				<h2>
					Security of personal information:
				</h2>
				<p>
					BizBuySell's clients and their personal information are considered to be BizBuySell's greatest asset and thus their 
					privacy is treated with the utmost regard and respect. BizBuySell takes every reasonable precaution to secure personal 
					information within both its computers and its physical premises.
				</p>
				<p>
					The security of your personal information is important to BizBuySell. When you enter sensitive information (such as a 
					credit card number) on our registration or order forms, we encrypt that information using secure socket layer 
					technology (SSL). [To learn more about SSL, follow this link 
					<a href="http://www.verisign.com" title="VeriSign" rel="nofollow">http://www.verisign.com</a>].
				</p>
				<p>
					We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during 
					transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, 
					is 100% secure, however. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal 
					information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.
				</p>
				<p>
					If you have any questions about security on our Web site, please 
					<a href="http://www.bizbuysell.com/cgi-bin/contactus?tc=t5" title="Contact Us" rel="nofollow">contact us</a>.

					Opting-out, editing, updating or deleting personal information:
				</h2>
				<p>
					BizBuySell utilizes email as a vital and primary communication channel with registered users and customers. As a 
					registered user/customer, you hereby acknowledge and grant BizBuySell the permission to communicate with you via 
					email (as well as other communication channels such as phone and fax) for any purposes BizBuySell determines to be 
					relevant including, but not limited to, system messages, product updates, service announcements and other marketing 
					messages. BizBuySell will use best efforts to honor customers request to opt out of marketing messages, but under no 
					circumstances will BizBuySell have any liability for sending any email to its registered users/customers.
				</p>
				<p>
					Users who do not wish to receive marketing emails including the BizBuySell Bulletins, BizBuySell Promotional Emails, 
					or Sponsor Emails are requested to contact 
					<a href="http://www.bizbuysell.com/cgi-bin/contactus?tc=t5" title="BizBuySell Client Services" rel="nofollow">BizBuySell Client Services</a>, or select the opt-out option that is available

					by Email section and clicking on the "Cancel Notification" link.  We also send our users site and service announcement 
					updates. Members are not able to un-subscribe from service announcements, which contain important information about 
					service notices and responsibilities. BizBuySell occasionally communicates with its users via email and phone to provide 
					information about requested services and regarding issues related to their account. It is important to note that this 
					communication is not used for marketing or promotional purposes. Requesting the deletion of certain types of user 
					information may prevent users from accessing some web site features.
				</p>
				<p>
					You may correct or update your personally identifiable information by going to the area of the site where you submitted 
					the information, and following the instructions to view, change or delete the information.
				</p>
				<p>
					Credit card information submitted to BizBuySell is typically used for a one-time charge to your account, and subsequent 
					orders for renewals require users to resubmit the credit information. (An exception: BrokerWorks Membership accounts and 
					Franchise Directory advertising are automatically renewed each month, using the original credit information submitted.) 
					Therefore, for added security, any credit card information submitted to BizBuySell is not accessible for review or 
					modification by signing on to your ad. If you have questions regarding the credit card information used in ordering 
					your products or services, please 
					<a href="http://www.bizbuysell.com/cgi-bin/contactus?tc=t5" title="Contact Us" rel="nofollow">contact us</a> or at 415-284-4380.
