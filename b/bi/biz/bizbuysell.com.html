<a name="privacy"></a>

<h2>Our Commitment to Privacy</h2>

<p>BizBuySell respects each individual's right to personal privacy, and we are committed to protecting your privacy. Therefore, we provide this Privacy Policy notice to explain our online information practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used. To make this Privacy Policy notice easy to find, we make it available on our homepage and at every point where personally identifiable information may be requested. This Privacy Policy applies solely to the information collected or submitted on the BizBuySell.com website.</p>


<a name="collect"></a>

<h2>The Information We Collect and How We Use It</h2>

<p>Because of our commitment to privacy and our understanding of the necessity for confidentiality in buying and selling businesses, BizBuySell strives to collect as little personally identifiable information as possible from its users. However, for some of our services, such as placing ads, making replies, and purchasing materials, we may need to collect some personally identifiable information from you in order to deliver these services to you and enable others to reply to your postings. The types of personal information collected at these pages are described in the sections below.</p>

<p>We do not collect any personally identifiable information from you while you use services such as our business-for-sale search and the reading of postings to the Buyer's Bulletin Board. Any information entered in these search forms is not retained by BizBuySell.</p>

<p>The information we collect will not be used to create customer profiles based on browsing or purchasing history.  We do not supplement information collected at our website with data from other sources, such as credit history to authorize purchases or marketing data from third parties.</p>

<p><b>Note:</b> A primary purpose of BizBuySell is to provide publicly searchable databases of classified ads and other postings. Therefore, much of information submitted by you to these services is done so with the intent that we make the information public knowledge. Therefore, we define "personally identifiable information" as your email address and credit card information. We strive to keep this information confidential, as described in this Privacy Policy. However, users are welcome to disclose their email address in the text of their postings if they desire. The posting forms also note other items that may typically be considered personally identifiable information, which we allow users the option to disclose (such as name and phone number) or provide other means to make the publicly disclosed information more confidential (such as by selecting a region of the country instead of a state).</p>

<p><b>Business-For-Sale Ad Order Form</b><br>
We request information from you when you fill out our ad posting form.  You must provide a valid email address (providing your name and phone number is optional) so that you can receive inquiries to your ad, as well as email correspondence from BizBuySell regarding the status of your ad. You must also provide your credit card number and expiration date to enable us to charge the card for the ad fee.</p>

<p>We also collect information regarding the details of your business for sale. All of the information posted in page 2 of the ad form under the heading of “Enter the details about your business...”  will be publicly disclosed with the exception of your email address and password. The information posted in page 3 of the ad form will be kept private.</p>

<p>The public information regarding your business-for-sale is made available through our searchable databases on BizBuySell and on the sites of our co-branded partners, as well as through our broker's database and our Listings-By-Email notification service. The financial data you provide about your business-for-sale (such as the asking price, gross income and cash flow) may be included in our aggregate statistics for our Business Pricing Report product.</p>

<p>Your email address and credit card information remain confidential and will not be distributed to any outside parties, except as necessary to process the charge for the listing and verify the sale.</p>


<p><b>Buyer's Workbook and Business Pricing Report</b><br>
We require your name, a valid email address and credit card number and expiration date so that we may process your order. For added security, we also request that you submit a password to be used in conjunction with your email address to sign on to your workbook or pricing report. If you ever wish to change your email address or password, please <a href="/cgi-bin/contactus?tc=t5">contact us</a>.</p>

<p>Your email address and credit card information remain confidential and will not be distributed to any outside parties, except as necessary to process the charge for the order and verify the sale.</p>

<p><b> Buyer's Bulletin Board</b><br>
To post an ad to the Buyer's Bulletin Board, we require a valid email address so that you can receive inquiries to your posting (through our blind email system in which your email address is not revealed). Your email address is also used as your sign-on ID to enable you to later sign on to your posting to edit or delete it.</p>

<p>In posting to the Buyer's Bulletin Board, all of the information regarding the type of business that you are seeking will be made available to the general public and to our member brokers. You may delete your posting at any time by returning to the Board area and selecting the "Delete Your Posting" option, and after confirming your desire to delete the posting it will immediately be removed from our database and no longer made available to the public.</p>


<p><b> Listings-By-Email</b><br>
If you wish to subscribe to our Listings-By-Email service, we ask for the email address to which you want the new listings delivered and for brief information regarding the types of listings you are interested in receiving. Your email address always remains private and is not sold or supplied to any third parties.</p>

<p>BizBuySell does permit its broker members to review our database of the types of listings that are currently sought, and if your Listings-By-Email request matches their criteria, the broker member is able to contact you through our blind email system (in which your identity or email address is not revealed). You may, however, opt to not have your listings preferences disclosed to BizBuySell broker members by checking the box on the Listings-By-Email form.</p>

<p>To unsubscribe from our Listings-By-Email, simply return to the Listings-By-Email section of BizBuySell and click on the "Cancel Notification" link. (We also provide a link to this page at the bottom of every email we send to you.) After entering your email address and clicking the Cancel button, you will be unsubscribed from our Listings-By-Email notifications. (Note that BizBuySell may also delete your subscription if your email address no longer functions.) When you unsubscribe, your email address and listing-type preferences are immediately removed from our database.</p>


<p><b>Replying to an Ad</b><br>
When you reply to any of the postings on BizBuySell through our custom reply forms, your reply is sent through our servers to the intended party. We do not sell or distribute to any outside party, any of the information submitted in the reply form.</p>

<p><b>Email Correspondence</b><br>
If you send an email to BizBuySell, we use your return email address to answer your inquiry or comment. Such addresses are not used for any other purpose and are not shared with outside parties.</p>

<p>On rare occasions, if ever, BizBuySell may send registered users an email announcement regarding a change in our service that affects their use of it.</p> 

<p><b>Cookies</b><br>
Cookies are small text files that a website can place on a user's computer hard drive to be a unique identifier for that user.</p>
<p>We use third-party  advertising companies&nbsp;<span lang="EN-GB">to serve  ads when you visit our Web site.&nbsp; The third-party advertising technology that we  use on this Web site uses information derived from your visits to this site to  target advertising within this site.&nbsp; In addition, our advertisers may use other  third-party advertising technology to target advertising on this site and other  sites.&nbsp; In the course of advertisements being served to you, a unique  third-party cookie or cookies may be placed&nbsp;in your browser.&nbsp; In addition, we  may use Web beacons, provided by third-party advertising companies, to help  manage and optimize our online advertising.&nbsp; Web beacons enable us to recognize  a browser’s cookie when a browser visits this site, and to learn which banner  ads bring users to our Web site.&nbsp; </span>To “opt-out,” please <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/consumer/opt_out.asp" title="http://www.doubleclick.com/us/corporate/privacy" target="_blank">click here</a>.</p>
<p> BizBuySell contains links to third-party websites, such as the websites of businesses being sold, the corporate sites of member business brokers, and other third-party business services. Clicking the links to view information from third parties directs you to pages on their websites, which may or may not be co-branded with the BizBuySell logo. Additionally, the BizBuySell database and related services such as posting a business-for-sale ad and registering for listings-by-email, also appear on third-party sites (such as <a href="http://www.bizbuysell.com/startup/" target="_blank"><i>The Wall Street Journal Online</i></a> under the identification of "powered by BizBuySell." These third-party sites may employ cookies. BizBuySell has no access to or control over these cookies. Please refer to the third party's privacy policy for details on their use of cookies.</p>


<p><b>Visitor Traffic Logs</b><br>
BizBuySell automatically collects IP addresses and traffic information from visitors to our site. None of this is linked to personally identifiable information. This information is aggregated into statistics to help us evaluate how visitors prefer to use and navigate our website, including the number and frequency of visits to our web pages and the length of visits.</p>

<p><b>Information Sharing</b><br>
We may use aggregate traffic information to tell a partner or advertiser that X number of individuals visited their ad or a certain area on our website, but we do not disclose anything that could be used to identify any individual visitor.</p>

<p>Sales data regarding ads placed through our co-branded partner sites may be provided to the co-branded partner. The BizBuySell ad numbers and email addresses of the ads placed through the co-branded partners may be provided to the co-brand, but no other personally identifiable information regarding those sales is provided.</p>

<p>Credit card transactions are handled by a third-party financial institution, which receives the credit card number and other personally identifying information only to verify the credit card numbers and process transactions.</p>

<p>We may disclose and use personally identifiable information in special circumstances when we believe, in good faith, that such release is reasonably necessary to (i) comply with law or court order, (ii) enforce or apply the terms of any of our user agreements, or (iii) protect the rights, property, or safety of BizBuySell, our users, or others.</p> 


<a name="security"></a>

<h2>Our Commitment to Data Security</h2>

<p>To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the correct use of information, we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online.</p>

<p>When our ad posting form asks users to enter sensitive information (such as a credit card number), that information is encrypted and is protected with the most accepted web encryption protocol in the industry - SSL.  Your credit card and other information cannot be read as it travels to our ordering system. </p>

<p>While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also do everything in our power to protect user-information in-house.  Access to our users' information is restricted to only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, our billing clerk or a customer service representative).  Furthermore, all employees are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy practices.</p>


<a name="links"></a>

<h2>Links to Other Websites</h2>

<p>BizBuySell contains links to third-party websites, such as the websites of specific businesses for sale, the corporate sites of member business brokers, and other third-party business services. In order to use these third-party services you will be directed to pages on their websites, which may or may not be co-branded with the BizBuySell logo. Remember that any information that you provide on any third-party page is being provided directly to the third-party service provider and is not subject to this Privacy Policy. We recommend that you review the privacy policy at each third-party website to determine how that site protects your privacy. The BizBuySell Privacy Policy applies solely to information collected on BizBuySell.com.</p>

 
<a name="children"></a>
 
<h2>Our Commitment to Children's Privacy</h2>

<p>BizBuySell believes that protecting the privacy of the very young is especially important. No part of our website is structured to attract anyone under 13, and BizBuySell never collects or maintains information at our website from those we know are under 13. </p>


<a name="access"></a>

<h2>How to Access or Correct Your Information</h2>

<p>You can access any information in your posting by going to the area of the site where you submitted the information, and follow the instructions to view, change or delete the information. To protect your privacy and security, we will also take reasonable steps through means such as passwords to verify your identity before granting access or making corrections.</p>

<p>If you select the option to delete your posting, it is immediately deleted upon clicking the button to confirm that you do indeed wish to delete it. If you select the option to edit your posting, the changes you request are first reviewed by our processing center, and may take up to two business days to appear in their updated state online. Deleted or modified information may continue to be stored by BizBuySell for archival record-keeping purposes only.</p>

<p>Credit card information submitted to BizBuySell is typically used for a one-time charge to your account, and subsequent orders for renewals require users to resubmit the credit information. (An exception: BrokerWorks Membership Accounts and Franchise Directory advertising  are automatically renewed each month, using the original credit information submitted.) Therefore, for added security, any credit card information submitted to BizBuySell is not accessible for review or modification by signing on to your ad or workbook. If you have questions regarding the credit card information used in ordering your ad, workbook, or pricing report, please <a href="/cgi-bin/contactus?tc=t5">contact us</a>.</p>


<a name="updates"></a>

<h2>Site and Service Updates</h2>

<p>We send business-for-sale advertisers a welcoming email to verify the email address used in the ad, and to notify the user that their ad is now available online and their credit card has been charged. On very rare occasions, we may also send site and service announcement updates. Members are not able to unsubscribe from service announcements, which contain important information about the service. We communicate with the user to provide requested services and in regards to issues relating to their account via email or phone. </p>


<a name="notification"></a>

<h2>Notification of Changes to the Privacy Policy</h2>

<p>By using our website, you consent to the collection and use of this information by BizBuySell. If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post the new Privacy Policy on this page so that our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it.  If at any point we decide to use personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time it was collected, we will notify users by way of an email. Users will have a choice as to whether we use their information in this different manner. </p>


<a name="contact"></a>


<h2>How to Contact Us</h2>

<p>Should you have other questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy, please <a href="/cgi-bin/contactus?tc=t5">contact us</a>.</p>
