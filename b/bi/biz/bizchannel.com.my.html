	<br>THIS SECURITY ARRANGEMENT DETAILS THE PROCEDURES EMPLOYED BY BUMIPUTRA-COMMERCE BANK BERHAD IN 
	SAFEGUARDING THE SECURITY AND INTEGRITY OF THE INFORMATION, ANY TRANSACTIONS MADE VIA OUR SYSTEM AND 
	OUR SYSTEM ITSELF.

	<font color="#801F29">
	<b>1.	INTRODUCTION</b></font>		
    <p>
    We shall at all times and to the best of our ability, endeavour to ensure that all 
    materials, data, communications and/or information ("Information") exchanged, disclosed, 
    shared, stored or otherwise used, or any transactions which are made via our System ("Transactions") 
    are kept private and confidential. Further thereto, we shall comply with and adhere to the requirements 
    of Bank Negara Malaysia pertaining to the privacy and confidentiality of the Information and Transactions 
    as well as the need to maintain the security and integrity of our System. In pursuance of these 
    objectives, we have set in place a multitude of security procedures and requirements which are 
    designed to ensure the optimum security of the Information, Transactions and our System at all 
    times, all of which are elaborated upon below.
    </p><p>
    </p><hr color="801F29">
	<font color="#801F29">
	<b>2.	DATA PRIVACY, CONFIDENTIALITY &amp; INTEGRITY</b></font>		
    <p>
    In order to ensure the privacy, confidentiality and integrity of the Information which are exchanged, 
    disclosed, shared, stored or otherwise used on our System and the Transactions, whether or not the same 
    belongs or originates from you or otherwise, we have engaged the use of a combination of authentication, 
    encryption and auditing mechanisms which serve as a powerful barrier against all forms of system 
    penetration and abuse.
    </p><p>
    These mechanisms which are engaged above include but are not limited to the following:-
    </p><ol>
    <li>Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) Channel;</li>
    <li>128-bit Encryption;</li>
    <li>Username &amp; Password protection and authentication;</li>
    <li>Firewalls; and</li>
    <li>Account-locking,</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
    all of which have been thoroughly tested in a series of independent security audits and have been 
    determined, whether used separately or together, to effectively protect and safeguard against known 
    security issues and prevent any form of tampering or theft of Information or Transactions, where 
    applicable.
    </p><p>
	</p><hr color="801F29">
	<font color="#801F29">
	<b>3.	AUTHENTICATION</b></font>		
    <p>
    For the purpose of verification of the identity of our Customers, we employ in our 
    authentication process, the use of individual and distinct Usernames and Passwords 
    ("Access Codes"). These Access Codes will act as a key to access, inter alia, your relevant 
    account(s), financial information and the banking facilities, products and services offered 
    via our System. 
    </p><p>
    To ensure the integrity of these Access Codes, you are advised to maintain its confidentiality 
    by not sharing it or making it accessible to any other person and to take all reasonable endeavours 
    to maintain its security which may include, memorising the Access Codes, changing your Password 
    regularly and signing off before visiting any other Internet sites.
    </p><p>
    Other than the use of individual and distinct Access Codes, we also employ for our business 
    Customers, the use of digital certificates for the purposes of ascertaining and authenticating 
    their identity.

    </p><p>
	</p><hr color="801F29">
	<font color="#801F29">
	<b>4.	NON-REPUDIATION</b></font>		
    <p>
   Further to the rest of this Security Arrangement and for the purposes of clarification, any and all 
   Transactions which are initiated by or originate from the Customer's Access Codes shall be deemed to 
   have been initiated or originated from the said Customer and accordingly, we shall be entitled to 
   carry out the said Transactions as if we had been duly instructed to do so by the respective Customer.
   </p><p>
   We also maintain and constantly update the logs of the Transactions which record, among others, the 
   Transactions entered into by our Customers (including you) and the nature, time and date of the same, 
   all of which serves to enable us to verify the various Transactions made and act as evidence thereof 
   should there ever arise a dispute as to the same.
    </p><p>
	</p><hr color="801F29">
	<font color="#801F29">
	<b>5.	ACCESS CONTROL &amp; SYSTEM DESIGN</b></font>		
    <p>
    Our System is designed and developed with the primary and utmost intention of safeguarding the 
    security and integrity of all Information and Transactions at all times. Pursuant thereto, the 
    System deploys a wide range of security features all of which are constantly reviewed and audited 
    to determine their effectiveness and further updated and maintained to ensure that these security 
    features perform at optimum standards at all times.
    </p><p>
    We also adopt a variety of monitoring and review measures upon the security and integrity of our System, 
    which include but are not limited to:-
    </p><ol>
    <li>Enhanced data-encryption methods;</li>
    <li>Anti-virus detection, prevention and protection procedures;</li>
    <li>Firewall barriers; and</li>
    <li>24/7 surveillance and detection,</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
    all of which are designed and implemented to intercept and prevent any form of attack on, 
    penetration or otherwise unauthorised access into our System and to ensure that the critical 
    sectors of our System including the storage of the Information, the Information itself and the 
    processing and authentication of the Transactions are, at all times, kept free from the such 
    attack, penetration or unauthorised access ("System Security Monitors").
    </p><p>
    We shall also endeavour to conduct regular and thorough reviews or audits of our System Security 
    Monitors, both by our internal security auditors as well as by external security experts. These 
    reviews and audits may include but are not limited to actual penetration testing and intrusion 
    detection on our said System Security Monitors which will enable us to determine whether there 
    are any defects, faults, malfunctions or shortcomings (the "said defects") in the same. In the 
    event the said defects or otherwise a breach of our System is discovered, we shall in the case 
    of a security breach, promptly report the same to appropriate management and Bank Negara Malaysia 
    and immediately proceed to rectify or remedy the same. For this purpose, we may be required to 
    temporarily or indefinitely suspend all use of our System until such time when the said defects 
    are rectified or remedied without any notice and without any liability whatsoever to you.
    </p><p>
    While we have the capabilities to ensure that the privacy, confidentiality and integrity of the 
    Information exchanged, disclosed, shared, stored or otherwise used and the Transactions as well 
    as the security and integrity of our System itself are at all times, safeguarded, maintained and 
    secure, we shall from time to time collaborate efforts with other major hardware, equipment or 
    software vendors and manufacturers in an effort to keep abreast with the developments and 
    improvements made to the same. Accordingly, where we believe that such developments and 
    improvements would serve to provide enhanced security to the Information, Transactions and 
    our System above, we shall not hesitate to implement the same for our joint-benefit.
