</p>
<ol class="sublist">
<li class="sublist-item">
<span class="counter"></span>
<p class="subtext">
<b>Account.</b> In order to use certain Services, you may be required to create an account (“<b>Account</b>”). We may offer different options to create an Account, including:
</p><ol class="sub-sublist">

</li>
<li class="sublistitem">
<b>Third Party Accounts:</b> You may choose to create an Account by clicking on a ‘connect’ or ‘sign-in’button that we may display on the Services for a designated third party website or service (each a “<b>Third Party Account</b>”), including but not limited to, LinkedIn, Facebook or Twitter. Doing so will enable you to link your Service Account and your Third Party Account. If you choose this option, then you will be required to approve the connection as well as the types of information (which may include Personal Information) that we will obtain from your Third Party Account and the types of activities that we may perform in connection with your Third Party Account. Please note that in order to use this option, you will need to have, and may need to be signed-in to, an existing Third Party Account.
</li>
<li class="sublistitem">
<b>Event Registration:</b>
You may be creating an Account in connection with your attendance at an event. Information you provide in the course of creating an Account or registering for an event or for use of the Services, including but not limited to, name, email address, phone number, physical address, and employer, may be provided to and maintained by the organizer of the event (“<b>Event Organizer</b>”), whether or not you complete the registration process, and may be used by the Event Organizer in connection with the event or future events or other products and services. If you wish to opt-out from receiving email solicitations from the Event Organizer for future events or other products and services, you may do so through the Event Organizer’s website or the unsubscribe link provided with the Event Organizer’s email solicitations.
</li>
</ol>
<p>
Regardless of which method you choose to register your Account, we may send an email to your nominated email address to instruct you how to confirm your registration.

The notices and tools that we provide on the Services should help inform you which information will be made publicly available. If you publish your contact information in any User Submissions or as part of your Public Profile, you may receive unsolicited messages from other users of the Services or the public.
