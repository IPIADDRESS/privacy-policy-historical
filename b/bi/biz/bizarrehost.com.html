<br>

 In order to provide you with our services we collect, use, and share certain information about you. This policy explains what we collect, with whom we share it, and how you can interact with us in order to ensure the accuracy of the data we collect, use, and share.
<br><br>
<b>A.</b> The information we collect from you helps us better serve the online community by continually personalizing the electronic services we provide. We collect and maintains the following data:
<br><br>
1. Information that you provide to us
We receive and store all information that you enter on our website: the url you are purchasing goods or services from, your e-mail address, your language preference, your first name, your last name, your address, your city, your state, your zip and your country. You are obligated to provide us with accurate and up-to-date information, and failure to provide us with such information could void any Agreement between you and us. We use the information that you provide for such purposes as processing your purchase request, responding to customer service inquiries, loss prevention, improving our service, communicating with you, and allowing our clients to provide customer service and fulfill their obligations to you.
<br><br>
2. Information that we automatically receive
We receive and store certain information whenever you download web pages, or send us e-mail or forms. For example, we employ "cookie" technology. We do this so that we can recognize you when you re-visit our URLs. Additionally, we identify the numerical IP address assigned to your computer by your Internet Service Provider.
<br><br>
3. E-mail Correspondence
We sometimes request a confirmation when you receive and open an e-mail communication delivered by us. We archive all e-mail sent in and out of our network, and we identify the origination IP address of all mail sent into our network. We require that you refrain from "forging headers" or sending "SPAM".
<br><br>
4. Information from third parties
From time to time, we request and receives information from third parties and compare it to the information that you have provided. The main purpose for this is that of loss prevention.
<br><br>
5. If you consent (Opt-In)
Other than detailed above, we will contact you and request your permission prior to sharing your data with third parties. Generally, we will offer a promotional product or service on behalf of a third party, rather than allow the third party to contact you directly. In any event, other than detailed above, we will contact you at the location provided by you at enrollment when we desire to share your information with a third party, or, we will present you with a "check-box" requesting that you opt-in to any third party mailing lists. Should you desire to "opt-out" of any such mailing lists, simply do so by sending an e-mail to: <script language="JavaScript" type="text/javascript">print_mail_to_link()</script><a href="mailto:cs@farmtube.com">cs@farmtube.com</a>
<br><br>
<b>B.</b> Our processor utilizes Secure Socket Layer (SSL) software when receiving and transmitting electronic payments. They encrypt the information you provide. They reveal on the last five digits of your credit card numbers when processing your transaction internally, and they reveal the entire number when communicating on a private dedicated line of communication with their acquiring bank.
<br><br>
<b>C.</b> We allow you to access to certain information about you for the limited purpose of viewing, updating, and in some instances deleting from our system any information deemed inaccurate. Any requests to access your information may be directed to: <script language="JavaScript" type="text/javascript">print_mail_to_link()</script><a href="mailto:cs@farmtube.com">cs@farmtube.com</a>
<br><br>
<b>Spam Policy</b>
<br><br>
Spam is flooding the Internet with many copies of the same message, in an attempt to force the message on people who would not otherwise choose to receive it. E-mail spam targets individual users with direct mail messages and costs the sender very little to send. Most of the costs are paid for by the recipient or the carriers rather than by the sender. We do not condone the use of spam and the sending of unsolicited e-mail in any form, nor do we control other Web sites involvement and/or practices in this area.
