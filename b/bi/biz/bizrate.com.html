<span class="text"> 
<p> This confirms that BizRate.com is a licensee of the TRUSTe Privacy Program. 
  This privacy statement discloses the privacy practices for www.BizRate.com. 
</p><p> BizRate.com is an online shopping marketplace designed to deliver the best 
  possible online shopping experience to you, our users. You are the reason we 
  exist as a business. We depend upon our relationship with you and remain committed 
  to protecting your privacy and security. 
</p><p> Everyday, thousands of online shoppers just like you enjoy our services and 
  entrust BizRate.com with their shopping information. This information allows 
  us to provide services to make online shopping as rewarding and efficient as 
  possible. <u><i>You</i></u> are the power behind BizRate.com. The more you share 
  about how you shop, the better shopping can be for you and for everyone. 
</p><p>&nbsp; 
</p><p> <b>Two Kinds of Information </b> 
</p><p> The information you provide allows us to deliver valuable services and promotions 
  to meet the needs of online buyers and sellers. To protect your privacy, we 
  keep the information we collect in two distinct categories: 
</p><p> <b>1. Personally Identifiable Information</b> is information associated with 
  you as an individual. It is kept in a record that matches it with a customer 
  number so we can access it to make the site more relevant and useful when you 
  visit. 
</p><p> <b>2. Aggregate Information</b> comes from many sources and is combined to 
  show a big picture, such as trends or statistics, and does not reveal the identity 
  of the individuals who shared it. This information is used primarily for research 
  purposes. 
</p><p>&nbsp; 
</p><p> <b><i>How We Use the Information You Provide </i></b> 
</p><p> <b>Personally Identifiable Information</b> 
</p><p> You control the personally identifiable information you share with us. We 
  use it to provide you with a better shopping experience and to enhance our ability 
  and the ability of our participating online stores to serve you. Online stores 
  and others who are part of the BizRate.com shopping community may work with 
  us to deliver personalized discounts and promotions to you, but they do NOT 
  have access to your personally identifiable information. 
</p><p> <b>Your personally identifiable information is NOT sold to third parties for 
  marketing purposes.</b> For example, we do NOT sell your phone number to telemarketers 
  or a list containing your mailing address to "junk mail" marketing companies. 
</p><p> <b>Aggregate Information </b> 
</p><p> Aggregate Information allows people and their businesses to be smarter about 
  online shopping. When a business knows more about its customers, they both win. 
  Without giving out personally identifiable information, we make aggregate information 
  available to online stores or other third parties that deliver valuable products 
  or services to our users. 
</p><p> BizRate.com provides timely, insightful and detailed analysis of online buying 
  and customer satisfaction through a variety of reports. By sitting at the point-of-sale 
  across thousands of quality online retailers, BizRate.com is uniquely positioned 
  to monitor e-Commerce activity across the Web, soliciting information from millions 
  of online buyers like you as they make their purchases. 
</p><p>&nbsp; 
</p><p> <b><i>How We Gather Information </i></b> 
</p><p> <b>BizRate.com Surveys.</b> When you complete a survey after purchasing from 
  a BizRate.com Customer Certified online store, the only information we require 
  is your email address. Your valid email address allows us to certify that you 
  are an actual customer and to send you a follow-up survey about your satisfaction 
  following delivery. 
</p><p> We ask for your demographic information (like gender, age range, occupation, 
  education level, income, marital status, and zip code) but this is always voluntary. 
  This information is used in aggregate, or to enhance the level of service BizRate.com 
  can provide you. 
</p><p> We mainly use your survey data to rate an online store's performance. Your 
  feedback allows online shoppers to benefit from your experience. We compile 
  the survey responses of online consumers into marketing research reports that 
  provide insights about the current trends in the world of e-commerce. At no 
  time in the survey process does any outside party have access to your personally 
  identifiable information. The only exception is that, at your request only, 
  we will forward your email address and comments to the online retailer for whom 
  you completed a survey, so that they may respond directly to any comments you 
  might have provided. 
</p><p> We may also gather statistics about the use of various aspects of the service 
  for administrative purposes or to determine what services to offer or enhance. 
</p><p> <b>BizRate.com membership information.</b> If you join our BizRater Membership 
  Program and become a member of the BizRate.com shopping community, you need 
  to enter some personally identifiable information, such as your user ID, password, 
  first and last name, zip code, and an email address through which we can contact 
  you when necessary. All information you provide at registration, except for 
  your username, may be edited whenever you like through your MyBizRate page. 
</p><p> <b>Information used for form filling, rebate offers, and other services.</b> 
  We store and use personally identifiable information such as user ID, passwords, 
  addresses, billing, and credit card information to enable form-filling convenience 
  for our members, and to customize and personalize our services. We may also 
  use your mailing address to send you rebate checks. 
</p><p> <b>Enhanced features may require more information.</b> Some enhanced BizRate.com 
  features, such as the BizRate.com Shopping Toolbar, form-filling, order tracking, 
  and rebate offers, require that we collect additional personally identifiable 
  information from you, such as your billing, shipping, and transaction information. 
</p><p> <b>BizRate.com customer service contacts</b>. If you contact BizRate.com by 
  email, telephone, or mail, we may keep a record of that contact or correspondence. 
</p><p> <b>BizRate.com contests or promotions.</b> We may also ask you for personally 
  identifiable information at other times, including but not limited to when you 
  enter a sweepstakes, contest, or promotion sponsored by BizRate.com. 
</p><p> <b>The BizRate Shopping Toolbar.</b> We use the completed transactions that 
  are securely logged in your private account to allow you to keep track of online 
  purchases, and to further enhance and personalize your shopping experience. 
  We may also collect information regarding your transactions and purchasing patterns 
  when the BizRate Shopping Toolbar is inactive, in order to customize and personalize 
  your shopping experience in the future. 
</p><p> <b>Transactions and purchasing pattern information.</b> We collect information 
  regarding your online transactions and purchasing patterns through the use of 
  "cookies". If you use the BizRate.com Shopping Toolbar, we collect and securely 
  log information regarding your completed transactions into your private account. 
  If you are a member and make purchases or other transactions through a mybizrate.com 
  email account that we maintain for you, you may thereafter receive order confirmations 
  and other emails from the online stores through that mybizrate.com email account. 
  We may also collect relevant information from those emails before forwarding 
  them on to your registered email account. We use the information we collect 
  on your transaction and purchasing pattern information to deliver customized 
  promotions and offers to you, and to better understand your needs and preferences. 
</p><p>&nbsp; 
</p><p> <b>Use of Cookies </b> 
</p><p> In order to provide personalized services, we use "cookie" capabilities enabled 
  by your Internet browser. "Cookies" are small files that your web browser places 
  on your computer's hard drive or in your browser memory for security purposes 
  and to remember your site preferences and personalization. For instance, "cookies" 
  may be used to remember your password for you when you re-visit our web site. 
  While most web browsers automatically accept cookies, you can usually change 
  your browser to prevent that. Even without accepting cookies, you can still 
  use the features on our web site, although certain enhanced features may not 
  be available. 
</p><p>&nbsp; 
</p><p> <b>Security </b> 
</p><p> This site has security measures in place to prevent the loss, misuse or alteration 
  of the information under our control. We have invested in industry-leading security 
  technology to make your shopping experience as secure as possible and to protect 
  your privacy. We currently employ the following techniques: 
</p><blockquote> 
  <p> <b>· Encryption.</b> Leading encryption technologies, comparable to those 
    used in Internet-based home banking services provided by financial institutions, 
    are used for both the data transmission during form filling and for data storage 
    in our secure database. 
  </p><p> <b>· Secure data storage.</b> Our secure database protects your personally 
    identifiable information. We provide a secure server hosting location, firewall 
    protection, controlled access, and encryption technology. 
  </p><p> <b>· Non-cached data transmission.</b> Form filling data are directly obtained 
    from our secure server -- they are not filed in any cache. This is done to 
    assure that this personally identifiable information will not be easily exposed 
    to hackers or other unauthorized users. 
</p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp; 
</p><p> <b>Required and Additional Disclosures</b> 
</p><p> It is our general policy not to release any personally identifiable information 
  without your permission. We may in certain circumstances disclose information 
  to online stores or other third parties when we believe in good faith that such 
  action is necessary to: (1) conform with legal requirements or comply with legal 
  processes, such as a court-ordered subpoena; (2) protect and defend our legal 
  rights and property, and the legal rights and property of our users, online 
  stores and other parties, such as fraud investigations; and (3) as otherwise 
  permitted by law. Our disclosures in such circumstances will be limited to just 
  the particular information we believe in our good faith judgment is necessary 
  or appropriate to satisfy the particular legal requirement or other appropriate 
  disclosure situation. 
</p><p>&nbsp; 
</p><p> <b>Shopping at Participating Online Stores</b> 
</p><p> BizRate.com encourages participating online stores to participate in industry 
  privacy initiatives and to take a responsible attitude towards consumer privacy. 
  However, since we do not have any direct control over the privacy policies or 
  practices of the participating online stores, we cannot be responsible for their 
  actions. We recommend that you always review each online store's privacy policies 
  before you complete any transaction with them. 
</p><p>&nbsp; 
</p><p> <span class="text"><b>Co-Branded Services</b> </span>
 
</p><p><span class="text"> In certain areas on our site (such as the Wireless &amp; Telecom 
  and Personal Finance areas), we have joined forces with a reputable third-party 
  source of specialized information and other content so that you can quickly 
  and easily make informed decisions about such products and services. In each 
  of these areas, the BizRate.com header notes that the services are "Powered 
  by" or "By" the third-party (such as GetConnected.com in the Wireless 
  &amp; Telecom area and Bankrate.com in the Personal Finance area). This indicates 
  that the content resides on the third party's servers and your use of those 
  services is governed by that company's privacy policies and terms of use, which 
  you can access at the bottom of each page in those areas. We recommend that 
  you always review their privacy policies and terms of use before you complete 
  any transaction with them. BizRate.com's Terms of Use (but not our privacy policies) 
  also apply as between you and BizRate.com with respect to your use of those 
  third-party services accessed through our site.</span> 
</p><p>&nbsp;
<span class="text">
</span></p><p><b>Service Providers and Joint Marketing Activities</b> 
</p><p> We may provide personally identifiable information on a limited basis (i) 
  to third parties who are perform services for us or functions on our behalf 
  in accordance with applicable law, and (ii) when we engage in joint marketing 
  activities or in corporate transactions such as mergers and acquisitions from 
  time to time with other reputable parties as permitted by applicable law. In 
  such instances, we will contractually prohibit the third party involved from 
  disclosing or using the information other than for the purposes for which we 
  disclosed the information. For instance, they would be prohibited from selling 
  the information to a telemarketer or "junk mail" marketing company in violation 
  of our Privacy Policy. 
</p><p> <b>Anti-Spam Policy</b> 
</p><p> We strongly oppose junk email, or "spam". Our Member Agreement prohibits spamming 
  by members. If you receive any junk email that mentions BizRate.com, please 
  send details to <a href="mailto:privacy@bizrate.com">privacy@bizrate.com</a> 
  and we will investigate promptly. Members who are found to be spamming will 
  forfeit their right to participate in our BizRater Membership Program and may 
  be subject to other legal action. 
</p><p> From time to time, BizRate.com will send email to members and others who have 
  agreed to be contacted by BizRate.com. You can always choose not to receive 
  email from BizRate.com. Most messages carry opt-out or unsubscribe instructions 
  at the bottom of the email. Communication necessary to maintain a member account 
  does not carry these instructions - please contact <a href="mailto:consumer_relations@bizrate.com">consumer 
  relations</a> if you wish to cancel your membership. 
</p><p> <b>Contact Us</b> 
</p><p> If you have questions or concerns regarding this statement, you should first
