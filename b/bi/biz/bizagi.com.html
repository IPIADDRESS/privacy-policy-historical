</p>
<p><b>4.3. Embedded Pixels and Similar Technologies: </b>On the electronic Channels, Bizagi and its service providers may use embedded pixel technologies to identify unique user visits (as opposed to aggregate hits) and for advertising purposes. Also, embedded pixels or other technologies may be used in e-mails and our online display advertising to provide information on when the e-mail or ad was opened to track marketing campaign responsiveness; information collected using these technologies may be associated with the recipient's e-mail address.
</p>
<p><b>4.4. Widgets, Buttons, and Tools:  </b>Our electronic Channels may include widgets, which are interactive mini-programs that run on our site to provide specific services from another company (e.g., links to bookmarked sites), along with buttons or other tools that link to other companies' services (e.g., a "Like" button or third-party map). The widget, button or tool may collect and automatically send Data, such as your e-mail address, or other information (such as your browser information, or IP address), to a third party. Cookies may also be set or used by the widgets, buttons or tools to enable them to function properly or for other purposes, which may include advertising. Information collected or used by a widget, button or tool, including cookie settings and preferences, is governed by the privacy policy of the company that created it.
</p>

<p><b>4.5. Physical Location:  </b>Bizagi may collect and share the physical location of your device for purposes consistent with this Privacy Statement, such as to provide you with personalized location-based services or content. In some instances, you may be permitted to allow or deny such use of your device's location, but if you choose to deny such use, we may not be able to provide you with the applicable personalized services or content.
</p>
<p><b>4.6. Log Files, IP Addresses, URLs and Other Data:  </b>As is true of most websites, Bizagi gathers specific information automatically to analyze trends in the aggregate and administer Bizagi’s Websites and Services.  This information may include your Internet Protocol (IP) address (or the proxy server you use to access the World Wide Web), device and application identification numbers, your location, your browser type, your Internet service provider and/or mobile carrier, the pages and files you viewed, your searches, your operating system and system configuration information, and date/time stamps associated with your usage. Due to Internet communications standards, when you visit or use Bizagi’s Websites and Services, Bizagi automatically receives the URL of the website from which you came and the website to which you go when you leave Bizagi’s Websites. This information is used to analyze overall trends, to help us improve Bizagi’s Websites and Services, to track and aggregate non-personal information, and to provide Bizagi’s Websites and Services. For example, Bizagi uses IP addresses to monitor the regions from which Customers and Visitors navigate the Bizagi’s Websites. Bizagi also collects IP addresses from Customers when they log into the Services as part of the Bizagi’s “Identity Confirmation” and “IP Range Restrictions” security features.
</p>
<p><b>4.7. Social Media Features and Single Sign-on: </b>Bizagi’s Websites may use social media features, such as the LinkedIn “like” button (“Social Media Features”). These features may collect your IP address and which page you are visiting on the Bizagi Websites, and may set a cookie to enable the feature to function properly. You may be given the option by such Social Media Features to post information about your activities on Bizagi’s Websites to a profile page of yours that is provided by a third-party social media network to share with others within your network. Social Media Features are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on Bizagi’s Websites. Your interactions with these features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing the relevant Social Media Features. Bizagi also allows you to log in to certain of Bizagi’s Websites and Services using sign-in services such as Linkedin, Microsoft and Google. These services will authenticate your identity and provide you the option to share certain personal information with us such as your name and email address to pre-populate our sign-up form.
</p>
<p><b>4.8. Do Not Track:  </b>Currently, various browsers — including Internet Explorer, Firefox, and Safari — offer a “do not track” or “DNT” option that relies on a technology known as a DNT header, which sends a signal to websites’ visited by the user about the user's browser DNT preference setting. Bizagi does not currently commit to responding to browsers' DNT signals concerning the Bizagi Websites, in part, because no common industry standard for DNT has been adopted by industry groups, technology companies or regulators, including no consistent standard of interpreting user intent. Bizagi takes privacy and meaningful choice seriously and will make efforts to continue to monitor developments around DNT browser technology and the implementation of a standard.
</p>

<br><h2 class="ti-color4">5. Public forums refer a contact, and customer testimonials</h2>

<p>
  Bizagi may provide bulletin boards, blogs, or chat rooms on the Bizagi Websites. Any personal information you choose to submit in such a forum may be read, collected, or used by others who visit these forums and may be used to send you unsolicited messages.

Customers and Visitors may elect to use Bizagi’s referral program to inform contacts about Bizagi’s Websites and Services. When using the referral program, Bizagi requests the contact’s name and email address. Bizagi will automatically send the contact a one–time email inviting him or her to visit Bizagi’s Websites. Bizagi does not store this information.</p><p>
Bizagi posts a list of Customers and testimonials on Bizagi’s Websites that contain information such as Customer names and titles. Bizagi obtains the consent of each Customer before posting any information on such a list or posting testimonials.

</p>

<br><h2 class="ti-color4">6. Sharing of information collected</h2>

<p><b>6.1. Service Providers: </b>Bizagi may share Data about Bizagi Visitors, Customers and Attendees with Bizagi’s contracted service providers so that these service providers can provide services on our behalf.

If you purchase, explicitly express interest in, or register for a jointly–offered product, service, or program from or through Bizagi, Bizagi may share Data about Customers collected in connection with your purchase or expression of interest with our partner(s). Bizagi does not control our business partners’ use of the Data about Bizagi’s Customers collected by us, and their use of the information will be governed by their privacy policies. If you do not wish for your information to be shared in this manner, you may choose not to purchase or explicitly express interest in a jointly-offered product or services.</p><p>
Bizagi does not share Data about Bizagi Attendees with business partners unless: (1) you expressly opt-in to such sharing via an event registration form; or (2) you attend a Bizagi event and allow or any of its business partners to scan your attendee badge.

If you decide to share your information with business partners in the manners described above, your information will be subject to the business partners’ respective privacy statements.

</p>
<p><b>6.4. Third Parties:  </b>Section 4 of this Privacy Statement, Website Tools, specifically addresses the information third parties or Bizagi collects through cookies and web beacons, and how you can control cookies through your Web browsers.  Bizagi may also disclose your personal information to any third party with your prior consent.
</p>
<p><b>6.5. Compelled Disclosure: </b>Bizagi reserves the right to use or disclose information provided if required by law or if Bizagi reasonably believes that use or disclosure is necessary to protect Bizagi’s rights and to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process.
</p>
