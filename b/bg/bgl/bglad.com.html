OUR WEB SITE PRIVACY POLICY<br>

<br>
We have created this Privacy Policy in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to privacy. This Privacy Policy explains our practices with respect to the collection, use, and disclosure of personal and non-personal information provided by visitors to our Web site. By using this site, you signify your assent to these our privacy practices and the terms and conditions of our Web site.
<br>
<br>
<b>If this policy is not agreeable to you, please do not use this site.</b>
<br>
<br>
<b>WHAT TYPE INFORMATION IS COLLECTED?</b><br><br>

<b>Personal Information</b><br>

We only collect personal information from visitors to our Web site when they voluntarily provide it to us by completing our registration form. We may require visitors to provide us with information including, but not limited to, their name, email address, birth date, username, and password.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
<b>Non-Personal Information</b><br>
When visitors access our Web site, certain non-personal information may be collected from them including, but not limited to, their browser type (e.g., Mozilla, Opera or Internet Explorer), operating system (e.g., Windows or Macintosh), IP address, and the domain name from which they accessed the site (e.g., google.com). In addition, we may collect information about visitors' browsing behavior, such as the date and time they visit the Web site, the areas or pages of our Web site that they visit, the amount of time spent viewing the site, the number of times the visitor returns to the site, and click-stream data. We use transparent tracking pixels to determine the number of Web site visitors that have been sent to us through our affiliate network. We do not track any information about visitors once they leave our site. We may use cookies (small text files that are stored on visitors computers when they access our Web site) to collect this information. Information collected through cookies may be combined with visitors' personal information. We may also allow unaffiliated third parties, such as advertisers, to serve cookies to visitors of our Web site. Visitors are always free to decline cookies, but in doing so they may not be able to use certain features on our Web site. The "help" segment of the toolbar on most browsers explains how to configure a browser to not accept new cookies, how to have the browser inform a user when they receive a new cookie, and how to erase cookies from their hard drives. 
<br>
<br>
We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our website. These companies may use information (not including your name, address, email address, or telephone number) about your visits to this and other websites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies, <a href="http://www.google.com/privacy_ads.html">click here</a>.
<br>
<br>
<b>IN WHAT WAY DO WE USE YOUR PERSONAL AND NON-PERSONAL INFORMATION?</b><br>

Our goal in collecting personal information is to provide visitors with the most personalized Web experience possible and our advertisers with an efficient means to reach the right audience. By knowing a little about our visitors, we are able to deliver more relevant content and advertisements, and provide better services. We may use information collected from visitors to our Web site for any of the following purposes: (1) to administer our Web site, (2) to conduct internal reviews of our site (e.g., to determine the number of visitors to the site), (3) to help us better understand visitors' use of our site, (4) to help diagnose problems with our server, and (5) to protect the security or integrity of our site. Non-personal information will be used for purposes of conducting internal reviews of the site, monitoring the site, and providing a greater online experience for our visitors.
<br>
<br>

<b>DO WE DISCLOSE YOUR INFORMATION?</b><br>
We will not transfer nor disclose information collected from visitors to our Web site to our independent contractors, subsidiaries and affiliates Our third party service providers have their own terms and conditions and privacy policies. We suggest that visitors access these third party sites and review their terms and conditions and privacy policies before "subscribing" to any third party offer. We may share non-personal information we collect from visitors to our site, such as their browsing behaviors, with third parties. For example, we may tell a third party advertiser that a certain number of people have visited a certain area on our Web site.
<br>
<br>
<b>WHAT SECURITY MEASURES DO WE TAKE TO PROTECT YOUR DATA?</b><br>
To help prevent unauthorized access, maintain data integrity, and ensure the appropriate use of information, we have put in place certain physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect from visitors to our Web site. We allow access to personal information only to persons and entities engaging in activities provided for by this Privacy Policy. Visitors should consider any communication that they transmit to us (such as data, questions or answers, comments, suggestions, or communications submitted to a chat room) to be non-confidential. We will not be liable or responsible if information that belongs to a visitor is intercepted and used by an unintended recipient. 
<br>
<br>

<b>WE PROTECT CHILDREN'S PRIVACY</b><br>

<br>

<br>
<b>CORPORATE CHANGES</b><br>
