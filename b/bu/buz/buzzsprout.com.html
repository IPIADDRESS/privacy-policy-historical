        <h1>Buzzsprout - Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p>Buzzsprout (www.buzzsprout.com) is a Higher Pixels product. Higher Pixels is committed to protecting the privacy and data of those who visit the buzzsprout.com website and use the Buzzsprout Service.</p>
        <p>The data you put into Buzzsprout is yours. We’ll only ever access your account to help you with a problem or fix a software issue. We log access to accounts by IP address. This allows us to verify that no unauthorized access has happened for as long as the logs are kept.</p>
        <h3>Your Personal Information</h3>
        <p>We collect the email addresses of those who communicate with us via email. When you browse our marketing pages, we track that for analytical purposes (conversion rates and testing new designs). We'll also store any information you voluntarily submit (for example, filling out a survey) for the duration of the research project or as long as it makes sense.</p>
        <p>When you sign up for Buzzsprout, we ask for your name and email address. This allows us to personalize your new account, and send you invoices, updates, or contact you concerning your account. We’ll never give nor sell your personal information to third parties.</p>
        <h3>When We Will Share Your Info</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>To provide you products or services you’ve requested. Only done with your permission.</li>
          <li>To investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of our <a href="/tos">Terms of Service</a>, or as otherwise required by law.</li>
          <li>If Buzzsprout or Higher Pixels is acquired by or merged with another company. We have no plans to sell or merge, but if it happens, we’ll notify you before your info is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Law Enforcement</h3>
        <p>Higher Pixels won’t provide data to law enforcement without a court order. Should that happen, we’ll attempt to inform you of the request unless we’re legally prevented from doing so.</p>
        <h3>Use of Cookies</h3>
        <p>When you use the Buzzsprout Service we and our vendors may use “cookies”, “web beacons”, and similar devices to track your activities. These small pieces of information are stored on your hard drive, not on the Buzzsprout website.</p>
        <p>We use cookies to help you navigate the Buzzsprout website and Service as easily as possible, and to remember information about your current session. We do not use this technology to spy on you or otherwise invade your privacy. You can disable cookies and tracking technologies through your web browser, however doing so may render the Buzzsprout Service unusable.</p>
        <h3>Security and Storage</h3>
        <p>The Buzzsprout website and Service has industry standard security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse, and alteration of the information under our control. While there is no such thing as "perfect security" on the Internet, we will take all reasonable steps to insure the safety of your information.</p>
        <p>All data is encrypted via <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security" target="_blank">SSL/TLS</a> when transmitted between our servers and your browser. Our database data isn’t encrypted (because it needs to be available quickly), but we go to great lengths to secure your data at rest.</p>
        <p>You retain all rights of ownership to the data you have stored on the Buzzsprout Service. We will not sell or share this data with any third-parties or use this data to compete with you or advertise to your clients/listeners.</p>
        <h3>Deleted Data</h3>
        <p>When you cancel your account, we delete all data associated with your account from our production database. We do keep backups, designed for catastrophic system recovery, for 30 days. The backups are purged on a rolling 30 day cycle. When an account is deleted, none of your personal data will remain on our servers past 30 days. Anything you delete from your account while it’s active will also be purged from the backups at day 30.</p>
        <h3>EU-US and Swiss-US Customers</h3>
        <p>Please see our <a href="/privacy_shield">EU-US and Swiss-US Privacy Shield policy</a>.</p>
