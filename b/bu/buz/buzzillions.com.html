<span class="about">Privacy Policy</span>

<p>
This Privacy Policy (this "<b>Policy</b>") describes how personal information is collected from users of the
Buzzillions website at http://www.buzzillions.com (the "<b>Site</b>") and the PowerReviews product reviews and
ratings service ("<b>Review Service</b>"), operated by PowerReviews, Inc. ("<b>PowerReviews</b>," "<b>we</b>,"
or "<b>us</b>") and how that information is used and disclosed. The Review Service is provided both through the
Site and through third party sites via framing techniques as described below ("<b>Third Party Sites</b>"). We
encourage you to read this Policy carefully before providing any personal information on the Site or Review
Service.
<br><br>
Safe Harbor:<br>
The United State Department of Commerce and the European Commission have agreed on a set of data protection principles and frequently asked questions (FAQ) to enable U.S. companies to satisfy European Union (EU) law requirements for adequate protection of personal information transferred from the EEA to the United States.  The privacy principles in this policy are based on the Safe Harbor Principles and PowerReviews adheres to the Safe Harbor Principles as outlined below.
<br><br>
<span class="big">Information We Collect</span>
<br><br>
We collect "personal information" about users of the Site and the Review Service in the normal course of our
business. As used in this Policy, "<b>personal information</b>" is information that identifies or is capable of
being associated with an identifiable person. Some examples of personal information include a user's name,
address, and email address. Personal information does not include aggregate information or de-identified
information. "<b>Aggregate information</b>" is information about the use of the Site, such as information
collected about Site users, or a category of services or users, from which any personal information has been
removed. An example of aggregate information would be a report stating that forty-seven percent of the Site's
registered users identify themselves as male.
<br><br>Most of the personal information we receive comes directly from users who register on the Site, use the
Review Service or who otherwise voluntarily provide information to us in connection with various activities on
the Site or Review Service. The information we request at registration includes, without limitation, name,
address, e-mail address, and birth date. We may also collect other types of information during registration or
in connection with your other activities on the Site, such as demographic information (including, without
limitation, your age, occupation, and income) and information about or contained in postings you make in forums
or any other interactive areas of the Site, your answers to surveys, your participation in sweepstakes,
contests, games and promotional offers; and in any email request you send us for any reason (such as to request
customer service or provide us with comments or feedback). Also, we request your email address when you submit a
product or service review using the Review Service (whether through our Site or a Third Party Site) and if you
provide it, we send an email message to you confirming that you submitted the review.
<br><br>
We also automatically collect some information when you use the Site or Review Service. We log your IP address.
If you reached the Site by clicking on a link or advertisement on another site, we also log that information.
This helps us understand our users' interests and maximize our online exposure. All of this information is
collected and used only as aggregate information; that is, it is entered into our database, where we can use it
to generate overall reports on our users, but not individual reports that identify you personally.
<br><br>
<span class="big">Framed Content</span>
<br><br>
The Review Service may be displayed on or through Third Party Sites with the use of inline frames or other
framing techniques. We may collect personal information in such framed pages or content located on or provided
by Third Party Sites. When you submit personal information to us in this manner, it is treated as personal
information under this Policy. The collection and use of personal information by the Third Party Site directly
(i.e., outside of the Review Service framed pages) is governed separately by the privacy policy of such site.
<br><br>
<span class="big">Cookies, Web Beacons, and Similar Technologies</span>
<br><br>
We may use cookies to identify Site and Review Service users and to customize their experiences on the Site and
Review Service. Unless you provide your email address to us, our cookies contain no personally identifiable
information about you. If you have provided your email address to us, however, our cookies may be used to
identify you. We use cookies to help us understand how visitors use (and to help us to improve) the Site and
Review Service. You may refuse to accept cookies from us by following the procedures specific to your Web
browser. If you do so, your browser may react strangely and you may not be able to use some services on the Site
or Review Service.
<br><br>
Additionally, we may use, and may allow third parties to use, cookies and Web beacons on the Site and Review Service to
monitor the effectiveness of advertising or for other legitimate purposes. These companies may use information about your
visits to the Site and Review Service (not including your name, address or other personal information) to provide 
advertisements on the Site and Review Service, other websites and other forms of media about goods and services that may
be of interest to you.
<br><br>
Web beacons, also known as "Web bugs," are small, graphic images on Web pages or Web-based documents or in email messages that allow us or third
parties to monitor who is visiting the Site or Review Service. Web beacons collect the IP address of the
computer that the Web beacon is sent to, the URL of the page the Web beacon comes from and the time it was
viewed. Web beacons may be linked to your personal information.
<br><br>
If you would like more information about these practices and to know your choices about not having this information used by
these companies, please click <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">here</a>.
<br><br>
<span class="big">How We Use the Information We Collect</span>
<br><br>
We use the information we collect to:
</p><ul class="desc">
    <li>contact you for administrative purposes or provide you with customer service;</li>
    <li>complete transactions requested by you or to verify that you have submitted a review to our Review
        Service;
    </li>
    <li>respond to any questions, problems or complaints, or request feedback;</li>
    <li>organize the Site and Review Service to better serve you and customize or develop our products and
        services; and
    </li>
    <li>send you emails containing information about products and services that you might find of interest.</li>
    <li>to investigate and help prevent potentially unlawful activity or activity that threatens the network or otherwise violates the Usage Agreement;</li>
</ul>
Personal information provided on our Site or through the Review Service may be linked together or merged with
other personal information we obtain about you so that we may better understand your needs and inform you about
our products or services and those of our business partners. In addition, if we receive personal information
from third parties with whom we have business relationships, we may combine this information with the other
personal information we maintain about you. In either case, this Policy governs this information.
<br><br>
<span class="big">Disclosure of Information</span>
<br><br>
We do not rent, sell or disclose personal information to third parties without your prior consent, except as
described in this privacy policy. We may share personal information when we have your consent to do so, when
required by law, when required to protect our rights or property, as necessary to complete a transaction you
have requested, or for marketing purposes. We reserve the right to use and disclose any non-personal information
that we collect.
We may use third party service providers to assist us with the administration of the Site or Review Service or
to perform other services for us, including transaction processing and sending email. These third parties may be
given or may have access to your personal information, but agree to receive and use such information solely to
provide services to us or on our behalf.
<br><br>
If you provide us with personal information through a Third Party Site, we may share such information with such
Third Party Site for their internal business purposes and we generally require such Third Party Sites to comply
with this Policy. In addition, we may also share personal information with third parties for such third parties'
(or other third parties') marketing purposes; however, we provide you with the choice of opting-out of such
disclosures (please see "Choice and Access" below).
<br><br>
We may use third parties, called third-party ad servers or network advertisers, to deliver ads to you on our
behalf. These third-party ad servers may use cookies, web beacons or other technology to collect non-personally
identifiable information about your visits to our Site or the Review Service in order to use it to present
advertisements that may be of interest to you. If you would like more information about this practice or whether
you can opt out of having this information used by third-party ad servers to provide targeted ads, please visit
http://www.networkadvertising.org/optout_nonppii.asp
<br><br>
Information about our users, the Site and the Review Service is a business asset of PowerReviews. Therefore,
information about our users, including personal information, will be disclosed as part of any (a) merger or
acquisition, (b) creation of a separate business to provide the Site or our Review Service, or to provide other
services or fulfill products; (c) debt financing, sale or pledge of company assets, or (d) insolvency,
bankruptcy or receivership in which personal information would be transferred as one of PowerReviews's business
assets.
<br><br>
We may release personal information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with the law (e.g., a
lawful subpoena, warrant or court order); to enforce or apply our policies or any other agreement with a user;
to initiate, render, bill, and collect for amounts owed to us; to protect our rights or property; to protect our
users from fraudulent, abusive, or unlawful use of our Site or its services; to enforce contest, sweepstakes,
promotions, or game rules; or if we reasonably believe that an emergency involving immediate danger of death or
serious physical injury to any person requires disclosure of communications or justifies disclosure of records
without delay.
<br><br>
We send to your web browser many of the advertisements you see when you use our network of Web sites. However,
we also allow other companies, called third-party ad servers or ad networks, to serve advertisements within our
web pages. Because your web browser must request these advertising banners from the ad network Web site, these
companies can send their own cookies to your cookie file, just as if you had requested a web page from the site.
Please note that if an advertiser asks us to show an advertisement to a certain audience (for example, men ages
18-34) or audience segment (for example, men ages 13-24 who have viewed sports content) and you respond to that
ad, the advertiser or ad-server may conclude that you fit the description of the audience they are trying to
reach. As always remember, we only authorize our third-party ad servers to employ anonymous cookies for ad
delivery and anonymous targeting. Our third-party ad servers do not collect, nor do we give them access, to any
personally identifying information about you.
<br><br>
<span class="big">Opting Out of Third-Party Ad Servers</span>
<br><br>
If you want to prevent a third-party ad server from sending and reading cookies on your computer, currently you
must visit each ad network's Web site individually and opt out (if they offer this capability).
<br><br>
Currently, we have relationships with the following third-party ad networks (click to visit their Web site):
<br><br>
<a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.valueclickmedia.com/privacy.shtml">ValueClick Media</a>
<br><br>
<span class="big">Choice and Access</span>
<br><br>
We provide our users with the ability to "opt-in" to receiving certain communications from us or having their
information disclosed to third parties by indicating their preferences at the time of registration. If such user
later wishes to change these preferences or access, change or delete their personal information we provide the
following options:
<ul class="desc">
    <li>To "opt-out" of receiving promotional e-mail from us, you can; (a) send an email to
        privacy_request@powerreviews.com with your request; or (b) click on the "unsubscribe" link in the email
        you receive from us.
    </li>
    <li>To "opt-out" of receiving promotional mailings from us, you can: (a) send an email to
        privacy_request@powerreviews.com with your request; or (b) write to us at PowerReviews Inc., 22 Fourth
        Street, Suite 600, San Francisco, CA 94103.
    </li>
    <li>To "opt-out" of disclosure to third parties for their direct marketing purposes, you can: (a) send an
        email to privacy_request@powerreviews.com with your request; or (b) write to us at PowerReviews Inc.,
        22 Fourth Street, Suite 600, San Francisco, CA 94103.
    </li>
</ul>
Please note that opting out of receiving communications from us will not prevent you from receiving
administrative communications, such as those concerning the operation of the Site or Review Service or about a
review you have submitted.
<br><br>
<span class="big">Children</span>
<br><br>
We do not intend, and the Site is not designed, to collect personal information from children under the age of
13. If you are under 13 years old, you should not register with or otherwise provide personal information to our
Site or the Review Service.
<br><br>
<span class="big">Security</span>
<br><br>
We use reasonable security measures in an effort to prevent loss, misuse and alteration of information under our
control. We cannot, however, guarantee protection of all information against interception, misappropriation,
misuse, or alteration, or that your information may be not be disclosed or accessed by accidental circumstances
or by the unauthorized acts of others. Furthermore, we have no control over the security of other sites you
might visit, interact with or do business with.
<br><br>
<span class="big">Policy Changes</span>
<br><br>
We will modify this Policy if our privacy practices materially change in the future. We will notify you of such
changes only by posting the new policy on our Site and indicating at the top of the Policy the date it was last
updated. We encourage you to review the Policy each time you visit our Site or Review Service to see if it has
been updated since your last visit to make sure you understand how personal information you provide will be
used.
<br><br>
