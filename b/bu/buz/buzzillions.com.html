<p>This Privacy Policy (this "<b>Policy</b>") describes how personal
information is collected from users of the Buzzillions website at
http://www.buzzillions.com (the "<b>Site</b>") and the Bazaarvoice
product reviews and ratings service ("<b>Review Service</b>"),
operated by PowerReviews, LLC., which is a wholly-owned subsidiary of
Bazaarvoice, Inc. ("<b>Bazaarvoice</b>," "<b>we</b>," or
"<b>us</b>") and how that information is used and disclosed. The
Review Service is provided both through the Site and through third party sites
via framing techniques as described below ("<b>Third Party Sites</b>").
We encourage you to read this Policy carefully before providing any personal
information on the Site or Review Service. </p>

<span class="big">Information We Collect</span> <br>
<br>
We collect "personal information" about users of the Site and the
Review Service in the normal course of our business. As used in this Policy,
"</span><span lang="X-NONE" style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;
color:black;font-weight:normal">personal information</span><span lang="X-NONE" style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;color:black;
font-weight:normal">" is information that identifies or is capable of
being associated with an identifiable person. Some examples of personal
information include a user's name and email address. Personal information does
not include aggregate information or de-identified information. "</span><span lang="X-NONE" style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;
color:black;font-weight:normal">Aggregate information</span><span lang="X-NONE" style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;;color:black;
font-weight:normal">" is information about the use of the Site, such as
information collected about Site users, or a category of services or users,
from which any personal information has been removed. An example of aggregate
information would be a report stating that forty-seven percent of the Site's
registered users identify themselves as male. <br>
<br>
Most of the personal information we receive comes directly from users who
register on the Site, use the Review Service or who otherwise voluntarily
provide information to us in connection with various activities on the Site or
Review Service. The information we request at registration includes name,
e-mail address, and birth date. We may also collect other types of information
in connection with your other activities on the Site, such as information about
or contained in postings you make in forums or any other interactive areas of
the Site, your answers to surveys, your participation in sweepstakes, contests,
games and promotional offers; and in any email request you send us for any reason
(such as to request customer service or provide us with comments or feedback).
Also, we request your email address when you submit a product or service review
using the Review Service (whether through our Site or a Third Party Site) and
if you provide it, we send an email message to you confirming that you
submitted the review. <br>
<br>
We also automatically collect some information when you use the Site or Review
Service. We log your IP address. If you reached the Site by clicking on a link
or advertisement on another site, we also log that information. This helps us
understand our users' interests and maximize our online exposure. All of this
information is collected and used only as aggregate information; that is, it is
entered into our database, where we can use it to generate overall reports on
our users, but not individual reports that identify you personally. <br>
<br>
<span class="big">Framed Content</span> <br>
<br>
The Review Service may be displayed on or through Third Party Sites with the
use of inline frames or other framing techniques. We may collect personal
information in such framed pages or content located on or provided by Third
Party Sites. When you submit personal information to us in this manner, it is
treated as personal information under this Policy. The collection and use of
personal information by the Third Party Site directly (i.e., outside of the
Review Service framed pages) is governed separately by the privacy policy of
such site. <br>
<br>
<span class="big">Cookies, Web Beacons, and Similar Technologies</span> <br>
<br>
We may use cookies to identify Site and Review Service users and to customize
their experiences on the Site and Review Service. We also use cookies to help
us understand how visitors use (and to help us to improve) the Site and Review
Service and provide such information to our clients and partners through
reports and other analytics tools. You may refuse to accept cookies from us by
following the procedures specific to your Web browser. If you do so, your
browser may react strangely and you may not be able to use some services on the
Site or Review Service. <br>
<br>
Bazaarvoice firmly believes in the importance of online privacy and is a member
of the Network Advertising Initiative (NAI). Through the Site, we collect and
use, and allow other third parties to collect and use, information about you to
provide you a more enriched online experience by (i) creating advertisements,
(ii) delivering advertisements to websites on behalf of advertisers, (iii)
monitoring and managing advertising campaigns, and (iv) presenting you with
advertisements that are more likely to be interesting and relevant to you. <br>
<br>
Bazaarvoice's technology may be deployed on other websites to collect
information that may be used for online ad tailoring purposes or to deliver an
advertisement to you from a company whose website you have visited in the past.
Bazaarvoice's technology may employ cookies and Web beacons to collect
non-personally identifying information, such as information related to
advertising campaign results, in the course of providing its clients with its
ad-serving services and for the purpose of helping its clients determine which
advertisement is suitable to be delivered to you. This non-personally
identifiable information collected through a cookie may be shared with our
customers for their advertising purposes and may be combined by them with other
data, including personal information, in possession of our customers. </span></p>

parties is not covered by our privacy statement. We do not have access or
control over these cookies. <b><br>
<br>
</b>Web beacons, also known as "Web bugs," are small, graphic images

of the page the Web beacon comes from and the time it was viewed. Web beacons
may be linked to your personal information. If you would like more information

 <li class="MsoNormal" style="color:black"><span style="color:windowtext">From
     time-to-time we may provide you the opportunity to participate in contests
     or surveys on our site and may use a third party provider to administer
     them. If you participate, we may request certain personally identifiable
     information from you. Participation in these surveys or contests is
     completely voluntary and you therefore have a choice whether or not to
     disclose this information.&nbsp; </span></li>
</ul>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color:black">Personal information provided on
our Site or through the Review Service may be linked together or merged with
other personal information we obtain about you so that we may better understand
your needs and inform you about our products or services and those of our
business partners. In addition, if we receive personal information from third
parties with whom we have business relationships, we may combine this
information with the other personal information we maintain about you. In
either case, this Policy governs this information. <br>
<br>
<span class="big">Disclosure of Information</span> <br>
<br>
We do not rent, sell or disclose personal information to third parties without
your prior consent, except as described in this privacy policy. We may share
personal information when we have your consent to do so, when required by law,
when required to protect our rights or property, as necessary to complete a
transaction you have requested, or for marketing purposes. We reserve the right
to use and disclose any non-personal information that we collect. We may use
third party service providers to assist us with the administration of the Site
or Review Service or to perform other services for us, including transaction
processing and sending email. These third parties may be given or may have
access to your personal information, but agree to receive and use such
information solely to provide services to us or on our behalf.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
We may use third parties, called third-party ad servers or network advertisers,
to deliver ads to you on our behalf. These third-party ad servers may use
cookies, web beacons or other technology to collect non-personally identifiable
information about your visits to our Site or the Review Service in order to use
it to present advertisements that may be of interest to you. If you would like
more information about this practice or whether you can opt out of having this
information used by third-party ad servers to provide targeted ads, please
visit http://www.networkadvertising.org/optout_nonppii.asp&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Information about our users, the Site and the Review Service is a business asset
of Bazaarvoice. Therefore, information about our users, including personal
information, will be disclosed as part of any (a) merger or acquisition, (b)
creation of a separate business to provide the Site or our Review Service, or
to provide other services or fulfill products; (c) debt financing, sale or
pledge of company assets, or (d) insolvency, bankruptcy or receivership in
which personal information would be transferred as one of Bazaarvoice's
business assets.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
We may release personal information when we believe release is appropriate to
comply with the law (e.g., a lawful subpoena, warrant or court order); to
enforce or apply our policies or any other agreement with a user; to initiate,
render, bill, and collect for amounts owed to us; to protect our rights or
property; to protect our users from fraudulent, abusive, or unlawful use of our
Site or its services; to enforce contest, sweepstakes, promotions, or game
rules; or if we reasonably believe that an emergency involving immediate danger
of death or serious physical injury to any person requires disclosure of
communications or justifies disclosure of records without delay.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
We send to your web browser many of the advertisements you see when you use
our&nbsp; Web site. However, we also allow other companies, called third-party ad
servers or ad networks, to serve advertisements within our web pages. Because
your web browser must request these advertising banners from the ad network Web
site, these companies can send their own cookies to your cookie file, just as
if you had requested a web page from the site. Please note that if an
advertiser asks us to show an advertisement to a certain audience (for example,
men ages 18-34) or audience segment (for example, men ages 13-24 who have
viewed sports content) and you respond to that ad, the advertiser or ad-server
may conclude that you fit the description of the audience they are trying to
reach. As always remember, we only authorize our third-party ad servers to
employ anonymous cookies for ad delivery and anonymous targeting. Our
third-party ad servers do not collect, nor do we give them access, to any
personally identifying information about you. <br>
