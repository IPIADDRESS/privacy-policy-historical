        <p>&nbsp;</p>
            
            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>
                buzztouch takes your right to privacy seriously, and wants you to feel comfortable using this internet based (web-based) application.
                This privacy policy deals with personally-identifiable information (referred to as "data" below) that may be collected by this site. 
                This policy does not apply to other entities that are not owned or controlled by the application editor, nor to persons that are not employees or agents of the application editor, or that are not under the application editor's control.
            </p>
            
            
            <h3>1. Collection of data</h3>
            <p>
                Registration of a user account is not available to the public. No personal information is required to use
                the application. You are not required to provide any personal information that may identify you unless you
                complete the online registration process. If you choose to complete the online registration process,
                we do ask for your first and last name plus your birthdate (to comply with the law) as well as some
                basic contact information.
                It is possible that an uncotrollable circumstance may arise that prevents us from hiding
                contact information you provided during the registration process an administrator completed
                (such as, but not limited to, subsequent to a successful act of intrusion by a third party). 
                Similiar to other web based applications, the application editor may also automatically receive general information that is
                contained in server log files,  such as your IP address, and cookie information.
                Information about how advertising may be served on this applications (if it is the application editor's policy to display advertising) is set forth below.
            </p>
            
            <h3>2. Use of data</h3>

                (iii) a service provided on our application requires interaction with a third party with or is provided by a third party,
                such as an application service provider; (iv) pursuant to legal action or law enforcement; 
                (v) it is found that your use of this applications violates this policy, terms of service, 
                or other usage guidelines, or if it is deemed reasonably necessary by the applications editor
                to protect the application editor's legal rights and/or property; or
                (vi) this application is purchased by a third party, in which case that third party will be able
                to use the data in the same manner as set forth in this Policy.
