        Tracking Technologies<br>
        Technologies such as: cookies, beacons, tags and scripts are used by NoCash,
        affiliates, or analytics. We use Google Analytics. These technologies are used in
        analyzing trends, administering the site, tracking users' movements around the
        site and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. We may
        receive reports based on the use of these technologies by these companies on an
        individual as well as aggregated basis.
    </p>
    <p>
        We use cookies for <em>our shopping cart, to remember users' settings (e.g.
        display preferences), and for authentication</em>. Users can control the use of
        cookies at the individual browser level. If you reject cookies, you may still use our
        site, but your ability to use some features or areas of our site may be limited.
    </p>
    <p>
        We partner with a third party to either display advertising on our Web site or to
        manage our advertising on other sites. Our third party partner may use
        technologies such as cookies to gather information about your activities on this
        site and other sites in order to provide you advertising based upon your browsing
        activities and interests.  If you wish to not have this information used for the

    <p>
        Analytics / Log Files<br>
        As is true of most web sites, we gather certain information automatically and
        store it in log files. This information includes internet protocol (IP) addresses,
        browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages,
        operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data. We use this information,
        which does not identify individual users, to analyze trends, to administer the
        site, to track users' movements around the site and to gather demographic
        information about our user base as a whole. We do not link this
        automatically-collected data to personal information.
    </p>
	<p>
		Security<br>
		When you submit sensitive information such as credit card, and login
		information, your information is transmitted through a state of the art
		128-bit SSL encryption. Also, encrypted are pages for our Affiliate
		Program where other sensitive information is collected, specifically
		social security number and Tax ID number. No method of transmission over the
        Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however.  Therefore, we
        cannot guarantee its absolute security. If you have any questions about security
        on our Web site, you can contact us at <a href="mailto:customerservice@bushdvd.com">customerservice@bushdvd.com</a>.

        Widgets, such as the Share this button or interactive mini-programs that run on
        our site. These Features may collect your IP address, which page you are visiting
        on our site, and may set a cookie to enable the Feature to function properly.
        Social Media Features and Widgets are either hosted by a third party or hosted
