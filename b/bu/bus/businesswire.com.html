<h1>Business Wire Privacy Statement</h1>

<span class="body_small">Originally posted 12/21/2000 - Last updated 02/01/2002 </span>
</p><p>

</p><p>
Information about individual users collected on the Business Wire Web sites is used for internal business purposes, including customizing services, contacting members regarding submissions, and responding to requests for information. On occasion, Business Wire or one of its members or affiliates may also use this information to inform you of news, service upgrades or new services or products that may be of particular interest to you. 
</p><p>
Business Wire tracks aggregate anonymous statistics regarding usage of the web site and provides this anonymous information to members, affiliates, advertisers and for other lawful purposes. 
</p><p>
<b>Does Business Wire provide personal information collected on the Business Wire Web sites to third parties? </b>
</p><p>
Business Wire does not sell, trade or rent personal information collected online and will not knowingly disclose any individual personal information to third parties except as follows: 
</p><p>
(1) In order to provide you with requested services, Business Wire may provide contact or other necessary information to affiliated companies such as Newstream and Round Table Group. For example, if you register for the Expertsource service, Business Wire may provide your email address to Round Table Group in order to facilitate initial contact between you and the relevant expert; 
</p><p>
(2) If you register to have press releases for a particular Business Wire member's company in the Company Archives e-mailed to you or if you download a high resolution version of a photograph that appears with a member's press release, the member company may be notified that you have utilized one of these services and provided with your e-mail address in order to follow-up and provide you with additional valuable information; 
</p><p>
(3) When disclosure is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be causing injury to or interference with the rights (including property rights) or safety of other users or third parties or of Business Wire; and 
</p><p>
(4) When Business Wire reasonably believes that disclosure is required by law or to comply with legal process served on Business Wire. 
</p><p>
<b>How can I change or update the information I provide at the Business Wire Web sites? </b>

</p><p>
<b>Do the Business Wire Web sites use cookies? </b>
</p><p>
Yes, however Business Wire only uses cookies to facilitate functions at the Business Wire Web sites and does not record or store any information about your movements on the Internet outside the Business Wire Web sites. Please note that if you click on a link to a third-party Web site from one of the Business Wire Web sites, the linked-to site may have different policies and practices with regard to cookies and Business Wire has no control over and is not responsible for such policies or practices.

</p><p>
<b>What measures does Business Wire take to safeguard its online users' privacy? </b>
</p><p>
Information you submit at a Business Wire Web site upon registration for specific services is password-protected so that the only parties who have access to the information besides Business Wire and its agents and affiliates are the member entity and its employees. In addition, individual employees of members will receive individual passwords when they log-on to submit press releases online, and information submitted using Business Wire Connect is further protected by Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software, which encrypts the information during transmission. In order to protect the integrity of the password system, members should refrain from disclosing passwords and immediately change any passwords that may have been compromised. Business Wire will never ask you for your password by e-mail, so members and their employees should not respond to unsolicited e-mail requests asking for password information even if such requests appear to be from Business Wire. 
</p><p>
Please be advised that no data transmission over the Internet is 100% secure. Business Wire is committed to protecting users' personal information, but cannot guarantee or warrant the security of this information when it is sent to or through the Business Wire Web sites.
