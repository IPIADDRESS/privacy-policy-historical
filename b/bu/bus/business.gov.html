<h1>Privacy</h1>
<p>Business.gov collects NO  personal information, such as names and addresses, when you visit our  website. If you choose to provide this information to us, it will be  used only to fulfill your request for information.</p>

<p>Business.gov collects some technical information from you when you  visit the site in order to give you the best possible experience. The  section below explains how we handle and collect technical information  when you visit our website.</p>

<h2>Technical Information Collected and Stored Automatically</h2>
<p>Business.gov automatically records website usage information that we  analyze statistically to track operational problems, to prevent fraud  and to improve the effectiveness, security and integrity of the site.  This information does not identify you personally and we do not use  this information to track or record information about individuals. For  each page that you visit, we collect and store only the following  technical information: </p>

<ul>
  <li> Date and time of access </li>
  <li> URL address of the Business.gov webpage visited </li>
  <li> Internet domain and IP address from which our website was accessed</li>
  <li> Type of browser and operating system used to access our site (if provided by the browser)</li>
  <li> URL address of the referring page (if provided by the browser) </li>
  <li> Completion or success status of the request for a web page or other on-line item</li>
  <li> File size of the webpage visited</li>
</ul>
<p>This information is only used to help us make the site more useful for  you. With this data we learn about the number of visitors to our site  and the types of technology our visitors use. We never track or record  information about individuals and their visits.</p>
<h2>Cookies</h2>
<p>When you visit some websites, their web servers generate files of  information known as cookies, which helps webmasters understand how  users interact with their site's content and services. Websites use  cookies to track one's activities on a website (e.g., pages visited,  links clicked on, etc.), and to record information about the user so  when the user returns the site, customized features can be provided.</p>
<p>
There are three types of cookies. A session cookie is a line  of text that is stored temporarily in your computer's random access  memory (RAM) and is only available for the duration of an active  browsing session. A session cookie is not placed on any hard drive, and  it is destroyed as soon as you close your browser. A persistent cookie  is saved to a file on your hard drive and is accessed whenever you  re-visit the website that put it there. This lets that website remember  what you were interested in the last time you visited. A third-party  cookie is a persistent cookie that is set by or sent to a website  different than the one you're currently viewing. </p>
<p>
Business.gov does not use persistent cookies, but sometimes  uses session cookies. Some of the interactive sections of our website  may set session cookies in temporary memory in order to provide  streamlined navigation. These session cookies are not stored on your  computer's hard drive <strong>permanently</strong> and are automatically erased as soon as you close your browser.  Information from these session cookies is not collected or saved.</p>
<p>
Business.gov uses Google Analytics, which requires a third  party (Google) session cookie, to keep track of the site usage. The  cookie is used solely for collecting usage information as described in  the "Technical Information Collected and Automatically Stored" section.  No personally identifiable information is gathered. </p>

<h2> Information That You Voluntarily Provide </h2>
<p>We do not collect personal information for any purpose other than  to respond to you. If you choose to provide us with personal  information - like filling out a <a href="/contact_us" title="Contact Us">Contact Us</a> form with an e-mail address and submitting it to us through the website  - we use that information to respond to your message and to help us get  you the information you have requested. We only share the information  you give us with another government agency if your question relates to  that agency, or as otherwise required by law. Business.gov never  collects information or creates individual profiles for commercial  marketing. </p>
<p>
While you must provide an e-mail address and zip code for a  localized response to any incoming questions or comments to  Business.gov, we recommend that you NOT include any other personal  information, such as social security numbers. </p>

<h2> Site Security </h2>
<p>For site security purposes and to ensure that this service remains  available to all users, this government computer system employs  commercial software programs to monitor network traffic to identify  unauthorized attempts to upload or change information, or otherwise  cause damage. </p>

<p>Except for authorized law enforcement investigations, no other  attempts are made to identify individual users or their usage habits.  Raw data logs are used for no other purposes and are scheduled for  regular destruction in accordance with National Archives and Records  Administration guidelines. </p>

<p>Unauthorized attempts to upload information or change  information on this service are strictly prohibited and may be  punishable under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1986 and the  National Information Infrastructure Protection Act. </p>
<h2>Links to Other Sites</h2>
<p>Business.gov contains links to websites of  other government, public and private organizations that are outside of  our control. When you follow a link to another site, you leave the  Business.gov site and your website interactions are no longer protected  by our privacy policy. Business.gov is not responsible for, and does  not endorse the privacy or security practices and content of sites to  which Business.gov links. </p>

<h2>Your Rights Under the Privacy Act</h2>
<p>The Federal Citizen Information Center provides a guide to <a href="http://www.pueblo.gsa.gov/cic_text/fed_prog/foia/foia.htm" onclick="javascript:urchinTracker('/outgoing/www.pueblo.gsa.gov/cic_text/fed_prog/foia/foia.htm');">Your Rights to Federal Records - Questions and Answers on the Freedom of Information Act and Privacy Act</a> that explains your rights to personal information under these laws.</p></div>
