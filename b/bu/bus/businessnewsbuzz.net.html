        Our goal is to become your favorite Internet destination by providing
        the information, services, and product offerings that are most relevant
        to you. To achieve this goal, the Netcog Network must collect information
        so we can understand what makes you different from our many other
        unique users.
        </p><p>Information collected online is usually defined as being either <b>anonymous</b>
        or <b>personally identifiable</b>.</p>
        <ul>
          <b>
          </b><li><b>Anonymous information</b> refers to data that cannot be tied back
          to a specific individual. For example, Netcog collects some information
          each time a visitor comes to a Netcog Network site so we can improve
          the overall quality of the visitor's online experience. Netcog collects
          the visitor's IP address (e.g., whether the user is logged on from
          ibm.com or a Free Internet Access), referral data (e.g., the
          address of the last URL a user visited prior to clicking through to a
          Netcog Network site), and browser and platform type (e.g., a Netscape
          browser on a Macintosh platform). Netcog also collects aggregate search
          terms from its search services for internal reporting
          and targeted advertising. Netcog collects this user information for
          purposes of product monitoring, product improvement, and targeted
          advertising. You do not have to register with the Netcog Network before
          we can collect this anonymous information.</li>

        <ul>
          <b>
          </b><li><b>Personally identifiable information</b> refers to data that tells
          us specifically who you are, such as your name and postal address,
          which may be collected in addition to the anonymous data described
          above. Netcog collects personal information in the following ways from

                  back more often. Users who complete the registration process
                  are given a Netcog Network ID and can take full advantage of

        When you register for a service within the Netcog Network, that
        information is generally collected and maintained solely by the Netcog
        Network unless specifically stated otherwise at the point of collection.
        For example, some Netcog Network services (like Auctions) are
        offered in conjunction with a third-party company. If data is collected
        and/or maintained by any company other than Netcog, we will tell you at
        the point of collection. If you do not want to share your information
        with that company, you can choose not to use that service. Please see
        the Section entitled <a href="#share">With whom does the Netcog Network
        share the information that is collected?</a> for a more complete list of
        companies that allow Netcog to provide you with a wide variety of
        Products and Services.
        </p><p>Netcog runs many promotions and sweepstakes across its Network. These
        promotions may be sponsored or co-sponsored by third-party companies.
        Data collected during a promotion is typically shared with the sponsor
        or co-sponsor. Netcog will inform you at the point of collection whether
        or not we are sharing your personal data as a result of your
        participation in a promotion or sweepstakes. If you do not want to have
        the Netcog Network share your data, you can choose not to participate in
        the promotion or sweepstakes.</p>
        <p>Be aware that Netcog Network sponsors and other advertisers have links
        on our sites that take you to other sites that may collect personally
        identifiable information about you. Netcog hopes that all third parties
        involved adhere to our policies regarding the privacy of our users.
        However, the Netcog Network Privacy Policy does not cover third-party
        data collection practices and the Netcog Network does not assume any
        responsibility for any actions of third parties.</p>

        Any personally identifiable information you share with Netcog when
        registering for Products and Services at any of our Network sites is
        maintained and accessible only by Netcog unless specifically stated
        otherwise. Netcog requests information from its users so that users can
        enjoy customized experiences across the Netcog Network, including
        personalization services, interactive communications and much more. Most of these Products and Services are
        available to you at no cost. In order to provide great content and
        services free of charge, Netcog displays advertisements.
        <p>The following are examples of how the Netcog Network may use the
        information it collects:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Netcog offers its users the ability to personalize content on the
            Network, such as news, custom home page design, newsletters, email alerts and more.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <li>Netcog uses the aggregate data collected to let our sponsors know
            the numbers of people who have certain demographic characteristics
            and the number of those people who have seen and "clicked"
            on their advertisement(s). We will also disclose to those
            third-party sponsors the overall demographics available regarding
            who saw and "clicked" on their advertisement. No
            personally identifiable information will be disclosed to these
            advertisers as part of this process -- only information in an
            aggregate form.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <li>Netcog also uses the aggregate data to perform statistical analyses
            of the collective characteristics and behavior of our registered
            users and visitors, to measure user demographics and interests
            regarding specific areas of the Netcog Network and to analyze how and
            where best to use our resources. Without such data, we would not
            know which parts of the Netcog Network are the most popular, and we
            would not be able to change and update the content and services
            appropriately.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <li>Netcog may, from time to time, use your information to contact you
            about changes or enhancements to Products and Services on the Netcog
            Network.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <li>If you told Netcog that you were interested in receiving offers or
            information from selected sponsors and advertisers, Netcog will send
            you e-mail about products and services that we feel may be of
            interest to you. For those who elect to receive such materials from
            Netcog or third parties, and who indicate that they do in their
            profile, Netcog will release personally identifiable information.
            Information released includes name, e-mail address and other
            information supplied in the Netcog Network registration process.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <li>Netcog sometimes uses an individual registered user's data to
            "pre-populate" forms that are displayed for the purpose of
            collecting individual data by the Netcog Network and/or its
            advertisers and sponsors.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <li>If you enter a sweepstakes or a contest on the Netcog Network, we
            will use the information you provided to contact you in the event
            you win.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <li>Netcog may be required by law enforcement or judicial authorities
            to provide information on individual users to the appropriate
            governmental authorities. In matters involving a danger to personal
            or public safety, Netcog may voluntarily provide information to

        User information may be shared internally with other companies within
        the Netcog group. In addition, the Netcog Network may share user information with
        third-party companies that are not part of the Netcog group. In
        order to provide you with content and services that match your
        interests, the Netcog Network has relationships with many of the best
        service and content companies. Some of these services require
        registration before they will function properly. You can recognize most
        of these sites by looking for the joint branding of Netcog and the
        third-party company. For example, if you see a logo in the upper-right
        corner of the page that says 'Brought to you by ______', you are on a
        co-branded site. Other third-party relationships are "private
        label" relationships where a service or content company provides
            Netcog with technology, services and/or content under Netcog Network
        branding.
        </p><p>Whenever you provide registration information on co-branded or
        private label sites, that data may be shared with the third-party
        company providing the service. You should make every effort to read the
        individual privacy policies of such third-parties, and make an informed
        decision on your own whether or not to continue based upon these sites'
        privacy practices and your own discretion. <b>You may opt-out of sharing
        your information with such providers by choosing not to use that service
        or content.</b></p>
        <p>The following is a list of third-party companies with whom Netcog has
        contracted to provide you Products and Services. This list may expand or
        change from time to time.</p>

        Please note that, when you purchase goods or services through Netcog
        Shop, your credit card and identifying information will be provided to
        third parties in order to verify the credit card data. Furthermore, the
        data you submit in connection with your use of the Netcog Shop will be
        provided to individual merchants from whom you order goods or services.
        Please review carefully the privacy policies of particular merchants
        that you access through Netcog Shop. Because your privacy and security
        concerns are important to Netcog, we took action to ensure that the
        personal data you submit while using the Netcog Shop Shopping Cart
        (including your credit card number, billing, and shipping information)
        is passed through "secure servers." Netcog Shop accomplishes
        this through technology provided by <a href="http://www.verisign.com/">Verisign</a>,
        which is a member of the <a href="http://www.truste.com/">TRUSTe</a>
        program. For the vast majority of purchases made through the Netcog
        Shopping Cart, your credit card is charged electronically and your
        actual account number is never presented to the merchant from whom you
        have purchased.</p>
            <p><u>User feedback collection</u>.<br>
            Netcog contracts with partners to collect feedback
        from randomly-selected users about their satisfaction with the Netcog
        site. For more information about the their privacy policy, see our
            partners page.</p>
        <p>In addition to finding co-branded and private label sites, you will
        find direct links on our site to sites offered by third parties. Some of
        these sites are authorized to use the Netcog Network brands and/or logos.
        No third-party sites are covered by this Privacy Policy. If you feel
        that a site using a Netcog Network brand and/or logo does not follow an
        acceptable privacy policy, please contact the Netcog Privacy Site

          </b>Meeting new people in an online community (chat room, forum,
          newsgroup, message board, Web page, etc.) is one of the best things
          about the Internet, but you should always be careful about disclosing
          personal information such as an actual name, member name, e-mail
          address, and so on. This information may be collected and used by
          others within the online community to send unsolicited e-mail messages
          from other parties, outside the Netcog Network. Some of the messages
          you receive may be useful to you, but some may not. In an effort to
          curtail unsolicited e-mail, Netcog blocks certain e-mail addresses and
          domains from sending messages to e-mail addresses at our domains.

          information to anyone they encounter on the Internet. They should also
          be instructed not to fill out any forms or register at any Web site
          without your knowledge and consent. Take advantage of the online
          resources for parents available on the internet.
