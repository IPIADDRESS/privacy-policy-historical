<font size="+2"><b>BusinessOL.com, Inc. Security Statement</b></font>
<p>
<font size="+1"><b>Personal Information Security</b></font>
</p><p>

BusinessOL.com, Inc. uses a password
protection scheme to secure any names and addresses provided by visitors who
choose to register on this site. 
</p><p>
Visitors to this site
are allowed to provide BusinessOL.com, Inc. with their name, address and comments. 
Providing this information is strictly optional. Visitors are in no way obligated to do
so. If the name and address is provided then the person providing this
information must also provide a secret password. Only the person knowing this confidential
password may ever view or change this information during the site visit or any
future visit to this site.
</p><p>
Names and addresses that are provided by visitors are stored 
in a database. 
This database is not at the same location on the server as this web site.
Furthermore, security on the database is set so that only
the Internet servers (serving web pages) and technical personell 
who are given systems administrator capabilities
can ever view or access the database.
Finally, the security on this database is set so that no
Internet visitors may access it.

</p><p>
If the visitor
providing the information also provides an email address then an email is sent thanking
the visitor. An email will also sent to BusinessOL.com, Inc. with the registration
information.
</p><p>
Transmission of both emails is not secure.




</p><p>
<font size="+1"><b>Credit Card and Order Information Security</b></font></p><p>

This site allows visitors to pay for items ordered using a credit card.
BusinessOL.com, Inc. processes all credit card
transactions using <a href="http://www.Authorize.Net">Authorize.net</a>'s
secure <a href="http://www.authorizenet.com/support/docs/">Automated Direct
Connect (ADC) Relay Response</a> methods. A visitorâ€™s card number, name, and
expiration date, are transferred via a secure connection directly with
Athorize.Net's gateway server.
</p><p>
When
a visitor submits an order containing credit card information, a secure
connection is made with Authorize.Net using SSL for bank approval.
Authorize.Net processes the entire transaction through the banking system. The
credit card number, name, and expiration date are NEVER transmitted to BusinessOL.com, Inc. and
can never be stored in any fashion or viewed by BusinessOL.com, Inc.. The entire transaction
is between Authorize.net and the buyer. BusinessOL.com, Inc. is not involved in the transaction.
</p><p>
Authorize.net
only transmits to BusinessOL.com, Inc. whether the transaction was accepted or rejected; and if
the information was rejected what the rejection reason was. 
This acceptance or rejection is then
communicated by BusinessOL.com, Inc. to the visitor.
