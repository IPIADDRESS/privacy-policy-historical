  <p class="px14 bold">Privacy Statement</p>

<p>We are committed to safeguarding your privacy online. This privacy policy applies to your information that we collect and receive; it does not apply to practices of businesses that we do not own or control or people we do not employ. At no time will we sell your information or release your personally-identifiable data without your permission. You can visit this Site without revealing who you are or providing any personal information about yourself. </p>

<p>By using this Site, you agree to the terms of this privacy policy. Please read the following policy to understand how your personal information will be treated as you use our services. The following discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices.</p>

<p>This Site contains links to other sites. These include links to individual lender/broker sites that offer consumer and business loans, as well links to other third party sites that offer credit reports, property valuation information, insurance quotes, etc. We are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such Web sites.</p>

<p class="px14 bold">Browsing the Site</p>

<p>If you browse through the Site without entering any personal data, we will gather and store certain information about your visit. This information does not identify you personally and cannot be linked back to you unless you decide at some point to identify yourself. If you are only browsing, we collect the following information: IP address, the type of browser and operating system used to access our site, the date and time you access our site, the pages you visit (click-through), and if you linked to our website from another website, the address of that website as well as additional information related to your visit. We use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server, and to administer the Site. </p>

<p class="px14 bold">Information Collected</p>

<p>We collect the email addresses of consumers who communicate with us or through our authorized vendors via email. We also collect information provided to us by consumers in loan or refinance requests submitted through our site or our authorized vendors' sites ("Loan Request Information"). Loan Request Information typically includes name, address, and phone numbers, email address, household income, estimated credit rating, and loan specific information including but not limited to estimated property value, desired loan amount, downpayment, and whether the applicant is working with a real estate agent. In addition, consumers who express a desire to apply for a loan provide us with and authorize us or our affiliate websites to obtain from third parties necessary financial information such as credit reports ("Finance Information"). We do not provide financing, but instead transmit those requests to third-party vendors for consideration.</p>

<p>All information provided by consumers in any of the above-listed ways or otherwise becomes the property of Internet Brands once received by us and may be used and disclosed as permitted in this Policy.</p>

<p>Loan Request Information is used to transmit financing requests to third parties who may be in a position to respond to your request. Consumers who submit Loan Request Information expressly authorize up to four (4) third party lenders to contact them by phone or email in connection with their loan or refinancing request regardless of whether or not such consumer is listed on a "Do Not Call" list.</p>

<p>As part of the request process, we may verify the information you provide, or obtain omitted address or other contact information from third parties.</p>

<p>Loan Request Information transmitted to a lender or other fulfillment entity becomes the property of that lender of fulfillment entity, in addition to us. The information is used to process your financing application.</p>

<p>We also share your personal information with our affiliated companies in order to identify products or services in which you may have interest, to improve our user experience and generally to engage in market research and for other internal business purposes. We may also aggregate your personal information with others' information and prepare reports on site usage, purchase history or other factors for sale or distribution to others. Those reports are aggregated and include no personally identifying information. Finally, we may use your personal information to send you email or postal communications regarding products or services offered by us or by third parties with whom we have relationships in which we think you may be interested. We do not share, sell, trade or rent your personal information to third parties for unknown reasons.</p>

<p>You may at any time choose not to receive promotional emails from us by contacting us at <a href="mailto:information@internetbrands.com">information@internetbrands.com</a>. Notwithstanding the foregoing, we may continue to contact you for the purpose of communicating information relating to this Site, as well as to facilitate, complete, or confirm any transaction that you may enter into or responding to your inquiry or request.</p>
