<a name="wp"></a><b>1.	What personally identifiable information Business.com collects from you, and how Business.com uses the information.</b><br><br>  
</p>
<p>
		Business.com collects and stores personal information in several ways at different parts of our Site.  This information may include your legal name, email address, age, gender, address, telephone number(s), areas of interest, financial information, User ID, User Password and other self-identifying information.  We collect this information in order to provide you with our services more easily, and in a more personalized manner.  We may make message boards and discussion forums available to you.  If you choose to voluntarily disclose certain information on any such public area of the Site, this Privacy Policy will not cover such disclosure of information.  We urge exercising caution when disclosing information on public message boards or discussion forums. 
</p>
<p>
Business.com also may request certain information using online order forms for products and services.  On the order forms, we may collect contact information, financial information, demographic information, method of payment and, if applicable, a credit or debit card number.  We may also collect information about you in surveys or for sweepstakes and contests on the Site and information about the searches you perform and the pages you visit on the Site. Business.com may also monitor, on an anonymous aggregate basis, patterns of use in connection with emails that it sends out, including which links are clicked on in our email communications, so that we may use such information to better personalize the content of the Site and our mailings for our users. All such information will be protected in accordance with our Privacy Policy.  We may also automatically collect your Internet Protocol address to help diagnose problems and for system administration.  Business.com reserves the right to request any additional information necessary to establish and maintain your account for use of the Site. 
</p>

<p>
 	Business.com uses the information collected from you in accordance with this Privacy Policy.  Information we collect is used to customize your experience at our Site.  We also show you content that we think will be interesting to you, and display content according to the preferences you indicate while on our Site.  Business.com may use your information to send you promotional materials about Business.com and its partners.  We may also use your information to contact you, if necessary.  
</p>
<a name="wi"></a><b>2.	With whom your information may be shared.</b><br><br>

	<p>
	Business.com will not sell, rent or barter your personal information other than to its business partners as set forth herein.  However, we may from time to time aggregate statistical information regarding our customers, traffic patterns and site usage, or sell our research, which may contain aggregate information.  In addition, we may report aggregate information to our advertisers.  Such aggregate information will not individually identify any user.  
	</p>
<p>
	In order to provide you with co-branded services, and to improve our features, we will sometimes share your information with our partners.
</p>
<p>


	We reserve the right to disclose any information if such action is necessary (a) to conform to the requirements of the law or to comply with legal process or subpoena served on Business.com, (b) to protect and defend the legal rights or property of Business.com, the Site, or its users, or (c) in an emergency, to protect the health and safety of its users or the general public.   We further reserve the right to release any information concerning any user if that user participates (or is reasonably suspected of participating) in any illegal activity, even without a subpoena, warrant, or other court order.  We cooperate with law enforcement agencies in identifying those who may be using our servers or services for illegal activities.  We also reserve the right to report any suspected illegal activity to law enforcement for investigation or prosecution.

<a name="wc"></a><b>3. 	What choices you have regarding the collection, use and distribution of your information.</b><br><br>

	<p>
	You may occasionally receive information about the products or services you have selected to place on your personal Business.com pages, which may include Business.com products and services, and the products and services of our partners.
