                <h2 class="box_h2">Privacy Statement</h2>
               <p>This Privacy Policy discloses the privacy practices for the Business-Software.com site and various related services (together referred to as the "site"). Business-Software.com, the provider of the site (referred to as "us" or "we"), is committed to protecting your privacy online. Please read the information below to learn the following regarding your use of this site. </p>

<p>You acknowledge that this Privacy Policy is part of our Site Terms of Use, and by accessing or using our site, you agree to be bound by all of its terms and conditions. If you do not agree to these terms, please do not access or use this site.</p>

<p>We reserve the right to change this Privacy Policy at any time. Such changes, modifications, additions or deletions shall be effective immediately upon notice thereof by posting the revised Policy on this page. You acknowledge and agree that it is your responsibility to maintain a valid e-mail address as a registered user and to review this site and this Policy.   </p>

<p><strong>What information do we collect from you?</strong></p>

<p>In order to better provide you with our numerous services, we collect two types of information about our users: Personally Identifiable Information and Non-Personally Identifiable Information. Our primary goal in collecting information from you is to provide you with a smooth, efficient, and customized experience while using our site.</p>

<p>Personally Identifiable Information: This refers to information that lets us know who you are. When you engage in the activities on this site, such as requesting software trials or accessing evaluation tools, we will ask you to provide limited information about yourself by filling out and submitting an online registration form.   It is completely optional for you to engage in these activities. If you elect to engage in these activities, however, we will ask that you provide personal information, such as your first and last name, address, email address, name of company, job title, telephone number, and other personal identifying information.  The information we ask you to provide is mandatory and if you do not provide the mandatory data with respect to a particular activity, you will not be able to engage in that activity.  </p>

<p>Non-Personally Identifiable Information: This refers to information that does not by itself identify a specific individual. We gather certain information about you based upon where you visit on our site in several ways. This information is compiled and analyzed on both a personal and an aggregated basis. This information may include the Web site's Uniform Resource Locator ("URL") that you just came from, which URL you go to next, what browser you are using, and your Internet Protocol ("IP") address. An URL is the global address of documents and other resources on the World Wide Web. An IP address is an identifier for a computer or device on a Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol ("TCP/IP") network, such as the World Wide Web. Networks like the Web use the TCP/IP protocol to route information based on the IP address of the destination. In other words, an IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you are surfing the web, allowing web servers to locate and identify your computer. Computers require IP addresses in order for users to communicate on the Internet.  Even if you don't register at our site, we will still collect your Non-Personally Identifiable Information upon your visit to our site. 
</p>
<p><strong>Where do we collect information from you and how do we use it?</strong></p>

<p>We do not collect any Personally Identifiable Information about you unless you voluntarily provide it to us. You provide certain limited Personally Identifiable Information to us when you register to engage in activities provided on our site.  </p>

<p>In addition, we may also collect, or content server may collect, certain Non-Personally Identifiable Information. This information is ultimately stored in the form of store categories, and, in some cases, specific URLs. We use your IP address to diagnose problems with our servers, software, to administer our site and to gather demographic information. </p>

<p>We will also use Personally Identifiable Information to enhance the operation of our site, improve our marketing and promotional efforts, statistically analyze site use, improve our product and service offerings, and customize our site's content, layout, and services. We may use Personally Identifiable Information to deliver information to you and to contact you regarding administrative notices. We may also use Personally Identifiable Information to resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems and enforce our agreements with you, including our Site Terms of Use and this Private Policy. 
</p>
<p><strong>With whom do we share your information?</strong></p>

<p>If you choose to provide us your Personally Identifiable Information, we may share your Personal Identifiable Information for marketing purposes with our affiliates, partners and vendors.  The use of your Personally Identifiable Information may result in follow-up communications from those partners and vendors regarding their products or services.  For instance, upon receiving your request for software trial, we will forward your Personal Identifiable Information to the partner or vendor of your preference who will then follow up with you regarding your request.  The use of your Personally Identifiable Information by those partners and vendors is governed by the privacy policies of those partners and vendors and is not subject to our control.    Should you have any inquiries relating to the use of your information by those partners and vendors, you should contact them directly.</p>

<p>Occasionally we may be required by law enforcement or judicial authorities to provide Personally Identifiable Information to the appropriate governmental authorities. We will disclose Personally Identifiable Information upon receipt of a court order, subpoena, or to cooperate with a law enforcement investigation. We fully cooperate with law enforcement agencies in identifying those who use our services for illegal activities. We reserve the right to report to law enforcement agencies any activities that we in good faith believe to be unlawful.
</p>
<p>We may also provide Non-Personally Identifiable Information about our traffic patterns and related site information to third party advertisers, but these statistics do not include any Personally Identifiable Information. </p>

<p><strong>What are your choices regarding collection, use, and distribution of your information?</strong> </p>

<p>We may, from time to time, send you e-mail regarding our products and services.  If you do not want to receive such mailings, simply tell us when you give us your personal information. 
</p>
<p>You also have choices with respect to cookies, as described below. By modifying your browser preferences, you have the choice to accept all cookies, to be notified when a cookie is set, or to reject all cookies. If you choose to reject all cookies some parts of our site may not work properly in your case. </p>

<p><strong>What security precautions are in place to protect against the loss, misuse, or alteration of your information?</strong></p>

<p>At our site you can be assured that your Personally Identifiable Information is secure, consistent with current industry standards. We have implemented technology and security policies and procedures intended to reduce the risk of accidental destruction or loss, or the unauthorized disclosure of or access to, such information, reasonably appropriate to the level of the data concerned. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet or any wireless network can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your Personally Identifiable Information, you acknowledge that: (a) there are security and privacy limitations of the Internet which are beyond our control; (b) the security, integrity and privacy of any and all information and data exchanged between you and us through this site cannot be guaranteed; and (c) any such information and data may be viewed or tampered with in transit by a third party.  </p>

<p><strong>Do we use "cookies"?</strong>
</p>
<p>When you use our site we will store cookies on your computer in order to facilitate and customize your use of our site. A cookie is a small data text file, which a Web site stores on your computer's hard drive (if your Web browser permits) that can later be retrieved to identify you to us. Our cookies store randomly assigned user identification numbers, the country where you are located, and your first name to welcome you back to our site. The cookies make your use of the site easier, make the site run more smoothly and help us to maintain a secure site. You are always free to decline our cookies if your browser permits, but some parts of our site may not work properly in that case.</p>

<p>We may use an outside ad serving company to display banner advertisements on our site. As part of their service, they will place a separate cookie on your computer. We will not provide any third-party ad server with any of your Personally Identifiable Information or information about your purchases. We and our third party ad server will collect and use Non-Personally Identifiable Information about you, such as your IP address, browser type, the server your computer is logged onto, the area code and zip code associated with your server and whether you responded to a particular ad. Other advertisers may also place banner ads on our site in the same manner as above, but we will not disclose any Personally Identifiable Information to them. </p>

<p><strong>What should you know about privacy policies and data collection at any third party sites accessible from our site?</strong></p>

<p>Except as otherwise discussed in this Privacy Policy, this document only addresses the use and disclosure of information we collect from you. Other sites that may be accessible through our site have their own privacy policies and data collection, use and disclosure practices. Please consult each site's privacy policy. We are not responsible for the policies or practices of third parties. Additionally, other companies which place advertising on our site may collect information about you when you view or click on their advertising through the use of cookies. We cannot control this collection of information. You should contact these advertisers directly if you have any questions about their use of the information that they collect. </p>

<p><strong>What else should you know about your privacy online? </strong></p>

<p>You must be at least 18 years old to have our permission to use this site. Our policy is that we do not knowingly collect, use or disclose Personally Identifiable Information about visitors that are under 18 years of age.
</p>
<p>If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, the practices of this site, your dealings with this site, or your Personally Identifiable Information, or please send us e-mail to: privacy@Business-Software.com.</p>
