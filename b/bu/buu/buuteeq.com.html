												<p>In the registration process, we collect registration information from our users, including name, user name, and password, and contact information such as email and mailing address. Each of these different types of information is used to provide hotels and guests with access to a rich collection of on-line resources, including without limitation business web page hosting services, digital marketing services, on- and off-line advertising services, promotional pricing services, and the ability to contact merchants from whom hotels and guests seek services (collectively, the "Service"). Registration information is used to authenticate users and recall their profile pages, and contact information is used to provide information on Service updates.
<br>
<br>
In the operation of the Service, we collect and store hotel and guest information in order to provide communications and other services. This data is gathered from a variety of sources and enables us to prepare hotel pages, provide services to hotels and guests with minimal data entry, etc. buuteeq will continue to make your data available to you on the buuteeq platform as long as you are a user according to the terms and conditions of the buuteeq Terms of Service (as amended form time to time) (the "Terms of Service") and in some cases, as set forth in the Terms of Service, up to one hundred eighty (180) days after. Please consult the Terms of Service as well as this Privacy Policy to understand your rights and responsibilities as a user of the buuteeq platform.
<br>
<br>
Information such as your hotel name, screen name, full name, profile photo, and any personally identifiable information you have included in your reviews may be shown by users to their friends or other users primarily in conjunction with reviews or other content you have contributed. In addition, we may sell your reviews to third parties, in which case your provided information (e.g., screen name, first name and last initial, profile photo, city/state/neighborhood, and any personally identifiable information you have included in your reviews) may be shown to users of such third party web sites.
<br>
<br>
Your full name and email address may also be used when you send an email notification to a friend (such as in an invitation, or when sharing a review). We may also use your email address to send you updates or news regarding the buuteeq Site, but you may choose to not receive email of this type by accessing the "Account Settings" tab of the buuteeq Site and updating your notification settings. Additionally, we use your email address to contact you on behalf of your friends (such as when someone sends you a personal message).
<br>
<br>
You should be aware that when you voluntarily disclose personally identifiable information (e.g., user name, e-mail address) via reviews, messages, forums, postings, or in other areas of the buuteeq Site, that information, along with any substantive information disclosed in your communication, can be collected and correlated and used by third parties and may result in unsolicited messages from other posters or third parties.

<br>
<br>
If you would like to remove your information from the buuteeq Site, you can do so by deleting your account under "Account Settings."

												<p>We may share your personal or business information as described below:

Affiliated Businesses We Do Not Control: We anticipate that we may become affiliated with a variety of businesses and work closely with them. In certain situations, these businesses may operate stores at the buuteeq Site, sell items to you through the buuteeq Site or offer you products or services that may be of interest to you. In other situations, buuteeq may provide services, or sell products jointly with affiliated businesses. You can easily recognize when an affiliated business is associated with a particular opportunity or transaction, and we will share user information that is related to such opportunity or transaction with that affiliated business.

Agents: We employ other companies and people to perform tasks on our behalf and need to share your information with them to provide products or services to you. Examples include sending email, analyzing data, and providing user services. Without your permission, buuteeq's agents do not have any right to use personal information we share with them beyond what is necessary to assist us.

Business profiles: Business profile information including business name, address, phone number and email address is displayed to users publicly in connection with the Service. As part of the buuteeq Site and the Service, you will receive from buuteeq and other users and partners of buuteeq e-mail and other communication relating to your business and/or the products and services you offer.
<br>
<br>
Business Transfers: In some cases, we may choose to buy or sell assets. In these types of transactions, user information is typically one of the business assets that is transferred. Moreover, if buuteeq, or substantially all of its assets or capital stock were acquired, or in the event that buuteeq goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of buuteeq may continue to use your information as set forth in this Privacy Policy.
<br>
<br>
Protection of buuteeq and Others: We may release personal and business information when we believe in good faith that release is necessary to comply with law; enforce or apply our Terms of Service, Privacy Policy, and other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of buuteeq, our employees, our users, or others. This includes, without limitation, exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection.
<br>
<br>
With Your Consent: Except as set forth above, you will be notified when your personally identifiable individual information may be shared with third parties, and will be given the option to prevent the sharing of this information.

												<p>buuteeq may periodically conduct both business and individual customer surveys. We encourage our customers to participate in these surveys because they provide us with important information that helps us to improve the types of services we offer and how we provide them to you. Your personal information and responses will remain strictly confidential, even if a third party conducts the survey. Participation in our customer surveys is voluntary.
<br>
<br>
We take the information we receive from individuals responding to our customer surveys and aggregate it with the responses from other customers to create broader, generic responses to the survey questions (such as gender, age, residence, hobbies, education, employment, industry sector, or other demographic information). We then use the aggregated information to improve the quality of our services to you, and to develop new services and products. This aggregated, non-personally-identifying information may be shared with third parties.</p>

												<p>Like most websites, buuteeq and the buuteeq Site require cookies to function properly. Cookies are small text files that reside on a user's computer and identify you as a unique user. We use cookies to refine the buuteeq Site and simplify the user experience. For example, the use of cookies allows registered users to enter the buuteeq Site without explicitly typing in their email address and password every time. You should be aware that buuteeq cannot control the use of cookies by advertisers or any information advertisers may gather from their use of cookies. If you do not want information collected through the use of cookies, there is a simple procedure in most browsers that allows you to deny or accept the cookie feature; however, you should note that cookies may be necessary to provide you certain features (e.g., customized delivery of information) available on the buuteeq Site. For example, Google, as a third party vendor to buuteeq, uses cookies to serve advertisements on the buuteeq Site. Google?s use of its DART cookie enables it to serve ads to you and other buuteeq users based on your and other buuteeq?s users? visits to the buuteeq Site and other sites on the Internet. You may opt out of the use of the DART cookie by visiting the ad and content network privacy policy at http://www.doubleclick.com/privacy/index.aspx</p>

Firewalls and other security technologies are employed to prevent interference or access from outside intruders; however, buuteeq cannot guarantee the security of user account information.
