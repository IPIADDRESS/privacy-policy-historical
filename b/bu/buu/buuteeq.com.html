			<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

Whether you are a hotel owner or a potential or actual hotel guest, we want to keep offering you outstanding value so that you continue to use our services. We believe you should be able to share and collaborate on our platform in a secure hosted environment.</p>

<p>Because we want you to understand the collections and uses of data that are necessary and possible on the buuteeq platform, and to show our respect for your privacy, we have established this Privacy Policy. WE RESERVE THE RIGHT TO CHANGE THIS PRIVACY POLICY AND WILL PROVIDE NOTIFICATION OF ANY MATERIAL CHANGE OR AMENDMENT VIA A POSTING TO THE BUUTEEQ.COM WEBSITE (THE "BUUTEEQ SITE"). YOUR USE OF THE BUUTEEQ SITE INDICATES YOUR ASSENT TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY AND ANY SUBSEQUENT CHANGES OR AMENDMENTS HERETO. USE OF INFORMATION WE COLLECT NOW IS SUBJECT TO THE PRIVACY POLICY IN EFFECT AT THE TIME SUCH INFORMATION IS USED. YOU MAY CONTACT US WITH ANY QUESTIONS PERTAINING TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY AT INFO@BUUTEEQ.COM</p>

<p>For purposes of this Privacy Policy, the term "hotel" means a user of the buuteeq platform or the buuteeq Site. For purposes of this Privacy Policy, the term "guest" means a guest or potential guest on the buuteeq platform or buuteeq Site.</p>

<h2>Collected Information</h2>

<p>In the registration process, we collect registration information from our users, including name, user name, and password, and contact information such as email and mailing address. Each of these different types of information is used to provide hotels and guests with access to a rich collection of on-line resources, including without limitation business web page hosting services, digital marketing services, on- and off-line advertising services, promotional pricing services, and the ability to contact merchants from whom hotels and guests seek services (collectively, the "Service"). Registration information is used to authenticate users and recall their profile pages, and contact information is used to provide information on Service updates.</p>

<p>In the operation of the Service, we collect and store hotel and guest information in order to provide communications and other services. This data is gathered from a variety of sources and enables us to prepare hotel pages, provide services to hotels and guests with minimal data entry, etc. buuteeq will continue to make your data available to you on the buuteeq platform as long as you are a user according to the terms and conditions of the buuteeq Terms of Service (as amended form time to time) (the "Terms of Service") ? and in some cases, as set forth in the Terms of Service, up to one hundred eighty (180) days after. Please consult the Terms of Service as well as this Privacy Policy to understand your rights and responsibilities as a user of the buuteeq platform.</p>

<p>Information such as your hotel name, screen name, full name, profile photo, and any personally identifiable information you have included in your reviews may be shown by users to their friends or other users primarily in conjunction with reviews or other content you have contributed. In addition, we may sell your reviews to third parties, in which case your provided information (e.g., screen name, first name and last initial, profile photo, city/state/neighborhood, and any personally identifiable information you have included in your reviews) may be shown to users of such third party web sites.</p>

<p>Your full name and email address may also be used when you send an email notification to a friend (such as in an invitation, or when sharing a review). We may also use your email address to send you updates or news regarding the buuteeq Site, but you may choose to not receive email of this type by accessing the "Account Settings" tab of the buuteeq Site and updating your notification settings. Additionally, we use your email address to contact you on behalf of your friends (such as when someone sends you a personal message).</p>

<p>You should be aware that when you voluntarily disclose personally identifiable information (e.g., user name, e-mail address) via reviews, messages, forums, postings, or in other areas of the buuteeq Site, that information, along with any substantive information disclosed in your communication, can be collected and correlated and used by third parties and may result in unsolicited messages from other posters or third parties. Such activities are beyond the control of buuteeq. PLEASE DO NOT POST ON THE BUUTEEQ SITE OR ANY OTHER AREAS ANY PERSONAL INFORMATION THAT YOU EXPECT TO KEEP PRIVATE.</p>

<p>If you would like to remove your information from the buuteeq Site, you can do so by deleting your account under "Account Settings." If your information has been indexed by a search engine (e.g., Google.com), please note that it may take some time for such search engine to remove it from it index, and that such removal from the search engine is outside of buuteeq?s control.</p>

<p>buuteeq may also collect and analyze from visitors and users certain information regarding the use of the Service and the buuteeq Site activity. Information collected may include but is not limited to the buuteeq Site traffic volume, frequency of visits, type and time of transactions, type of browser and operating system, IP address, requested URL, referring URL, etc. This information is logged to help diagnose technical problems, administer the buuteeq Site, and improve the quality and types of Service delivered. In addition, we use this information to perform statistical analyses of user behavior and characteristics in order to measure interest in and use of the various areas of the buuteeq Site and to inform advertisers of such information as well as the number of users that have been exposed to, or clicked on, their advertising banners.</p>

<h2>Payments Transactions</h2>

<p>With respect to payments transactions you may enter into on the buuteeq Site, we do not store or retain any PIN data (i.e., personal identification numbers), AVS data (i.e., address verification data) or Card Validation Codes (i.e., the three (3) or four (4) digit codes on backs of credit cards). We do not store or retain magnetic stripe information or hard copies containing cardholder data after a payment transaction has been authorized. In making a payment transaction on the buuteeq Site, you agree to abide by the applicable terms of service and policies.</p>

<h2>Shared Information</h2>

<p>We may share your personal or business information as described below:</p>

<p>Affiliated Businesses We Do Not Control: We anticipate that we may become affiliated with a variety of businesses and work closely with them. In certain situations, these businesses may operate stores at the buuteeq Site, sell items to you through the buuteeq Site or offer you products or services that may be of interest to you. In other situations, buuteeq may provide services, or sell products jointly with affiliated businesses. You can easily recognize when an affiliated business is associated with a particular opportunity or transaction, and we will share user information that is related to such opportunity or transaction with that affiliated business.</p>

<p>Agents: We employ other companies and people to perform tasks on our behalf and need to share your information with them to provide products or services to you. Examples include sending email, analyzing data, and providing user services. Without your permission, buuteeq's agents do not have any right to use personal information we share with them beyond what is necessary to assist us.</p>

<p>Business profiles: Business profile information including business name, address, phone number and email address is displayed to users publicly in connection with the Service. As part of the buuteeq Site and the Service, you will receive from buuteeq and other users and partners of buuteeq e-mail and other communication relating to your business and/or the products and services you offer.</p>

<p>Business Transfers: In some cases, we may choose to buy or sell assets. In these types of transactions, user information is typically one of the business assets that is transferred. Moreover, if buuteeq, or substantially all of its assets or capital stock were acquired, or in the event that buuteeq goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of buuteeq may continue to use your information as set forth in this Privacy Policy.</p>

<p>Protection of buuteeq and Others: We may release personal and business information when we believe in good faith that release is necessary to comply with law; enforce or apply our Terms of Service, Privacy Policy, and other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of buuteeq, our employees, our users, or others. This includes, without limitation, exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection.</p>

<p>With Your Consent: Except as set forth above, you will be notified when your personally identifiable individual information may be shared with third parties, and will be given the option to prevent the sharing of this information.</p>

<h2>Customer Surveys, Marketing Communications, Etc.</h2>

<p>buuteeq may periodically conduct both business and individual customer surveys. We encourage our customers to participate in these surveys because they provide us with important information that helps us to improve the types of services we offer and how we provide them to you. Your personal information and responses will remain strictly confidential, even if a third party conducts the survey. Participation in our customer surveys is voluntary.</p>

<p>We take the information we receive from individuals responding to our customer surveys and aggregate it with the responses from other customers to create broader, generic responses to the survey questions (such as gender, age, residence, hobbies, education, employment, industry sector, or other demographic information). We then use the aggregated information to improve the quality of our services to you, and to develop new services and products. This aggregated, non-personally-identifying information may be shared with third parties.</p>
