<div class="standardParagraphInfo">Cookies: </div>
<div class="standardParagraph">
Our Web site uses cookies for the purpose of identifying you uniquely.
 This allows us to pre-populate your user name on the login page and to distinguish
 between your editing session and that of the many other people using our service. Cookies also
ensure that you view relevant ad banners on our Web site when you log in. Our web-based website editing system
will not function unless your browser is set to accept cookies.
</div>

<div class="standardParagraphInfo">Links:</div>
<div class="standardParagraph">
Be aware that when you click on ad banners, you may be redirected to other sites not operated by BuddyMarks.com.
You are responsible for information that you provide to these sites. We recommend that you review the privacy policy of any site that requests personal information.
** Note that this policy does not cover the privacy practices of these linked sites.
</div>

<div class="standardParagraphInfo">Tracking GIFs &amp; Servers:</div>
<div class="standardParagraph">
We use electronic images known as Tracking GIFs - sometimes called single-pixel GIFs, transparent GIFs, or clear gifs- that allow us to track general
user traffic patterns. BuddyMarks.com also automatically receives and records information from our servers and from your browser including your IP address, the
time, and information about the page you requested.</div>

<div class="standardParagraphInfo">General Information Collected:</div>
<div class="standardParagraph">
When visiting our site, some general information is collected including: IP address (your computer's unique signature) Operating
system (e.g., Windows 95) Browser software (e.g., Microsoft Internet Explorer, Netscape) Internet Service Provider (e.g., Earthlink, Verizon).
The information we collect is aggregated to reflect the population as a whole rather than focused on individuals. We use it to help us better
understand the people who visit mail.com. In addition, like many other sites with paid advertising, we disclose some of this aggregate information to
advertisers to inform them of the number of people who have seen and clicked on their advertisements.
</div>
<div class="standardParagraph">BuddyMarks.com reserves the right to modify all or
some of this Privacy Policy at any time without notice. If we change
our Privacy Policy, we will post a notice on our website so our users
are aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what
circumstances, if any, we disclose it. We will use information only in
accordance with the Privacy Policy under which the information was
collected unless we have received explicit authorization from the
appropriate user(s) to do otherwise. </div>
