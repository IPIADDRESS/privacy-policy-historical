<h3>THE USE OF COOKIES TECHNOLOGY</h3>

<p>A "cookie" is a small data file which is transferred to your computer’s hard drive. We use cookie technology to make your use of our Site and our Services more convenient and to support our internal business purposes.</p>

<p>Most web browsers are initially set up to accept cookies, but you can configure your browser to alert you every time a cookie is offered, letting you decide whether or not to accept it. You can also configure your browser to block all cookies from a specific domain or all domains. If you continue to use our Site and Services without disabling cookies we will assume that you are willing to accept all cookies from our Site.</p>

<p>You can, of course, use and visit our Site with cookies disabled, but you will not automatically be recognised by the Site upon re-visiting. We therefore recommend that you visit our Website using "Essential Cookies" as described below.</p>

<p><u>Essential Cookies</u></p>

<p>We use cookies to identify you when you visit our Sites e.g. we use session cookies to recall your e-mail address so you don’t have to re-enter this information each time you visit. Cookies allow us to tailor your unique user experience.</p>

<p>We may collect the following personal data through essential cookies: a unique ID assigned to your device; IP address; device and browser type; operating system; referring URLs; content viewed or other actions taken on our sites and apps; time and date of those actions; country and language selected.</p>

<p><u>Analytics Cookies</u></p>

<p>We use analytics cookies when we process your data and so we can manage and improve sites for monitoring, auditing, research and reporting purposes.</p>

<h3>The Use of Other Tracking Mechanisms</h3>

<p>Our Site may use technology such as web beacons, web bugs or clear GIFs to track and analyse non-personally identifiable usage information and to compile statistical information about our Users (e.g. their IP address, browser type, internet service provider etc.) in order to improve the Site's quality and to support our business.</p>

<p>You should note that We also use HTML5 localStorage technology to enhance your user experience. This technology operates in the same fashion as cookies technology and therefore we will use this mechanism to collect and store information as well as configure your experience in the same ways outlined above.</p>

<h3>The Use of Information We Collect</h3>

<p>We will use your Personal Information to help cater and deliver to you a unique User experience. We may use your information in the following ways:</p>

<ul class="list-privacy">

	<li>to improve our Services;</li>
	<li>to provide you with the most user-friendly online experience;</li>
	<li>to use IP addresses and device identifiers to: identify the location of users, block disruptive use, establish the number of visits from different countries and other statistical purposes;</li>
</ul>

<h3>THE USE OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION</h3>

<p>We will use your Personal Information for our internal business purposes e.g. to:</p>

<ul class="list-privacy">
	<li>monitor, develop and improve the Services and/or your experience based on a monitoring of your preferences and behaviours;</li>
	<li>administer the provision of your Services;</li>

</ul>

<h3>The Collection, Use and Handling of Children’s Information</h3>

<p>In accordance with our Terms and Conditions, only individuals 18 years and over may use our Site and Services. If you are aware or become aware of any person under the age of 18 using our Services, please contact us immediately and, unless permission is obtained from their parent and/or guardian and/or the bill payer, we will take steps to delete their account and all Personal Information. We are committed to protecting children's privacy on the Internet and we comply fully with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA).</p>

<p>Where appropriate, we will instruct children not to provide such information to us. If a parent becomes aware that a child has provided us with Personal Information, we ask that the parent or legal guardian of the child contact us by visiting www.buddyplay.net, selecting 'Contact Us'</p>

<h3>Marketing Messages</h3>

<p>Generally, we will only send you marketing e-mails if you consent to us doing so.

<p><u>Sharing with Third Party Providers:</u> We may need to use third party service providers to provide the best possible Services to you. At times, we may need to employ external vendors, service providers and suppliers to assist us with e.g. processing credit card payments, fraud scoring and prevention, debt collection and telecommunications. These third parties may need access to your Personal Information as is reasonably necessary to perform their obligations; they are not permitted to use your Personal Information for any other reason.</p>

<p><u>Sharing with Affiliate Companies:</u> Where you permit us to, We, our affiliates and subsidiaries (where We have granted permission) may disclose to their affiliates and business partners certain Personal Information and other details of the use of our Services so our partners can send you their own Direct Marketing communications.

<p><u>Cleaned Data.</u> Periodically, we take steps to "clean" Personal Information provided to us, e.g. we may remove information which can be used to identify individuals anonymising, pseudonymising, summarising, aggregating or removing certain data elements. The resulting cleaned data is no longer considered personal information and is not subject to this Privacy Policy. The cleaned data may be provided to various third parties as necessary to provide you with our Services.</p>

<p><u>Business Restructuring:</u> If We undergo a reorganisation or restructuring we may need to share your Personal Information within our group of companies so we can continue to deliver our Services to you without interruption. We may also share your information to a third party if we participate in a merger, acquisition, reorganisation, restructure or other sale of some or all of our assets.</p>

<p>You should however note that if, due to a reorganisation or restructure, we become subject to a new owner, your information may be subject to the new owner’s policy. In these circumstances, you will be notified by e-mail or through an update of this Policy prior to the change.</p>

<p><u>Legal Necessity:</u> Where permitted or required by any law or regulation we may collect, use or disclose your Personal Information or other information without your consent, e.g. in response to a court order or subpoena or to comply with a legally permitted inquiry by a government agency.</p>

<p>We may also share your information to detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security, or technical issues.</p>

<p>Be assured that, whilst we may share your information as indicated above, your Personal Information and other information will remain subject to and will be governed by this Policy at all times.</p>

So, keep in mind that when you give us Personal Information it could be transferred, stored or processed in a location outside the EEA or EU.</p>

<h3>Transfer of Data</h3>

<p>We maintain servers in various locations worldwide and therefore your information may be processed in a jurisdiction different from the one in which you live. We comply with data protection laws in all applicable jurisdictions and provide equal protections to all information.</p>

<h3>Retention of Your Information</h3>

<p>Any Personal Information given to us will only be held for as long as legally required or permitted and in accordance with the following measures. We will only retain your Personal Information for as long as necessary for us to provide you with our Services or have a legitimate reason to keep it.</p>
