<h2 class="line">Privacy statement</h2>
<h3>Privacy statement</h3>
<br>
<h3>1.1 General</h3>
<p>Careful treatment of your personal data is very important both to you and BudgetAir.co.uk. All information you provide us with shall be treated with the greatest of care. Your personal details will only be used in the way described in this privacy statement.</p>
<h3>1.2 Disclosure of personal details to third parties</h3>
<p>BudgetAir.co.uk will not disclose any personal information to third parties, unless this is required for performing services or required by legal provisions. Our suppliers are increasingly required to provide various local authorities, such as the customs and immigration authorities with personal data and travel details of their customers. This is, for instance, required by airline companies and if you travel to or via the United States or Canada. Disclosure of this information is for your own safety. Although BudgetAir.co.uk is required to provide your personal details to the supplier, the necessity stated above is a responsibility and activity of the supplier. If you have any objection to this, you should report this prior to confirming your booking. BudgetAir.co.uk reserves the right to provide details to the competent authorities, in the event of fraud or misuse of means of payment, or in the event that a user intentionally causes damage through the use of our website.</p>
<h3>1.3 Use of our website</h3>
<p>Our website can be consulted anonymously. Only when you order products, book a trip, want to request the newsletter or wish to contact us by email form, we ask you to enter relevant personal details.</p>
<h3>1.4 Profile</h3>
<p>Our website can save your profile which is secured by a login name and password. A profile offers you extra convenience when making a booking. You should keep your login name and password confidential and not disclose these to third parties to prevent others from accessing your personal details.</p>
<h3>1.5 Newsletter</h3>
<p>If you wish to be regularly informed about our special offers or promotional activities, you can subscribe to our newsletter. You can do this by sending us your email address and possibly your name and gender via this site. Next, you will receive an email asking you to confirm that you agree to the use of your personal details for sending you the newsletter. If you no longer wish to receive the newsletter, you can cancel your newsletter subscription at any time.</p>
<h3>1.6 What details do we collect?</h3>
<p>In order to guarantee the correct execution of the trip you have booked, we ask you to enter both your personal details and the details of your travel companions. By disclosing the details of your travel companions, you confirm that you are authorised in your capacity as booking client to do so.</p>
<p>We may collect the following data:</p>
<ul>
<li>* your full name as per your passport, including gender, initials, full first name, middle name and surname.</li>
<li>* your address, postcode, city, country. You may provide a different invoice or shipping address for travel documents;</li>
<li>* your phone number, fax number, mobile phone number, phone number for the people at home in case of emergency just before or during your trip;</li>
<li>* your email address;</li>
<li>* additional personal health information insofar as provided voluntarily and necessary for correct proceeding of your trip;</li>
<li>* additional personal preferences insofar as provided voluntarily and necessary for a correct proceeding of your trip;</li>
<li>* customer account numbers of third parties (such as a frequent flyer number) or of suppliers, allowing you to qualify for privileges or other benefits attached to this;</li>
<li>* your computer's IP address, to prevent misuse and fraud.</li>
</ul>
