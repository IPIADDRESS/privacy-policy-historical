          As a valued Budget Travel customer, your personal privacy is very important to us. We take 
          great care with personal information that is provided to us on-line, taking steps to keep 
          it secure and to ensure it is used only for legitimate purposes. By using the Budget Travel 
          website, you accept the practices described in this privacy policy. We may update our privacy 
          policy from time to time to take account of changing requirements such as changes in technology 
          or legislation and we request that you refer back to this privacy policy frequently to become 
          aware of any such revisions. In addition we recommend that you review the private policy of any 
          other website accessed through the Budget travel website as these sites may be subject to different 
          privacy practices. Budget Travel Limited shall not be responsible for these websites or the 
          information made available thereon.</p>
          
          <h4 class="subheading2">Use of Customer Information</h4>
          
          <p class="text">Your information is collected when you request information from us, 
          contact us or make a booking with us. We will up-date your information whenever we 
          get the opportunity to keep it current, accurate and complete.</p>
          
          <p class="text">Any information obtained via this website or any other website controlled 
          by Budget Travel Limited will be used by Budget Travel Limited to identify you as a customer, 
          to process your booking, to verify credit or other charge card details and to deliver relevant 
          information to you in connection with your travel and any other ancillary services which you 
          may wish to avail of. For these purposes, we may transit your personal information to our 
          own offices, authorized agents, other carriers and services providers, credit and charge 
          card companies and data processing companies working on our behalf. Your personal information 
          and any records relating to your travel will also be retained for audit functions. We ask for 
          your telephone number so that we can contact your urgently if there is a problem with 
          your reservation.</p>
          
          <p class="text">We may use the information collected by us to notify you about new Budget 
          Travel services, important operational changes and special offers that we think you 
          will find valuable.</p>
          
          <p class="text">Some of your information may be considered sensitive personal data 
          under the EU Data Protection Directive, for example information relating to health. 
          Should this arise, we will require you to consent to the use of such information. 
          We will endeavor to draw your attention to this if it applies, when you first 
          supply us with your information.</p>
          
          <h4 class="subheading2">Direct Marketing Material</h4>
          
          <p class="text">If you do not want to receive any marketing material from us, you may 
          indicate this us when making your booking on our website. If you change your mind you 
          should inform us in writing.</p>
          
          <h4 class="subheading2">Use of "Cookies" and Links to Other Websites</h4>
          
          <p class="text">If our contract and dealing with you is via our website, we may use "cookies", 
          which is a small piece of data sent from our web server to your computer and stored in a text 
          file on your hard drive. Cookies allow us to identify your computer but not you personally. 
          You can set your web browser to refuse cookies. We use cookies to measure site usage and related 
          information. If you are making a purchase, we may also use cookies to keep track of the transaction 
          from one web page to another.</p>
          
          <p class="text">Our website may contain links to other websites not controlled by us. These sites 
          may send you cookies and collect data and personal information. We are not responsible for the 
          actions, content or the privacy policies of those websites to which our website may link.</p>
          
          <h4 class="subheading2">Confidentiality and Security of Personal Information</h4>
          <p class="text">When you book a holiday on-line, we offer the use of secure software that 
          encrypts all information you input before it is sent to us. The use of Secure Socket Layer 
          (SSL) Technology means that all personal information, such as your credit card number will be 
          encrypted as it travels from your computer to the Budget Travel on-line booking engine. When 
          received, the information is decrypted and processed in the same way as a normal credit card 
          transaction by telephone. If your browser supports SSL, and if you entered our site via our 
          secure server access, then transmission of any sensitive data would be protected.</p>
          
          <p class="text">If your browser does not support SSL we recommend that you upgrade to the 
          latest version of any browser to enhance the security of further transactions, otherwise 
          transmission of your personal data may not be protected and Budget Travel disclaims any 
          responsibility in this regard. We have taken all reasonable steps to have in place 
          appropriate security measures to protect your information.</p>
          
          <h4 class="subheading2">Making Corrections and Contacting Us</h4>
          <p class="text">If you need to alter your details for any reason you may do so by writing 
          to the Marketing Department at 134 Lwr Baggot Street, Dublin 2.</p>
          
          <p class="text">You may withdraw your consent to the use of your personal information for 
          any purposes, other than the fulfillment of a booking, by writing to us at the above address.</p>
