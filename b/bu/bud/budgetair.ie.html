<h3>1.2 Disclosure of personal details to third parties</h3>
<p>budgetair.ie will not disclose any personal information to third parties, unless this is required for performing services or required by legal provisions.

Although budgetair.ie is required to provide your personal details to the supplier, the necessity stated above is a responsibility and activity of the supplier. If you have any objection to this, you should report this prior to confirming your booking. budgetair.ie reserves the right to provide details to the competent authorities, in the event of fraud or misuse of means of payment, or in the event that a user intentionally causes damage through the use of our website.</p>
