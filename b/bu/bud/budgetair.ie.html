            <p><b>BOOKING ON-LINE</b></p>
            <p>As a valued BudgetAir customer, your personal privacy is very important 
              to us. We take great care with personal information that is provided 
              to us on-line, taking steps to keep it secure and to ensure it is 
              used only for legitimate purposes. By using the Budgetair website, 
              you accept the practices described in this privacy policy. We may 
              update our privacy policy from time to time to take account of changing 
              requirements such as changes in technology or legislation and we 
              request that you refer back to this privacy policy frequently to 
              become aware of any such revisions. In addition we recommend that 
              you review the private policy of any other website accessed through 
              the Budgetair website as these sites may be subject to different 
              privacy practices. Budget Travel Limited shall not be responsible 
              for these websites or the information made available thereon.</p>
            <p><b>USE OF CUSTOMER INFORMATION</b></p>
            <p>Your information is collected when you request information from 
              us, contact us or make a booking with us. We will up-date your information 
              whenever we get the opportunity to keep it current, accurate and 
              complete.</p>
            <p>Any information obtained via this website or any other website 
              controlled by Budget Travel Limited will be used by Budget Travel 
              Limited to identify you as a customer, to process your booking, 
              to verify credit or other charge card details and to deliver relevant 
              information to you in connection with your travel and any other 
              ancillary services which you may wish to avail of. For these purposes, 
              we may transit your personal information to our own offices, authorized 
              agents, other carriers and services providers, credit and charge 
              card companies and data processing companies working on our behalf. 
              Your personal information and any records relating to your travel 
              will also be retained for audit functions. We ask for your telephone 
              number so that we can contact you urgently if there is a problem 
              with your reservation.<br>
              We may use the information collected by us to notify you about new 
              Budgetair services, important operational changes and special offers 
              that we think you will find valuable.</p>
            <p>Some of your information may be considered sensitive personal data 
              under the EU Data Protection Directive, for example information 
              relating to health. Should this arise, we will require you to consent 
              to the use of such information. We will endeavor to draw your attention 
              to this if it applies, when you first supply us with your information.</p>
            <p><b>DIRECT MARKETING MATERIAL</b></p>
            <p>If you do not want to receive any marketing material from us, you 
              may indicate this us when making your booking on our website. If 
              you change your mind you should inform us in writing.</p>
            <p><b>USE OF "COOKIES" AND LINKS TO OTHER WEBSITES</b></p>
            <p>If our contract and dealing with you is via our website, we may 
              use "cookies", which is a small piece of data sent from 
              our web server to your computer and stored in a text file on your 
              hard drive. Cookies allow us to identify your computer but not you 
              personally. You can set your web browser to refuse cookies. We use 
              cookies to measure site usage and related information. If you are 
              making a purchase, we may also use cookies to keep track of the 
              transaction from one web page to another.</p>
            <p>Our website may contain links to other websites not controlled 
              by us. These sites may send you cookies and collect data and personal 
              information. We are not responsible for the actions, content or 
              the privacy policies of those websites to which our website may 
              link.<br>
            </p>
            <p><b>CONFIDENTIALITY AND SECURITY OF PERSONAL INFORMATION</b></p>
            <p>When you book a holiday on-line, we offer the use of secure software 
              that encrypts all information you input before it is sent to us. 
              The use of Secure Socket Layer (SSL) Technology means that all personal 
              information, such as your credit card number will be encrypted as 
              it travels from your computer to the Budgetair on-line booking engine. 
              When received, the information is decrypted and processed in the 
              same way as a normal credit card transaction by telephone. If your 
              browser supports SSL, and if you entered our site via our secure 
              server access, then transmission of any sensitive data would be 
              protected.</p>
            <p>If your browser does not support SSL we recommend that you upgrade 
              to the latest version of any browser to enhance the security of 
              further transactions, otherwise transmission of your personal data 
              may not be protected and Budget Travel disclaims any responsibility 
              in this regard. We have taken all reasonable steps to have in place 
              appropriate security measures to protect your information.<br>
            </p>

              for any purposes, other than the fulfillment of a booking, by sending
