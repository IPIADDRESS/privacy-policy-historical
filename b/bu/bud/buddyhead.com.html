<p><strong>Personal Information Collected Automatically:</strong><br>
We receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact with our Website or services. Buddyhead automatically receives and records information on our server logs from your browser including your IP address, Buddyhead cookie information, the page you requested, and the media you have consumed (e.g., viewed, played, downloaded, uploaded, and shared).<br>
Generally, our service automatically collects usage information, such as the numbers and frequency of visitors to our site and its components, similar to TV ratings that indicate how many people watched a particular show. This type of data enables us to figure out how often customers use parts of the Website or services so that we can make the Website appealing to as many customers as possible, and improve those services. As part of this use of information, (i) we may provide information to the content owners that relates to their fans (e.g., regarding which fans are consuming and sharing what pieces of media at what levels), and (ii) we may provide aggregate information to our partners about how our customers, collectively, use our site (e.g., we share this type of statistical data so that our partners also understand how often people use their services and our Website, so that they, too, may provide you with an optimal online experience).</p>
<p><strong>Communications:</strong><br>
Buddyhead is a retailer of Buddyhead Record’s artists and third party artists music, video and multimedia content.&nbsp; Buddyhead markets media directly to users of the site through e-mails, sms, phone/voicemail and other forms of communication. We often receive a confirmation when you access a message from your Buddyhead or other device. Buddyhead uses this confirmation to improve the effectiveness of the marketing. If you do not want to receive such communication from us, please choose the appropriate setting in the account management area of the Website to not receive correspondence from the Buddyhead directly or from the Buddyhead on behalf of the artist.</p>
