<div id="collectedInfo"><span style="color:#444444;font-weight:bold;">The information we collect </span><br>
<br>
<span style="text-decoration:underline;color:#444444;">From you. </span> <span style="color:#444444;">We receive and store information that you submit on our website or give us in other ways (such as via telephone or through the mail).  This consists of information that can identify you ("personal information"), including your first and last name, date of birth, telephone number, postal and email addresses, fax number, and billing information (such as credit card number, cardholder name, and expiration date).  We may also request information about your travel plans, style, and preferences (such as meal requests, seat selection, frequent flyer/hotel/car rental program information, and flight class, luggage, and ticketing options) as well as your entertainment interests (such as tour itineraries, performance and activity interests, and venue preferences).  You can choose not to provide information to us, but generally this information is necessary for you to register as a user, make bookings for travel or entertainment, complete a profile, receive updates of flight delays or schedule changes, post reviews, contribute to a discussion forum, participate in a survey, contest, or sweepstakes, ask us a question, or initiate other transactions on our website.  If you decline to supply or provide us with information while using our website, you may not be able to use or participate in some or all of its features.</span>
<br> <br>
<span style="text-decoration:underline;color:#444444;">About Travel Companions. </span><span style="color:#444444;">When you make a reservation on behalf of one or more travel or activity companions using our website, we will request personal information as well as interests, styles and preferences for each of those individuals.  You should obtain the consent of those individuals prior to submitting such information, as access to view or change their information will be available only through your account.</span>
<br><br>
<span style="text-decoration:underline;color:#444444;">As May Be Required By Law. </span> <span style="color:#444444;">Under the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) Secure Flight program, most air passengers are now required to provide their full name, date of birth, and gender (plus redress number, when applicable).  Secure Flight is a federally mandated program administered by the TSA. The privacy notice of the TSA is as follows:</span>
<br><br>
<em style="color:#444444;">The Transportation Security Administration of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security requires aircraft operators to collect information from you for purposes of watch list screening, under the authority of 49 U.S.C. section 114, and the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004. Providing this information is voluntary; however, if it is not provided, you may be subject to additional screening or denied transport or authorization to enter a sterile area. TSA may share information you provide with law enforcement or intelligence agencies or others under its published system of records notice. For more on TSA Privacy policies, or to view the system of records notice and the privacy impact assessment, please see TSA's Web site at <span style="color:#444444;font-weight:bold;"><a href="http://www.tsa.gov/">www.tsa.gov</a></span>.</em><br>
<br>
<span style="text-decoration:underline;color:#444444;">From Other Sources. </span> <span style="color:#444444;">From time to time we may also obtain both personal and non-personal information about you from our affiliated entities, business partners or other third party sources and add it to our account information about you.  Examples of such information include updated address information, purchase history, and demographic data.  In addition, if you sign up for BudgetAir.com using your social media account, link your BudgetAir.com account to your social media account, or use certain other BudgetAir.com social media features, we may access information about you through that social media provider, subject to that provider's policies. The information may include your name, email address, profile picture, gender, list of friends, and other information that you authorize us to receive. Depending on the privacy settings of you and your friends, we may access information that you provide to a social media provider regarding your respective locations ("Location Data") or "likes" in order to provide you with relevant content.  Note that your Location Data may also be shared with your friends on a social media provider, subject to your privacy settings with that social media provider.</span>
<br><br>
<span style="text-decoration:underline;color:#444444;">Automatic Information. </span> <span style="color:#444444;">We automatically collect certain information about your computer when you visit our website.  For example, we record your IP address, Web browser software (such as Firefox, Safari, or Internet Explorer), and referring website. We also may gather information about your online activity, such as trips or activities viewed and bookings made.  We collect this automatic information to customize your user experience and protect against fraud.

<br>
<span style="text-decoration:underline;color:#444444;">In General. </span><span style="color:#444444;"> We use sensitive billing information about you (such as cardholder name, credit card number, and expiration date) to complete travel-related or other bookings you make.  We use other information about you for general purposes, such as providing you with products and services you request; providing you with booking confirmations and updates; managing your account, including processing bills; communicating with you in general; responding to your questions and comments; assessing interest in and improving our products, services, and website; advising you about special offers, products or services that may be of interest to you; customizing your experience with our website; rewarding you as part of a reward and recognition program you may belong to; soliciting information from you, including through surveys;enabling us to publish your reviews, forum posts, and other content within the BudgetAir.com community; resolving disputes, collecting fees, or troubleshooting problems; preventing potentially prohibited or illegal activities; enforcing our Terms of Use; and as otherwise may be described to you at the time the information is collected.</span>
<br><br>
<span style="text-decoration:underline;color:#444444;">Email Communications.  </span><span style="color:#444444;">From time to time, we may send you emails containing information about your apparent travel-related or activity interests.  We do this to make it easy for you to take advantage of travel-related or other opportunities on our website.  For example, if you search for a flight to Paris on our website and have saved your itinerary or otherwise not yet booked your travel, we may send you an email to remind you about your saved itinerary or let you know about a special airfare to Paris.  Similarly, if we send you an email about Paris travel and you show interest in Paris hotels by clicking on a link about Paris hotels in the email, we may send you an email containing special hotel offers in Paris or other destination information such as tours and local entertainment.  We hope such emails provide valuable information to you about travel-related or other special offers available on our website.  Note, however, that you may choose not to receive these emails.

<span style="color:#444444;">Cookies are small data text files that are stored on your computer's hard drive (if your Web browser permits).  BudgetAir.com uses cookies for the following general purposes:
<br><br>
To help us recognize your browser as a previous visitor and save and remember any preferences you may have set while your browser was visiting our website. For example, if you create an account on our website, we may use cookies to remember your account information so you do not need to log into our website each time you visit.  We also may record your password in a cookie, if you check the box entitled "Sign me in automatically next time."  Note that for security purposes we encrypt all account-related data included in such cookies.  Cookies will not contain any personal information unless you have created an account with us.</span>
<br><br>
<span style="color:#444444;">To help us customize the content and advertisements provided to you on this website and on other websites across the Internet.  For example, when you access a page on our website, a cookie is automatically set by us, our service providers (such as Google), or our partners to recognize your browser as you navigate the Internet and to present you with information and advertising based on your apparent interests. See <a href="#displayAdvertising" style="color:#5e5e5e;"><span style="color:#444444;font-weight:bold;">Display of tailored advertising and your choices</span></a> for more information about our online advertising practices and your choices.
