            You must not provide us with your personal information if you are not of legal age
            to purchase alcohol in the jurisdiction in which you reside and (if different) in
            the jurisdiction in which you are accessing the site. We do not intend to collect
            personal information from any individuals under the legal purchase age or market
            alcoholic beverages to anyone under the legal purchase age. If we receive notice
            or believe that someone under the legal purchase age has provided us with personal
            information we will make every reasonable effort to remove such personal information
            from our files or flag such personal information and, to the extent permitted by
            law, retain it for the sole purpose of ensuring that it is not used any further.</p>
        <h2>
            3. What is personal information?</h2>
        <p>

            4. Collecting personal information</h2>
        <p>
            It is your choice to provide us with personal information. We will only collect
            personal information that you choose to provide. In certain instances, we may provide
            you with the option to select whether you would like to receive information from
            us or from trusted third parties (for example, by choosing to opt-in or opt-out
            of receiving special promotional offers). In some circumstances, you will not have
            the option to opt-out, such as when we are satisfying the obligations of a contract
            with you, administering a transaction requested by you, or as required by law.
        </p>
        <p>
            You may choose to provide us with personal information if, for example, you: contact
            us with an enquiry; register on the site; forward an item to a friend; purchase
            an item; fill out a survey or other form with your personal information included;
            request us to provide you with information; enter a competition; post information

        <p>
            By providing any personal information to us, you fully understand and clearly consent
            to the transfer of such personal information to, and the collection and processing
            of such information in, other countries or territories. Any such transfer and processing
            by us will be in accordance with this Privacy Statement.

            5. Use of cookies on our websites</h2>
        <p>
            In common with many websites, we use "cookies" to help us gather and store information
            about visitors to our websites. A cookie is a small data file that our server sends
            to your browser when you visit the site. The use of cookies helps us to assist your

                        </li><li>Anonymous tracking of interaction with online advertising, e.g., to monitor the
                            number of times that a banner ad is displayed and the number of times it is clicked.
                            </li><li>To compile and report to third parties (such as advertisers) aggregate statistics
                                about our users in terms of numbers, traffic patterns and related site information.

        </ol>
        <p>
            We may also use clear gifs (also known as web bugs or web beacons), which are tiny
            graphics embedded in web pages and email messages that we use, in connection with
            cookies, to collect non-personal information from users to analyze site usage, manage
            content on the site, track visits to other related sites, and track the performance
            of online advertising.
        </p>

            with other personal information that you provide to us in order to:</p>
        <ol>

                greet you on the site by name;
                </li><li>conduct transactions, such as credit card sales; and
                    </li><li>monitor your use of our website(s) in order to make our communications to you as
                        relevant as possible and for other marketing and advertising research purposes.
                    </li>

            11. Portfolio permissions</h2>
        <p>
            If you have given permission to receive communications about Diageo brands generally
            (for example, by opting to receive news and special offers by email about Diageo’s
            other great alcohol brands) you may from time to time receive communications about
            brands to which you have not opted-in specifically. Information about many of Diageo’s
            brands can be found at <a href="http://www.diageobrands.com" target="_blank">www.diageobrands.com</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            We may occasionally send you communications about brands not featured on www.diageobrands.com
            (e.g. new brands). We recommend that you refer to <a href="http://www.diageobrands.com" target="_blank">www.diageobrands.com</a> from time to time as the list of brands
            featured will be updated periodically.</p>
        <p>
            Providing general permission for us to communicate with you about our brands does
            not mean that you will receive communications about all Diageo’s brands. We
            will only communicate with you about those brands that we think may be of particular
            interest to you. Any such communications will provide you with an opportunity to
            unsubscribe from the brand in question and/or from all communications about Diageo
            brands.</p>
