The TRUSTe program covers only information that is collected through this Web site, and does not cover information that may be collected through software downloaded from the site.<br><br>BullGuard takes privacy issues very seriously. When you visit our Web site we want it to be completely transparent which personal data are collected and kept by BullGuard and our partners, and the choices you have to correct or avoid providing these data. Certain services, such as online payments, can only be performed with a transfer of personal details, whilst other details are collected to map the choices of our customers, in order to improve the BullGuard products and Web site. The important part is that you have to make an informed choice as to which data you wish to provide. The text below sets out what kind of data we collect, how we collect it, how we keep it, with whom we share it, how you can change it and how you can avoid providing it. Your trust is very important to us. <br><br>The information that we collect helps us personalise and continually improve your experience with BullGuard. This Privacy Statement describes BullGuard's approach to privacy and how we collect and use any personal information about you. This will enable you to make choices as to whether you wish to supply such information. <br><br>This Privacy Statement is subject to changes. Any changes in our privacy policy or practices regarding personally identifiable information will be posted on this Web site 30 days before they take effect. <br><br><strong>The information we collect and how we collect it</strong><br>We store all the information you enter on our Web site to customise services for you, improve our Web site, and communicate with you in regards to special offers, bonuses, sales and related marketing information and activities. <br><br>If you do not wish to receive information from BullGuard you can always indicate this in your account settings at:<a href="https://www.bullguard.com/login.aspx">https://www.bullguard.com/login.aspx</a> <br><br>You can also choose not to receive information from BullGuard by using the function "Unsubscribe" in the case of the Newsletter or the "Do not show this again" function in the application windows. <br><br>Personal information is requested when you place an order, request a service, correspond with us or use the services offered on our Web site. These are the categories of data we request: Name, mailing address, e-mail address, phone number and credit card details. If you choose to use our referral service to tell a friend about our site, we will ask you for your friend's name and email address. We will automatically send your friend a one-time email inviting him or her to visit the site. BullGuard stores this information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email and tracking the success of our referral programme. <br><br>Your friend may contact us at support@bullguard.com to request that we remove this information from our database.<br><br><strong>Cookies</strong><br>Cookies are small pieces of information that our Web sites provide to your browser when you visit our sites. We use these cookies to track which parts of our Web site you prefer and which particular services you have taken an interest in. We do not link the information we store in cookies to any personally identifiable information you submit while on our site. You can set your browser to reject cookies or notify you if a web site tries to place a cookie in your browser. Rejecting cookies may affect your ability to access some of our services. Consult the "Help" function in your browser to learn about your cookie preferences.<br><br><strong>Web beacons</strong><br>Web beacons are invisible graphical images also known as single pixel GIFs. We use web beacons to assess which pages users access. For example: we often receive a confirmation when you open e-mails from any of our online services. We don't, however, link the information provided by web beacons to any personally identifiable information you submit whilst on our site. You can also set your browser not to display images. Using this setting may affect your ability to access some of our services. Consult the "Help" function in your browser to learn about displaying images. <br><br><strong>Website statistics</strong><br>While you visit the BullGuard Web site, we use your IP address to track your activity and log your browser type, which pages you view, how you got to our Web site and any links you use to leave our site. At no point is this correlated with any personal information. These patterns provide us with useful information as to what you as a customer expect from our site and how we can improve content and navigational tools. It is important to emphasise that we do not track you once you leave the BullGuard Web site.<br><br>We take advantage of the third-party tracking services provided by Index Tools, who use cookies to track non-personally identifiable information about visitors to our site. As part of this process, the type of operating system used, screen settings and IP addresses are captured to provide volume statistics and track the success of our marketing and public information programmes.<br><br><strong>What we do with the information</strong><br>Information about our customers is an important part of our business, and we do not sell or lease it to external parties. We share customer information only with companies acting as agents on behalf of BullGuard, such as credit card and online payment companies. Such companies only have access to information needed to verify the validity of the means of payment and are contractually limited in how they use the data. We do not share, sell, trade, or rent your personal information to third parties for their promotional use.<br><br>As we continue to develop our business, we may sell or buy other companies or entities. In such transactions, customer information is generally one of the transferred business assets. In the event that BullGuard or substantially all of its assets are acquired, customer information may be one of the transferred assets. Any such change in ownership will be displayed on this website and communicated directly to users who have submitted their e-mail address to us.<br><br>We release account and other personal information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with law; enforce or apply our Conditions of Use and other agreements, or protect the rights, property, or safety of BullGuard, our users, or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction.<br><br><strong>The security of your information</strong><br>Only the online payment provider has access to the entire credit card number during order processing. BullGuard has access to the last four digits so we can offer you services such as automatic renewal of subscriptions and remind you if your card has expired. During the order processing you will be directed onto pages hosted by the online payment provider, whilst providing your payment information. These pages maintain the look and feel of pages hosted by BullGuard, but identifies the online payment provider in the url. We use Secure Socket Layer (SSL) software to encrypt the information you input. We maintain electronic, procedural and physical safeguards in connection with the collection, storage and disclosure of any personally identifiable information. These procedures entail that we may request proof of identity before we disclose any personal information to you.<br><br><strong>How you can change your information</strong><br>&nbsp;</p><p align="justify">You can update or change your personal information by: </p><p align="justify"><br>- accessing your user account at <a href="https://www.bullguard.com/login.aspx">https://www.bullguard.com/login.aspx</a>&nbsp;</p><p align="justify">- through the feedback form at <a href="/feedback.aspx">/feedback.aspx</a>&nbsp;</p><p align="justify">- by email to <a href="mailto:support@bullguard.com">support@bullguard.com</a><br>- by regular mail to the following address: </p><p align="justify">&nbsp;</p><p align="justify">&nbsp; <strong>BullGuard Ltd.<br></strong>&nbsp; Customer Relations Dept.<br>&nbsp; 823 Salisbury House<br>&nbsp; 29 Finsbury Circus<br>&nbsp; EC2M 5QQ London<br>&nbsp; United Kingdom<br><br><br>-----</p><p align="justify">&nbsp;</p><p align="justify">&nbsp;</p><p align="justify">BullGuard does not sell products for purchase by children.
