	<h3>Collected Information</h3>

	<p>The bullhornstaffing.com site collects personal third party information on certain forms throughout the site such as name, email address, social security number, tax id number and various types of demographic information such as education level. Sensitive information is protected by SSL encryption.</p>

	<p>Customer email addresses and any personal or third party customer information will not be distributed or shared with any third parties for promotional purposes. We may also email information regarding updates to the Service. Except as we explicitly state at the time we request information, or as provided for in the Bullhorn Terms of Use, we do not disclose to any third-party the information provided.</p>

	<p>Other third parties, such as content providers, may provide content on the Web Site but they are not permitted to collect any information nor does Bullhorn share any user information with these parties. Customers will be using the service to host data and information ("Data"). Bullhorn will not review, share, distribute, print, or reference any such Data except as provided in the Bullhorn Terms of Use, or as may be required by law. Individual records may at times be viewed or accessed only for the purpose of resolving a problem, support issue, or suspected violation of the Terms of Use, or as may be required by law, warrant, subpoena, legal process or court order. We reserve the right to disclose your personally identifiable information as required by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on our Web site.</p>

	<p>Of course, customers are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality and security of their user registration and password. Users may opt-out of receiving secondary communications from our website by selecting the opt-out link located in the message body of all our electronic communications. Users may also email <a href="mailto:privacy@bullhorn.com">privacy@bullhorn.com</a> directly with a request to be removed from such communications.

	<h3>Cookies</h3>

	<p>When you interact with Bullhorn we strive to make that experience easy and meaningful. When you log on to Bullhorn, our Web server sends a cookie to your computer. Cookies are files that Web browsers place on a computer's hard drive and are used to tell us whether customers have used the Service previously. Standing alone, cookies do not identify you personally. They merely recognize your browser.</p>

	<p>There are two types of Cookies: session and persistent-based. Session cookies exist only during an online session. They disappear from your computer when you close your browser software or turn off your computer. Persistent cookies remain on your computer after you've closed your browser or turned off your computer. They include such information as a unique identifier for your browser.</p>

	<p>Bullhorn uses session cookies containing encrypted information to allow the system to uniquely identify you while you are logged in. This information allows Bullhorn to process your transactions and requests. Session cookies help us make sure you are who you say you are after you've logged in and are required in order to use the Bullhorn application. Bullhorn uses persistent cookies that only Bullhorn can read and use, to identify the fact that you are a Bullhorn customer or a visitor, who has registered for the Bullhorn Community or to receive certain types of content. We are especially careful about the security and confidentiality of the information stored in persistent cookies. For example, we do not store account numbers or passwords in persistent cookies. Users or visitors who disable their Web browsers' ability to accept cookies will be unable to use all aspects of our service or the Community.</p>

	<h3>Import Contacts</h3>

	<p>We utilize an import contacts feature to help you keep in touch with your contacts and employees. We make it easy for you to invite people from your email address books or Microsoft Outlook account to join you on our Site. At your request we will search your email address book to help you import your contacts to our site. Once your contacts have been uploaded to the Bullhorn application, it is up to the user to select which contacts will be sent an email. This feature is to send contacts an email correspondence or to keep their information as a contact in the Bullhorn Staffing application.</p>

	<h3>Access to Personally Identifiable Information</h3>

	<p>If your personally identifiable information changes, or if you no longer desire our service, you may correct, update, delete, or deactivate it by sending the appropriate request and information to <a href="mailto:privacy@bullhorn.com">privacy@bullhorn.com</a> or by sending a request to the postal address listed below.

When our Site is accessed using Microsoft Internet Explorer versions 5.0 or higher, Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology protects information using both server authentication and data encryption to help ensure that Data is safe, secure, and available only to you.

	<h3>Bullhorn Safe Harbor Privacy Policy Statement</h3>

	<p>Bullhorn is committed to the highest standards of data privacy rights for its customers and partners. In addition to our web privacy policy, Bullhorn self-certifies with the U.S. Department of Commerce's EU Safe Harbor Framework which concerns the transfer of data from the European Union to the United States. Bullhorn acknowledges and adheres to the privacy principles set forth in the Safe Harbor Framework in respect to all data transferred from the EU to the U.S. Additional information regarding Safe Harbor can be viewed at the Department of Commerce's site, <a href="http://www.export.gov/safeharbor/">http://www.export.gov/safeharbor/</a>.</p>

	<p>Bullhorn complies with the U.S. - E.U. Safe Harbor Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use and retention of personal data from European Union member countries. To learn more about the Safe Harbor program, and to view Bullhorn's certification, please visit <a href="http://www.export.gov/safeharbor/">http://www.export.gov/safeharbor/</a>.</p>

	<p>The Department of Commerce's Safe Harbor Framework provides a set of principles that support the EU Data Directive of data protection. The following principles are part of Bullhorn's privacy protection process and are used in the collection and handling of data from the European Union.</p>

	<ul>
	    <li>Notice - Bullhorn will disclose the type of information being collected, its purpose, and any third party with whom data may be shared.</li>

	    <li>Choice - Bullhorn will offer the opportunity of individuals to opt-out of any transfer of data to third parties or use of collected data for purposes other than originally stated for and authorized.</li>

	    <li>Onward Transfer - Any disclosure of information by Bullhorn to third parties will make the Notice and Choice principles applicable to the transfer. Transfer of data to parties acting as agents of Bullhorn will only be done if the third party itself meets the requirements of the Safe Harbor Framework or has been deemed adequate by the EU.</li>

	    <li>Security - Bullhorn takes reasonable precautions in its protection of data and any misuse, loss, destruction, alteration, and unauthorized access or disclosure.</li>

	    <li>Access - Bullhorn will provide access to personal information to individuals and allow them to correct, amend, or delete information where it is inaccurate unless the cost of such access is prohibitive in relation to the risk of privacy or where the rights of another individual would be violated.</li>

	    <li>Data Integrity - Bullhorn takes reasonable steps to ensure that any personal data it collects is relevant for the purpose it is being used and that the information is reliable, accurate, complete, and current.</li>

	    <li>Enforcement - Bullhorn will attempt to resolve any privacy concerns directly with individuals. In the event a resolution cannot be made, individuals may engage Bullhorn's independent recourse mechanism, (<a href="https://feedback-form.truste.com/watchdog/request">TRUSTe</a>).</li>
