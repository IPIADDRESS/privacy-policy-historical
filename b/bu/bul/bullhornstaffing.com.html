	<h3>Tracking Technologies</h3>

	<p>Technologies such as: tags and scripts are used by Bullhorn and our marketplace partners, affiliates, or service providers. These technologies are used in analyzing trends, administering the site, tracking users' movements around the site and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. We may receive reports based on the use of these technologies by these companies on an individual as well as aggregated basis.</p>

	<p>As is true of most web sites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. This information includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data. We do link this automatically-collected data to personally identifiable information.</p>

	<p>We use cookies for [our shopping cart, to remember users' settings (e.g. language preference), and for authentication]. Users can control the use of cookies at the individual browser level. If you reject cookies, you may still use our website, but your ability to use some features or areas of our website may be limited.</p>

	<p>We partner with a third party to either display advertising on our website or to manage our advertising on other sites. Our third party partner may use technologies such as cookies to gather information about your activities on this website and other sites in order to provide you advertising based upon your browsing activities and interests. If you wish to not have this information used for the purpose of serving you interest-based ads, you may opt-out by clicking here (or if located in the European Union click here). Please note this does not opt you out of generic ads. You will continue to receive generic ads.</p>

	<h3>Access to Personally Identifiable Information</h3>

	<p>Bullhorn has no direct relationship with the individuals whose personal information it processes. An individual who seeks access, or who seeks to correct, amend, or delete inaccurate data should direct his query to the Bullhorn's Customer (the data controller). If requested to remove data by our Customer,  we will respond within a reasonable timeframe.</p>

	<h3>Data Retention</h3>

	<p>Bullhorn will retain personal information we process on behalf of our Customers for as long as needed to provide services to our Customer and as required under Customer agreements. Bullhorn will also retain this personal information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.</p>

	<h3>Security</h3>

	<p>Our Site has security measures in place to help protect against the loss, misuse, and alteration of the Data under our control. When our Site is accessed using Microsoft Internet Explorer versions 5.0 or higher, Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology protects information using both server authentication and data encryption to help ensure that Data is safe, secure, and available only to you. Bullhorn also implements an advanced security method based on dynamic data and encoded session identifications, and hosts the Site in a secure server environment that uses a firewall and other advanced technology to protect against interference or access from outside intruders. Finally, Bullhorn provides individual user names and passwords that must be entered each time a customer logs on. These safeguards help protect against unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and provide for the appropriate use of Data. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, we cannot guarantee absolute security. If you have any questions about security on our Service, you can contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@bullhorn.com" target="_blank">privacy@bullhorn.com</a>.</p>
