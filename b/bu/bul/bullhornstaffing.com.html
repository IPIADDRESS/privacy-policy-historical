	<h3><b>4. Access to Personal Information Controlled by Bullhorn</b></h3>

	<p>4.1. Upon request and within 45 days, Bullhorn will provide you with information about whether we hold, or process on behalf of a third party, any of your personal information. In addition, Bullhorn will take reasonable steps to permit customers to correct, amend, or delete their personal information. To request this access, please contact <a href="privacy@bullhorn.com">privacy@bullhorn.com</a>.</p>
	
	<p>4.2. We may retain your information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you with our Services, comply with our contractual and/or legal obligations, resolve disputes and enforce our agreements.</p>

	<h3><b>5. Access to Personal Information Controlled by our Customers</b></h3>

	<p>In most cases, Bullhorn has no direct relationship with the individuals whose personal information it processes. We recommend that an individual who seeks access, or who seeks to correct, amend, or delete personal information should direct his query to the Bullhorn's customer (the data controller). If requested to remove data by our customer, we will respond within 45 days.  Individuals may also submit such inquiries or requests directly to Bullhorn at no cost for them by contacting <a href="privacy@bullhorn.com">privacy@bullhorn.com</a>.</p>

	<h3><b>6. Data Retention by Us</b></h3>

	<p>We will retain personal information we process on behalf of our Customers for as long as needed to provide Services to our customer and as required under customer agreements. We will also retain this personal information as necessary to comply with our legal and/or contractual obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements. When the purpose for which Bullhorn is processing the personal information is fulfilled, expires or is terminated, Bullhorn will, upon request, provide our customers with a copy of their  personal information stored by us, and Bullhorn will then either delete or anonymize/de-identify any remaining personal information in accordance with our customer agreements.</p>

	<h3><b>7.  Data Security</b></h3>

	<p>Bullhorn employs reasonable and appropriate security measures to protect against the loss, misuse, and alteration of the personal information it processes. When the Service is accessed using Microsoft Internet Explorer versions 5.0 or higher, Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology protects information using both server authentication and data encryption to help provide that personal information is safe, and secure while in transit. Bullhorn also implements an advanced security method based on dynamic data and encoded session identifications, and hosts the Service in a secure server environment that uses a firewall and other advanced technology to protect against interference or access from outside intruders. Finally, Bullhorn provides individual user names and passwords that must be entered each time a customer logs on. These safeguards help protect against unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and provide for the appropriate use of personal information. Nevertheless, no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is one hundred percent (100%) secure, however. Therefore, we cannot guarantee absolute security. If you have any questions about security on our Service,  please contact us at <a href="privacy@bullhorn.com">privacy@bullhorn.com</a>.</p>

	<h3><b>8. Links to Third Party Sites</b></h3>

	<p>Our Service includes links to other Web sites whose privacy practices may differ from those at <a href="https://www.bullhorn.com" target="_blank">www.bullhorn.com</a> and <a href="https://bbo.bullhornstaffing.com" target="_blank">https://bbo.bullhornstaffing.com</a>. If you submit personal information to any of these sites, your information is governed by the applicable third-party’s privacy policies and we are not responsible for it. We therefore encourage you to carefully read the privacy policy of any Web site you visit and raise questions directly with these other providers.</p>

	<h3><b>9. No Services for Minors</b></h3>

	<p>We do not knowingly collect information from minors. To use the Site, you must be the age of legal majority in your place of residence. By using the Site, you hereby represent that you are at least the age of legal majority in your place of residence. We do not use an application or other mechanism to determine the age of users of the Site.  All information provided to us will be treated as if it was provided by an adult. We will use commercially reasonable efforts to delete information associated with a minor as soon as practicable if we learn that a minor has submitted information about himself/herself to us..
	
	</p><h3><b>10. Note for California Residents</b></h3>
	
	<p>California law permits California residents who provide us with personal information to request certain information regarding our disclosure of such information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes. We do not, at this time, disclose such information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes. If we change this policy, we will update this provision and provide instructions on how you may make a request for details.</p>
	
	<h3><b>11.	Do-Not-Track Disclosure</b></h3>
	
	<p>There are many methods where web browser signals and similar mechanisms can indicate your choice to disable tracking. But we may not be aware of or able to honor every such mechanism. Because there is not yet a common understanding of how to interpret web browser-based “Do Not Track” (DNT) signals other than cookies, we may not respond to undefined DNT signals to our Sites or online services. More information about “do not track” is available at <a href="www.allaboutdnt.org" target="_blank">www.allaboutdnt.org</a> concerning such information.</p>
	
	<h3><b>12. Severability</b></h3>
	
	<p>The invalidity or unenforceability of any provisions of this Privacy Policy in any country shall not affect the validity or enforceability of any other provision of this Privacy Policy, which shall remain in full force and effect.</p>
	
	<h3><b>13. Changes in this Privacy Policy</b></h3>
	
	<p>We may update this privacy statement to reflect changes to our information practices that will become effective upon posting. If we make material changes to this policy, we will notify you here, by email, or by means of a notice through the Service prior to the change becoming effective. We encourage you to periodically review this page for the latest information on our privacy practices.</p>
