BuildDirect.com Technologies  ("BuildDirect") recognizes the importance of privacy and the  sensitivity of Personal Information (as defined below). BuildDirect believes in  protecting your privacy. This policy outlines how we manage your Personal  Information and safeguard your privacy. <br>
By providing Personal information to us,  you agree to the terms of this policy. However, we are committed to continuous  improvement and value your input. We welcome your comments and/or suggestions on  improving this policy. If you have any concerns, please write to our Privacy  Officer at the address in this policy under the caption "Need More  Information?" <br>
This policy does not apply to the  practices of companies or other entities that BuildDirect does not manage or  control. This policy does not apply to information regarding corporations or  other non-individuals. 
</p><p><br>
  <strong>DEFINITIONS</strong> <br>
  <br>
  The  following definitions are used solely for the purposes of this policy: <br>
  <br>
"Contact Information" means information to enable an individual at a  place of business to be contacted and includes the name, position name or  title, business telephone number, business address, business email or business  fax number of the individual, but does not mean information that is collected  via a BuildDirect Website or Online service about an individual consumer who is  a resident of California. <br>
<br>
"Personal Information" means information about an identifiable  individual, excluding Contact Information, and includes things such as gender,  age, ethnicity, financial and credit information, health information, consumer  preference information, customer profiles, ID numbers, and any other data  assigned to an individual. <br>
<br>
"Summarized Data" means records which have been stripped of  information identifying individuals, and which have been manipulated or  combined to provide generalized, anonymous information. 
</p><p><br>
  <strong>COLLECTION OF PERSONAL INFORMATION</strong> <br>
  <br>
  This  policy covers our treatment of Personal Information that we collect, either  through communications or interaction we may have with you (such as e-mails,  telephone conversations, face-to-face, written correspondence, signing the  visitors log in our office premises, or through our website). This policy also  covers our treatment of any information shared with us by third parties.  Sometimes we may collect Personal Information about you from other sources,  provided that such sources confirm to us that they are permitted to share such  information, such information is publicly available or the collection is  required or authorized by law. Examples of collection from other sources  include collections from: 
</p><ul type="disc">
  <li>a government agency or registry; </li>
  <li>a business, trade, or professional       organization; </li>
  <li>your accountant; </li>
  <li>an employment agency or your current or       previous employer. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>USE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION</strong><br><br>
  BuildDirect may collect and use your  Personal Information for the following purposes: </p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>to administer and build your BuildDirect       account; </li>
  <li>to market new services and products that we       believe will be of interest to you; </li>
  <li>to collect a debt owed to BuildDirect or its       agents; or to pay a debt owed by BuildDirect; </li>
  <li>to help us make credit decisions about clients,       prevent fraud, check the identity of new clients and prevent money       laundering; </li>
  <li>to help us make a decision with respect to       employment or an appointment with BuildDirect</li>
  <li>to identify you if you visit our office       premises; and </li>
  <li>as required or authorized by law. </li>
</ul><br>
<p><strong>DISCLOSURE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION</strong> <br><br>
  BuildDirect does not and will not sell, rent,  share or disclose your Personal Information without first receiving your  permission or as disclosed in this policy. Under certain circumstances,  BuildDirect will disclose your Personal Information: </p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>when you have consented to the       disclosure; </li>
  <li>to fulfill the purpose for which the Personal       Information was collected; </li>
  <li>when the services we are providing to you       require us to give information to third parties, for example: providing       government-assigned identification numbers to customs brokers or other       third parties responsible for processing customs clearance for shipments; </li>
  <li>if we engage a third party to provide services       to us (such as payroll processing, computer back-up services, archival       file storage, customer relationship management, advertising distribution)       and the third party is bound by confidentiality obligations; </li>
  <li>to relay an opt-out request to third-party       marketing agency (see "Opting Out " below); </li>
  <li>where it is necessary to collect a debt owed to       BuildDirect or its agents, or to pay a debt owed by BuildDirect; </li>
  <li>to respond to an emergency where the health or       safety of any individual is reasonably believed to be threatened; </li>
  <li>if the information is already publicly known;       and </li>
  <li>when we are required or authorized by law to do       so. </li>
</ul>
<p>Except when we are required by law to disclose  Personal Information, where commercially practicable we will use contractual or  other arrangements to protect Personal Information disclosed to third parties. </p>
<p><br>
    <strong>SUMMARIZED DATA</strong><br>
    <br>
  We may also use your Personal Information to  generate Summarized Data for internal use and for sharing with affiliates,  subsidiaries, advertisers and business partners. Your identity and Personal  Information will be kept anonymous in Summarized Data. Summarized Data will be  used for marketing and planning purposes. <br>
  <br>
  <strong>CONSENT</strong><br>
  <br>
By providing Personal Information to us, you  voluntarily consent to the collection, use and disclosure of Personal  Information as specified in this policy. Without limiting the foregoing, we may  on occasion ask you to consent when we collect, use, or disclose your Personal  Information in specific circumstances, in which case we may ask for your  consent in writing although in some circumstances we may accept your oral  consent. Sometimes your consent will be implied through your conduct with us if  the purpose of the collection, use or disclosure is obvious and you voluntarily  provide the information. In addition, we may collect, use and disclose Personal  Information without your consent when we are required or authorized by law to  do so. </p>
<p><br>
  <strong>WITHDRAWAL OF CONSENT</strong><br>
  <br>
  Individuals have the right to withdraw their  consent to the collection, use, or disclosure of Personal Information at any  time, except where that withdrawal would frustrate the performance of a legal  obligation by BuildDirect. Upon reasonable written notice given to BuildDirect  (address to Privacy Officer at the address in this policy under the caption  "Need More Information?") all Personal Information held by  BuildDirect that is identifiable to that individual will be removed from our  records and a notice of the impact of that removal will be provided to the  individual. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if you withdraw consent, BuildDirect  nonetheless reserves the right to retain, collect, use and disclose Personal  Information without your consent where we are permitted or required by law to  do so. <br>
  <br>
  <strong>OPTING OUT</strong></p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>You may wish to opt out of receiving certain       information or marketing and promotional material distributed by       BuildDirect. You may do so by selecting the opt-out or unsubscribe feature       in our Online communications including our online newsletter and product       updates, or by writing to BuildDirect’s Privacy Officer at the address in       this policy under the caption "Need More Information?" </li>
  <li>From time to time, BuildDirect may engage a       third-party marketing agency to distribute advertisements to consumers who       have expressed an interest in receiving such material. For this purpose,       the marketing agency may use its own distribution list. This list is not       under BuildDirect’s control and may not be shared with BuildDirect. While       BuildDirect takes steps to ensure that the marketing agency lists only       individuals who have provided their informed consent for the marketing       purpose, it is possible that the individual may desire to opt-out from       receiving further BuildDirect advertisements. In this case, the individual       may send his/her opt-out request in writing to BuildDirect’s Privacy       Officer (at the address noted above), providing enough detail to enable       the requester’s identity to be confirmed. Upon confirming the identity of       the requester, BuildDirect will relay the opt-out request to the marketing       agency in question. In such a case, however, the requester should be aware       that his/her opt-out request could cause the marketing agency to cease all       further advertising distributions to him/her. This could result in the requester       not receiving material or information that might be of financial or other       benefit from other organizations that also employ the same agency. In       relaying an opt-out request to a third-party marketing agency, BuildDirect       therefore accepts no responsibility for any consequences to the requester       arising from the actions of the agency. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>ACCESS TO AND CORRECTION OF PERSONAL  INFORMATION</strong> </p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>Individuals have the right to know what       Personal Information BuildDirect has collected about them, how that       information is being used and to whom it has been disclosed, as well as to       verify and amend that information if it is incorrect. An individual may       make an access/correction request by writing to BuildDirect’s Privacy       Officer at the address in this policy under the caption "Need More       Information?" Upon receiving the written request and a processing fee       of US$10.00, and where the identity of the requester can be confirmed,       information held by BuildDirect that is identifiable to the requester, as       well as information on all use and disclosures of that information, will       normally be released to the requester within 30 days, except where that       release is not required or is prohibited by law. If necessary, BuildDirect       will correct the Personal Information if requested to do so. Where an       access/correction request requires more extensive treatment, we will       advise the requester of the approximate cost of responding to the request.       The requester should provide enough detail to enable BuildDirect to       confirm his/her identity. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>CAN I BE DENIED ACCESS TO MY PERSONAL  INFORMATION?</strong> <br><br>
