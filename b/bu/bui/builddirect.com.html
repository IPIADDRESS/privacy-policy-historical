									<p><span class="header2"><u>COLLECTION OF PERSONAL INFORMATION</u></span></p>
									<div>This policy covers our treatment of Personal Information that we collect, 
										either through communications or interaction we may have with you (such as 
										e-mails, telephone conversations, face-to-face or written correspondence) or 
										through our website. This policy also covers our treatment of any information 
										shared with us by third parties. Sometimes we may collect Personal Information 
										about you from other sources, provided that such sources confirm to us that 
										they are permitted to share such information, such information is publicly 
										available or the collection is required or authorized by law. Examples of 
										collection from other sources include collections from:
									</div>
									<div>

											a government agency or registry;
											</li><li>
											a business, trade, or professional organization;
											</li><li>

											</li><li>
												an employment agency or your current or previous employer.
											</li>
										</ul>
									</div>
									<p><span class="header2"><u>USE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION</u></span></p>
									<p>BuildDirect may collect and use your Personal Information for the following 
										purposes:
									</p>
									<ul>
										<li>
										to administer and build your BuildDirect account;
										</li><li>
										to market new services and products that we believe will be of interest to you;
										</li><li>
										to collect a debt owed to BuildDirect or its agents; or to pay a debt owed by 
										BuildDirect;
										</li><li>
										to help us make credit decisions about clients, prevent fraud, check the 
										identity of new clients and prevent money laundering;
										</li><li>
										to help us make a decision with respect to employment or an appointment with 
										BuildDirect; and
										</li><li>
											as required or authorized by law.</li></ul>
									<p><span class="header2"><u>DISCLOSURE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION</u></span></p>
									BuildDirect does not and will not sell, rent, share or disclose your Personal 
									Information without first receiving your permission or as disclosed in this 
									policy. Under certain circumstances, BuildDirect will disclose your Personal 
									Information:
									<ul>
										<li>
										when you have consented to the disclosure;
										</li><li>
										to fulfill the purpose for which the Personal Information was collected;
										</li><li>
										when the services we are providing to you require us to give information to 
										third parties, for example: providing government-assigned identification 
										numbers to customs brokers or other third parties responsible for processing 
										customs clearance for shipments;
										</li><li>
										if we engage a third party to provide services to us (like computer back-up 
										services, archival file storage, or payroll processing, and the third party is 
										bound by confidentiality obligations;
										</li><li>
										where it is necessary to collect a debt owed to BuildDirect or its agents, or 
										to pay a debt owed by BuildDirect;
										</li><li>
										to respond to an emergency where the health or safety of any individual is 
										reasonably believed to be threatened;
										</li><li>
										if the information is already publicly known; and
										</li><li>
										when we are required or authorized by law to do so.
									</li></ul>
									Except when we are required by law to disclose Personal Information, where 
									commercially practicable we will use contractual or other means to protect 
									Personal Information disclosed to third parties.
									<p><span class="header2"><u>SUMMARIZED DATA</u></span></p>
									We may also use your Personal Information to generate Summarized Data for 
									internal use and for sharing with affiliates, subsidiaries, advertisers and 
									business partners. Your identity and Personal Information will be kept 
									anonymous in Summarized Data. Summarized Data will be used for marketing and 
									planning purposes.
									<p><span class="header2"><u>CONSENT</u></span></p>
									By providing Personal Information to us, you voluntarily consent to the 
									collection, use and disclosure of Personal Information as specified in this 
									policy. Without limiting the foregoing, we may on occasion ask you to consent 
									when we collect, use, or disclose your Personal Information in specific 
									circumstances, in which case we may ask for your consent in writing although in 
									some circumstances we may accept your oral consent. Sometimes your consent will 
									be implied through your conduct with us if the purpose of the collection, use 
									or disclosure is obvious and you voluntarily provide the information. In 
									addition, we may collect, use and disclose Personal Information without your 
									consent when we are required or authorized by law to do so.
									<p><span class="header2"><u>WITHDRAWAL OF CONSENT</u></span></p>
									Individuals have the right to withdraw their consent to the collection, use, or 
									disclosure of Personal Information at any time, except where that withdrawal 
									would frustrate the performance of a legal obligation by BuildDirect. Upon 
									reasonable written notice given to BuildDirect, all Personal Information held 
									by BuildDirect that is identifiable to that individual will be removed from our 
									records and a notice of the impact of that removal will be provided to the 
									individual. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if you withdraw consent, BuildDirect 
									nonetheless reserves the right to retain, collect, use and disclose Personal 
									Information without your consent where we are permitted by law to do so.
									<p><span class="header2"><u>OPTING OUT</u></span></p>
									<ul>
										<li>
										You may wish to opt out of receiving certain information and marketing or 
										promotional materials from BuildDirect. You may do so by selecting the opt-out 
										or unsubscribe feature in our Online communications including our online 
										newsletter and product updates, or by writing to us at the address at the end 
										of this policy.
										</li><li>
										From time to time, BuildDirect may engage an independent marketing agency to 
										distribute advertisements to consumers who have expressed an interest in 
										receiving such material. For this purpose, the marketing agency may use its own 
										distribution list of names and addresses. This contact information is not 
										provided to BuildDirect, nor is this information in the custody or control of 
										BuildDirect. While such lists are composed of names of individuals believed to 
										have voluntarily provided their informed consent for this marketing purpose, it 
										is possible that an individual’s name may be included on the list in error, or 
										that an individual may wish to have his/her name removed from the list. Should 
										an individual contact BuildDirect to request that his/her name be removed from 
										such a list, BuildDirect may relay this request to the marketing agency as a 
										matter of good will toward the requestor. In such a case, however, BuildDirect 
										incurs no responsibility or liability for the actions of the marketing agency. 
										The requestor should also be aware that by having his/her name removed from 
										such a third-party marketing list, he/she may also forego receiving promotional 
										material and any ensuing benefits, financial or in other kind, from other 
										organizations which may contract the services of agencies that use the list.
									</li></ul>
									<p><span class="header2"><u>ACCESS TO AND CORRECTION OF PERSONAL INFORMATION</u></span></p>
									<ul>
										<li>
										Individuals have the right to know what Personal Information BuildDirect has 
										collected about them, how that information is being used and to whom it has 
										been disclosed, as well as to verify and amend that information if it is 
										incorrect. Upon receiving, at the address at the end of this policy, a written 
										access request and a handling fee of US$10.00, and where the identity of the 
										requestor can be confirmed, information held by BuildDirect that is 
										identifiable to the requestor, as well as information on all use and 
										disclosures of that information, will normally be released to the requestor 
										within 30 days, except where that release is not required or is prohibited by 
										law. If necessary, BuildDirect will correct the Personal Information if 
										requested to do so. Where an access request requires more extensive treatment, 
										we will advise the requestor of the approximate cost of responding to the 
										request. The requestor should provide enough detail to enable BuildDirect to 
										confirm the identity of the requestor.
									</li></ul>
									<p><span class="header2"><u>CAN I BE DENIED ACCESS TO MY PERSONAL INFORMATION?</u></span></p>
									Your rights to access your Personal Information are not absolute. We may deny 
									access:
									<ul>
										<li>
										when denial of access is required or authorized by law;
										</li><li>
										when granting you access would have an unreasonable impact on other people’s 
										privacy;
										</li><li>
										to protect our firm’s rights and property; or
										</li><li>
										where the request is frivolous or vexatious.
									</li></ul>
									If we deny your request for access to, or refuse a request to correct Personal 
									Information, we will explain why.
									<p><span class="header2"><u>WEBSITE</u></span></p>

									subscribing to any corporate communications.<br>

									communications or information sent by you to us via the website. If you wish to
