 Buxfer, Inc. ("Buxfer") knows that you care about how your personal
 information is used and shared, and takes your privacy seriously.
 Please read the following to learn more about our Privacy Policy. By
 visiting the Buxfer’s website at http://www.buxfer.com (“buxfer.com”),
 or using any of our services, you acknowledge that you accept the
 practices and policies outlined in this Privacy Policy.
</div>

<div class="subtitle">
 What Does This Privacy Policy Cover? 
</div>
<div class="section">
 This Privacy Policy covers Buxfer’s treatment of personally
 identifiable information ("Personal Information") that Buxfer gathers
 when you are accessing buxfer.com and when you use our services. This
 policy does not apply to the practices of companies that Buxfer does
 not own or control, or to individuals that Buxfer does not employ or
 manage.
</div>

<div class="subtitle">
 What Personal Information Does Buxfer display or Collect? 
</div>
<div class="section">
 The information we gather from users enables us to personalize and
 improve our services, and to allow our users to set up a user account
 and profile that can be used to interact with other users through
 buxfer.com. In connection with buxfer.com, we request and display some
 personal information to other users and visitors of buxfer.com, which
 allows users to identify each other.  We collect the following types
 of information from our users. 

 <ul class="arrow">
  <li>
   <b>Personal Information You Provide to Us</b>
   <div>
    We receive and store any information you enter on buxfer.com or
    provide to us in any other way. The types of Personal Information
    collected may include your name, age, gender, zip code, e-mail
    address, cell phone number, occupation, hometown, college, personal
    interests, nickname, and information about personal finances that is
    entered on buxfer.com. You may choose not to provide us with certain
    information, but then you may not be able to take advantage of many of
    our special features. The Personal Information you provide is used for
    such purposes as allowing you to interact with other users, responding
    to your requests for certain information, products and services,
    customizing the advertising and content you see, and communicating
    with you about specials and new features.
   </div>
  </li>
  <li>
   <b>Personal Information Collected Automatically</b>
   <ul class="squareBullets" style="list-style-image: none;">
    <li>
     We receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact with buxfer.com or obtain services from
     us. Buxfer automatically receives and records information on our server logs from your browser including your
     browser type, IP address, Buxfer cookie information, and the page you requested. We also record the details of
     your transactions on buxfer.com.
    </li>
    <li>
     Generally, our service automatically collects usage information, such
     as the numbers and frequency of visitors to our site and its components, similar to TV ratings that indicate
     how many people watched a particular show. Buxfer only uses this data in aggregate form, that is, as a
     statistical measure, and not in a manner that would identify you personally. This type of aggregate data
     enables us to figure out how often users use parts of buxfer.com or services so that we can make buxfer.com
     appealing to as many users as possible, and improve those services. As part of this use of information, we may
     provide aggregate information to our partners about how our users, collectively, use our site. We share this
     type of statistical data so that our partners also understand how often people use their services and
     buxfer.com, so that they, too, may provide you with an optimal online experience. Again, Buxfer never discloses
     aggregate information to a partner in a manner that would identify you personally. 
    </li>
   </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
   <b>E-mail Communications</b>
   <div>
    We may receive a confirmation when you open an e-mail from Buxfer if your computer supports this type of program.
    Buxfer uses this confirmation to help us make e-mails more interesting and helpful. We also compare our user list
    to lists received from other companies, in an effort to avoid sending unnecessary messages to our users.
   </div>
  </li>
  <li>
   <b>Browser Cookies</b>
   <ul class="squareBullets" style="list-style-image: none;">
    <li>
     Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer’s hard drive through your browser to
     enable our systems to recognize your browser and tell us how and when pages in our site are visited and by how
     many people. Buxfer cookies do not collect Personal Information, and we do not combine the general information
     collected through cookies with other Personal Information to tell us who you are or what your screen name or
     email address is.
    </li>
    <li>
     Most browsers have an option for turning off the cookie feature, which will prevent
     your browser from accepting new cookies, as well as (depending on the sophistication of your browser software)
     allowing you to decide on acceptance of each new cookie in a variety of ways. We require that cookies be
     enabled for you to take advantage of the services we offer on buxfer.com. 
    </li>
    <li>
     Ads appearing on buxfer.com may be delivered to users by our advertising partners, who may set cookies. These
     cookies allow the ad server to recognize your computer each time they send you an online advertisement to
     compile information about you or others who use your computer. This information allows ad networks to, among
     other things, deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you. This Privacy
     Policy covers the use of cookies by Buxfer and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.
