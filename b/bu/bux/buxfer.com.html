This policy does not apply to the practices of companies that Buxfer does not own or control, or to individuals that Buxfer does not employ or manage. </div> <div class="subtitle"> What Personal Information Does Buxfer display or Collect? </div> <div class="section"> The information we gather from users enables us to personalize and improve our services, and to allow our users to set up a user account and profile that can be used to interact with other users through buxfer.com. In connection with buxfer.com, we request and display some personal information to other users and visitors of buxfer.com, which allows users to identify each other. We collect the following types of information from our users. <ul class="arrow"> <li> <b>Personal Information You Provide to Us</b> <div> We receive and store any information you enter on buxfer.com or provide to us in any other way.

We also record the details of your transactions on buxfer.com. </li> <li> Generally, our service automatically collects usage information, such as the numbers and frequency of visitors to our site and its components, similar to TV ratings that indicate how many people watched a particular show. Buxfer only uses this data in aggregate form, that is, as a statistical measure, and not in a manner that would identify you personally. This type of aggregate data enables us to figure out how often users use parts of buxfer.com or services so that we can make buxfer.com appealing to as many users as possible, and improve those services. As part of this use of information, we may provide aggregate information to our partners about how our users, collectively, use our site.
