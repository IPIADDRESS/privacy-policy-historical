                                                            We collect two different types of data: (1) the personal information you share with us; and (2) anonymous aggregated data about how visitors use this site and interact with our marketing campaigns through the use of cookies.<br>
<br>
(1) You may decide to submit personal information to Bupa, by completing a ‘contact us’ form or by contacting us through email, telephone, social media or blog replies. We may add this information to a database so that we can identify you and manage our relationship with you as a Bupa customer. We also use this information to update and improve the accuracy of our records and for those other purposes set out in this policy. The type of information we collect and would refer to as ‘personal information’ or ‘personal data’ includes any information that may identify you as an individual, such as your name and address, as personal data or personal information.<br>
<br>
For example, we may collect the following personal information:<br><br>
<ul>
    <li class="dot-rte">name and job title</li>
    <li class="dot-rte">age and date of birth</li>
    <li class="dot-rte">contact information including email address</li>
    <li class="dot-rte">other information relevant to customer surveys and/or offers</li>
</ul>
<br>
Sometimes you may decide to submit personal information which is of a more private nature, which we refer to as sensitive personal information. This sort of information would be required, for example, so that we can generate a product quote or perhaps to deal with your questions, or administer your policy with us.<br>
<br>
We may collect the following sensitive personal information if you share it with us and if we believe the processing of this information is necessary:<br><br>
<ul>
    <li class="dot-rte">your ethnic origin</li>
    <li class="dot-rte">condition of your physical or mental health</li>
    <li class="dot-rte">employment information if you are applying for a job</li>
    <li class="dot-rte">lifestyle information</li>
</ul>
<br>
(2) We may use cookies or other technology to understand how people are using our site and respond to certain marketing messages, such as search engine marketing. The data is aggregated and anonymous so we cannot identify you personally. We refer to this as non-personally identifiable information.&nbsp; For further information on how Bupa uses cookies please refer to our cookies policy below.

<ul>
    <li class="dot-rte">internal record keeping and administration</li>
    <li class="dot-rte">providing and improving our products and services</li>

    <li class="dot-rte">responding to requests where we have a legal or regulatory obligation to do so</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, depending on how your scheme or service is funded or introduced, we may share information with your employer or an appointed intermediary, as applicable. This is solely for product or service administration purposes. We may also share the financial amounts claimed together with the names of the individuals who have claimed under a scheme funded by your employer if your employer requests this. This might occur, for example, where your employer wishes to discuss with you what other support they can offer you or your family while someone is receiving or recovering from treatment. However, we won’t share the details of your health condition, illness, injury or treatment with your employer without your permission.</p>

There are different types of cookies which are used to do different things. These include letting you navigate between different pages on a website efficiently, remembering preferences you have given and helping us to identify ways to improve your overall site experience. Others are used to provide you with advertising which is more tailored to your interests, or to measure the number of site visits and the most popular pages users visit.

                                                            Cookies can be set and controlled by the operator of the website which the user is browsing such as Bupa for this website (known as a ‘first party cookie’) or a third party such as Facebook, for example to display advertisements and social sharing features, (known as a ‘third party cookie’).<br>
<br>
Due to their core role of enhancing and enabling usability or site processes, disabling certain cookies may prevent you from using certain aspects of the Bupa website, such as generating a quote or placing an order.<br>
<br>
Broadly speaking, there are two different types of browser cookie:<br>
<br>
(1) <b>Session cookies</b> are stored in the computer's memory during a user's browsing session and are automatically deleted from the user's computer when the browser is closed or the session is deemed to have ended.<br>
<br>
These cookies usually store a session ID that is not personally identifiable to users, allowing the user to move from page to page without having to log-in repeatedly. They are widely used by commercial websites; for example to keep track of items that a consumer has added to a shopping basket.<br>
<br>
Session cookies do not collect any information from the user's computer and they expire at the end of the user's browser session. They can also become inaccessible after the session has been inactive for a specified length of time, usually 20 or 30 minutes.<br>
<br>
(2) <b>Persistent cookies</b> are stored on the user's computer and are not deleted when the browser is closed. Persistent cookies can be used to retain user preferences for a particular website, allowing those preferences to be used in future browsing sessions.<br>
<br>
Persistent cookies usually assign a unique ID to the user’s browser and they are usually configured to identify a user for a prolonged period of time, from days to months or even years.
