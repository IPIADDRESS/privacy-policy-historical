        Web Site Use Information</font></span></strong></p>
        <p><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: black;"><font face="Georgia">Similar
        to other commercial Web sites, our Web site utilizes a standard
        technology called "cookies" (see explanation below, "What
        Are Cookies?") and web server log files to collect information
        about how our Web site is used. Information gathered through cookies and
        Web server logs may include the date and time of visits, the pages
        viewed, time spent at our Web site, and the Web sites visited just
        before and just after our Web site.</font></span></p>
        <p><strong><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: black;"><font face="Georgia">How
        Do We Use the Information That You Provide to Us?</font></span></strong></p>
        <p><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: black;"><font face="Georgia">Broadly
        speaking, we use personal information for purposes of administering our
        business activities, providing the products and services you requested,
        to process your payment, , to monitor the use of the service, our
        marketing and promotional efforts and improve our content and service
        offerings, and customize our site's content, layout, services and for
        other lawful purposes. These uses improve our site and better tailor it

        Personally identifiable information or business information will not be
        shared with parties except as required by law.</font></span></p>
        <p><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: black;"><font face="Georgia">Occasionally,
        we may also use the information we collect to notify you about important
        changes to our Website, new services, and special offers we think you
        will find valuable. You may notify us at any time if you do not wish to
        receive these offers by emailing us at the link provided on the

        <p><strong><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: black;"><font face="Georgia">What
        Are Cookies?</font></span></strong></p>
        <p><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: black;"><font face="Georgia">A
        cookie is a very small text document, which often includes an anonymous
        unique identifier. When you visit a Web site, that site's computer asks
        your computer for permission to store this file in a part of your hard
        drive specifically designated for cookies. Each Web site can send its
        own cookie to your browser if your browser's preferences allow it, but
        (to protect your privacy) your browser only permits a Web site to access
        the cookies it has already sent to you, not the cookies sent to you by
        other sites. Browsers are usually set to accept cookies. However, if you
        would prefer not to receive cookies, you may alter the configuration of
        your browser to refuse cookies. If you choose to have your browser
        refuse cookies, it is possible that some areas of our site will not
        function as effectively when viewed by the users. A cookie cannot
        retrieve any other data from your hard drive or pass on computer
        viruses.</font></span></p>
        <p><strong><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: black;"><font face="Georgia">How
        Do We Use Information We Collect from Cookies?</font></span></strong></p>
        <p><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: black;"><font face="Georgia">As
        you visit and browse our Web site, the site uses cookies to
        differentiate you from other users. In some cases, we also use cookies
        to prevent you from having to log in more than is necessary for
        security. Cookies, in conjunction with our Web server's log files, allow
        us to calculate the aggregate number of people visiting our Web site and
        which parts of the site are most popular. This helps us gather feedback
        to constantly improve our Web site and better serve our clients. Cookies
        do not allow us to gather any personal information about you and we do
        not intentionally store any personal information that your browser
        provided to us in your cookies.</font></span></p>
        <p><strong><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: black;"><font face="Georgia">IP
        Addresses</font></span></strong></p>
        <p><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: black;"><font face="Georgia">IP
        addresses are used by your computer every time you are connected to the
        Internet. Your IP address is a number that is used by computers on the
        network to identify your computer. IP addresses are automatically
        collected by our web server as part of demographic and profile data
        known as traffic data so that data (such as the Web pages you request)
        can be sent to you.</font></span></p>
        <p><strong><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: black;"><font face="Georgia">Sharing
        and Selling Information</font></span></strong></p>
        <p><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: black;"><font face="Georgia">We
        do not share, sell, lend or lease any of the information that uniquely
        identify a subscriber (such as email addresses or personal details) with
        anyone except to the extent it is necessary to process transactions or
        provide services that you have requested.</font></span></p>
        <p><strong><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: black;"><font face="Georgia">How

        About Legally Compelled Disclosure of Information?</font></span></strong></p>
        <p><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: black;"><font face="Georgia">We
        may disclose information when legally compelled to do so, in other
        words, when we, in good faith, believe that the law requires it or for
        the protection of our legal rights. We may also disclose account
        information when we have reason to believe that disclosing this
        information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action
        against someone who may be violating our Terms of Service or to protect
        the safety of our users and the Public.</font></span></p>
        <p><strong><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: black;"><font face="Georgia">What
        About Other Web Sites Linked to Our Web Site?</font></span></strong></p>
        <p><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: black;"><font face="Georgia">We
        are not responsible for the practices employed by Web sites linked to or
        from our Web site or the information or content contained therein. Often
        links to other Web sites are provided solely as pointers to information
        on topics that may be useful to the users of our Web site.</font></span></p>
        <p><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: black;"><font face="Georgia">Please
        remember that when you use a link to go from our Website to another web
        site, our Privacy Policy is no longer in effect. Your browsing and
        interaction on any other web site, including web sites, which have a

        policies. Please read over those rules and policies before proceeding.</font></span></p>

        Commitment To Data Security:</font></span></strong></p>
        <p><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: black;"><font face="Georgia">Please
        note that your information will be stored and processed on our computers
        in the United States. The laws on holding personal data in the United
        States may be less stringent than the laws of your Country of residence
        or citizenship. To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy,
        and ensure the correct use of information, we have put in place
        appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard
        and secure the information we collect online.</font></span></p>

        voluntary and the user therefore has a choice whether or not to disclose
        this information. Information requested may include contact information
        (such as name and shipping address), and demographic information (such
        as zip code, age level). Contact information will be used to notify the
        winners and award prizes. Survey information will be used for purposes
        of monitoring or improving the use and satisfaction of this site.</font></span></p>

        acquired, your information would be considered part of those assets, and
        may be part of those assets that are transferred.</font></span></p>
        <p><strong><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: black;"><font face="Georgia">Policy
        Modifications</font></span></strong></p>
