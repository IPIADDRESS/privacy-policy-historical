        <div align="left">Bunzola is strongly committed to protecting the privacy 
            of consumers of its interactive products and services. Throughout 
            cyberspace, we want to contribute to providing a safe and secure environment 
            for consumers, and in particular, ensure that kids' information is 
            protected.</div><br>
          <div align="left">The purpose of this privacy policy is to inform you, as 
            a welcome visitor to Bunzola, what kinds of information we may 
            gather about you when you visit Bunzola, how we may use that information, 
            whether we disclose it to anyone, and the choices you have regarding 
            our use of, and your ability to correct, the information. Finally, 
            please note that this policy applies only to Bunzola, and not to 
            other companies or organizations Web sites to which we link. We have 
            clearly marked Bunzola and these branded Web sites with our logo 
            so you know where this policy applies.</div><br>
          
        <div align="left"><b>Information about all Bunzola's visitors</b><br>
            In general, our service automatically gathers certain usage information 
            like the numbers and frequency of visitors to Bunzola and its areas, 
            very much like television ratings that tell the networks how many 
            people tuned in to a program. We only use such data in the aggregate. 
            This collective data helps us determine how much our customers use 
            parts of the site, so we can improve our site to assure that it is 
            as appealing as we can make it for as many of you as possible. For 
            example, Bunzola may use a technology nicknamed "cookies" that 
            tells us how and when pages in our site are visited, and by how many 
            people. Bunzola cookies do not collect personally identifiable 
            information and we do not combine information collected through cookies 
            with other personally identifiable information to tell us who you 
            are or even what your screen name or e-mail address is. We also may 
            provide statistical "ratings" information, never information about 
            you personally, to our Bunzola partners about how our "members", 
            collectively, use Bunzola. We do this so they too can understand 
            how much people use their areas and our site in order for them to 
            provide you with the best possible Web experience as well. </div><br>
          
        <div align="left"><b>Disclosure</b><br>
            We do not use or disclose information about your individual visits 
            to Bunzola or information that you may give us, such as your name, 
            address, email address or telephone number, to any outside companies. 
            But as we mention above, we may share with our Web site partners aggregated 
            statistical "ratings" information about the use of Bunzola.</div><br>
          
        <div align="left"><b>Bunzola privacy policy changes</b><br>
            If we decide to change our privacy policy for Bunzola, we will 
            post those changes here so that you will always know what information 
            we gather, how we might use that information and whether we will disclose 
            it to anyone.</div><br>
