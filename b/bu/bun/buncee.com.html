Information Collection &amp; User Registration
</p>

<p>
In order to use this Web site, you must first complete the registration form and create a user name and password.  During registration, you are required to give contact information (such as name and email address), gender, and  date of birth.  This service is restricted to users 13 years of age or older.  We will use your contact  information to contact you about the services on our site in which you have expressed interest.
</p>

<p>
Buncee LLC is the sole owner of Buncee.com and any information collected on Buncee.com, which collects personally identifiable information from our users at several different points on our Web site.
<!--Orders-->
</p>

<p>
If you purchase a product or service from us, we request certain personally identifiable information from you on our order form. You must provide contact information, including name, email, shipping address, and financial information such as credit card number and expiration date.  
</p>

<p>
We use this information for billing purposes and to fill your orders.  If we have trouble processing an order, we will use this information to contact you.  When you place an order, you will receive an email from us.  

</p>

<p>
Surveys or Contests <br>
From time-to-time, we may provide you the opportunity to participate in contests or surveys on our site.  If you participate, we will request certain personally identifiable information from you. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary. Therefore, you have a choice whether or not to disclose this information.  The requested information typically includes contact information (such as name and shipping address) and demographic information (such as zip code).
</p>

<p>
We will communicate with you through email and notices posted on the Buncee.com website, or through other means available through the service, including mobile text messages.  We may send you a series of emails that help inform new Users about the features of the service, and we will also send you service messages relating to the functioning of the Services.  We may also send you messages with promotional information directly or on behalf of our partners, unless you have opted out of receiving promotional information.
</p>

<p>
Many communications you initiate through Buncee.com (e.g. an invitation sent to a non-User) will list your primary email address and the name of the message.  Messages you initiate may also provide aggregate information about your network (for instance how many people are in your network), but will not list the people to whom you’re directly connected.  Other communications that you initiate through the Buncee.com website, like a request for an introduction, will list your name as the initiator, but will not include your personal email address contact information.  Your contact information will only be shared with another User if both of you have indicated that you would like to establish contact with each other.

Profile <br>
We store information that we collect through log files, clear gifs, and/or third party sources to create a “profile” of your preferences.  We tie your personally identifiable information, and your purchasing history, to information in the profile, in order to provide tailored promotions and marketing offers and to improve the content of the site for you.
</p>

<p>
Information Sharing and Disclosure
Aggregate Information (non-personally identifiable)

</p>

<h1>
Personally identifiable information:
</h1>

<p>
We <b>DO</b> share personally identifiable information with Third Parties that are our Agents and Service Providers </p>

<h1>
Agents  
</h1>


<p>
We use an outside shipping company to fulfill orders, and a credit card processing company to bill you for goods and services. These companies do not retain, share, store or use personally identifiable information for any other purposes.
</p>

<h1>Service Providers</h1>


<p>We <span style="text-transform: lowercase">USE OTHER THIRD PARTIES TO PROVIDE SERVICES ON OUR SITE</span>.  W<span style="text-transform: lowercase">HEN YOU SIGN UP, WE WILL SHARE INFORMATION  AS NECESSARY FOR THE THIRD PARTY TO PROVIDE THAT SERVICE</span>.</p>

<p>These third parties are prohibited from using your personally identifiable information for any other purpose.</p> 

<h1>Legal Disclaimer</h1>

<p>
It is possible that we may need to disclose personal information, profile information, and/or information about your activities as a Buncee.com User when required by subpoena or other legal process, or if Buncee.com has a good faith belief that disclosure is necessary to (a) investigate, prevent, or take action regarding suspected or actual illegal activities or to assist government enforcement agencies; (b) to enforce the User Agreement, to investigate and defend ourselves against any third party claims or allegations, or to protect the security or integrity of our site; and/or (c) to exercise or protect the rights, property or personal safety of Buncee.com, our Users, employees, or others.
</p>
<!--
<h1>Log Files</h1>

<p>
As is true of most Web sites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files.  This information includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data.  
</p>

<p>
We use this information, which does not identify individual users, to analyze trends, to administer the site, to track users&rsquo; movements around the site and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole.  
</p>

<p>
We do link this automatically-collected data to personally identifiable information.  We may use a third-party tracking service that uses cookies to track non-personally identifiable information about visitors to our site in the aggregate.  
</p>-->

<h1>Clear Gifs (Web Beacons/Web Bugs)</h1>

<p>
We employ a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs), that help us better manage content on our site by informing us what content is effective.  Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users.  In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on Web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. We tie the information gathered by clear gifs to our customers’ personally identifiable information. 
</p>

<p>
We use clear gifs in our HTML-based emails to let us know which emails have been opened by recipients.  This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns.  If you would like to opt-out of these emails, please see “Choice and Opt-out.” 
</p>

<h1>Links to Other Sites</h1>

<p>
This Web site contains links to other sites that are not owned or controlled by Buncee LLC.  Please be aware that we, Buncee LLC, are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites.  
</p>

<p>
We encourage you to be aware when you leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every Web site that collects personally identifiable information.  
</p>

<p>
This privacy statement applies only to information collected by this Web site. 
</p>

<h1>Access to Personally Identifiable Information</h1>

<p>
If your personally identifiable information changes, or if you no longer desire our service, you may correct, update, delete or deactivate it by making the change on our member information page or by emailing our Customer Support at <a href="mailto:info@buncee.com">info@buncee.com</a>.
</p>

<h1>Security</h1>

<p>
We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it.  No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however.  Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.
</p>

<p>
If you have any questions about security on our Web site, you can send email us at <a href="mailto:security@buncee.com">security@buncee.com.</a>
</p>

<h1>Business Transitions</h1>

<p>
In the event Buncee LLC goes through a business transition, such as a merger, acquisition by another company, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, your personally identifiable information will likely be among the assets transferred.  You will be notified via a prominent notice on our Web site for 30 days of any such change in ownership or control of your personal information.
</p>

<h1>Changes in this Privacy Statement</h1>

<p>
If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes to this privacy statement and other places we deem appropriate so that you are aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it.  
</p>

<p>
We reserve the right to modify this privacy statement at any time, so please review it frequently.  If we make material changes to this policy, we will notify you here, by email, or by means of a notice on our home page.
