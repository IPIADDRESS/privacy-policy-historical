<ul type="disc">
 <li class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">We
     may offer certain features that are available only&nbsp;through the use of

 <li class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">We

 <li class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">Most

<p class="MsoNormal"><a name="Spam"></a><b><span style="font-size:13.5pt;

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">We

<p class="MsoBodyText">You may not use our technology and communication tools to

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">Your

you are responsible for all actions taken in the name of your account. If you
lose control of your password, you may lose substantial control over your

you should immediately notify BundlePost.com technical support or Social

can see, review and change most of your personal information by signing on to
BundlePost.com. Generally, we will not manually modify your personal

must promptly update your personal information if it changes or is inaccurate.
Upon your request, we will close your account and remove your personal

in accordance with applicable law. We do retain personal information from
closed accounts to comply with law, prevent fraud, collect any fees owed,
resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems, assist with any investigations,
enforce our Terms &amp; Conditions Agreement, and take other actions otherwise
permitted by law.</span></p>

data as an asset that must be protected and use lots of tools (encryption,
