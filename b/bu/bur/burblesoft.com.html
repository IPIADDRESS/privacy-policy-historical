            <p>
                Your privacy is important to Burble Software Inc. So we've developed a Privacy
                Policy that covers how we collect, use, disclose, transfer, and store your
                information. Please take a moment to familiarize yourself with our privacy
                practices and let us know if you have any questions.
            </p>
            <p class="lead">Collection and Use of Personal Information</p>
            <p>
                Personal information is data that can be used to uniquely identify or contact a
                single person.<br>
                You may be asked to provide your personal information anytime you are in contact
                with Burble Software Inc or an Burble Software Inc affiliated company. Burble
                Software Inc and its affiliates may share this personal information with each other
                and use it consistent with this Privacy Policy. They may also combine it with other
                information to provide and improve our products, services, content, and
                advertising.<br>
                Here are some examples of the types of personal information Burble Software Inc
                may collect and how we may use it.
            </p>
            <p class="lead">What personal information we collect</p>
            <div>
                <ul>
                <li>When you create a Burble Software Inc Member Account, purchase a product,
                    download a software update, or utilize Burble Software Inc services, we may
                    collect a variety of information, including your name, mailing address, phone
                    number, email address, contact preferences, and credit card information.</li>
                <li>When you register for and/or participate on Burble Software Inc forums,
                    Burble Software Inc may collect the information you provide about those
                    people such as name, mailing address, email address, and phone number.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <p class="lead">How we use your personal information</p>
            <div>
                <ul>
                <li>The personal information we collect allows us to keep you posted on Burble
                    Software Inc's latest product announcements, software updates, and
                    upcoming events. It also helps us to improve our services, content, and
                    advertising. If you don't want to be on our mailing list, you can opt out at
                    anytime by updating your preferences.</li>
                <li>We also use personal information to help us develop, deliver, and improve our
                    products, services, content, and advertising.</li>
                <li>From time to time, we may use your personal information to send important
                    notices, such as communications about purchases and changes to our terms,
                    conditions, and policies. Because this information is important to your
                    interaction with Burble Software Inc, you may not opt out of receiving these
                    communications.</li>
                <li>We may also use personal information for internal purposes such as auditing,
                    data analysis, and research to improve Burble Software Inc's products,
                    services, and customer communications.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <p class="lead">Collection and Use of Non-Personal Information</p>
            <p>We also collect non-personal information − data in a form that does not permit
                direct association with any specific individual. We may collect, use, transfer, and
                disclose non-personal information for any purpose. The following are some
                examples of non-personal information that we collect and how we may use it:</p>
            <div>
                <ul>
                    <li>We may collect information such as occupation, language, zip code, area
                        code, unique device identifier, location, and the time zone where an Burble
                        Software Inc product is used so that we can better understand customer
                        behavior and improve our products, services, and advertising.</li>
                    <li>We also may collect information regarding customer activities on our website,
                        and from our other products and services. This information is aggregated and
                        used to help us provide more useful information to our customers and to
                        understand which parts of our website, products, and services are of the most
                        interest. Aggregated data is considered non-personal information for the
                        purposes of this Privacy Policy.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <p>If we do combine non-personal information with personal information, then the
                combined information will be treated as personal information for as long as it
                remains combined.</p>
            <p class="lead">Cookies and Other Technologies</p>
            <p>
                Burble Software Inc's website, online services, interactive applications, email
                messages, and advertisements may use "cookies" and other technologies such as
                pixel tags and web beacons. These technologies help us better understand user
                behavior, tell us which parts of our website people have visited, and facilitate and
                measure the effectiveness of advertisements and web searches. We treat
                information collected by cookies and other technologies as non-personal
                information. However, to the extent that Internet Protocol (IP) addresses or similar
                identifiers are considered personal information by local law, we also treat these
                identifiers as personal information. Similarly, to the extent that non-personal
                information is combined with personal information, we treat the combined
                information as personal information for the purposes of this Privacy Policy.
                Burble Software Inc and its partners use cookies and other technologies in mobile
                advertising services to control the number of times you see a given ad, to deliver
                ads that relate to your interests, and to measure the effectiveness of ad
                campaigns.<br>
                Burble Software Inc and our partners also use cookies and other technologies to
                remember personal information when you use our website, online services, and
                applications. Our goal in these cases is to make your experience with Burble
                Software Inc more convenient and personal. Knowing someone using your
                computer or device has used a particular service helps us make any advertising
                and email communications more relevant to your interests. And knowing your
                contact information and information about your computer or device helps us
                register your products, personalize your operating system, set up your Burble
                Software service, and provide you with better customer service.<br>
                As is true of most websites, we gather some information automatically and store it
                in log files. This information includes Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, browser
                type and language, Internet service provider (ISP), referring and exit pages,
                operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data.<br>
                We use this information to understand and analyze trends, to administer the site,
                to learn about user behavior on the site, and to gather demographic information
                about our user base as a whole. Burble Software Inc may use this information in
                our marketing and advertising services.<br>
            </p>
            <p class="lead">Disclosure to Third Parties</p>
            <p>At times Burble Software Inc may make certain personal information available to
                strategic partners that work with Burble Software Inc to provide products and
                services, or that help Burble Software Inc market to customers. Personal
                information will only be shared by Burble Software Inc to provide or improve our
                products, services and advertising; it will not be shared with third parties for their
                marketing purposes.</p>
            <p class="lead">Service Providers</p>
            <p>Burble Software Inc may share personal information with companies who provide
                services such as information processing, delivering products to you, managing
                and enhancing customer data, providing customer service, assessing your interest
                in our products and services, and conducting customer research or satisfaction
                surveys. These companies are obligated to protect your information and may be
                located wherever Burble Software Inc operates.</p>
            <p class="lead">Others</p>
            <p>
                It may be necessary − by law, legal process, litigation, and/or requests from public
                and governmental authorities within or outside your country of residence − for
                Burble Software Inc to disclose your personal information. We may also disclose
                information about you if we determine that for purposes of national security, law
                enforcement, or other issues of public importance, disclosure is necessary or
                appropriate.<br>
                We may also disclose information about you if we determine that disclosure is
                reasonably necessary to enforce our terms and conditions or protect our
                operations or users. Additionally, in the event of a reorganization, merger, or sale
                we may transfer any and all personal information we collect to the relevant third
                party.
            </p>
            <p class="lead">Protection of Personal Information</p>
            <p>
                Burble Software Inc takes precautions — including administrative, technical, and
                physical measures — to safeguard your personal information against loss, theft,
                and misuse, as well as against unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and
                destruction.<br>
                Burble Software Inc online services use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption on
                all web pages where personal information is collected. You must use an SSL-enabled
                browser such as Chrome, Firefox, Internet Explorer or Safari. Doing so
                protects the confidentiality of your personal information while it's transmitted over
                the Internet.<br>
                When you use some Burble Software Inc products, services, or applications, or
                post on an Burble Software Inc forum or chat room, the personal information you
                share is visible to other users and can be read, collected, or used by them. You are
                responsible for the personal information you choose to submit in these instances.
                For example, if you list your name and email address in a forum posting, that
                information is public. Please take care when using these features.
            </p>
            <p class="lead">Integrity and Retention of Personal Information</p>
            <p>Burble Software Inc makes it easy for you to keep your personal information
                accurate, complete, and up to date. We will retain your personal information for
                the period necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy unless a
                longer retention period is required or permitted by law.</p>
            <p class="lead">Access to Personal Information</p>
            <p>You can help ensure that your contact information and preferences are accurate,

                For other personal information, we make good faith efforts to
                provide you with access so you can request that we correct the data if it is
                inaccurate or delete the data if Burble Software Inc is not required to retain it by
                law or for legitimate business purposes. We may decline to process requests that
                are unreasonably repetitive, require disproportionate technical effort, jeopardize
                the privacy of others, are extremely impractical, or for which access is not
                otherwise required by local law. Access, correction, or deletion requests can be
                made through the regional Privacy Contact Form.</p>
            <p class="lead">Location-Based Services</p>
            <p>To provide location-based services on Burble Software Inc products, Burble
                Software Inc and our partners and licensees may collect, use, and share precise
                location data, including the real-time geographic location of your Burble Software
                Inc computer or device. This location data is collected anonymously in a form that

                partners and licensees to provide and improve location-based products and
                services. For example, we may share geographic location with application
                providers when you opt in to their location services, if applicable.</p>
            <p class="lead">Third-Party Sites and Services</p>
