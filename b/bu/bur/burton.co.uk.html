              <p>The personal information we collect and use will depend on why we need it. We will only collect the personal information we believe we need to use, or which you have agreed we can collect from you or agreed someone else can share with us, such as Unidays to confirm student status.</p>

              <p>Sometimes we are given information about you unexpectedly, such as from the police, organisations and agencies trying to prevent threats and fraud, and from the public. <a href="#chapter1">[In detail][+]</a></p>

              </ol>

              <p>We need to collect and use lots of information about you so that you can use our websites and apps, shop in our stores, buy things from us and learn about our offers and new arrivals. We also need to use some details to prevent and detect fraud.</p>

              <p>We look at and learn from your browsing, shopping and how you respond to our marketing to understand what sort of customer you are and predict what products we have that you may also be interested in. We try to show you adverts and offers we think you will like tailored to you based on stuff like your location, including what we know about you including through our apps, websites and other websites you visit, relying on the extra understanding about you which ad providers and social media platforms have collected with your consent.</p>

              <p>Our use of your details will depend on you and what you are doing: browsing or buying, if you are new to us or a registered customer. Use will be different on-line and in-store but we will try to join up details of our relationship with you in store and online in our records, even if you use different devices online. We explain our lawful reasons for use of your personal information in our detail section. You can access this by scrolling to âAdditional Detailsâ.</p>

                <li><strong>Who we share your personal information with and why</strong></li>
              </ol>

              <p>We use suppliers and service providers, such as for delivering orders, or dealing with card checks and payments. These include other group companies and external contractors. We only share the personal details they need to know for their services and we make sure your privacy is respected and protected.</p>

              <p>We share personal information with third parties when you have told us that we can share, or them that they can share, or you agree we can share your information, such as when you register to use a âStyle adviserâ function we offer which is provided by a third party, or with third party ad providers, such as social media platforms or Google, so our adverts are shown to you. We will share agreed details with third parties like Newday if you choose to use their store card, or Klarna if you choose to use their payment service, for the purpose of enabling the service which you have sought to use.</p>

              <p>We will provide personal information about you to the police, fraud prevention and credit reference agencies when we have to by law, or when we deem necessary to prevent fraud. If we decide to reorganise or sell all or most of our business, your personal information may be transferred to the buyer of the business but we will never sell your personal information to third parties for them to market their products to you. <a href="#chapter3">[In detail][+]</a></p>

              <p>Business for us and many suppliers is international so your personal information may, at times, be handled in a location outside Europe. When this occurs, we take care in ensuring the security of your information. In the event you ask us to deliver your order outside of Europe, we need to send limited details outside of Europe to fulfil this request. <a href="#chapter4">[In detail][+]</a></p>

              <p>We will only keep your personal information for a limited period of time. This period will depend on a number of reasons, such whether we still need to deliver to you, or you have an account with us, or we are providing ongoing customer care to you. Sometimes we must also keep your information by law, to deal with a regulator or where required by our insurers. We delete your personal information at your request where possible and we wonât keep it for longer than we should or need to for the provision of a service and for communicating with you. <a href="#chapter6">[In detail][+]</a></p>

              <p><strong>Concessions</strong></p>

              <p>Where you shop in one of our concessions in another retailerâs store, their systems will check and take and record payment, operate CCTV and security and Wi-Fi. They will provide us with details of your purchases for our records. Unusually, if you are involved in any suspected incident, they may share additional details with us to help us together to prevent and detect crime.</p>

              <p><strong>Cookies</strong></p>

              <p>So we are clear, cookies are the nickname for tiny text files which some websites pages place on the device you use to access them, to give us encrypted information such as to remember what you have put in your basket when shopping, your preferences, whether you have an account and what cookies you have accepted. They will not collect your name, address and payment card details but send back technical facts. They also help us to understand and sort out technical errors which sometimes happen online. We need cookies to make our websites and your device able to work well together. Some cookies are our own but we also work with carefully selected third parties to help us and who set their cookies from our website pages and to help us run our websites (these are called third party cookies). You will not be able to buy from us online and your browsing experience may not be as enjoyable if you block your device from receiving cookies.</p>

              <p>We use cookies online to do the job a good sales assistant does in store, noting what you are interested in, seeing if we can help show you where those items are, find more like them and tell you about products which work well with them. We can also tell you about special offers and promotions, just like they would.</p>

              <p>Personal information does not include information where your identity has been removed or is unknown (anonymous data). Some of this information may only be identifiable to you and personal because you are logged in to your account, or because we have collected details of your IP address or the device that you have used to access the website. Where we can, we prefer to show you adverts online which you are more likely to be interested in.</p>

              <p>Normally until you buy from us, you are an unnamed user of our website but we want to make you a customer. We work with online advertising partners to do this. They set a cookie from our webpages and this allows them to spot when you use the same device on other websites they publish ads on. They can then make sure you see an ad from us (retargeting). In some cases, the ads you see from us online will be more tailored to you (tailored or behavioural ads). This uses known and observed information about you to try and categorise you and predict what you will want to buy and which offers you will most like (profiling). This will be from our knowledge of you as a customer with us and from your use of our websites but we do not share that detailed information with those advertising partners. In other cases, it will be based on what advertising partners /social media providers know about you from their cookies and use of their websites but we do not receive the detailed
              information from these websites.</p>

              <p>You can get more information about cookies and can change your mind about cookies at any time. if you want more details or to change your mind, see our cookies notice.</p>

                <li><strong>How long we keep your information and why</strong></li>
              </ol>

              <p>We will only keep your personal information for a limited period of time. This will depend on a number of factors, including:</p>

              <ul>
                <li>whether you have placed an order with us, or have a registered account with us;</li>

                <li>any laws or regulations that we are required to follow;</li>

                <li>whether we are dealing with a current request, customer care issue or complaint;</li>

                <li>where there is a legal or other type of dispute involving or affecting you;</li>

                <li>the type of information that we hold about you; and</li>

                <li>whether we are asked by you or a regulatory authority to keep your personal data for a valid reason.</li>
              </ul>

              <p>We will keep your personal information during the period that you are a customer with us and then for as long as is necessary in connection with both our and your legal rights and obligations. This may mean that we keep some types of personal information for longer than others. Generally, if you are an inactive customer we will remove your account after 18 months.</p>

              <ol start="7">
                <li><strong>Your rights and how to use them</strong>&nbsp;</li>
              </ol>

              <p>You have rights to understand and control use of your personal information. These rights only apply to your own personal information. For all these rights:</p>

              <ul>
                <li>we must be able to verify your identity;</li>

                <li>your request must not impact the privacy rights of other people;</li>

                <li>Your request must not be excessive, very unreasonable or repeated [too often].</li>

                <li>They cannot clash with the provision of a service (for example submitting a right to erasure when we are processing an order from you)</li>
              </ul>

              <p>Many rights have limitations and exceptions, for instance, we do not have to provide you with legally privileged advice involving your personal information.</p>
