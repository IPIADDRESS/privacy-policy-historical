It also describes the choices available to you regarding the use of, your access to, and how to update and correct your personal information. “Personal Information” means information that alone or when in combination with other information may be used to readily identify, contact, or locate you, such as: name, address, email address, or phone number. We do not consider Personal Information to include information that has been anonymized such that it does not allow a third party to easily identify a specific individual.</p><p>THE SITE COLLECTS YOUR INFORMATION</p><p>We collect Personal Information when you choose to provide it to us including when you:</p><ul><li>register to use the Site;</li><li>purchase a Burrow Product on the Site;</li><li>use the Site; and</li><li>communicate with us.</li></ul><p>We also collect Personal Information by using cookies, pixels, server logs, and other similar technology as you use the Site. Please note that we may use third party service providers to help operate the Site and these third party service providers may collect Personal Information from our Site as well.</p><p><strong>Register an Account.</strong>The Site gives you the option of creating a user account (an “Account”). If you decide to create an Account, you will provide us with certain Personal Information, such as your user name and password. You are not required to register to use the Site.</p><p><strong>Purchase a Burrow Product.</strong>When you purchase a Burrow product using the Site, you are given the option of logging into an Account or checking out as a guest. In either case, when you purchase a Burrow product, you will provide us with Personal Information, such as your name, email address, and shipping address.</p><p><strong>Make a Payment.</strong>When you make a payment through the Site, you may need to provide Personal Information to our third party payment processors. Such Personal Information may include sensitive Personal Information, such as your credit card number.</p><p><strong>Submit Information to the Site.</strong>We collect information you submit to the Site. For example, when you post a review of a Burrow product on the Site or refer a friend to Burrow using the Site, the Site will collect the information in your submission to the Site, including any Personal Information. If you choose to submit content to any public area of the Site, such content will be considered “public” and will not be subject to the privacy protections set forth herein.</p><p><strong>Communicate with Us.</strong> We may also collect Personal Information from you when you communicate with us.

Please note that cookie-based opt-outs are not effective on mobile applications. However, on many mobile devices, application users may opt out of certain mobile ads via their device settings.\</p>\<p>To manage our advertising on other sites, we engage third party advertising partners. These third party partners may use technologies such as cookies to gather information about your activities on the Site and other sites in order to provide you advertising based upon your browsing activities and interests. Certain of our third party advertising partners participate in self-regulatory organizations, and those organizations operate websites that give you the ability to opt-out of receiving targeted ads from those partners. You can access these websites, and also learn more about targeted advertising and privacy, at Network Advertising or AboutAds. You can also choose not to be included in Google Analytics here.\</p>\<p>To be clear, whether you are opting out by adjusting your browser/device settings or by using a website established by a self-regulatory group, these cookie-based opt-outs must be performed on each device and browser that you wish to have opted-out. For example, if you have opted out on your computer browser, that opt-out will not be effective on your mobile device. You must separately opt out on each device.\</p>\<p>Please note that we do not respond to or honor “do not track” (a/k/a/ DNT) signals or similar mechanisms transmitted by web browsers.\</p>\<p>If you receive an unwanted email from us, you can use the unsubscribe link found at the bottom of the email to opt out of receiving future emails.
