href="mailto:support@burrow.com">support@burrow.com</a></div></div><div class="faq--wrapper"><div class="privacy"><h5>Effective Date of Current Policy: April 4, 2017</h5><p>This Privacy Policy applies to https://burrow.com/ (the “Site”) and all other websites owned and operated by Burrow Inc. The term “Burrow,” “we,” and “us” includes Burrow Inc. and our affiliates and subsidiaries.</p><p>The Privacy Policy explains how Burrow may:</p><ul><li>collect,</li><li>use, and</li><li>disclose</li></ul><p>Personal Information (defined below) we obtain through the Site, your communications with us, or from third parties. It also describes the choices available to you regarding the use of, your access to, and how to update and correct your personal information. “Personal Information” means information that alone or when in combination with other information may be used to readily identify, contact, or locate you, such as: name, address, email address, or phone number. We do not consider Personal Information to include information that has been anonymized such that it does not allow a third party to easily identify a specific individual.</p><h5>THE SITE COLLECTS YOUR INFORMATION</h5><p>We collect Personal Information when you choose to provide it to us including when you:</p><ul><li>register to use the Site;</li><li>purchase a Burrow Product on the Site;</li><li>use the Site; and</li><li>communicate with us.</li></ul><p>We also collect Personal Information by using cookies, pixels, server logs, and other similar technology as you use the Site. Please note that we may use third party service providers to help operate the Site and these third party service providers may collect Personal Information from our Site as well.</p><p>Register an Account. The Site gives you the option of creating a user account (an “Account”). If you decide to create an Account, you will provide us with certain Personal Information, such as your user name and password. You are not required to register to use the Site.</p><p>Purchase a Burrow Product. When you purchase a Burrow product using the Site, you are given the option of logging into an Account or checking out as a guest. In either case, when you purchase a Burrow product, you will provide us with Personal Information, such as your name, email address, and shipping address.</p><p>Make a Payment. When you make a payment through the Site, you may need to provide Personal Information to our third party payment processors. Such Personal Information may include sensitive Personal Information, such as your credit card number.</p><p>Submit Information to the Site. We collect information you submit to the Site. For example, when you post a review of a Burrow product on the Site or refer a friend to Burrow using the Site, the Site will collect the information in your submission to the Site, including any Personal Information. If you choose to submit content to any public area of the Site, such content will be considered “public” and will not be subject to the privacy protections set forth herein.</p><p>Communicate with Us. We may also collect Personal Information from you when you communicate with us. For example, you may send us Personal Information by writing an email to us, subscribing to the Burrow newsletter, or making a reservation for an event hosted by Burrow. If you contact us, we may keep a record of that correspondence.</p><p>Take a Survey. From time to time, we may contact you to participate in online surveys. If you do decide to participate, you may be asked to provide certain information which may include Personal Information. For example, you may be asked to provide contact information as well as information about your height, weight, gender or date of birth.</p><p>Information You Provide About a Third Party. If you choose to use any Burrow referral service to tell a friend about Burrow, we may collect your friend's Personal Information, such as name and email address. We will automatically send your friend a one-time email inviting him or her to purchase a Burrow product. We store your friend’s information in order to send this one-time email and to track the success of our referral program.</p><p>Passive Collection. The Site collects and stores information that is generated automatically as you use it, including your preferences and anonymous usage statistics. This information may include Internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, Internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, the files viewed on our site (e.g., HTML pages, graphics, etc.), operating system, date/time stamp, and/or clickstream data. We use this data to analyze trends in the aggregate and administer the site. Non-personal information that we passively collect may be combined with other information about you, including Personal Information.</p><p>Tracking Technologies. Burrow and its partners use cookies, pixels, server logs, and other similar technology to analyze trends, administer the website, track users’ movements around the website, and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. You can control the use of cookies at the individual browser level, but if you choose to disable cookies, it may limit your use of certain features or functions on our website or service. Non-personal information that we collect using these technologies may be combined with other information about you, including Personal Information.</p><p>Information Provided by Third Parties. Burrow may collect information about you from third parties or supplement the information we collect from you with additional records received from third parties. Information is collected from third parties in order to enhance our ability to serve you, to tailor our content to you, and to offer you information that we believe may be of interest to you.</p><h5>HOW BURROW USES YOUR INFORMATION</h5><p>We use Personal Information to facilitate and improve our services, and communicate with you.</p><p>Internal and Service-Related Usage.
