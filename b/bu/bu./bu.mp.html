    <div id="policy">
<p>Last revised: May 1, 2012
</p>

<p>At Bump we recognize that privacy is important. This Privacy Policy (“Policy”) applies to your use of the Bump applications on all platforms (the “Application” or “Applications”), the related services we provide (“Bump Services”) and the Site. Unless otherwise defined in this Privacy Policy, capitalized terms used in this Privacy Policy have the same meanings as in our Terms of Service (“TOS”) found at <a href="http://bu.mp/tos">http://bu.mp/tos</a>.</p>
<p>Bump Technologies, Inc. (“Bump,” “us” or “we”) has created this privacy policy (the “Policy”) to explain our privacy practices so you will understand what information about you is collected, used and disclosed with respect to the Applications, the Bump Services and the Site.</p>
<p>By using any Application, the Bump Services or the Site, you consent to the privacy practices described in this Policy.  This Privacy Policy does not cover your use of the PayPal Services in connection with your PayPal Account.  Your use of your PayPal Account and the PayPal Services is covered by the User Agreement and the PayPal Privacy Policy that you agreed to when you opened your PayPal Account, as may be amended from time to time.</p>
<p>We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to change, modify or otherwise alter this Policy at any time. You can find the most recent version of this Policy at <a href="http://bu.mp/privacy">http://bu.mp/privacy</a>, with the date of last modification noted above. Such modifications shall become effective immediately upon the posting thereof on the Site. Therefore, we encourage you to check the date of this Policy whenever you access or use an Application, the Bump Services or the Site to check if this Policy has been updated. You must review this Policy on a regular basis to keep yourself apprised of any changes. If you do not agree to any modifications to this Policy, your sole recourse is to immediately stop all use of all Applications, the Bump Services and the Site. Your continued use of any Application, the Bump Services or the Site following the posting of any modifications to this Policy will constitute your acceptance of the revised Policy. Should you have any questions regarding this Policy, please contact us at the contact information listed at the end of this Policy. Please note that none of our employees or agents has the authority to vary any of our Policies.</p>
<p>This Policy covers our collection, use and disclosure of your information through the Applications, the Bump Services and the Site. It does not cover any collection, use or disclosure by third parties through any applications, Web sites, products or services that we do not control or own, such as Facebook, or any third party features or services made available via an Application, the Bump Services or the Site, such as the PayPal Services. All trademarks, trade names, and logos of third parties featured on the Applications or the Site belong to their respective owners.</p>
<p><b>1. WHAT KIND OF INFORMATION WE COLLECT</b></p>
<p>We collect the following types of information below through your use of the Applications, the Bump Services and/or the Site.</p>
<p><b>Personal Information.</b> “Personal Information” is information that identifies you or another person, which may be transmitted or received when you use an Application, the Bump Services and/or the Site. Personal Information includes your geographic location information, names, physical addresses, email addresses, telephone, fax and other device numbers, calendar entries stored within your Device, contact entries stored within your Device, files, content, photographs, location information and other metadata in photographs and other information you transmit or receive using an Application, the Bump Services, PayPal Services and/or the Site which identifies you or another person.  Personal Information also includes information about you or others that may be accessed by our system directly from your Device, including from your address book, location, photos or contacts folder, in order to enable certain features of an Application or the Bump Services, such as the feature that finds and suggests mutual friends and other individuals who you may know.  Unless you have elected to opt-out of providing your geographic location information, the Applications may use and store information related to the geographic location of your device and combine this information with other Personal Information to provide certain services, whether or not the Application is active.</p>
<p>We collect Personal Information if you provide it directly to us via email or through the Applications, the Bump Services or the Site. We may also collect Personal Information when you send us messages, comments, questions or suggestions or if you participate in blogs, forums, message boards, chat rooms, profile pages and other services to which you are able to post information, if any, on the Site (collectively, “Forums”).  We may also collect Personal Information through certain features of one or more Applications or the Bump Services (and in some instances will allow you to opt-out of such collection or retention of certain Personal Information).  In some instances, certain Applications do not have to be in active use in order for your Personal Information to be collected through them.</p>
<p><b>Non-Personal Information.</b> “Non-Personal Information” is information that does not identify you or any other individual, and includes Session and Usage Data, Log Data and Aggregate Information, each as described below.</p>
<p><i>Session and Usage Data.</i> “Session and Usage Data” is information about your use of an Application, the Bump Services and/or the Site and&nbsp;includes, without limitation, connection and service-related data submitted to us through your use of an Application, the Bump Services or the Site. Session and Usage Data includes information relating to the connection request, server communication and data sharing, including network&nbsp;measurements, quality of service, and date, time and location of the bump. We also may aggregate Session and Usage data as described in Aggregate Information below. Please note that Session and Usage Data does not include any Personal Information nor does it include Content you may transmit or share through the use of an Application (such as photos, contacts, calendar appointments, etc.), the Bump Services, or the Site.</p>
<p><i>Log Data.</i> When you interact with us or use an Application, the Bump Services or our Site, our systems may automatically collect your unique User Device number, the IP address, type of browser or operating system you use, and the dates and times of your use (“Log Data”).</p>
<p><i>Aggregate Information.</i> “Aggregate Information” is data we collect about a group or category of services or Users from which individual User identities have been removed. In other words, information on how you use the Applications, the Bump Services and the Site may be collected and combined with information about how others use the Applications, the Bump Services and the Site, but no personally identifiable information will be included in the resulting Aggregate Information. Aggregate Information helps us understand trends in our Users' needs so that we can better consider new features or otherwise tailor the Applications, the Bump Services and the Site.</p>

In some instances, we may combine Non-Personal Information with Personal Information (such as combining your name with your unique User Device number). If we combine any Non-Personal Information with Personal Information, the combined information will be treated by us as Personal Information as long as it is combined.</p>
<p>We may display targeted advertisements based on Personal Information. Advertisers (including ad serving companies) may assume that people who interact with, view, or click targeted ads meet certain targeting criteria, such as females between 18-24 years of age from a particular geographic area.

The Site may also carry advertisements from other companies. When you click on links of third parties in an Application, the Bump Services or the Site, you may leave the Application, the Bump Services or the Site. Some of these third party sites may be co-branded with our name/logo or our affiliated entity's name/logo, even though they are not operated or maintained by us. This Policy does not address, and we are not responsible for, the privacy practices of Web sites operated by third parties, whether they are linked to or otherwise accessible from an Application, the Bump Services or the Site. The inclusion of a link or accessibility of third party Web sites does not imply endorsement of such third party Web site by us.
