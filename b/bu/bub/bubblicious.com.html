            <h1><br>PRIVACY STATEMENT</h1>
            
<p>Cadbury Adams USA LLC ("we," "us," "our") respects 
your privacy and is committed to protecting your personally identifiable information. 
We have adopted this privacy policy ("Privacy Policy") to explain what 
information may be collected on this site ("Site") and how such information 
may be used and/or shared with others. This Privacy Policy applies solely to information 
collected through this Site and not through any other sources. This Privacy Policy 
is subject to the terms and conditions posted on this Site ("Terms and Conditions"). 
Please return to this Site and review this Privacy Policy from time to time, as 
it may be amended without notice. Any changes to this Privacy Policy will be effective 
immediately upon the posting of the revised Privacy Policy on this Site. Your 
use of the Site constitutes your agreement to the terms and conditions set forth 
in this Privacy Policy.<br>
<br>
<b>YOUR INFORMATION AND HOW WE USE IT</b><br>
<br>
This Site collects two kinds of information: (1) information that personally identifies 
you (such as your name and e-mail address); and (2) information that does not 
personally identify you (such as the number of users who log on to the Site on 
a daily basis). As a general policy, no personally identifiable information is 
automatically collected from your visit to this Site. However, in certain circumstances, 
you may be asked to provide us with some specific information about yourself in 
order to use specific features on the Site, such as sweepstakes, contests, surveys 
and other promotions. Such information may include contact information (such as 
your name and/or e-mail address), and other information as we may require. The 
personally identifiable information you submit will be used to carry out your 
requests and respond to your inquiries. To accomplish this, we may share your 
personally identifiable information with third parties that perform functions 
on our behalf (or on behalf of our partners), such as companies or individuals 
that deliver merchandise, participate in our promotions, administer our promotions, 
provide marketing or promotional assistance, analyze data or provide customer 
service (but such information will be shared only to the extent they need such 
information to perform their functions). Your personally identifiable information 
may also be used by us or shared with our parent, subsidiaries and affiliates 
to provide you with product information, and promotional and other offers. You 
may always direct us (by contacting us at the address listed below) not to share 
your personally identifiable information with these parties or not to use your 
personally identifiable information to provide you with such information or offers. 
We may also use your information as otherwise disclosed at the point where such 
information is collected or in any additional terms and conditions applicable 
to the particular feature of the Site. Except as provided herein, your personally 
identifiable information will not be provided to any third parties without prior 
approval from you.<br>
<br>
From time to time, we may collect non-personally identifiable information from 
you through the standard operation of our servers. Such information can include 
the type of browser being used (e.g., Netscape Navigator, Internet Explorer), 
the operating system you are using (e.g., Windows 95, Windows 98, Macintosh), 
the domain name of your Internet service provider (e.g., America Online, Compuserve), 
and the number of users that visit a specific page on the Site and the character 
and duration of such visits. This information may be used to help analyze site 
traffic and improve our services. We may also aggregate such information to create 
statistical data and share it with potential advertisers, partners, affiliates 
and other third parties. At no point, however, will the aggregated information 
personally identify you.<br>
<br>
We reserve the right to disclose any personally identifiable or non-personally 
identifiable information if we are required to do so by law or if we reasonably 
believe that such action is necessary in order to: (a) fulfill a government request; 
(b) conform with the requirements of the law or to comply with legal process served 
on us; (c) to protect or defend the legal rights or property of Cadbury Adams 
USA LLC, this Site, or its users; or (d) in an emergency to protect the health 
and safety of this Site’s users or the general public.<br>
<br>
<b>CHILDREN UNDER 13</b><br>
<br>
This Site is operated in compliance with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection 
Act. We do not request children under the age of 13 to provide more personally 
identifiable information than is reasonably necessary to participate in an activity 
on the Site. For example, with respect to sweepstakes, we only request children’s 
e-mail addresses to allow them to participate. In any event, Children under the 
age of 13 should not provide any personally identifiable information on the Site 
without the knowledge and permission of a parent or guardian. If (at the point 
where a user’s personally identifiable information is collected) we determine 
that such user is under the age of 13, the personally identifiable information 
provided by such user will not be used or maintained without the consent of his/her 
parent or guardian. In certain circumstances, we may require children under the 
age of 13 to provide us with the contact information for their parent or legal 
guardian. We will use this information (i) to notify such parents or legal guardians 
of their children’s participation in an activity on the Site and of our privacy 
practices, and/or (ii) to seek consent to their children’s participation 
in an activity on the Site. Without his/her parent’s or legal guardian’s 
permission, a child under the age of 13 may not be able to participate in certain 
activities. A parent or legal guardian can request that we remove, change or refuse 
further submission of information relating to a child under the age of 13 by sending 
an e-mail to privacypolicy@am.csplc.com or by contacting us at 1-800-648-0027. 
Any such request must contain the child’s name, address and e-mail address 
so we can locate such child’s information.<br>
<br>
<b>IP ADDRESS</b><br>
<br>
An IP address is a number that’s automatically assigned to your computer 
whenever you’re surfing the Web. Web servers, the big computers that "serve 
up" Web pages, automatically identify your computer by its IP address. We 
collect IP addresses for purposes of system administration, to report aggregate 
information to our advertisers, and to track the use of the Site. When visitors 
request pages from the Site, our servers log the visitors’ IP addresses. 
It is not our practice to link IP addresses to anything personally identifiable, 
which means that a visitor’s session will be logged, but the visitor remains 
anonymous to us. However, we reserve the right to use IP addresses to identify 
a visitor only when we feel it is necessary to enforce compliance with the Site’s 
policies or to protect our service or customers, the Site, or others.<br>
<br>
<b>COOKIES </b><br>
<br>
"Cookies" are small text files from a Web site that are stored on your 
hard drive. These small text files make using a Web site more convenient by saving 
your passwords and preferences for you. Cookies themselves do not contain any 
personally identifiable information. We may analyze the information derived from 
these cookies and match such information with data provided by you or another 
party. We may provide our analysis and certain non-personally identifiable information 
to potential partners, advertisers (who may use this information to provide advertisements 
tailored to your interests) or other third parties, but we will not disclose any 
personally identifiable information, except as provided in this Privacy Policy. 
<br>
<br>
Also, we may allow third parties that serve advertisements on our Site (including 
our promotion partners) to place and access cookies on your computer, but they 
will not be able to access our cookies. The use of cookies by such third parties 
are not subject to our Privacy Policy, but are subject to their own respective 
privacy policies.<br>
<br>
You can have the option of deciding whether or not to accept a cookie by resetting 
your browser to notify you whenever a cookie is being sent to your hard drive. 
You may also delete a cookie manually from your hard drive. Please note, however, 
that some parts of this Site will not function properly or will be considerably 
slower if you refuse to accept a cookie or choose to disable your cookies settings.<br>
<br>
<b>KEEPING YOUR INFORMATION SECURE</b><br>
<br>
We have reasonable and appropriate security measures in place to protect against 
the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control. Please be 
advised, however, that while we strive to protect your personally identifiable 
information and privacy, we cannot guarantee or warrant the security of any information 
you disclose or transmit to us online and cannot be responsible for the theft, 
destruction, or inadvertent disclosure of your personally identifiable information. 
<br>
<br>
<b>TRANSFER OF ASSETS</b><br>
<br>
As we continue to develop our business, we may sell or purchase assets. If another 
entity acquires us or all or substantially all of our assets, personally identifiable 
information, non-personally identifiable information, and any other information 
that we have collected about the users of the Site will be transferred to such 
entity as one of the transferred assets. Also, if any bankruptcy or reorganization 
proceeding is brought by or against us, all such information may be considered 
an asset of ours and as such may be sold or transferred to third parties.<br>
<br>
<b>OTHER SITES</b><br>
<br>
This Site may contain links to other web sites that we do not control or maintain. 
We are not responsible for the privacy practices employed by these other web sites. 
We encourage you to note when you leave this Site and to read the privacy statements 
of such other web sites before submitting any personally identifiable information. 
In addition, this Site may link to web sites owned or operated by third parties. 
Please note that the other third party web sites are subject to the privacy policies 
posted on those sites. <br>
