  	  		<p><em>Please note that from time to time we may review and modify our Privacy Policy. As your visits to the Site will be subject to the Privacy Policy in effect at the time of your visit, please review this Privacy Policy regularly to ensure that you are aware of any modifications.</em></p>
<p>This policy is effective as of and was last updated on January 12, 2013.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>General</strong><br>
This privacy policy (“Privacy Policy”) is designed to inform you about the type of information that Qology Direct (“Company”, “we,” “our” or “us”) may gather about or collect from you in connection with your use of Qology Direct (this “Site”). It also is intended to explain the conditions under which we use and disclose that information, and your rights in relation to that information.</li>
<li><strong>Children&nbsp;</strong><br>
This Site is not intended for children under 18 years of age. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 18.</li>
<li><strong>Gathering, Use and Disclosure of Non-Personally-Identifying Information</strong><br>
We collect both Non-Personally-Identifying Information and Personally-Identifying Information from you. “Non-Personally-Identifying Information” is information that, without the aid of additional information, cannot be directly associated with a specific person or entity. “Personally-Identifying Information,” by contrast, is information such as a name or email address that, without more, can be directly associated with a specific person or entity.<p></p>
<ol>
<li><em><strong>Gathering Non-Personally-Identifying Information</strong></em>
<ol>
<li><em><strong>Web Browsers</strong></em><br>
Like most site operators, we gather from you Non-Personally-Identifying Information of the sort that web browsers, depending on their settings, may make available. That information includes your Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, operating system and browser type, and the locations of the web pages that you view right before arriving at, while navigating and immediately after leaving this Site.</li>
<li><em><strong>Web Cookies&nbsp;</strong></em><br>
A&nbsp;<strong>“Web Cookie”</strong>&nbsp;is a string of information that a site stores on your computer, and that your browser provides to this Site each time you submit a query to this site. We use Web Cookies to track the pages that you visit during each Site session, both to help us improve your experiences with this Site and to help us understand how this Site is being used.IF YOU DO NOT WISH TO HAVE WEB COOKIES PLACED ON YOUR COMPUTER, YOU SHOULD SET YOUR BROWSER TO REFUSE WEB COOKIES BEFORE ACCESSING THIS SITE, WITH THE UNDERSTANDING THAT CERTAIN FEATURES OF THIS SITE MAY NOT FUNCTION PROPERLY WITHOUT THE AID OF WEB COOKIES. IF YOU REFUSE WEB COOKIES, YOU ASSUME ALL RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY RESULTING LOSS OF FUNCTIONALITY.</li>
<li><em><strong>Google Interest Based Advertising Program&nbsp;</strong></em><br>
In order to enhance your experience when you visit our website, we participate in the Google Interest-based Advertising Program (the “Program”) to insure that the advertisements on our website correspond to your interests. We do this by working with Google and other Program participants who, like us, place ads on our website and those of other Program Participants. We then share the information we collect using cookies placed in your browser in order to provide you with targeted advertising when you visit our websites. You may opt out of Google’s use of cookies by visiting the Google Advertising Opt Out Page:http://www.google.com/privacy_ads.html</li>
<li><em><strong>Web Beacons&nbsp;</strong></em><br>
A&nbsp;<strong>“Web Beacon”</strong>&nbsp;is an object that is embedded in a web page. It is usually invisible to you but allows site operators to check whether you have viewed a particular web page or email communication. We may occasionally place Web Beacons on pages of this Site. You may not decline Web Beacons. However, they may be rendered ineffective by declining all cookies or modifying your browser setting to notify you each time a cookie is tendered and permit you to accept or decline cookies on an individual basis.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><em><strong>Use of Non-Personally-Identifying Information&nbsp;</strong></em><br>
We analyze Non-Personally-Identifying Information gathered from you to help us better understand how this Site is being used. By identifying patterns and trends in usage, we are able to better design this Site to improve your experiences, both in terms of content and ease of use. We link information gathered using Web Cookies and Web Beacons to Personally-Identifying Information.</li>
<li><em><strong>Disclosure of Non-Personally-Identifying Information&nbsp;</strong></em><br>
From time to time, we may also release the Non-Personally-Identifying Information gathered from you in the aggregate, such as by publishing a report on trends in the usage of this Site.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><em><strong>Collection, Use and Disclosure of Personally-Identifying Information</strong></em><br>
As defined above, Personally-Identifying Information is information that can be directly associated with a specific person or entity.
