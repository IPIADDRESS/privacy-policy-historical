What information does Rakuten.com collect from you?
</a>
</span>
<br>
In order to better provide you with numerous products and services, Rakuten.com collects two types of information about its visitors: Personally Identifiable Information and Non-Personally Identifiable Information. Our primary goal in collecting information from you is to provide you with a smooth, efficient, and customized experience while using our site. 
<p>
<span class="techblue">
<i>Personally Identifiable Information</i>
</span>
<br>
Personally Identifiable Information is information that lets us know the specifics of who you are. We may collect Personally Identifiable Information when you register and set up an account, order a product or service, register for a Gift List, enter contests or sweepstakes, apply for the Rakuten.com branded credit card, fill out surveys, and send us feedback. For example, Personally Identifiable Information might include your name, billing address, shipping address, telephone number, e-mail address, credit card or other payment information, and product details. With this information, Rakuten.com can fill your orders and better provide you with personalized services. For a few services, we may collect your Personally Identifiable Information on behalf of other merchants and share it with them. For example, on our Cellular Store, we may ask you for your social security number, driver's license number and date of birth and share that information with the third-party telephone service provider that you have selected. <i>If you visit one of the stores available through a link on our site, then you should be aware that they will independently collect, use and share your Personally Identifiable Information in accordance with their own privacy policies.</i> If you have questions about their information practices, then please read their privacy policies. In many cases, you can find a link to their privacy policies on the page offering the Partners' services.  
</p>
<p>
<span class="techblue">
<i>Non-Personally Identifiable Information</i>
</span>
<br>
Non-Personally Identifiable Information refers to information that does not by itself identify a specific individual. We gather certain information about you in several ways, based upon where you shop on our site. This information is compiled and analyzed on both a personal basis and an aggregated basis. For example, this information may include the Web site's Uniform Resource Locator ("URL") that you just came from, which URL you next go to, what browser you are using, and your Internet Protocol ("IP") address. A URL is the global address of documents and other resources on the World Wide Web. An IP address is an identifier for a computer or device on a Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol ("TCP/IP") network, such as the World Wide Web. Networks like the Web use the TCP/IP protocol to route information based on the IP address of the destination. In other words, an IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you are surfing the web, allowing web servers to locate and identify your computer. Computers require IP addresses in order for users to communicate on the Internet, browse and shop. 
</p>
<p>
On an aggregated basis, we collect anonymous data related to the pages, products, downloads and other content that is sampled, clicked on, streamed, searched for, transferred from and downloaded. Except as otherwise limited in this Policy, we may disclose, sell, trade, or rent Non-Personally Identifiable Information to others without your consent.  
</p></li><p>
</p><li>
<span class="techblue">
<a name="wheredo">
Where do we collect information from you and how do we use it?
</a>
</span>
<br>
Our primary goal in collecting personal information is to provide Rakuten.com's visitors with a superior customized online experience. We use the customer contact information to fill orders, contact purchasers to inform them of their order status, to send promotional information, to enhance the operation of our site and administer our systems.
<p></p>
<p>
Demographic data also may be collected at our site from third party advertising servers, content servers, or web site analysis agents who provide us with the zip code and area code associated with a visitor's server, along with pages viewed on our site. We review the actions of the Rakuten.com visitors on an aggregate basis to determine customers' preferences. Rakuten.com also does research on our visitors' demographics, interests, and pages that they viewed, based upon the information provided that they have provided to us during ordering, a promotion, from our server log files, from our web site analysis agents, or from contests, drawings or surveys. We will use this data to tailor the visitor's experience at our site, to improve our marketing and promotional efforts, to statistically analyze site use, to improve our product offerings, and to customize our site's content, layout, and services. We receive reports from third party ad servers, content servers, or web site analysis agents that tell us how many ads were presented and clicked upon or what content was served or viewed.
</p>
<p>
We may also share your Personally Identifiable Information with third parties who provide services to us. Those third parties include authorized contractors, temporary employees and consultants and other companies working with us (collectively, "agents"). Those third parties will independently collect, use and share your Personally Identifiable Information in accordance with their own privacy policies, and are not subject to this Privacy Policy. If you have questions about their information practices, then please read their privacy policies. Where we believe it to be appropriate (in our sole discretion), we will ask our agents not to disclose or use your personal information for purposes other than to provide services to you or Rakuten.com.
</p>
<p>
We gather information in the following ways: 
</p>
<p>
<span class="techblue">
<i>Shopping</i>
</span>
<br>
We collect Non-Personally Identifiable Information from you while you are shopping on the Rakuten.com site.  That Non-personally Identifiable Information may include IP addresses for the purposes of system administration, to gather broad demographic information, to enable ads to be served on our site, to report Non-Personally Identifiable Information to our advertisers, and to monitor the level of activity on our site. We collect this information from visitors to our site regarding the URLs they came from, domain types (e.g., .com or .org), their IP addresses, the date and time of their visit or order, the number of visits and orders, the number of visits per browsing session, the server type, the operating system and browser type used to come to the site, the country, state and telephone area code where their servers are located, the pages and page titles of our site that visitors viewed during their visit, whether the visitor's computer is enabled for Java or cookies, browser language, applications and plug-ins, and any search terms entered on our site.
</p><p>
<span class="techblue">
<i>Ordering</i>
</span>
<br>
When you order from us, we collect Personally Identifiable Information from you. If you order one of our products or services, then we will collect and maintain your name, e-mail address, billing address, shipping address, telephone number, product selections, credit card or other payment information, order number, referring URL, IP address, page you bought from and a password. We collect this information, and other Personally Identifiable Information as disclosed in this Policy, in order to fill your order, to communicate with you about your order and to send you promotional materials. Before confirming your order, you will have the opportunity to review the product order form and make changes and additions to the information it contains and these changes will be automatically kept for future use. We may require additional verifications or information from you before accepting any order.
</p>
<p>
<span class="techblue">
<i>Gift Registry</i>
</span>
<br>
If you decide to create a Gift List through our site, then we will collect Personally Identifiable Information about you.  You will create an account where we will collect and use your name, e-mail address, credit card or other payment information, billing and shipping address, phone number, password and product preferences. This information is subject to the terms of this Privacy Policy except as explained here. Other site users will be able to search for your Gift List using your e-mail address, unless you choose not to make your Gift List searchable. Those who do have access to your Gift List will be able to see Personally Identifiable Information, including your name, e-mail address, city, state, and may also have access to other personal information and product information that you have entered into the Gift List. If others place orders for items on your Gift List, then they may have access to your address. We will use the product preferences that you include in your Gift List to inform you about offers that may be of interest to you. If you provide us with the e-mail addresses of your family and friends, then we will use their e-mail addresses to send them your Gift List if you instruct us to do so. With your permission, we will send them the Gift List using your e-mail address as the originating address. We will not use the e-mail addresses of your family and friends for any other purpose.
</p><p>
<span class="techblue">
<i>Gift Certificates</i>
</span>
<br>
If you purchase a gift certificate from our site, then you will need to give us the recipient's name and e-mail address if you wish to send the certificate by e-mail. If you wish to send a certificate by regular mail, then you will need to give us the name, mailing information and phone number for the recipient. The recipient information you give us will only be used to send the gift certificate and for no other purpose.
</p>
<p>
<span class="techblue"><i>Financing</i>
</span>
<br>				
You may apply for a Rakuten.com branded credit card on our site. The credit card is administered by a third party bank and Rakuten.com's privacy policy does not apply to any information that you provide to apply for the credit card or to purchases you make with that card.
</p>
<p>
<span class="techblue">
<i>Cellular Store Orders</i>
</span>
<br>
On our Cellular Store, we may collect such Personally Identifiable Information as your social security number, driver's license, date of birth and other specific information on behalf of the cellular telephone service provider that you have selected. We also use a third party to fulfill your Cellular Store orders. We may use and transfer to our Cellular Store fulfillment partners and to the cellular telephone service provider such information together with your other Personally Identifiable Information as needed by them to fulfill any orders that you may place. The cellular telephone service providers may use and share that Personally Identifiable Information in accordance with their own privacy policies. Please review the privacy policy of your cellular telephone service provider to understand how your Personally Identifiable Information may be used and disclosed by that cellular telephone service provider.
</p>
<p><span class="techblue">
<i>Digital Downloads</i>
</span>
<br>
When you order a download or a product from us we collect Personally Identifiable Information from you. We will collect and maintain Personally Identifiable Information such as your name, e-mail address, billing and shipping address, company name, company, home, facsimile and shipping contact telephone numbers, music selections, credit card or other payment information, order number, referring URL, IP address, page you bought from and a password. We collect this Personally Identifiable Information and other information as disclosed in this Policy in order to deliver the download, ship products to you, to pay royalties and license fees, to administer our site and to send you promotional materials. When you download a digital file or other digital content, there are broad but necessary limits placed by the owner of that digital content that may restrict how you copy, use and transfer that download to approved computers, electronic devices and media. In the future, those limits might be extended by the owner of the digital content in exchange for your agreement to allow use of your Personally Identifiable Information by that owner in creative ways (e.g. download a sponsor's screensaver to your cellphone or other electronic devices).
</p>
<p>
<span class="techblue">
<i>Online Surveys and Polling</i>
</span>
<br>
In order to improve our services to you, we ask some of our customers to voluntarily complete surveys that may be collected by an independent third party. Individual survey answers are confidential although Non-Personally Identifiable Information is collected and disclosed to third parties. If you do not wish to participate in a survey, then you should simply decline to participate when asked.
</p>
<p>
<span class="techblue">
<i>Contests and Sweepstakes</i>
</span>
<br>
When you enter a contest or other promotion, we may ask you for Personally Identifiable Information such as your name, address and e-mail address. We may request this Personally Identifiable Information in order to administer the contest, to send you promotional e-mails, notify winners or to make the winners' list publicly available pursuant to certain states' laws. Your consent to such promotional use and disclosure of this Personally Identifiable Information may be a condition of your participation. For example, as a condition of receiving any prize you are likely to be required to submit an Affidavit of Eligibility for us to ensure your eligibility to receive the prize according to the Contest Rules.
</p>
<p>
<span class="techblue">
<i>Newsletters, Promotional E-mails and Personalized On-line Ads</i>
</span>
<br>
As a service to our customers, we offer free newsletters, such as promotional e-mails and personalized on-line advertisements. We will send you newsletters and e-mails periodically listing current specials and deals. You may "opt-out," or unsubscribe from our newsletters, emails or personalized on-line advertisements either by following any unsubscribe instructions contained in any e-mail, newsletter or personalized on-line advertisement that you receive from us, or by sending an e-mail to or by sending an e-mail to <a href="mailto:optout@mail.rakuten.com" class="blue">optout@mail.rakuten.com</a>.  Once you have opted out of receiving all newsletters, all promotional emails or all personalized on-line ads, then you will not receive any future promotional emails, newsletters or personalized on-line advertisements (as applicable) unless you then open a new account, enter a contest, or otherwise subsequently sign up to receive newsletters, emails or personalized on-line advertisements. <strong>Please Note: If you agree to receive e-mails from any of our third party service providers or any third party merchants on our site, then you will receive e-mails separately from them and all information that you choose to disclose to them will be subject to their privacy policy. If you later decide that you no longer want to receive their e-mails, then you will need to follow their own specific opt-out instructions. Following the directions for opting out of disclosing Personally Identifiable Information to Rakuten.com will not opt you out of third party disclosures and their promotional emails.</strong>
</p>
<p>
<span class="techblue">
<i>Contact Information and Third Party Data</i>
</span>
<br>					
If you contact Rakuten.com or our customer service representatives by telephone, e-mail or letter, then we may keep a record of your correspondence or comments. If you report a problem with our site, then we may collect such information in a file specific to you. If you contact us through our feedback area or by calling one of our customer service representatives, then we may ask for your name, e-mail address and order information in order to send you a reply. If other users or third parties send us correspondence about your activities or purchases on our site, then we may keep the information in a file specific to you. The information collected about you in these cases may include your Personally Identifiable Information.
</p>
<p>
<span class="techblue">
<i>Customer Service</i>
</span>
<br>
We use a third party to help us provide customer service. In order to help you most effectively, we provide them with your order information, which includes Personally Identifiable Information.
</p>
<p>
<span class="techblue">
<i>Warranty Information</i>
</span>

</p>
<p>
<span class="techblue">
<i>Advertising</i>
</span>
<br>
We may display advertisements on our site, both our own advertisements and third party advertisements. By knowing a little about you and by using that Personally Identifiable Information, Rakuten.com is able to deliver more relevant advertisements and content to you in the form of targeted banners and promotions. For example, advertisers give us an advertisement and tell us the type of audience they want to reach. Rakuten.com takes the advertisement and includes it in a Rakuten.com e-mail to prior customers whose Personally Identifiable Information indicates that they meet that criterion. We may also use Personally Identifiable Information to allow our advertising partners to assist us in delivering personalized on-line ads to you by using cookies while you are on the Internet. We also display third party advertising, where third-party servers display ads linked to certain search terms that you have entered or to certain pages that you are viewing. In this process, advertisers never have access to Personally Identifiable Information or to individual account information. Rakuten.com may share Non-personally Identifiable Information or aggregated data with advertisers. 
</p>
<p>
<span class="techblue">

<br>
We also track customers' Personally Identifiable Information such as traffic patterns throughout their online session, including which pages, information and advertisements that a customer views while using the site and what items that they place in their basket or purchase.

We may share Non-personally Identifiable Information such as aggregated statistics about pages viewed on our site, sales and other shopping information with third parties.
