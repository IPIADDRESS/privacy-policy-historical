					<span class="techblue"><li><a name="whatinfo">What information does Buy.com collect from you?</a><br>
					In order to better provide you with numerous products and services, Buy.com collects two types of information 
					about its visitors: Personally Identifiable Information and Non-Personally Identifiable Information.  Our 
					primary goal in collecting information from you is to provide you with a smooth, efficient, and customized 
					experience while using our site.  
					
					<p><span class="techblue"><i>Personally Identifiable Information</i></span><br>
					This refers to information that lets us know the specifics of who you are. Personal information is 
					requested when you order a product or service, register for a Gift List, enter contests or sweepstakes, 
					apply for the Buy.com credit card, fill out surveys, and send us feedback. For example, this information might include 
					your name, billing address, shipping address, telephone number, e-mail address, credit card or other 
					payment information, and product details. With this information, Buy.com can fill your orders and better 
					provide you with personalized services. For a few services, we may collect your personal information 
					on behalf of other merchants and share it with them. For example, on our Cellular Store, we may ask you 
					for your social security number, driver's license number and date of birth and share that information 
					with the third-party telephone service provider that you have selected. <i>If you visit one of the stores 
					available through a link on our site, they will independently collect, use and 
					share your personal information in accordance with their own privacy policies.</i> If you have questions 
					about their information practices, please read their privacy policies. In many cases, you can find a 
					link to their privacy policies on the page offering the Partners' services. 

					</p><p><span class="techblue"><i>Non-Personally Identifiable Information</i></span><br>
					This refers to information that does not by itself identify a specific individual.  
					We gather certain information about you based upon where you shop on our site in several ways.  
					This information is compiled and analyzed on both a personal and an aggregated basis.  For example, 
					this information may include the Web site's Uniform Resource Locator ("URL") that you just came from, 
					which URL you next go to, what browser you are using, and your Internet Protocol ("IP") address.  A URL 
					is the global address of documents and other resources on the World Wide Web.  An IP address is an identifier 
					for a computer or device on a Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol ("TCP/IP") network, such as the 
					World Wide Web.  Networks like the Web use the TCP/IP protocol to route information based on the IP address 
					of the destination.  In other words, an IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer 
					whenever you are surfing the web, allowing web servers to locate and identify your computer.  Computers require 
					IP addresses in order for users to communicate on the Internet, browse and shop.
					
					</p><p><span class="techblue"></span></p></li><li><a name="wheredo">Where do we collect information from you and how do we use it?</a><br>
					Our primary goal in collecting personal information is to provide Buy.com's visitors with a superior customized online 
					experience.  We use the customer contact information to fill orders, contact purchasers to inform them of their order 
					status, to send promotional information, to enhance the operation of our site and administer our systems. 
					
					<p>Demographic data also may be collected at our site from third party advertising servers, content servers, 
					or web site analysis agents who provide us with the zip code and area code associated with a visitor's server, along with pages 
					viewed on our site.  We review the actions of the Buy.com visitors on an aggregate basis to determine 
					customers' preferences.  Buy.com also does research on our visitors' demographics, interests, and pages 
					viewed based on the information provided to us during ordering, a promotion, from our server log files, from our 
					web site analysis agents, or from contests, drawings or surveys.  We will use this data to tailor the visitor's experience at our site, 
					to improve our marketing and promotional efforts, to statistically analyze site use, to improve our product 
					offerings, and to customize our site's content, layout, and services.  We receive reports from third 
					party ad servers, content servers, or web site analysis agents that tells us how many ads were presented
					 and clicked upon or what content was served or viewed. 
					
					</p><p>We may also share your personally identifiable information with third parties who provide services to us, 
					our customers and web site visitors.  Those third parties include authorized contractors, temporary employees 
					and consultants and other companies working with us (collectively, "agents").  Where we believe it to be 
					appropriate (in our sole discretion), we will ask our agents not to disclose or use your personal information 
					for purposes other than to provide services to you or Buy.com.
					
					</p><p>We gather information in the following ways:
					
					</p><p><span class="techblue"><i>Shopping</i></span><br>
					We collect IP addresses for the purposes of system administration, to gather broad demographic information, 
					to enable ads to be served on our site, to report Non-Personally Identifiable Information to our advertisers, 
					and to monitor the level of activity on our site.  We collect information from visitors to our site regarding 
					the URLs they came from, domain types (e.g., .com or .org), their IP addresses, the date and time of their visit 
					or order, the number of visits and orders, the number of visits per browsing session, the server type, the operating 
					system and browser type used to come to the site, the country, state and telephone area code where their servers are 
					located, the pages and page titles of our site that visitors viewed during their visit, whether the visitor's computer 
					is enabled for Java or cookies, browser language, applications and plug-ins, and any search terms entered on our site. 
					
					</p><p><span class="techblue"><i>Ordering</i></span><br>
					When you order from us, we collect personally identifiable information from you.  If you order one of our products 
					or services, we will collect and maintain your name, e-mail address, billing address, shipping address, telephone 
					number, product selections, credit card or other payment information, order number, referring URL, IP address, 
					page you bought from and a password.  We collect this, and other information, as disclosed in this Policy, in 
					order to fill your order, to communicate with you about your order and to send you promotional materials.  
					Before confirming your order, you will have the opportunity to review the product order form and make changes 
					and additions to the information it contained and these changes will be automatically kept for future use.
					
					</p><p></p><p><span class="techblue"><i>Gift Registry</i></span><br>
					If you decide to create a Gift List through our site, you will create an account, where we will collect and use 
					your name, e-mail address, credit card or other payment information, billing and shipping address, phone number, 
					password and product preferences.  This information is subject to the terms of this Privacy Policy except as 
					explained here.  Others will be able to search for your Gift List using your e-mail address unless you choose 
					not to make your Gift List searchable.  Those who have access to your Gift List will be able to see your name, 
					e-mail address, city, state, and may have access to other personal information and product information that you 
					have entered into the Gift List.  If others place orders for items on your Gift List, they may have access to your 
					address.  We will use the product preferences that you include in your Gift List to inform you about offers that may 
					be of interest to you.  If you provide us with the e-mail addresses of your family and friends, we will use their 
					e-mail addresses to send them your Gift List if you instruct us to.  With your permission, we will send them the 
					Gift List using your e-mail address as the originating address.  We will not use the e-mail addresses of your 
					family and friends for any other purpose. 
					
					</p><p></p><p><span class="techblue"><i>Gift Certificates</i></span><br>
					If you purchase a gift certificate from our site, you will give us the recipient's name and e-mail 
					address if you wish to send the certificate by e-mail.  If you wish to send a certificate by 
					regular mail, you will give us the name, mailing information and phone number for the recipient.  
					The recipient information you give us will only be used to send the gift certificate and for no other purpose. 
					
					</p><p></p><p><i><span class="techblue">Financing</span></i><br>				
					You may apply for a Buy.com Visa credit card on our site. The credit card is administered by a 
					third party bank and Buy.com's privacy policy does not apply to information you provide to apply for the credit 
					card or to purchases you make with that card. Please

					to see the credit card company's privacy policy.
					
					</p><p><span class="techblue"><i>Cellular Store Orders</i></span><br>

					on behalf of the cellular telephone service provider that you have selected. We will transfer that 
					information to them and use your other personal information to fulfill any future orders that you may place. 
					They will use and share that information in accordance with their own privacy policies. To see AT&amp;T's

					</p><p></p><p><span class="techblue"><i>Online Surveys and Polling</i></span><br>
					In order to improve our services to you, we ask some of our customers to voluntarily complete surveys, 
					which may be collected by an independent third party.  Individual survey answers are confidential, although 
					Non-Personally Identifiable Information is collected and disclosed to third parties.  If you do not wish to 
					participate in a survey, simply decline to participate when asked.  
					
					</p><p></p><p><span class="techblue"><i>Contests and Sweepstakes</i></span><br>
					When you enter a contest or other promotion, we may ask you for contact information such as your name, 
					address and e-mail address in order to administer the contest, to send you promotional e-mails, notify 
					winners and make the winners' list publicly available pursuant to certain states' laws.  Your consent to 
					such promotional use and disclosure of this information as a condition of your participation.  As a condition 
					of receiving any prize, you will be required to submit an Affidavit of Eligibility, for us to ensure that 
					you are eligible to receive the prize according to the Contest Rules.
					
					</p><p></p><p><span class="techblue"><i>Newsletters &amp; Promotional E-mails</i></span><br>
					We offer free newsletters, such as our Buy.com magazine, and promotional e-mails as a service to our customers.  We will send you 
					newsletters and e-mails periodically listing current specials and deals.  To stop receiving our 
					newsletter, send an e-mail to us at <a href="MAILTO:optout@buy.com" class="techblue">optout@buy.com</a>.
					
					</p><p></p><p><span class="techblue"><i>Contact Information and Third Party Data</i></span><br>					
					If you contact Buy.com or our customer service representatives by telephone, e-mail or letter, 
					we may keep a record of your correspondence or comments.  If you report a problem with our site, 
					we may collect such information in a file specific to you.  If you contact us through our feedback 
					area or by calling one of our customer service representatives, we may ask for your name, e-mail 
					address and order information in order to send you a reply.  If other users or third parties send 
					us correspondence about your activities or purchases on our site, we may keep the information in a file specific to you.  
					
					</p><p></p><p><span class="techblue"><i>Customer Service</i></span><br>		
					We use a third party to help us provide customer service.  In order to help you most effectively, 
					we provide them with your order information.  
					
					</p><p></p><p><span class="techblue"><i>Warranty Information</i></span><br>
					Our warranty programs are administered and operated by third party warranty companies.  When you purchase a warranty, from them 
					we pass along your name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, warranty purchased and information 
					about the product purchased to the warranty company so that they can provide their service to you.
					
					</p><p></p><p><span class="techblue"><i>Affiliate Program</i></span><br>
					Our Affiliate Program (Affiliate Connection) is administered by a third party, on a third party's Web site.  
					Any information collected by them is not governed by this Policy.  
					
					</p><p></p><p><span class="techblue"><i>Advertising</i></span><br>
					We may display advertisements on our site.  By knowing a little about you, Buy.com will be able to deliver 
					more relevant advertisements and content to you in the form of targeted banners and promotions.  
					For example, advertisers give us an advertisement and tell us the type of audience they want to 
					reach (e.g., buyers of Palm Pilots).  Buy.com takes the advertisement and includes it in a Buy.com 
					e-mail to prior customers meeting that criterion.  We may also have third-party advertising servers 
					display ads linked to certain search terms that you have entered, or to certain pages that you are viewing.  
					In this process, advertisers never have access to individual account information.  Additionally, Buy.com 
					may share aggregated data with advertisers.  
					
					</p><p>We also track customers' traffic patterns throughout their online session, including which pages, 
					information and advertisements a customer views while using the site and what items they place 
					in their basket or purchase.  We use your IP address to diagnose problems with our servers, software, 
					to administer our site and to gather demographic information.  
					
					</p><p>We may share aggregated statistics about pages viewed on our site, sales and other shopping information 
					with third parties.

					order status, for statistical purposes, for improving our site and its performance, to serve ads, and to notify you 
					of products or special offers that may be of interest to you.  We will disclose your Personally Identifiable Information

					<p>Other Parties:  We do not sell, trade, or rent your Personally Identifiable Information to others without your consent.

					<p>Ad Server and Content Server Cookies:  We may use an outside ad serving company or content server to display banner advertisements 
					and other information on our site or to serve promotional emails.
					As part of their service, they place a separate cookie on your computer. Except for the company that serves our promotional emails, Buy.com does not provide 
					third-party ad servers with any of your Personally Identifiable Information.  
					Buy.com and its third party ad servers do collect and use Non-Personally Identifiable Information about you, such 
					as your IP address, browser type, the URLs from which you came, referring site's domain types (e.g., .com), 
					operating system, the country, the server your computer is logged onto, where the servers that your computer 
					is logged onto is located, the pages of our site and products that visitors viewed during their visit, where an ad was placed 
					on a specific web site page, the time and date particular ads were served, the area code and zip code associated 
					with your server and whether you responded to a particular ad, and a receipt identifier.  If you would like to know 
					more about the information gathering practices of the company that send our promotional emails, please 
					<a href="http://www.doubleclick.com/us/corporate/privacy/privacy/default.asp?asp_object_1=&amp;" style="text-decoration : underline" target="_new" class="techblue">click here</a>.
					
					</p><p>Our third-party ad servers will occasionally use outside agents, whose computers will serve ads 
					on our site in the same manner and under the same conditions as above.  In addition, other ad 
					serving companies or advertisers may place banner ads on our site in the same manner as above, 
					but we do not disclose to them any Personally Identifiable Information.
					
					</p><p>Image Server Cookies:  As part of the ad-serving process, a third party may serve graphics upon our 
					site.  In order to customize their service, they may also place a cookie upon your computer.  
					While Buy.com does not control their use of that cookie, no Personally Identifiable or individual 
					customers' product information is collected. To see our image server's privacy policy, <a href="http://www.akamai.com/en/html/misc/privacy_policy.html" style="text-decoration : underline" target="_new" class="techblue">click here</a>.
					
					</p><p>Website Analysis Agent Cookies:  We may use a third party to analyze what our visitors find to be most 
					interesting on our site.  To do that, they will place a cookie on your computer with a randomly assigned 
					unique number in order to track the pages you view on our site, along with other Non-Personally 
					Identifiable Information.
					
					</p><p>Action Tags, Web Beacons and other Data Collection Methods:  An action tag or a web-beacon (also known as a clear gif or a pixel tag) is a method used to track 
					responses or actions by customers who view certain advertisements or other information on our site. 
					Action tags are 1x1 pixel images embedded in a website page that are used to transparently collect information.  
					Our ad server, content servers and website analysis agents  may use action tags to count the number of times that visitors click on a particular 
					banner ad or visit the pages of our site and to provide information about what products are viewed or purchased.  Without collecting any personally identifiable information, 
					they use that data to tell us (and other advertisers) which ads are the most effective on particular 
					sites.  Our ad server, content server and website analysis agents may use an action tag on our basket page, checkout page, and other pages, 
					to keep anonymous track of the number of times that clicking on a banner ad or views other information on our siteresults in a purchase.  
					They also collect the amount of the purchase, order confirmation number, stock keeping unit number, 
					quantity and identity of product purchased.
					
					</p><p>E-mail Distributor's Use of Action Tags:  Our third-party e-mail distributor may also use action tags.  
					They may, for example, keep track of when a promotional e-mail is opened and provide Buy.com with 
					ongoing aggregated reports of how many customers have responded. We share with them web site usage information 
					about visitors to our web site who have received a promotional e-mail or other targeted promotional campaign.  
					They use the information for the purpose of targeting future campaigns and upgrading visitor information used 
					in reporting statistics.  For this purpose, we and our third-party e-mail distributor note some of the pages 
					you visit on our web site through the use of action tags . For more information about our third-party e-mail 
					distributor's use of action tags and other data collection methods, please <a href="http://www.doubleclick.net/us/corporate/privacy/privacy/email/default.asp?asp_object_1=&amp;" style="text-decoration : underline" target="_new" class="techblue">click here</a>.
