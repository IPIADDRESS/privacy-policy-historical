BuyerZone.com gathers information for the purpose of matching buyers with relevant suppliers and to personalize and continually improve your experience with us. We recognize that your information is sensitive and restrict our collection of it to the critical data needed to deliver a superior experience, both to buyers and suppliers.
</p>
<p>As a visitor to our site, you can browse our pages without having any personally identifiable information revealed about you. Information we automatically collect via industry standard web log files includes the URL from which you visited, the page you are visiting, your computer browser information and your IP address. We may also track the effectiveness of various promotions through the use of data collection devices known as "cookies." Cookies contain specific pieces of information on your computer hard drive, and can be set to store information during a visit or for a longer period of time. Our cookies are not tied to personally identifiable information.</p>



<p>As a buyer using our Request for Quotes service, you need to provide additional information so BuyerZone.com can deliver our Request for Quotes service to you. This includes contact information, basic demographic information, and your purchasing requirements. The information collected varies according to the different purchasing categories and can be viewed by visiting the different forms located throughout our site. We will also ask you for feedback about our service, which is collected and stored to allow us to continually improve our offerings.</p>

<p>Cookies are also used to help streamline your experience on the site, automatically logging you in during future visits, for example. You are free to disable cookies at any time if your browser permits. However, by doing so, you may not be able to utilize certain features of our site. If you are unable to submit a Request for Quotes while having cookies disabled, please contact our Customer Care department at 1-888-393-5000 x2.</p>

<p>As a supplier using our Request for Quotes service, you must provide information that allows us to deliver our service to you. This includes your contact information, information about your desired target markets, and billing information. In addition, we may supplement the information you provide with a credit check to ensure your creditworthiness. It should be noted that any credit card information we receive is stored securely via encryption and an SSL connection; our security measures are reviewed later in this document.</p>

<p>As a visitor signing up for our newsletters, sample lead service, or other content, you will need to provide your contact information. Additionally, demographic information may be requested of you in order to provide a more customized experience. The specific information requested varies according to the different types of content requested by you.</p>
<a name="Use"></a>
<p><strong>HOW DO WE USE YOUR INFORMATION?</strong><br>
BuyerZone.com primarily uses the information we gather to put buyers and sellers into contact with one another and to improve your experience on our site through analysis and communication.
</p>
<p>Request for Quotes. Buyers or suppliers who utilize our Request for Quotes service receive emails from us to facilitate the transaction. You cannot opt out of emails that are necessary to provide our services. By using BuyerZone.com's Request for Quotes service and accepting our Terms and Conditions, you agree that we may use your personal information to contact you and deliver information to you related to your Request for Quotes.</p>

<p>Analysis. In our ongoing effort to improve the content and services we offer, we continually analyze the information we receive to identify trends and patterns in user behavior. Your personal information, when used in such a manner, is aggregated with others to amass enough data for such analysis and is not personally identifiable.</p>

<p>Testimonials and Feedback. We sincerely appreciate the feedback we receive from our users. Your feedback, both positive and negative, is forwarded to the appropriate departments at BuyerZone.com as necessary so we can continue to monitor and improve the service we provide. We may also share testimonials in our marketing literature but will do so without including personally identifiable information unless we have expressly asked for your permission to do so.</p>

<p>Newsletters. BuyerZone.com offers valuable content through email newsletters for both buyers and suppliers. Sign up is "opt-in" only, which means that you must sign up for a newsletter before you will start receiving it. If you no longer wish to receive any newsletter, we encourage you to opt out of these communications by changing your notification preferences as described below.</p>

<p>Email Services. BuyerZone.com offers services such as "Tell a Friend" that allow visitors to notify other people via e-mail about its services. We do not use any email addresses used in these communications for any purpose other than to forward the requested information.</p>

<p>Other communications.  BuyerZone.com reserves the right to send you email communications related to your Request for Quotes and the status of your account. In addition, BuyerZone.com sends periodic surveys, e-newsletters, and other communications, all of which you can opt out of receiving by changing your notification preferences as described below.</p>
<a name="Share"></a>
<p><strong>HOW DO WE SHARE YOUR INFORMATION WITH OTHERS?</strong><br>
Our customer information is an important part of our business. As a result, we limit the disclosure of this information to the information necessary to provide our service of matching buyers and suppliers. Our sharing of information to outside parties is described below.
</p>
<p>Buyers. To facilitate our business of matching buyers and suppliers, buyers using our Request for Quotes service will be provided information about suppliers. This includes supplier contact information, company background information and, where appropriate, ratings or reviews.</p>

<p>Suppliers. Similarly, a small set of suppliers will be provided with buyer information so buyers may be able to have their purchasing needs fulfilled. The buyer's information (including all forms of contact information submitted) can only be used to communicate with the buyer about their desired purchase. In addition, suppliers may receive information about buyers in a manner that does not disclose personally identifiable information. Examples include data that are aggregated across a group of buyers or feedback that is provided without attribution to a specific person or company.</p>

<p>Agents. From time to time, we may utilize the services of third-party companies to help facilitate our business activities. These include bill collection services, affiliate or incentive program providers, customer service organizations, e-mail and postal mail brokers, and marketing service providers. These companies are subject to confidentiality agreements with us and are prohibited from using the information we provide for any reason except to perform the functions that BuyerZone.com has outlined for them.</p>

<p>Affiliates. BuyerZone.com has established partnerships to provide our Request for Quotes service more broadly throughout the Internet to both buyers and suppliers. When a user has utilized these services through an affiliate, we will share information about these users to the affiliate as necessary. This information is typically reported in an aggregated format.</p>

<p>Advertisers. We aggregate information about our collective users for potential advertisers who are interested in understanding whether their offering would be suitable to our audience. This information does not include personally identifiable information like your company name or email address. Any promotions sent to you from the advertiser are done in a blind manner where the advertiser has no access to your personal contact information.</p>

<p>Business Transfers. It is possible that our business may be merged with or sold to another business entity. During such a transaction, business information is typically one of the assets shared in the combined entity. In the event that this occurs, your personal information will be protected by the BuyerZone.com privacy policy in effect at the time. If your personal information will be used contrary to this policy, you will receive notice as described in the "Notification of Changes" section below.</p>

<p>Legal Requests. As a good corporate citizen, BuyerZone.com is interested in protecting its members and the community at large. We will release account and other personal information to legal authorities when we believe it is appropriate to comply with the law. In addition, BuyerZone may choose to release information about you to relevant parties in relation to investigations of fraud, piracy or other unlawful activity in order to maintain a high level of trust and safety in our community.</p>
<a name="Secure"></a>
<p><strong>INFORMATION SECURITY</strong><br>
Your information is stored on servers that are protected against unauthorized access through the use of safeguards such as "firewalls," encryption and Secure Socket Layers. We utilize many security techniques to protect your personal information. However, it is impossible to guarantee a perfect security system.
</p>
<a name="Account"></a>
<p><strong>ACCOUNT INFORMATION AND PREFERENCES</strong><br>
 BuyerZone.com provides a number of ways for you to manage your personal information.</p>

<p>Account information. If you need to update your account information, such as your contact email address, you may do so by contacting our Customer Care department at <a href="mailto:customercare@buyerzone.com.">customercare@buyerzone.com</a>. </p>

<p>Notification Preferences. You have the ability to "opt out" or unsubscribe from e-mail communications, such as periodic surveys and our monthly enewsletter, that are not directly related to the BuyerZone.com Request for Quotes service and/or the status of your account.

<p>Password. BuyerZone.com suppliers may be issued a User ID and password to access their account. As a supplier, you are responsible for all actions taken with your user ID and password, including fees charged to your account.

<p>LEGAL DISCLAIMER<br>
Although we have attempted to address the various privacy-related issues you are likely to encounter, we cannot ensure that all of your private communications and other personal information will never be disclosed in ways not otherwise described in this Privacy Policy. Therefore, although we use industry standard practices to protect your privacy, we do not promise, and you should not expect, that your personal information or private communications will always remain private from unauthorized access.
