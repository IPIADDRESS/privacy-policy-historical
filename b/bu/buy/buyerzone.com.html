This confirms that BuyerZone.com is a licensee of the TRUSTe Privacy Program.  This privacy statement discloses the privacy practices for <a href="../../index.html">http://www.buyerzone.com</a>.</p><p> 

TRUSTe is an independent, non-profit organization whose mission is to build users' trust and confidence in the Internet by promoting the use of fair information practices.  Because this web site wants to demonstrate its commitment to your privacy, it has agreed to disclose its information practices and have its privacy practices reviewed for compliance by TRUSTe.  By displaying the TRUSTe trustmark, this web site has agreed to notify you of:</p><p>

1.	What personally identifiable information of yours or third party personally identification is collected from you through the web site<br>
2.	The organization collecting the information <br>
3.	How the information is used <br>
4.	With whom the information may be shared <br>
5.	What choices are available to you regarding collection, use and distribution of the information <br>
6.	The kind of security procedures that are in place to protect the loss, misuse or alteration of information under BuyerZone.com control <br>
7.	How you can correct any inaccuracies in the information. </p><p>

If you have questions or concerns regarding this statement, you should first contact BuyerZone.com by e-mail (<a href="../../services/feedback_form/feedback.jhtml">custcare@buyerzone.com</a>) or phone (1-888-393-5000).  If you do not receive acknowledgment of your inquiry or your inquiry has not been satisfactorily addressed, you should then contact TRUSTe through the "TRUSTe WatchDog Dispute Resolution Process"<br> (<a href="http://www.truste.org/users/users_watchdog_intro.html">http://www.truste.org/users/users_watchdog_intro.html</a>).  TRUSTe will then serve as a liaison with the Web site to resolve your concerns. </p><p>

<b>Information Collection and Use</b></p><p>

BuyerZone.com is the sole owner of the information collected on this site.  We will not sell, share, or rent this information to others in ways different from what is disclosed in this statement.  BuyerZone.com collects information from our users at several different points on our website.</p><p>

<b>Registration</b></p><p>
In order to use this website, a user must first complete the registration form.  During registration a user is required to give their contact information (such as name, email address, company, company size, and zip code).  This information is used to contact the user about the services on our site for which they have expressed interest.  It is optional for the user to provide demographic information (such as income level and gender), and unique identifiers (such as social security number), but encouraged so we can provide a more personalized experience on our site.  </p><p>

<b>Ordering</b></p><p>
We request information from the user on our order form.  Here a user must provide contact information (like name and shipping address) and financial information (like credit card number, expiration date).  This information is used for billing purposes and to fill customer's orders.  If we have trouble processing an order, this contact information is used to get in touch with the user.</p><p>

<b>Cookies</b></p><p>

A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's hard drive containing information about the user.  Usage of a cookie is in no way linked to any personally identifiable information while on our site.  For instance, by setting a cookie on our site, the user would not have to log in a password more than once, thereby saving time while on our site.  If a user rejects the cookie, they may still use our site without any drawbacks.  Cookies can also enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our site.</p><p>

Some of our business partners use cookies on our site (for example, advertisers).  However, we have no access to or control over these cookies.</p><p>

We use both session cookies (cookies which expire upon your exiting our site) and non-session cookies (cookies which do not expire as you exit our site; in our case they last 7 days).  The only 3rd party cookies served on our site may be from our advertisers.  These cookies are of both the session and non-session type.</p><p>

<b>Log Files</b></p><p>

In log files we collect the user's IP address, referring site URL, time and date.</p><p>

We use IP addresses, etc. to analyze trends, administer the site, track user's movement, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use.  IP addresses, etc. are not linked to personally identifiable information.  </p><p>

<b>Sharing</b></p><p>

We will share aggregated demographic information with our partners and advertisers. This is not linked to any personal information that can identify any individual person.</p><p>

We use outside shipping companies to ship orders, and a credit card processing company to bill users for goods and services. These companies do not retain, share, store or use personally identifiable information for any secondary purposes.</p><p>

We partner with both online quoting vendors and online shopping vendors to provide specific services. When the user signs up for these services, we will share names, or other contact information that is necessary for the third party to provide these services.  These parties are not allowed to use personally identifiable information, such as email and postal address or phone number, except for the purpose of providing these services.</p><p>

<b>Links</b></p><p>

This web site contains links to other sites. Please be aware that we, BuyerZone.com, are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites.  We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every web site that collects personally identifiable information.  This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by this Web site.</p><p>

<b>Newsletter</b></p><p>
If a user wishes to subscribe to our newsletter, we ask for contact information such as name and email address. </p><p>

<b>Surveys &amp; Contests</b></p><p>

From time-to-time our site requests information from users via surveys or contests.  Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and the user therefore has a choice whether or not to disclose this information.  Information requested may include contact information (such as name and shipping address), and demographic information (such as zip code, age level).  Contact information will be used to notify the winners and award prizes.  Survey information will be used for purposes of monitoring or improving the use and satisfaction of this site.</p><p>

<b>Tell-A-Friend</b></p><p>

If a user elects to use our referral service for informing a friend about our site, we ask them for the friend's name and email address.  BuyerZone.com will automatically send the friend a one-time email inviting them to visit the site.  BuyerZone.com stores this information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email.  The friend may contact BuyerZone.com at <a href="../../services/feedback_form/feedback.jhtml">custcare@buyerzone.com</a> to request the removal of this information from their database.</p><p>

<b>Discussion Forums and Live Help </b></p><p>

BuyerZone.com hosts discussion forums where you can post your opinions about business products and services and read the opinions of others.  The information disclosed in the public view is limited to the participant's username, posted comment, and date of posting.  </p><p>

We offer a live help function on our site to assist you with our services and the quoting services of our partners and affiliates.  Our live help is a one-on-one chat, not a public chat.  We do not store the transcripts of these chats. </p><p>

<b>Security</b></p><p>
This website takes every precaution to protect our users' information.  When users submit sensitive information via the website, your information is protected both online and off-line.</p><p>

When our order form asks users to enter sensitive information (such as credit card number and/or social security number), that information is encrypted and is protected with the best encryption technologies in the industry - SSL and PCP.  While on a secure page, such as our order form, the lock icon on the bottom of Web browsers such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to un-locked, or open, when you are just 'surfing'.</p><p>  

While we use encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also do everything in our power to protect user-information off-line.  All of our users' information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted in our offices.  Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, our billing clerk or a customer service representative) are granted access to personally identifiable information.  Our employees must use password-protected screen-savers when they leave their desk.  When they return, they must re-enter their password to re-gain access to your information.  Furthermore, ALL employees are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy practices.  Every quarter, as well as any time new policies are added, our employees are notified and/or reminded about the importance we place on privacy, and what they can do to ensure our customers' information is protected.  Finally, the servers that we store personally identifiable information on are kept in a secure environment, behind a locked cage.</p><p>

If you have any questions about the security at our website, you can send an email to <a href="../../services/feedback_form/feedback.jhtml">custcare@buyerzone.com</a>.</p><p>

<b>Supplementation of Information</b></p><p>

In order for this website to properly fulfill its obligation to our customers, it is necessary for us to supplement the information we receive with information from 3rd party sources.</p><p>

For example, to determine if our customers qualify for one of our credit cards, we use their name and social security number to request a credit report.  Once we determine a user's credit-worthiness, this document is destroyed. </p><p>

<b>Special Offers</b></p><p>

We send all new members a welcoming email to verify password and username. Established members will occasionally receive information on products, services, special deals, and a newsletter. Out of respect for the privacy of our users we present the option to not receive these types of communications. Please see our choice and opt-out below.</p><p>

<b>Site and Service Updates</b></p><p>

We also send the user site and service announcement updates. Members are not able to un-subscribe from service announcements, which contain important information about the service. We communicate with the user to provide requested services and in regards to issues relating to their account via email or phone.</p><p>

<b>Correction/Updating Personal Information:</b></p><p>

If a user's personally identifiable information changes (such as your zip code), or if a user no longer desires our service, we will endeavor to provide a way to correct, update or remove that user's personal data provided to us.  This can usually be done at an area we call MyZone (<a href="/services/myzone/index.html">http://www.buyerzone.com/services/myzone/index.html</a>) or by emailing <a href="../../services/feedback_form/feedback.jhtml">custcare@buyerzone.com</a>.</p><p>

<b>Choice/Opt-out</b></p><p>

Our users are given the opportunity to 'opt-out' of having their information used for purposes not directly related to our site at the point where we ask for the information.  For example, our order form has an 'opt-out' mechanism so users who buy a product from us, but don't want any marketing material, can keep their email address off of our lists.  </p><p>

Users who no longer wish to receive our newsletter or promotional materials from our partners may opt-out of receiving these communications by following the unsubscribe links in the email, visiting MyZone (<a href="/services/myzone/myzone_myprofile.jhtml">http://www.buyerzone.com/services/myzone/myzone_myprofile.jhtml</a>) or emailing us at <a href="../../services/feedback_form/feedback.jhtml">custcare@buyerzone.com</a>.</p><p>

Users of our site are always notified when their information is being collected by any outside parties.  We do this so our users can make an informed choice as to whether they should proceed with services that require an outside party, or not.</p><p>

<b>Insurance Disclaimer</b></p><p>

As a user of this service, be aware that BuyerZone.com is not an insurance broker acting on your behalf or for any insurance broker. You are not buying insurance from BuyerZone.com, and this form is not intended to substitute for a full insurance application. This form is provided by BuyerZone.com to insurance vendors with the minimum amount of information required to prepare a quote. Quotes presented through BuyerZone.com are non-binding, and full disclosure and agreement to the exact terms of your policy is exclusively between you and the vendor. BuyerZone.com neither endorses nor recommends any specific insurance coverage plan or insurance broker. </p><p>

<b>Legal Disclaimer</b></p><p>

Though we make every effort to preserve your privacy, we may need to disclose personal information when required by law in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary in order to conform to a court order or comply with a legal process served on our Web site.  We will provide prior notification of such request(s) either by e-mail or written notice.</p><p>

<b>Notification of Changes</b></p><p>

If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes on our Homepage so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under circumstances, if any, we disclose it.  If at any point we decide to use personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time it was collected, we will notify users by way of an email.  Users will have a choice as to whether or not we use their information in this different manner. We will use information in accordance with the privacy policy under which the information was collected. </p><p>

We always welcome your questions and feedback about our privacy policy. To send us feedback please contact <a href="../../services/feedback_form/feedback.jhtml">custcare@buyerzone.com</a>.</p></font><p><font face="verdana" size="2">
