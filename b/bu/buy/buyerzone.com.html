				<h1>BuyerZone Privacy Policy</h1>
				<p>Your privacy is very important to us. This privacy policy of BuyerZone.com, Inc. ("BuyerZone") describes the information we gather, how we share that information and what we do to protect your information.</p>
				<p>Use of the site indicates agreement with this privacy policy. This privacy policy was last updated February, 2008.</p>
				<h3>What Information Do We Gather?</h3>			
				<p>Information we automatically collect via industry standard web log files includes the URL from which you visited, the page you are visiting, your computer browser information and your IP address. We may also use automatic data collection devices such as "cookies" and "clear GIF's" (also known as "pixel tags" or "beacons").</p>
				<p>Cookies contain specific pieces of information on your computer hard drive, and can be set to store information during a visit or for a longer period of time. Cookies are also used to help streamline your experience on the site, automatically logging you in during future visits, for example. You are free to disable cookies at any time if your browser permits. However, by doing so, you may not be able to use certain features of our site. If you are unable to submit a Request for Quotes while having cookies disabled, please contact our Customer Care department at 1-888-393-5000.</p>
				<p>A clear GIF is a small graphic image, typically used in connection with cookies, that is placed on a web site or in an email message.  A clear GIF can monitor certain user behavior, such as your usage of the web site, whether you opened an email message or whether you clicked on a URL in an email message. We do not collect personally identifiable information in this way, but if you provide us with personally identifiable information, we may associate that information with the information that is collected automatically.</p>
				<p>As a prospective buyer using offerings on our site (such as our Request for Quotes service) to receive information from or about sellers, you are required to provide additional information so BuyerZone can deliver these services to you. This includes contact information, basic demographic information, and your purchasing requirements. The information collected varies according to the different purchasing categories and can be viewed by visiting the different forms located throughout our site. We may also ask you for feedback about our service, which is collected and stored to allow us to continually improve our offerings.</p>
				<p>As a supplier using offerings on our site (such as our Request for Quotes service to receive information from or about prospective buyers), you must provide information that allows us to deliver our service to you. This includes your contact information, information about your desired target markets, and billing information. Any credit card information we receive is stored securely via encryption and an SSL connection; our security measures are reviewed later in this document.</p>
				<p>We also require you to provide certain information when you request our newsletters, sample lead service or other content or submit information for posting on public areas of this site (e.g., blogs, moderated discussions or bulletin boards).</p>
				<p>Additionally, we may request that your provide demographic information. The specific information requested varies according to the different types of content you may request.</p>
				<p>Some of the materials included on this site, including advertising, may be served by third parties. These third parties, in the course of serving such materials, may collect information regarding your use of this site and how you respond to e-mail communications, using methods that may include automatic data collection, and may use this information in order to present advertisements or other content that may be of interest to you on both this site and other web sites.  Collection, use, disclosure and security of information collected by third parties are subject to the privacy policies of those third parties. If you would like more information about this practice or to opt out of having this information used by certain third-party ad servers to provide targeted ads, please visit <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/">http://www.networkadvertising.org/</a>.</p>
				<h3>How Do We Use Your Informatin?</h3>			
				<p>BuyerZone uses the information we gather to put buyers and sellers into contact with one another, to provide other features and functionality of this site, to improve your experience on our site through analysis and communication, for other purposes described in this policy, and for purposes disclosed to you when you provide information.</p>
				<p><strong>To Facilitate Transactions.</strong>  Buyers or suppliers will receive emails and other communications from us to fulfill or facilitate the purpose for which the information was provided or a request to use a service on this site. You cannot opt out of emails that are necessary to provide our services. By using BuyerZone's services offered on this site, you agree that we may use your personal information to contact you and deliver information to you related to those services.</p>
				<p><strong>Analysis.</strong> In our ongoing effort to improve the content and services we offer, we continually analyze the information we receive to identify trends and patterns in user behavior. Your personal information, when used in such a manner, is aggregated with others to amass enough data for such analysis and is not personally identifiable.</p>
				<p><strong>Testimonials and Feedback.</strong> We sincerely appreciate the feedback we receive from our users. Your feedback, both positive and negative, is forwarded to the appropriate departments at BuyerZone as necessary so we can continue to monitor and improve the service we provide. We may also share testimonials in our marketing literature but will do so without including personally identifiable information unless we have expressly received your permission to do so.</p>
				<p><strong>Newsletters.</strong> BuyerZone offers valuable content through email newsletters for both buyers and suppliers. If you no longer wish to receive any newsletter, we encourage you to opt out of these communications by changing your notification preferences as described below.</p>
				<p><strong>Email Services.</strong> BuyerZone may offer services such as "Tell a Friend" that allow visitors to notify other people via e-mail about its services. When an email address is provided for these communications, it is not used by us for any purpose other than to forward the requested information.</p>
				<p><strong>Other communications.</strong> BuyerZone may send you email and other communications related to this site, your use of our services and the status of your account, which may include site updates and responses to your inquiries. In addition, BuyerZone sends periodic surveys and other communications, all of which you can opt out of receiving by changing your notification preferences as described below.</p>
				<p><strong>Affiliates.</strong>  We may use the information you provide us to send you e-mail and other communications on behalf of other Reed Elsevier member companies.  These communications may include e-mail newsletters, as well as offers for other BuyerZone and Reed Elsevier services.  All email newsletters will provide you with an opportunity to opt out of receiving future issues of the newsletter.  All promotional offers will include an opportunity to opt out of receiving future promotions from the brand whose product/service is being promoted.</p>

				<h3>How Do We Share Your Information Wtih Others?</h3>			
				<p>Our customer information is an important part of our business. As a result, we only disclose this information as described in this section. Our sharing of information to outside parties is described below.</p>
				<p><strong>Prospective Buyers.</strong> To facilitate our business of matching buyers and suppliers, prospective buyers using our services will be provided information about suppliers relevant to the buyer's request or inquiry using such services. This includes supplier contact information, company background information and, where appropriate, ratings or reviews.</p>
				<p><strong>Suppliers.</strong> Similarly, suppliers whose products or services are relevant to a prospective buyer's request, and/or marketers, resellers and other service providers performing marketing, fulfillment and/or similar services on behalf of such suppliers with respect to the prospective buyer's request, may be provided with that prospective buyer's information.  We contractually limit use of the buyer's information (including all forms of contact information submitted) by the seller to communicating with the buyer, or permitting its marketers, resellers or other service providers to communicate with the buyer, about their desired purchase.  In addition, suppliers may receive information about buyers in a manner that does not disclose personally identifiable information. Examples include data that are aggregated across a group of buyers or feedback that is provided without attribution to a specific person or company.</p>
				<p><strong>Agents.</strong> From time to time, we may use the services of third-party companies to help facilitate our business activities. These include bill collection services, affiliate or incentive program providers, customer service organizations, e-mail and postal mail brokers, and marketing service providers. These companies are subject to confidentiality agreements with us and are prohibited from using the information we provide for any reason except to perform the functions that BuyerZone has outlined for them.</p>
				<p><strong>Affiliates.</strong>  We may share your information with our direct parent company, Reed Elsevier Inc., and other Reed Elsevier member companies for any uses consistent with those disclosed in this privacy policy.</p>
				<p><strong>Network Members.</strong>  BuyerZone has relationships with third parties to provide our services more broadly throughout the Internet to both buyers and suppliers. When a user has utilized these services through a member of our network, we will share information about these users with the affiliate as necessary. This information is typically reported in an aggregated format.</p>
				<p><strong>Advertisers.</strong> We may provide your information to third party advertisers (and/or to their service providers on their behalf) to market their products or services under contractual requirement to keep your personally identifiable information confidential and use it only to market and provide (directly and through third parties engaged by them for such purpose) their products or services.  You may opt out of such disclosures by sending an e-mail to <a href="mailto:privacymanager@reedbusiness.com">privacymanager@reedbusiness.com</a>  with the subject line: "<strong>do not disclose</strong>."  We also aggregate information about our collective users for potential advertisers who are interested in understanding whether their offering would be suitable to our audience. This information does not include personally identifiable information like your company name or email address.</p>
				<p><strong>Business Transfers.</strong> It is possible that our business may be merged with or sold to another business entity. During such a transaction, business information is typically one of the assets shared in the combined entity. In the event that this occurs, your personal information will be protected by the BuyerZone privacy policy in effect at the time. If your personal information will be used contrary to this policy, you will receive notice as described in the "Notification of Changes" section below.</p>
				<p><strong>Legal Requests.</strong> BuyerZone is interested in protecting its members and the community at large. We will release account and other personal information to legal authorities when we believe it is appropriate to comply with the law, rules or regulations or to protect persons or property. In addition, BuyerZone may choose to release information about you to relevant parties in relation to investigations of fraud, piracy or other unlawful activity.</p>

				<p>Your information is stored on servers that are protected against unauthorized access through the use of safeguards such as "firewalls," encryption and Secure Socket Layers. We utilize many security techniques to protect your personal information. However, it is impossible to guarantee a perfect security system.</p>

				<p>BuyerZone provides a number of ways for you to manage your personal information.</p>

				<p><strong>Notification Preferences.</strong> You have the ability to "opt out" or unsubscribe from certain e-mail communications, such as periodic surveys and our monthly email newsletter, that are not related to a requested service and/or the status of your account. To update your communication preferences, contact our Customer Care department at <a href="mailto:customercare@buyerzone.com">customercare@buyerzone.com</a>. If you do contact the Customer Care department, please be sure to specify the type of email communication(s) from which you would like to opt out.
