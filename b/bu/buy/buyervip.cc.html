            <p>
                Your privacy is important to us. To better protect your privacy we provide this
                notice explaining our online information practices and the choices you can make
                about the way your information is collected and used. To make this notice easy to
                find, we make it available from our footer navigation that is found on every page
                of our website. When you register at Osell, we ask you for personal information.
                We use this information to process your orders, conduct account verifications, and
                to communicate with you about the status of your orders. We also use your email
                address to send you newsletters you are subscribed to during registration, as well
                as messages about Osell special offers, promotional announcements and consumer surveys.
                Occasionally, we send our customers special offers and promotional information via
                postal mail, using the shipping address provided. If you no longer want to receive
                the newsletters or other announcements simply unsubscribe by checking the unsubscribe

            <h2>
                The information we collect</h2>
            <p>
                This notice applies to all information collected or submitted on the Osell website.
                On some pages, you can order memberships, order products, make requests, and register
                to receive materials. The types of personal information collected at these pages
                are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Name</li>
                <li>Billing address</li>
                <li>Emailaddress</li>
                <li>State driver's license number</li>
                <li>Phone number</li>
                <li>Credit/debit card information</li>
                <li>Unique identifiers (such as username and password)</li>

                <li>State sales tax ID</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                On some pages, you can submit information about other people. For example, if you
                order a product and want it drop shipped directly to your customer, you will need
                to submit their address. In this circumstance, the types of personal information
                collected are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Name</li>
                <li>Shipping address</li>

            <h2>
                How we use information</h2>
            <p>
                The primary use of your personal information, other than directly in connection
                with a purchase, is to efficiently provide you with personalized, relevant information.
                We also use registration information to let you know about new features or other
                offers of interest from us and to address customer service needs and requests.</p>

                Cookies</h3>
            <p>
                Contrary to popular myth, cookies do not extract private or personal information
                from your computer's memory, but rather, record only information you volunteer to
                us upon registering or visiting the site. Cookies are tiny files placed onto the
                hard drive of your computer when you register at our Web site that enable our server

                Log files</h3>
            <p>
                Like most standard website servers we use log files. This includes Internet protocol
                (IP) addresses, browser type, Internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages,
                platform type, date/time stamp, and number of clicks to analyze trends, administer

                Communications from Osell</h2>
            <p>
                Special offers and updates<br>
                We send all new members a welcoming email to verify password and username. Established
                members will occasionally receive information on products, services, special deals,
                and a newsletter. Out of respect for the privacy of our users we present the option
                to not receive these types of communications. We also send all registrants special
                offers and updates regarding our services. If you are a former customer, you will
                continue to receive special offers and updates regarding our services unless you
                choose to unsubscribe from such communications.
            </p>
            <h3>
                Newsletter</h3>
            <p>
                If a user wishes to subscribe to our newsletter, we ask for contact information
                such as name and email address. Out of respect for our users privacy, we provide
                a way to opt-out of these communications.</p>
            <h3>
                Service announcements</h3>
            <p>
                On rare occasions it is necessary to send out a strictly service-related announcement.
                For instance, if our service is temporarily suspended for maintenance we might send
                users an email. Generally, users may not opt-out of these communications, though
                they can deactivate their account. However, these communications are not promotional
                in nature.</p>
            <h3>
                Customer service</h3>
            <p>
                We communicate with users on a regular basis to provide requested services and in
                regard to issues relating to their account we reply via email or phone, in accordance
                with the user's wishes.</p>
            <h3>
                Other</h3>
            <p>
                During the registration process, we collect phone information so that we may call
                you for the purpose of preventing fraud during the ordering process of Osell products.
                We also will call you during the first several weeks of your trial or service to
                provide answers to any questions as well as to offer additional promotions only
                available via phone. After the first several weeks of your trial or service, we,
                or our authorized marketing partners, may periodically contact you for the purposes
                of improving our services by asking you to answer questions or complete surveys
                or by offering you other services that we feel you may benefit from.</p>
            <h2>
                Sharing - Third parties</h2>
            <p>
                Osell will not disclose your personal information provided in connection with membership
                registration or purchases, except with your knowledge and consent as described in
                this Privacy Policy or as may be required by law, or to protect the rights or property
                of Osell.<br>
                Information submitted by you online (such as information about products you purchase
                from us, your name, address, email address) may be shared with companies with which
                we have a commercial relationship, including companies through which you reached
                Osell. For example, if you make a purchase with us because of a special offer made
                through another site acting as a distributor of our products, in that circumstance
                you will be considered their customer as well. We will not, except as may be required
                by law, share with any other party your password or payment information. We may
                also share information about you (including name, email address, phone number, and
                postal address) to our marketing partners or other companies with whom we have a
                commercial relationship so they may contact you about information and services that
                we feel you would benefit from.</p>
            <h2>
                Our commitment to data security</h2>
            <p>
                Osell takes every precaution to protect our users' information. When users submit
                sensitive information via the website, their information is protected both online
                and off-line.</p>
            <p>
                When our registration/order form asks users to enter sensitive information (such
                as credit card number), that information is encrypted and is protected with the
                best encryption software in the industry - SSL. While on a secure page, such as
                our order form, the lock icon on the bottom of Web browsers such as Netscape Navigator
                and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to un-locked, or open,
                when users are just "surfing."</p>
            <p>
                While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also do
                everything in our power to protect user-information off-line. All of our users'
                information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted in
                our offices. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for
                example, our billing clerk or a customer service representative) are granted access
                to personally identifiable information. Furthermore, ALL employees are kept up-to-date
                on our security and privacy practices. Finally, the servers that store personally
                identifiable information are in a secure environment, behind a locked cage in a
                locked facility.</p>
            <p>
                Osell reserves the right to make any amendments, modifications or changes to this
                Privacy Policy at any time. If any material change is made to this Privacy Policy,
                we will notify our users about those changes via email. If you do not agree to such
                changes, you can modify your notification settings to opt out of certain notices
                from Osell or its marketing partners. If users have any questions about the security
                at our website, users can send an email to sales@osell.com.</p>

                Our commitment to children's privacy</h2>
            <p>
                Protecting the privacy of the very young is especially important. For that reason,
                we never collect or maintain information at our website from those we actually know
                are under 13, and no part of our website is structured to attract anyone under 13.
                In order to subscribe to Osell's services, the member must be 18 with a valid credit
                card.

                Our commitment to personal's privacy</h2>
            <p>
                You can access your personally identifiable information collected by Osell by logging
                into your account and visiting the "Settings" section of the website. You can correct
                factual errors in your personally identifiable information by sending us a request
                that credibly shows error. To protect your privacy and security, we will also take
                reasonable steps to verify your identity before granting access or making corrections.</p>
