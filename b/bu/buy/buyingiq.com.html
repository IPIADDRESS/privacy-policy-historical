	            The term "Submissions" refers to the information that you submit or post to BuyingIQ for public
	            display, such as business ratings, reviews, photos, compliments, and the information that you display
	            as part of your account profile. BuyingIQ may publicly display your submissions in order to provide
	            the services that we offer. When we display your submissions, we do so along with your account name
	            (first name and last initial or username). By using the personal information in your submissions
	            (such as a photo of yourself), third parties may be able to identify you, associate you with your
	            user account, and contact you. As such please do not include information in your submissions that
	            you expect to keep private. You may reduce the risk of being personally identified by choosing a
	            fictitious account name, though doing so could detract from the credibility of your submissions.
	        </p>
	        <p>
	            We may store additional information about you in other ways not specifically described here.
	            For example, if you contact us to provide feedback, register a complaint, or ask a question,
	            we will record any personal information and other content that you provide in your communication
	            so that we can effectively respond to your communication.
	        </p>
	        BuyingIQ may collect its visitors; statistical information regarding what pages are visited,

	        intended to identify your individual use of the Website, nor do we use this information for any
	        such purpose. This information is collected to assist us in maintaining a high quality site, as
	        well as, providing necessary traffic information to our advertisers. We may contract with other
	        online partners to help manage and optimize our Internet business and communications. We may use
	        third party website analytics services in connection with the Website to help us measure the
