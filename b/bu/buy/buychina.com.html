    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <div><p>
		We can make our services even 
better – to show you more relevant search results and products, to help 
you connect with people or to make sharing with others quicker and 
easier. As you use our services, we want you to be clear how we’re using
 information and the ways in which you can protect your privacy.
	</p>
	<p>
		Our Privacy Policy explains:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			What information we collect and why we collect it.
		</li>
		<li>
			How we use that information.
		</li>
		<li>
			The choices we offer, including how to access and update information.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		Your privacy matters to BuyChina so whether you are new to BuyChina 
or a long-time user, please do take the time to get to know our 
practices – and if you have any questions contact us.
	</p>
	<h2>
		Information we collect
	</h2>
	<p>
		<br>
We collect information to provide better services to all of our 
users – from figuring out basic stuff like which language you speak, to 
more complex things like which products you’ll find most useful or the 
people who matter most to you online.
	</p>
	<p>
		We collect information in two ways:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			Information you give us. When you sign up for a BuyChina 
Account, we’ll ask for personal information, like your name, email 
address, telephone number or credit card.
		</li>
		<li>
			Information we get from your use of our services. We may collect 
information about the services that you use and how you use them. This 
information includes:
		</li>
	</ul>
	<ul>
		<li>
			<strong>Device information</strong> 
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		We may collect device-specific information (such as your hardware 
model, operating system version, unique device identifiers, and mobile 
network information including phone number). BuyChina may associate your
 device identifiers or phone number with your BuyChina Account.
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			<strong>Log information</strong> 
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		When you use our services or view content provided by BuyChina, we 
may automatically collect and store certain information in server logs. 
This may include:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			details of how you used our service, such as your visit history.
		</li>
		<li>
			telephony log information like your phone number, calling-party 
number, forwarding numbers, time and date of calls, duration of calls, 
SMS routing information and types of calls.
		</li>
		<li>
			Internet protocol address(IP Address).
		</li>
		<li>
			device event information such as crashes, system activity, hardware 
settings, browser type, browser language, the date and time of your 
request and referral URL.
		</li>
		<li>
			cookies that may uniquely identify your browser or your BuyChina Account.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<ul>
		<li>
			<strong>Location information</strong> 
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		When you use a location-enabled BuyChina service, we may collect and 
process information about your actual location, like GPS signals sent by
 a mobile device. We may also use various technologies to determine 
location, such as sensor data from your device that may, for example, 
provide information on nearby Wi-Fi access points and cell towers.
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			<strong>Local storage</strong> 
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		We may collect and store information (including personal information)
 locally on your device using mechanisms such as browser web storage 
(including HTML 5) and application data caches.
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			<strong>Cookies and anonymous identifiers</strong> 
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		We use various technologies to collect and store information when you
 visit BuyChina.com, and this may include sending one or more cookies or
 anonymous identifiers to your device.&nbsp;
	</p>
	<h2>
		How we use information we collect
	</h2>
	<p>
		<br>
We use the information we collect from all of our services to 
provide, maintain, protect and improve them, to develop new ones, and to
 protect BuyChina and our users. We also use this information to offer 
you tailored content – like giving you more relevant search results and 
products.
	</p>
	<p>
		We may use the name you provide for your BuyChina Profile across all 
of the services we offer that require a BuyChina Account. In addition, 
we may replace past names associated with your BuyChina Account so that 
you are represented consistently across all our services. If other users
 already have your email, or other information that identifies you, we 
may show them your publicly visible BuyChina Profile information, such 
as your name and photo.
	</p>
	<p>
		When you contact BuyChina, we may keep a record of your communication
 to help solve any issues you might be facing. We may use your email 
address to inform you about our services, such as letting you know about
 upcoming changes or improvements.
	</p>
	<p>
		We use information collected from cookies and other technologies to 
improve your user experience and the overall quality of our services. 
For example, by saving your language preferences, we’ll be able to have 
our services appear in the language you prefer. When showing you related
 products, we will not associate a cookie or anonymous identifier with 
sensitive categories, such as those based on race, religion, sexual 
orientation or health.
	</p>
	<p>
		We may combine personal information from one service with 
information, including personal information, from other BuyChina 
services – for example to make it easier to share things with people you
 know.
	</p>
	<p>
		We will ask for your consent before using information for a purpose other than those that are set out in this Privacy Policy.
	</p>
	<p>
		BuyChina processes personal information on our servers in many 
countries around the world. We may process your personal information on a
 server located outside the country where you live.
	</p>
	<h2>
		Information you share
	</h2>
	<p>
		Many of our services let you share information with others. Remember 
that when you share information publicly, it may be indexable by search 
engines, such as Google.com. Our services provide you with different 
options on sharing and removing your content.
	</p>
	<h2>
		Accessing and updating your personal information
	</h2>
	<p>
		Whenever you use our services, we aim to provide you with access to 
your personal information. If that information is wrong, we strive to 
give you ways to update it quickly or to delete it – unless we have to 
keep that information for legitimate business or legal purposes. When 
updating your personal information, we may ask you to verify your 
identity before we can act on your request.
	</p>
	<p>
		We may reject requests that are unreasonably repetitive, require 
disproportionate technical effort (for example, developing a new system 
or fundamentally changing an existing practice), risk the privacy of 
others, or would be extremely impractical (for instance, requests 
concerning information residing on backup tapes).
	</p>
	<p>
		Where we can provide information access and correction, we will do so
 for free, except where it would require a disproportionate effort. We 
aim to maintain our services in a manner that protects information from 
accidental or malicious destruction. Because of this, after you delete 
information from our services, we may not immediately delete residual 
copies from our active servers and may not remove information from our 
backup systems.
	</p>
	<h2>
		Information we share
	</h2>
	<p>
		We do not share personal information with companies, organizations 
and individuals outside of BuyChina unless one of the following 
circumstances apply:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			<strong>With your consent</strong> 
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		We will share personal information with companies, organizations or 
individuals outside of BuyChina when we have your consent to do so. We 
require opt-in consent for the sharing of any sensitive personal 
information.
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			<strong>For external processing</strong> 
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		We provide personal information to our affiliates or other trusted 
businesses or persons to process it for us, based on our instructions 
and in compliance with our Privacy Policy and any other appropriate 
confidentiality and security measures.
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			<strong>For legal reasons</strong> 
		</li>
	</ul>
We will share personal information with companies, organizations or
 individuals outside of BuyChina if we have a good-faith belief that 
access, use, preservation or disclosure of the information is reasonably
 necessary to:
	<ul>
		<li>
			meet any applicable law, regulation, legal process or enforceable governmental request.
		</li>
		<li>
			enforce applicable Terms of Service, including investigation of potential violations.
		</li>
		<li>
			detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues.
		</li>
		<li>
			protect against harm to the rights, property or safety of BuyChina, our users or the public as required or permitted by law.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>
		Enforcement
	</h2>
	<p>
		We regularly review our compliance with our Privacy Policy. We also 
adhere to several self regulatory frameworks. When we receive formal 
written complaints, we will contact the person who made the complaint to
 follow up. We work with the appropriate regulatory authorities, 
including local data protection authorities, to resolve any complaints 
regarding the transfer of personal data that we cannot resolve with our 
users directly.
	</p>
	<h2>
		Changes
	</h2>
	<p>
		Our Privacy Policy may change from time to time. We will not reduce 
your rights under this Privacy Policy without your explicit consent. We 
will post any privacy policy changes on this page and, if the changes 
are significant, we will provide a more prominent notice (including, for
 certain services, email notification of privacy policy changes). We 
will also keep prior versions of this Privacy Policy in an archive for 
your review.
