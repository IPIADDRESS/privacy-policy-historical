		</p><p><b>Privacy Policy Updates</b>
		</p><p>Due to the Internet's rapidly evolving nature, BuyerLink may need to update this Privacy Policy from time to time. If so, BuyerLink will post its updated Privacy Policy on our Site located at www.buyerlink.com and if you are registered directly with us, we will send you a notice at the email associated with you in our systems, so you are always aware of what personally identifiable information we may collect and how we may use this information. If any modification is unacceptable to you, you shall cease using this Site and the Services.

Therefore, you should check the Privacy Policy on this Site periodically for updates and changes. 
		</p><p><b>Information Collection and Use</b>

However, in certain sections of this Site and when you use our Services, we may invite you to contact us with questions or comments or request information, provide us with feedback, sell and purchase Leads and complete a registration form. Due to the nature of some of these activities, we may collect personally identifiable information, such as your name, contact data such as your address, email address, phone number, fax number, username, password, credit card number or other financial payment account information, and other contact information that you voluntarily transmit with your communication to us. We may use your personally identifiable information to contact you to register you to use our Services, deliver certain Services, provide notices regarding Services you have purchased, provide notices regarding Services you might want to purchase in the future, verify your authority to enter our Site and to use our Services, and improve the content and general administration of the Site and our Services. We may also receive personally identifiable information of third parties through the Lead Sellers or Publishers that have collected the personally identifiable information through an online Lead form for transmittal and sale to buyers on this Site. Each Lead Seller or Publisher has agreed that they have complied with all applicable laws regarding their collection and sale of the Leads or Clicks and that they have the right to sell the Leads or Clicks. However, BuyerLink cannot ensure that the privacy practices of the Sellers conform with this Privacy Policy. BuyerLink will use the personally identifiable information of third parties contained in Leads and Clicks to generate aggregate product demand trends as explained in the Aggregate Information Section below.

For example, we may provide your personally identifiable information to a credit card processing company to process your payment or to a Lead validation company to confirm the validity of your contact information. We may provide the aggregate information about trends regarding the Leads or Clicks sold and bought on the Site through the Services to third-party companies but such information will not personally identify you or any of the third parties that are the subject of a Lead or Click.
