		<!--<h3 style='color:red'>Opportunity to Partner or License Technology</h3> -->	
		<h3 style="color:red">General</h3>
		<p>You may use BuyHatke at any time without registering. When you visit our website, data is saved on our servers in

an anonymous format, as is the website that you visit us from, the websites that you proceed to from our site, and

your IP address. As this is being done, no personal data is associated with you. </p>
<p>However, we do need some personal information from you so that you can actively participate in BuyHatke. We

would therefore like to request that you agree to the collection and storage of some of your data. You can revoke your

consent any time by cancelling your registration.</p>
<p>Once you have registered for "My BuyHatke", you are asked to choose a BuyHatke user name together with a

password, which then allows you to take advantage of all of the BuyHatke services.</p>
	<h3 style="color:red">Data Collection</h3>
		<p>Personal data is the information needed to identify you, for example your name, address, date of birth, e-mail

address, mobile phone number, etc. With your consent, personal data are recorded and processed by BuyHatke, in

particular:</p>
<ul style="display:block;">
<li>When you register with "My BuyHatke"</li><br>
<li>When you buy bids</li><br>
<li>When you win an auction</li><br>
<li>We will only collect your account or credit card data if this is necessary in order to process payment.</li>
</ul>
		<p>Usage data are personal data that identify the user, as well as information on the BuyHatke services the user

utilizes, for example your BuyHatke user name together with the associated password and your IP address when you

purchase bids or win an auction. We collect these data only to make it possible for you to use BuyHatke. The data is

stored only for as long as it is necessary to process bids you have bought and auctions you have won.</p>
		
		<h3 style="color:red">Use of the data</h3>
		<p>Personal data such as name, address, etc. are used to process item shipment after an auction is won. We ask for

your e-mail address so that we can stay in contact with you by e-mail. We need your account data or credit card data

to process payment transactions you are involved with. We also use your personal data to communicate with you

regarding orders, to process auctions, marketing retentions and to process other transactions. Similarly, we use your

data in order to inform you of marketing promotions or to enable third parties authorized by us to perform technical,

logistical, or other services. All data is stored securely on our servers.  </p>
		
		<h3 style="color:red">E-mail and SMS Newsletters</h3>
		<p>When you register with BuyHatke, you agree to receive e-mail and SMS newsletters. We will use this method to

inform you of new functions or special promotions on our website. You can at any time opt-out of these by changing

your settings.  </p>

		<h3 style="color:red">Forwarding Personal Data to Third Parties</h3>
		<p>Your personal information may be passed on to third parties only if this is necessary to process a payment

transaction or a business transaction with our partners. Essentially these are respectable businesses that strictly

comply with applicable data protection regulations. BuyHatke will not release any personal information on you or

forward this to third parties insofar as you have not given your express consent to do so, or unless we are required to

do so by law.</p>
<p>When you use BuyHatke and bid by mobile phone, you consent to have your phone number provided to Bidon private

Limited by the phone company so that you can be notified in the case of an item being purchased at auction.</p>
<p>
In other situations, personal data will be passed on only to the extent that we are required to do so by law. For

example, personal data is passed on to the law enforcement and regulatory authority.
</p>
		<h3 style="color:red">Providing Data within the Corporate Group</h3>
		<p>BuyHatke assures you that should data be provided this way, security and confidentiality will be guaranteed with no

change, and that the data will continue to be subject to the Data Protection Statement above.
</p>
	
<h3 style="color:red">Viewing/Changing Personal Data</h3>
		<p>You can view the information in your BuyHatke account at any time and update it as necessary using your BuyHatke

user name and your BuyHatke password. Your mobile phone number for activating your account can only be

changed by contacting our Customer Service.
</p>
<p>Once we are informed, we will adjust incorrect data accordingly.
<br>
We will notify you upon request at any time as to whether and what personal data in respect to your identity or your

pseudonym has been stored.</p>

<h3 style="color:red">Revoking Consent/Deleting Your Account</h3>
		<p>You can revoke your consent to the storage and processing of your personal data here at any time, effective

immediately.
<br>
You can delete or deactivate your BuyHatke account at any time. When you delete your membership, your personal

data is removed from our database unless we are required to save the data. As a rule it takes two to three business

days until your information is completely removed from all records.
</p>

<h3 style="color:red">The Use of Cookies at our Website</h3>
		<p>BuyHatke uses so-called "cookies", which are files that are stored on your computer that can be retrieved to assist in

customizing your experience with the online service. The information saved supports the functionality of the site, for

example by keeping track of your visual preferences or controlling the frequency of "pop-up" windows. These cookies

are deleted after one month. You are free to prevent cookies from being saved on your hard drive by adjusting the

corresponding settings in your browser. It is not necessary to accept cookies in order to use our service. However, we

would like to point out that turning off these settings may result in limited functionality.
</p>


<h3 style="color:red">Security Measures</h3>
		<p>The information in your BuyHatke account and in your BuyHatke profile is password protected, so that only you have

access to this personal information. Please note that you are not permitted to provide your password to anyone else.

BuyHatke will never ask for your password in e-mails that you receive unexpectedly or that you did not request.

Please remember to log out of your account and to close your internet browser window when you leave the BuyHatke

site; this is especially important if you use a PC in public locations. At present, this is the safest way to ensure that no

one has access to your personal information. We assume no liability for the abuse of login data and passwords used.
</p>

<h3 style="color:red">Protection from Web Crawlers or Spam</h3>
		<p>BuyHatke assures you that we will use your e-mail address with your express consent only for the purposes stated in

the Terms of Use. We will not sell your e-mail address to third parties, and we will prevent your e-mail address from

being recorded by "web crawlers" or "web spiders" to the best of our ability. If you believe that your e-mail address

has been recorded in this way, please let us know immediately.
</p>

<h3 style="color:red">Data Protection Guidelines Changes</h3>
		<p>When there are changes to the Data Protection Guidelines, we will indicate this on the BuyHatke website.
