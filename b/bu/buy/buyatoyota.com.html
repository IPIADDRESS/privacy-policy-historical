                <p class="privacyUnderline">By using this Website, you signify your consent to the terms of this Privacy Policy.  If you do not agree to this Privacy Policy, please do not use this Website. We may modify this Privacy Policy from time to time, and when we do so, we will post the modified Privacy Policy here, with the date of the most recent revision.  Please check this Privacy Policy frequently to be sure you are aware of our current policies.</p>
                <p><strong>INFORMATION WE COLLECT AND HOW WE USE IT</strong></p>
                <p> The amount and type of information we collect depends on how you use the Website. This Privacy Policy applies only to information collected through the Website.  This Privacy Policy does not apply to any other website other than BuyAToyota.com.</p>
                <p><u>Non-Personal Information</u> -</p>
                <p>You can visit this Website for general use such as reading vehicle product information or using our online tools, such as the calculators and configurators, without telling us who you are and without revealing any personal information about yourself (other than, in some cases, your zip code). When you use the Website in this way, we collect and store the name of your Internet service provider, your browser (including available plug-ins and browser functionality), the type of machine you are using, the IP address of your machine, the website that referred you to us, the pages of the Website that you view, the date and time that you access the Website, and any other information that cannot identify you personally ("Non-Personal Information"). We use this Non-Personal Information to generate statistics and measure Website activity to improve your experience with the Website.  Non-Personal Information does not allow us to identify you.</p>
                <p><u>Personally Identifiable Information</u> -</p>
                <p>In order to take advantage of certain services available on the Website, you must provide us with certain information that identifies you ("Personally Identifiable Information").  These services include, for example, sending you new vehicle information alerts, promotions, newsletters and mailed brochures. Depending upon the type of service you request, the Personally Identifiable Information we collect may include your name, mailing address, e-mail address, phone number, date of birth, what service you have requested, or other relevant information.</p>
                <p>In addition to using your Personally Identifiable Information to provide the service(s) you requested, we may use your Personally Identifiable Information to give you a more customized, interactive experience with the Website, to help us develop new products and services that meet your needs, or to measure the effectiveness of our online advertising initiatives, or other similar purposes.</p>
                <p>Your Personally Identifiable Information and your Non-Personal Information (the "Information") may be shared with our business partners to assist us in fulfilling your request(s).  We may also share your information with our affiliate companies, including Toyota Motor Sales, Inc., authorized Toyota dealers, and Toyota dealer advertising associations for their own use.</p>
                <p><u>Promotional Programs</u> -</p>
                <p>From time to time, we may use your Personally Identifiable Information to enable you to participate in promotional activities, such as sweepstakes, contests, games, special events, blogs and chats ("Programs"). Sometimes Programs are made available through joint efforts with an affiliated or unaffiliated business partner. If you choose to participate, we may use the information you provide in connection with the Program as part of your Personally Identifiable Information. For example, we may send you email messages related to the Program or your account activity, or for selection and notification of sweepstakes or contest winners.</p>
                <p>Your Personally Identifiable Information may also be shared with and used by our business partners or affiliate companies if you indicate your interest in receiving communications directly from that business partner or affiliate company.  If you elect to receive communications from our business partner, your information will be used by that company in accordance with its policies and this privacy policy will not apply to that company's use of your information. Sometimes the rules, terms and conditions or disclaimers that apply to a particular Program include information on how we may use the information that you provide to us through your participation in the Program. If there is a conflict between the rules, terms and conditions that apply to a particular Program and this Privacy Policy, those terms and conditions applying to the particular Program will govern. Please review all of the information about a Program before you provide us with any personal information.</p>
                <p><u>Blogs/Public Areas</u> -</p>
                <p>Please remember that blogs, chat rooms, bulletin boards and similar features are public areas on the Website and the information you disclose there is not confidential.  Any information posted in these areas of the Website can be viewed by other visitors or Internet users. You should not post Personally Identifiable Information in these areas.  The information presented in these areas of the Website reflects the views of the individual users who have posted such comments/materials and does not necessarily reflect the view of  Toyota Motor Sales, U.S.A. , Inc, authorized Toyota dealers, and  Toyota dealer advertising associations or any of our affiliates.  We reserve the right (but shall have no obligation) to monitor the use of these areas of our Website and to remove postings that we determine, in our sole discretion, to be inappropriate.</p>

                <p>For some features on the Website, you can submit information about other people to us. For example, if you wish to invite your friends to participate in a Program offered on the Website or forward particular content from the Website to your friends, you will be asked to submit your friends' email addresses. Our use, sharing and protection of your friends' information will also be subject to the terms of the Program and this Privacy Policy.</p>
                <p><u>Surveys</u> -</p>
                <p>From time to time we may conduct surveys on the Website. If you decide to participate, you may be asked to provide certain demographic information (such as your gender, date of birth and zip code). We may use the information that you submit, including your responses to the survey questions, for the purposes identified to you prior to your participation in the survey. In some cases, we may publish the results of the survey but will do so only as aggregate information and you will not be individually identified. As we may be conducting certain surveys with our business partners or other third parties, we may also share the results of those surveys with those third parties but will not identify individuals.  In addition, we may ask you to update your contact information.  When you provide us with updated contact information, we may share that contact information with our affiliated companies, our dealers, and advertising associations for their own use.</p>

                <p><strong>USE OF COOKIES</strong></p>
                <p>Cookies are pieces of information that a website transfers to the hard drive of a user's computer for record-keeping purposes so that we may track site and user activity. The use of cookies is an industry standard and you will find them at most major websites. By showing how and when visitors use the Website, cookies help us track those areas of our Website that are popular and which areas are not. Many improvements and updates to the Website are based on data such as total number of visitors and pages viewed.</p>
                <p>Most browsers are initially set to accept cookies. If you would prefer, you can set yours to refuse cookies or to alert you when cookies are being sent. However, it is possible that some parts of the Website, like the configurator areas, will not function properly if you do so. Also, without the use of cookies, we will not be able to recognize you as a visitor over time, and thus we will not be able to customize your experience with the Website.</p>
