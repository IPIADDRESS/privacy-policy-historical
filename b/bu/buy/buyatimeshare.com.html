There is no way for us to ensure or guarantee the privacy of User information before it arrives at the Website or after it leaves the Website, and we are not responsible for the actions of any third parties that may receive any such information.</p><p><b>INFORMATION THAT WE COLLECT</b></p><p><b>Information That You Provide</b></p><p>We collect and store information you enter on the Website.&nbsp; All Users have the option of providing various types of personally identifiable information to us through the Website.&nbsp; To perform the services offered through the Website, we need to collect and distribute personally identifiable information.&nbsp; We are committed to the responsible handling of any personal information you provide to us.&nbsp; This means we will use it only as outlined below.&nbsp; Users are welcome to browse our Website.&nbsp; However, to participate in some of our services, Users will be required to complete brief registration forms or enter other information.&nbsp; These forms may ask for personally identifiable information, including your name, address, phone numbers, and credit card information.&nbsp; When personally identifiable information is collected, it is subject to the terms of this Privacy Notice.&nbsp; Information entered by Users may be transmitted to our trusted business partners who fulfill the services requested by those Users.&nbsp; We may also use information entered by you to respond to your requests and communicate with you.</p><p>We encourage you to provide your personally identifiable information to us so you to take full advantage of the Website.&nbsp; Providing your personally identifiable information, however, is completely voluntary.&nbsp; You may choose not to provide us with your personally identifiable information.&nbsp; You will still have access to the Website even if you do not provide us with your personally identifiable information, but you will not be able to use certain services or features available through the Website that require you to enter your personally identifiable information to function.</p><p><b>Information Collected Automatically</b></p><p>We receive and store certain types of information each time you access the Website.&nbsp; We log your IP address to help us to diagnose problems with our servers, administer the Website, and track usage statistics.&nbsp; We match IP addresses to completed User registration forms for validation and error checking purposes.&nbsp; If you reached the Website by clicking on a link or ad from another website, then we may also log that information.&nbsp; This helps us to maximize our Internet exposure and to understand the interests of our Users.&nbsp; In general, this information is used to generate overall anonymous reports on our Users that enable us to improve the effectiveness of the Website.&nbsp;</p><p><b>Data Tracking</b></p><p>CookiesWhen you visit the Website, we may send one or more small files known as "cookies" to your computer.&nbsp; A cookie may contain information that allows us to track your path through the Website and to determine whether you have visited us before.&nbsp; However, unless you provide us with personally identifiable information, the cookies will not contain any information that would allow us to personally identify you.&nbsp; If you do provide personally identifiable information to us, the cookie is tied to this information so that our systems will recognize you each time you visit the Website.&nbsp; In that way, we can save your preferences from visit to visit and present you with a customized version of the Website, without requiring you to log into the Website every time you visit. Our cookies cannot be used to read any other data from your computer and cannot retrieve information from any other cookies created by other Websites.&nbsp; We use cookies to help us understand how Users use the Website, and to help us to improve the Website.&nbsp; You may refuse to accept a cookie from us by following the procedures for rejecting cookies specific to your web browser.&nbsp;&nbsp; Although you may do so, you may find that your browser reacts strangely when visiting not only our Website, but other websites as well.&nbsp;</p><p>If you visit the website of one of our business partners (e.g., advertisers) by clicking on a link from our Website, they may also use cookies on their website.&nbsp; We have no access to or control over these cookies.&nbsp; This privacy statement covers the use of cookies by us only and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers or other websites.</p><p><b>User Activity Tracking</b></p><p>We may employ software technology that enables us to track certain aspects of a User's visit to the Website.&nbsp; This technology helps us better manage content on the Website by informing us what content is effective.&nbsp; The software typically uses two methods to track User activity: 1) "trackers" and 2) "clear gifs".&nbsp; Trackers are pieces of executable code that are embedded in a web page that track usage activity including which pages are viewed, when they are viewed, and how long the pages are viewed.&nbsp; Clear gifs are tiny graphics with unique identifiers, which are embedded in web pages and email messages that track whether or not a User has viewed a particular web page or email message.&nbsp; User activity information may be associated with additional information about a User's session, such as IP Address and the type of browser used, and personally identifiable information, if provided by the User.</p><p>If you arrive at the Website by "clicking through" from another website, and you have registered with that other website, then certain information about you that you provided to that other website, such as the terms you were searching on that led you to the Website, may be transmitted to us and we may use it.&nbsp; You should review the Privacy Notice of any website from which you reached the Website in order to determine what information was collected by that website and for what purpose(s) you agreed that website could use that information.&nbsp;&nbsp; We may or may not retain information about you provided to us by other websites.&nbsp; If we do, we will only use it in accordance with this Privacy Notice.&nbsp; Such information may or may not be associated with other User activity data or personally identifiable information.</p><p><b>HOW WE USE INFORMATION WE COLLECT</b></p><p><b>General Uses of Information</b></p><p>We may use the information (whether or not personally identifiable) that you provide to us to:</p><ul><br>	<li>Make your next visit to the Website more personalized;<br>	</li><br>	<li>Process or complete transactions requested by you;<br>	</li><br>	<li>Contact you regarding administrative issues, such as questions about your specific request;<br>	</li><br>	<li>Email information and offers to you;<br>	</li><br>	<li>Mail information and offers to you;<br>	</li><br>	<li>Make telephone calls to you with information and offers;<br>	</li><br>	<li>Provide your information to trusted business partners to fulfill services you have requested;<br>	</li><br>	<li>Compile anonymous statistical information and analyses;<br>	</li><br>	<li>Provide compiled anonymous information to third parties; and<br>	</li><br>	<li>Provide, sell, or rent your personally identifiable information to third parties for advertising purposes.<br>	</li><br></ul><p><b>Surveys &amp; Contests</b></p><p>From time-to-time our Website may request personally identifiable information from Users via surveys or contests.&nbsp; Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and the User therefore has a choice whether or not to disclose personally identifiable information.&nbsp; The requested information typically includes contact information (such as name and shipping address), and demographic information (such as zip code).&nbsp; Contact information will be shared with the contest or survey sponsors to notify the winners and award prizes.&nbsp; Survey information will be used for purposes of monitoring or improving the use and satisfaction of the Website.&nbsp; Users' personally identifiable information collected through surveys or contests is not shared with third parties who are not agents, service providers or business partners, unless we give prior notice and receive your permission for the sharing.&nbsp;
