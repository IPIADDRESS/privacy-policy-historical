</font></p><p align="CENTER"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><b>I.	Information Which We Collect</b></font></p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">

<p>	We may request that you voluntarily supply us with personal information, including your e-mail address, postal address, home or work telephone number, credit card number (only if you choose to purchase a product online), for purposes such as correspondence, making a purchase, or participating in online contests, surveys or games.
