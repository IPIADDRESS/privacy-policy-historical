      <p>Your privacy is very important to us. To make use of certain features of our website; ie, <a href="http://mail.buffalo.com/">Free email</a>, <a href="http://www.buffalo.com/calendar/">E-vents@Buffalo.comSM</a>, <a href="http://www.buffalo.com/calendar/my_calendar/accounts/">MyCalendar@Buffalo.comSM</a>, etc., visitors need to register and provide certain information as part of the registration process. The information you provide will help us to provide the services you request from us. One of the things we will do with this information is offer more personalized features and make our features and our site more useful to you. </p>
      <p>Supplying such information is voluntary, but it makes it possible to supply personalized services to you. If you supply your email address and areas of interest, we can send you email notifications of new features or newsworthy items that may interest you; if you supply information on how to contact you, we can notify you if you're a winner in one of our many promotional contests. </p>
      <p>We utilize a standard feature of browser software called a "cookie" to assign each visitor a unique number that resides on your browser. We use this as a form of identification, although a cookie can't identify a visitor, it only identifies the computer that a visitor uses to access our site. Unless you voluntarily provide personal information through registration for one of our services, we don't know who you are, even if we assign a cookie to your browser. Our cookie cannot read data off of your hard drive. Our partners, affiliates, sponsors and advertisers may assign their own cookies to your browser when you access their sites, a process we do not monitor or control. </p>
      <p>Cookies enable us to deliver personalized services to you. We can improve and enhance our site if we know the path visitors are taking through our site, which pages of our site are being visited and how often. Of course, you can set your browser not to accept cookies but, if you do, it is possible that some features of Buffalo.comSM and BuffaloNews.com may not function properly or you may not be able to utilize the personalized services enjoyed by other visitors to our site. For further information on setting your browser's cookies, please refer to the Help instructions furnished with your browser or contact the browser's manufacturer. Buffalo.comSM cannot provide assistance with your cookie settings. </p>
      <p>Our web servers automatically collect certain information about your computer's connection to the internet when you visit our site, including your IP address, the number that tells computers attached to the internet where to send you the web pages you want to view. We use your IP address to deliver our web pages to you, to tailor our site to your personal interests and to measure our siteâ€™s traffic. </p>
      <p>To make our site more valuable to our visitors and to provide the content that they seek, we offer some features in conjunction with other providers that specialize in offering such services. Also, our site contains links to many other websites whose privacy policies we do not control. When you click on one of these links and leave our servers (check the URL in your browser's location bar to see where you are), that site's privacy policy governs any personal information you provide to that site. We recommend you familiarize yourself with that site's policy, as it may differ from Buffalo.com'sSM. </p>
      <p>Buffalo.comSM does not sell, trade or rent any personal information about its users unless otherwise indicated on afilliated Buffalo.com websites. However, Buffalo.comSM does share information with our partners, affiliates, sponsors and advertisers to assist them in market research and to confirm the value of advertising on Buffalo.comSM, and this information is in the form of aggregate statistics on traffic to pages of our site. These statistics include no personally identifying information. If you have consented as part of the registration process for free email, contests and other features, we also share information on our visitors with our partners, affiliates, sponsors and advertisers that may be marketing products and services of interest to you. As part of the registration process, we give you the opportunity to decline to receive any mailings from Buffalo.comSM, its partners, affiliates, sponsors or advertisers.</p>
      <p>All information gathered on Buffalo.comSM is encrypted for storage on our database. However, no security system is impenetrable and we cannot guarantee the security of our database, nor can we guarantee that information you supply will not be intercepted while being transmitted to us over the Internet. </p>
