						<p>We can be reached by writing to Buffets, Inc., 1460 Buffet Way, Eagan, MN 55121, or you can reach us by telephone at 651-994-8608. This Policy is effective as of 7/1/05.<br>
							<br>
							Our web server automatically recognizes each visitor's domain name. For visitors merely browsing our site, we generally collect only the domain name and user-specific browsing data regarding what pages consumers access or visit. With respect to on-line orders or other pages that specifically request the visitor to supply a name and address, telephone number, and payment information (e.g., credit card number and billing address), the data collected is used for processing the order or otherwise fulfilling the page-specific purpose shown unless otherwise provided in this privacy policy.<br>
							<br>
							The information we collect is used for internal review to improve the content of our web page, and is shared with agents or contractors who assist in providing support for our internal operations. Except as indicated below, it is not shared with other organizations for commercial purposes. We abide by all legal mandates to disclose data upon court order or at the request of governmental authorities conducting an investigation. We also use the information to verify or enforce compliance with the policies governing our web site and applicable laws or to protect against misuse or unauthorized use.<br>
							<br>
							With respect to cookies: We use cookies to record session information, such as items that consumers add to their shopping cart.<br>
							<br>
							From time to time, we may make the e-mail addresses of those who access our site available to other reputable organizations whose products or services we think you might find interesting. If you do not want us to share your e-mail address with other companies or organizations, or do not want to receive e-mail from us in the future, please let us know by writing to us at the above address.<br>
							<br>
							From time to time, we may provide updates and promotional information to our customer email addresses that are voluntarily provided to us as part of our various clubs and programs. If you do not want us to send you updates and promotional information via email, please let us know by writing to us at the above address.<br>
							<br>
							From time to time, we may make our customer e-mail lists available to other organizations that we believe to be reputable and whose products or services we think you might find interesting. If you do not want us to share your e-mail address with other companies or organizations, please let us know by writing to us at the above address.<br>
							<br>
							If you supply us with your postal address on line you will only receive the information for which you provided us your address.<br>
							<br>
							We sometimes collect telephone numbers from individuals related to the on line orders they have placed. If you object to the sharing of this information with others, please provide us with your name and phone number, and we will remove this information from the lists that we share with other organizations on a go-forward basis. It may, however, be impractical to remove names from lists previously supplied to others.<br>
							<br>
							With respect to ad servers: We do not partner with or have special relationships with any ad server companies.<br>
							<br>
							From time to time, we may use customer information for new, unanticipated uses not previously disclosed in our privacy notice. If our information practices change at some time in the future, we will post the policy changes to our web site to notify you of these changes, and we will use for these new purposes only data collected from the time of the policy change forward. If you are concerned about how your information is used, you should check back at our web site periodically.<br>
							<br>
							Customers may request that their personal information not be used for purposes other than those for which it was originally collected by writing to us at the above address.<br>
							<br>
							Upon written request to the address shown above, we will confirm the types of information currently maintained about the requesting party. This will not reflect information previously collected that has been discarded. Upon request we offer visitors the ability to have factual inaccuracies corrected in information that we maintain about them.<br>
							<br>
							With respect to security: When we transfer and receive certain types of sensitive information such as financial information, we redirect visitors to a secure server. Please consult your user documentation supplied by the supplier of your web browsing software to determine how your specific software displays whether a secure server connection is in place. It is the user's obligation to confirm whether such a secure connection is being used when an order is placed. We maintain security measures in place in our physical facilities, or those of our vendors, intended to protect against the loss, misuse or alteration of information that we have collected from you.<br>
