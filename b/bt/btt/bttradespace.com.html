                                and security of your personal information. BT is registered under the data protection

                                We sometimes use other companies to provide services to you or to provide services
                                to us. To enable them to do this, we may need to share your personal information
                                with them. When we do so, these companies are required to act in accordance with
                                the instructions we give them and they must meet the requirements of the Data Protection
                                Act to keep the information secure.<br>
                                We may share your personal information with other parts of BT to enable them to

                                provide this information in accordance with our code of practice on the disclosure
                                of customer information. This code limits BT´s ability to share information
                                in this manner and is intended to prevent BT gaining unfair competitive advantage
                                over its competitors.<br>
                                We may share your personal information with other companies so that they can contact
                                you with details of other products or services you may be interested in. We will
                                only do this if you have agreed to this and where the companies agree to use your
                                personal information for that purpose only. If you have agreed to receive information
                                about products and services from another company and later decide not to you will
                                need to contact that company yourself to let them know. You can of course ask us
                                not to continue to provide your personal information to any more companies in future.<br>
                                We may provide information, in response to properly made requests, for the purposes
                                of the prevention and detection of crime, and the apprehension or prosecution of
                                offenders. We may also provide information for the purpose of safeguarding national
                                security. In either case we do so in accordance with the Data Protection Act. We
                                also provide information when required to do so by law, for example under a court
                                order, or in response to properly made demands, under powers contained in legislation.<br>

                                assets, we may disclose personal information to the new (or prospective) owner.
                                If we do so, we will require them to keep it confidential.<br>

                                period. Unless there is a specific legal requirement for us to keep the information,
                                we will retain it for no longer than is necessary for the purposes for which the

                                Countries in the European Economic Area (EEA) are required to have a similar standard
                                of protection of personal data but this is not always the case in countries outside
                                of the EEA. We do sometimes transfer data outside the EEA but before doing so take
                                steps to ensure that your data will be given adequate protection as required by
                                the Data Protection Act.
