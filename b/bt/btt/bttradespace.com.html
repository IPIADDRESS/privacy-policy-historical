					<p><strong>BT Websites Privacy and Security Policy </strong></p>
<p>This page covers our Privacy and cookie Policy, for the full BT Tradespace Terms of Use, please refer to our <a href="http://explore.bttradespace.com/terms/http://" target="_self">Terms &amp; Policies page</a></p>
<p>We have developed this policy because we want you to feel confident about the privacy and security of your personal information</p>
<p><strong>Who are we?</strong></p>
<p>BT Group plc is the holding company for an integrated group of businesses that   provides voice and data services in the UK and overseas. British   Telecommunications plc is a wholly-owned subsidiary of BT Group plc and holds   virtually all businesses and assets of the BT group.<br>
BT has four customer-focused lines of business: BT Global Services, BT   Retail, BT Wholesale and Openreach. BT Retail, BT Wholesale and Openreach   operate mainly within the UK, where BT is the largest communications services   provider to the residential and business markets, supplying a wide range of   communications products and services, including voice, data, internet and   multimedia services, and offering a comprehensive range of managed and   packaged communications solutions.<br>
BT Global Services provides a range of products and services, including   communications, networked IT and consultancy services to address the needs of   major corporations, governments and multi-site global organisations. In April   2007, we announced a new structure, which includes two new business units; BT   Design will be responsible for the design and development of the platforms,   systems and processes which will support our services; BT Operate will be   responsible for their deployment and operation.<br>
When we refer to “we” or “our” or “BT” we are   referring to BT Group plc (which includes British Telecommunications plc) and   its subsidiaries, or any of them, as the context requires.<br>
<strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Why do we have a Privacy Policy?</strong></p>
<p>We have   developed this policy because we want you to feel confident about the privacy   and security of your personal information. BT is registered under the data   protection laws in the United Kingdom and takes all reasonable care to   prevent any unauthorised access to your personal information.<br>
When we refer to “personal information” in this privacy policy, we   mean information, which identifies you as an individual, or is capable of   doing so. Accordingly, we may hold and use data about you in your capacity as   a consumer, a business customer, as an individual acting on behalf of a   business customer, as a shareholder, or in any other capacity, for example,   when you visit our websites.<br>
<strong><em>Please read this privacy policy carefully.</em></strong> If you are visiting   any of our websites or using any of our services, by continuing to do so, you   indicate your agreement to our use of your personal information as set out in   this privacy policy.      <a href="http://www2.bt.com/btPortal/application?pageid=pan_privacy_policy&amp;siteArea=pan&amp;s_cid=pan_FURL_privacypolicy&amp;referer=yes#mainMenu"><br>
</a> <strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>What does this privacy policy cover?</strong></p>
<p>This   privacy policy only applies to how BT deals with your personal information.   It does not apply to any other company or to any other company´s websites   even if you access them through BT. If you disclose your personal information   to other companies your information will be dealt with according to their   privacy practices.      <a href="http://www2.bt.com/btPortal/application?pageid=pan_privacy_policy&amp;siteArea=pan&amp;s_cid=pan_FURL_privacypolicy&amp;referer=yes#mainMenu"><br>
</a> <strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>What personal information do we collect about   you, and when do we collect it?</strong></p>
<p>We may   ask you for information to enable us to provide a service to you and we   collect this information by telephone, written correspondence or via a   website. We may ask you for information including your name, private/business   address, contact telephone numbers and email address. We may also ask you for   other information that relates to the service you are using or ordering. For   example, we may need your credit card number to charge you for certain   services.<br>
We may ask you for information to enable us to provide a service to you and   we collect this information by telephone, written correspondence or via a   website. We may ask you for information including your name, private/business   address, contact telephone numbers and email address. We may also ask you for   other information that relates to the service you are using or ordering. For   example, we may need your credit card number to charge you for certain   services.</p>
<ul>
<li>When        you (or someone using your telephone line) make a telephone call or send        a fax that uses our telephone network or connect to the world wide web,        we keep a record of that call (including the number called) to enable BT        to charge for it. We also receive from other operators information about        calls made over our network, where we need that information for        connecting and billing purposes.</li>
<li>If        someone abuses or damages the telephone network, for example by making        offensive or nuisance calls, we may keep information relating to that        abuse.</li>
<li>We        have information about your use of our services (such as the amount of        time you spend on-line), which we use to manage our network, and for        billing. We may also use this information for marketing products and        services but we will give the option to opt out of receiving this        material.</li>
<li>If        you enter into any of our competitions or promotions, we may ask for        information about you, which will be made clear at the time you enter.        We will also inform you of the purposes for which the information you        provide may be used.</li>
<li>We        may ask you from time to time about what use you make of the services we        provide, what other services you would like us to provide in the future,        and for other information, such as lifestyle data.</li>
<li>We        collect information from visitors to our websites to help us to make        improvements to the websites and to the services we make available. We        know, for instance, how many visitors there are to each website, when        they visited, for how long and to which areas of our website they went.        We may share this information with our advertisers and to other        companies which offer their goods or services on our websites. It helps        to show these organisations how effective our websites are as sales        channels for their products. You or any other individual cannot be        identified from the information we share as the data is aggregated and        anonymised.</li>
<li>We        may also monitor and record our communications with you, including        e-mails and phone conversations. Information which we collect may then        be used for training purposes, quality assurance, to record details        about the products and services you order from us, and in order to meet        our legal and regulatory obligations generally</li>
</ul>
<p>We do   not use this information to:</p>
<ul>
<li>analyse        your visits to any other websites (except that we do track you if you go        to websites carrying our banner, but we do not identify personal details        while we do this)</li>

</a> <strong>What personal information do we collect about you   from other companies and organisations?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>We        may receive personal information about you from other companies and        organisations (for example, for marketing purposes) and we rely on these        third parties to obtain your consent for us to use this information.</li>
<li>We        receive information from other telecommunications operators about their        customers to enable us to enter their details (together with our own customer´s        information) in telephone directories. We also make telephone numbers        available on directory enquiry services unless customers (BT or other        licensed telecommunications operators) have chosen to be ex-directory.</li>
</ul>

</a> <strong>Credit checking and account management</strong></p>
<p>1.&nbsp;Please   note that when you order goods and services from BT we may make enquiries   about you for credit reference purposes. These enquiries include searching   your records held by Experian/Equifax or any other Credit Reference Agency   (CRA) and checking any details held on you by the Interactive Media in retail   Group (IMRG) Security alert or other Fraud Prevention Agencies (FPAs). When   CRAs receive a search from us they will place a footprint on your file that   may be seen by other organisations. At all times where your information is   disclosed to us we may retain it and we will protect it in accordance with   this policy and keep it secure. We will retain the outcome of searches we   carry out with CRAs to avoid having to make repeat searches against your   credit file in circumstances where we may need to carry out further credit   checks in respect of additional products or services ordered by you. We will   only retain this data for a reasonable period.<br>
2.&nbsp;We will carry out checks while assessing your application for   telephone service and will verify your identity. We do this to help protect   you from identity theft and fraud, and also to prevent and detect crime and   money laundering.&nbsp; We may also make periodic searches at CRAs and FPAs   to manage your account with us.<br>
3.&nbsp;If you tell us that you have a spouse or financial associate, we will   link your records together so you must be sure that you have their agreement   to disclose information about them. CRAs also link your records together and   these links will remain on your and their files until such time as you or your   partner successfully files for a disassociation with the CRAs to break that   link.<br>
4.&nbsp;Information on applications will be sent to CRAs and will be recorded   by them. We may also give them details of your accounts and billing   information, including how you manage it/them to CRAs We may tell them about   payments you make to us, your account balances, and payment defaults [We may   also give them historical information we hold about your payment history with   us.] If you do not pay your bills on time, CRAs will record this information   and it may be supplied to other organisations by CRAs and FPAs to perform   similar checks and to trace your whereabouts and recover debts that you owe   to them as well as us.</p>
<p><strong>How to find out more</strong><br>
This is a condensed version and if you would like to read the full details of   how your data may be used please visit our website at or phone [0800800150]   or ask one of our staff.<br>
You can contact the CRAs currently operating in the UK; the information they   hold may not be the same so it is worth contacting them all. They will charge   you a small statutory fee.</p>

</a> <strong>Do we share your personal information with anyone   else?</strong></p>
<p>As a   normal part of our business we share with other communications companies   information for connecting and charging for calls over each others networks.<br>
We sometimes use other companies to provide services to you or to provide   services to us. To enable them to do this, we may need to share your personal   information with them. When we do so, these companies are required to act in   accordance with the instructions we give them and they must meet the   requirements of the Data Protection Act to keep the information secure.<br>
We may share your personal information with other parts of BT to enable them   to conduct their own businesses and to market their products and services to   you. We provide this information in accordance with our code of practice on   the disclosure of customer information. This code limits BT´s ability to   share information in this manner and is intended to prevent BT gaining unfair   competitive advantage over its competitors.<br>
We may share your personal information with other companies so that they can   contact you with details of other products or services you may be interested   in. We will only do this if you have agreed to this and where the companies   agree to use your personal information for that purpose only. If you have   agreed to receive information about products and services from another   company and later decide not to you will need to contact that company   yourself to let them know. You can of course ask us not to continue to   provide your personal information to any more companies in future.<br>
We may provide information, in response to properly made requests, for the   purposes of the prevention and detection of crime, and the apprehension or   prosecution of offenders. We may also provide information for the purpose of   safeguarding national security. In either case we do so in accordance with   the Data Protection Act. We also provide information when required to do so   by law, for example under a court order, or in response to properly made   demands, under powers contained in legislation.<br>
If there is a change (or prospective change) in the ownership of BT or any of   its assets, we may disclose personal information to the new (or prospective)   owner. If we do so, we will require them to keep it confidential.<br>
If you believe the personal information we hold on your is incorrect you may   amend it by following the procedure set out below in “How can I change   the personal information BT holds about me?”         <a href="http://www2.bt.com/btPortal/application?pageid=pan_privacy_policy&amp;siteArea=pan&amp;s_cid=pan_FURL_privacypolicy&amp;referer=yes#mainMenu"><br>
</a> <strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>For how long does BT keep personal information?</strong></p>
<p>The   time period for which we keep information varies according to what the   information is used for. In some cases, there are legal requirements to keep   data for a minimum period. Unless there is a specific legal requirement for   us to keep the information, we will retain it for no longer than is necessary   for the purposes for which the data was collected or for which it is to be   further processed.            <strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>How do we protect your data when it is   transferred out of Europe?</strong></p>
<p>Countries   in the European Economic Area (EEA) are required to have a similar standard   of protection of personal data but this is not always the case in countries   outside of the EEA. We do sometimes transfer data outside the EEA but before   doing so take steps to ensure that your data will be given adequate   protection as required by the Data Protection Act.      <a href="http://www2.bt.com/btPortal/application?pageid=pan_privacy_policy&amp;siteArea=pan&amp;s_cid=pan_FURL_privacypolicy&amp;referer=yes#mainMenu"><br>
</a> <strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>How can I find out what personal information BT   holds about me?</strong></p>
<p>If you   want specific information ie.:-</p>
<ul>
<li>copies        of fault reports</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>copy        invoices</li>
</ul>
<p>then you must contact Customer Services.</p>
<p>If you are asking for a full subject access request then put your request in   writing, enclosing a cheque for £10 made payable to BT plc and send to   British Telecommunications PLC, PP M3042 DSAR, Colindale House, The Hyde,   Colindale, London NW9 6LB.</p>
<p>You will also need to provide the following information so that we can   process your request:</p>
<ul>
<li>The        relevant account number/s</li>
<li>The        relevant telephone number/s</li>
<li>The        relevant address/s</li>
<li>The        date and time if requesting a call recording? (<em>see also note below</em>)</li>
</ul>
<p>If you have any information such as reference numbers, dates and times of contact   then please include them in your request.<br>
<em><br>
(BT does record some calls for Quality and Training purposes, however, not   all calls are recorded. Calls are only held for a short period of time. If   you want a call recording it is essential that you provide the information   requested above, otherwise we will not be able to proceed with your request).</em><br>
Once we have all the relevant information we will process your request within   the 40 day time limit allowed under the terms of The Data Protection Act.      <a href="http://www2.bt.com/btPortal/application?pageid=pan_privacy_policy&amp;siteArea=pan&amp;s_cid=pan_FURL_privacypolicy&amp;referer=yes#mainMenu"><br>
</a> <strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>How can I change the personal information BT   holds about me?</strong></p>
<p>If the   information we hold about you is inaccurate, please let us know and we will   make the necessary amendments and confirm that these have been made.      <a href="http://www2.bt.com/btPortal/application?pageid=pan_privacy_policy&amp;siteArea=pan&amp;s_cid=pan_FURL_privacypolicy&amp;referer=yes#mainMenu"><br>
</a> <strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>How can I manage BT’s contact with me for   marketing purposes?</strong></p>
<p>You may   choose not to receive marketing information from BT and, if you are already   receiving such information from us, you can ask us to stop at any time. If   you would like BT not to call or mail you with details of products, services   and special offers, please call 0800 800 150 (residential customers) or 0800   400 400 (business customers) or contact your Account Manager.

<p><strong>How do we protect your personal information?</strong></p>
<p>We are   serious about guarding the security of your personal information and the   details of any transactions made. We take appropriate organisational and   technical security measures to protect your data against unauthorised   disclosure or processing. We use a secure server to store the information you   give us when you register or make an order (including your credit card   details and your password). Any personal data you send us on-line is securely   encrypted.<br>
Please note that your billing account number is a sensitive piece of   information, which can be used with your telephone number to find out   information about your use of BT´s services. Please be sure to keep this   information safe, and do not share it with others. For access to information   such as itemised billing and some business account and ordering services,   extra proof of identity and authorisation may be needed.      <a href="http://www2.bt.com/btPortal/application?pageid=pan_privacy_policy&amp;siteArea=pan&amp;s_cid=pan_FURL_privacypolicy&amp;referer=yes#mainMenu"><br>
</a> <strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>How do you find out about changes to our privacy   policy?</strong></p>
<p>We may   change our privacy policy from time to time. New policies will be published   on our web sites.      <a href="http://www2.bt.com/btPortal/application?pageid=pan_privacy_policy&amp;siteArea=pan&amp;s_cid=pan_FURL_privacypolicy&amp;referer=yes#mainMenu"><br>

<p><strong>Does BT’s privacy policy protect me when I use   BT’s websites?</strong></p>
<p>BT´s   privacy policy also applies to information collected when you use any of our   websites.<br>
You do not have to register to access most of our websites. However, if you   provide information via the “contact us” or any of the other   interactive features, you indicate your consent to our use of your personal   data in the manner described in this privacy policy.</p>
<ul>
<li>If        you do register on one of our websites, we may ask you to provide        personal details such as name, address, e-mail address, telephone number        and, where appropriate, BT account number. We also ask you to choose a        password, and to complete a password security question and answer, in        case you forget your password for any reason.</li>
<li>Once        you have registered on one of our websites, we may keep a record of your        use of any of the services made available via that particular website.        (Please see “When does BT use cookies” below for more        information on how we do this).</li>
<li>If        you choose not to register with us and only <em>browse</em> our websites,        we may gather information to help make your visit to our website more        satisfying. However, this information will not identify you personally.        (Please see “When does BT use cookies” below for more        information on how we do this).</li>
<li>If        you do not wish to register, you will still be able to use and order        some of the services offered via our websites. We will only ask you to        provide such information as necessary to enable us to carry out the        transaction in question. We will not use that information for any other        purpose. You should note that some services are only available if you        register on the website first.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you   have registered for any of the services available through our websites you   may choose to cancel that registration at any time. You can do this in one of   two ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>return        to the original registration page and following the instructions for        cancelling the registration; or</li>
<li>send        an e-mail to us by completing the feedback form</li>
</ul>
<p>Please   ensure you inform us of the service which you wish to cancel.<br>
If you do either of these, your personal details will be deleted from our   website database.<br>
If you have registered you have direct control over information in your   personal profile on our website. You can access and change this information   at any time by using the “Update your profile” link.<br>
Over and above what BT does to safeguard your privacy and security on-line,   there are a number of things you can do to protect yourself from Internet   fraud:</p>
<ul>
<li>Choose        a password (letters and digits) you can remember but others will not        guess, change it regularly and, if you do write it down, keep it        somewhere safe and secure.</li>
<li>When        you have finished your session on our website, make sure you prevent        your details being seen by anyone that you do not wish to see them. So,        if you have registered and logged in, remember to log off.</li>
<li>Clear        any cache so there is no record of any transactions left on screen –        both Netscape and Internet Explorer let you do this.</li>
<li>We        also recommend you then close your browser so any history of the session        is cleared. As an extra precaution, your session on bt.com will time out        if you have not used the site for 30 minutes.</li>
<li>We        collect information from visitors to our websites to help us to make        improvements to the websites and to the services we make available. We        know, for instance, how many visitors there are to each website, when        they visited, for how long and to which areas of our website they went.        We may share this information with our advertisers and to other        companies which offer their goods or services on our websites. It helps        to show these organisations how effective our websites are as sales        channels for their products. You or any other individual cannot be        identified from the information we share as the data is aggregated and        anonymised.</li>
<li>We        do not use this information to:</li>
<li>analyse        your visits to any other websites (except that we do track you if you go        to websites carrying our banner, but we do not identify personal details        while we do this); or</li>

<h2><span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>When do we use cookies and how do we get your   consent?</strong></span></h2>
<p><strong>What   are cookies?</strong></p>
<p>A “cookie” is a text file containing small amounts of information   which a server downloads to your personal computer (PC) or mobile when you   visit a website. The server then sends a cookie back to the originating   website each time you subsequently visit it, or if you visit another website   which recognises that cookie.</p>
<p>There   are different types of cookies which are used to do different things, such as   letting you navigate between different pages on a website efficiently,   remembering preferences you have given a website, and improving your overall   experience. Others are used to provide you with advertising which is more   tailored to your interests, or to measure the number of site visits and the   most popular pages users visit.</p>
<p>Some   cookies are allocated to your PC only for the duration of your visit to a   website, and these are called session based cookies. These automatically   expire when you close down your browser.</p>
<p>Another   type of cookie known as a “persistent”. These cookies would remain   on your PC for a period of time.</p>
<p>If you   want to know more about cookies please go to <a href="http://www.allaboutcookies.org/" target="_blank">www.allaboutcookies.org</a> which explains how cookies   work and how you can manage their use.<br>
<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>Your   consent to use cookies</strong></p>
<p>Cookies   are essential for helping us deliver a high quality online experience for our   customers. By using our website, you consent to us using cookies in   accordance with this Privacy Policy. If you would prefer us not to use   cookies then you can disable the cookies using the instructions set out below   or opt not to use our website.</p>
<p>However,   disabling your cookies may prevent us from delivering some or all of our   online services to you.            <strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>How do you disable cookies?</strong></p>
<p>All types of cookies can be removed from your PC   but there may be some deterioration in the service you receive (for example,   you may receive many pop up boxes containing the same advertisements or you   may not be able to access a page you earlier personalised).<br>
Your browser lets you choose whether to accept, not to accept or to be warned   before accepting cookies. These settings can be found in the advanced   preferences<br>
In Internet Explorer 9 select: Tools menu / Internet options / Privacy<br>
In Chrome select: Preferences / Settings / Advanced<br>
In Safari select: Preferences / Privacy<br>
In Firefox select: Tools menu / Options / Privacy / Cookies<br>
For removing the “Remember me” cookie, just deselect the box when   you sign in.                                 <strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>Are third party sites covered by this policy?</strong></p>
<p>Third   party Internet sites that you can link to from BT´s websites are not covered   by our privacy policy, so we urge you to be careful when you enter any   personal information online. BT accepts no responsibility or liability for   these sites.<br>
Other companies which advertise or offer their products or services on our   website may also allocate cookies to your PC. The types of cookies they use   and how they use the information generated by them will be governed by their   own privacy policies and not ours.</p>
