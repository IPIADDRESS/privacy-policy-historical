                            <p>
                                We have developed this policy because we want you to feel confident about the privacy
                                and security of your personal information. BT is registered under the data protection
                                laws in the United Kingdom and takes all reasonable care to prevent any unauthorised
                                access to your personal information.<br>
                                When we refer to "personal information" in this privacy policy, we mean
                                information, which identifies you as an individual, or is capable of doing so. Accordingly,
                                we may hold and use data about you in your capacity as a consumer, a business customer,
                                as an individual acting on behalf of a business customer, as a shareholder, or in
                                any other capacity, for example, when you visit our websites.<br>
                                <strong><em>Please read this privacy policy carefully.</em></strong> If you are

                                you indicate your agreement to our use of your personal information as set out in

                                This privacy policy only applies to how BT deals with your personal information.
                                It does not apply to any other company or to any other company´s websites
                                even if you access them through BT. If you disclose your personal information to
                                other companies your information will be dealt with according to their privacy practices.

                                with them. When we do so, these companies are required to act in accordance with
                                the instructions we give them and they must meet the requirements of the Data Protection

                                We may share your personal information with other parts of BT to enable them to

                                provide this information in accordance with our code of practice on the disclosure
                                of customer information. This code limits BT´s ability to share information
                                in this manner and is intended to prevent BT gaining unfair competitive advantage
                                over its competitors.<br><br>
                                We may share your personal information with other companies so that they can contact

                                only do this if you have agreed to this and where the companies agree to use your
                                personal information for that purpose only. If you have agreed to receive information
                                about products and services from another company and later decide not to you will
                                need to contact that company yourself to let them know. You can of course ask us
                                not to continue to provide your personal information to any more companies in future.<br><br>
                                We may provide information, in response to properly made requests, for the purposes

                                offenders. We may also provide information for the purpose of safeguarding national
                                security. In either case we do so in accordance with the Data Protection Act. We
                                also provide information when required to do so by law, for example under a court
                                order, or in response to properly made demands, under powers contained in legislation.<br><br>

                                assets, we may disclose personal information to the new (or prospective) owner.
                                If we do so, we will require them to keep it confidential.<br><br>
