<h2><a name="Who are we?" id="Who are we?"></a>Who are we?</h2>
<p>BT Group plc is the holding company for an integrated group of businesses that provides voice and data services in the UK and overseas. British Telecommunications plc is a wholly-owned subsidiary of BT Group plc and holds virtually all businesses and assets of the BT group.</p>
<p>BT has four customer-focused lines of business: BT Global Services, BT Retail, BT Wholesale and Openreach. BT Retail, BT Wholesale and Openreach operate mainly within the UK, where BT is the largest communications services provider to the residential and business markets, supplying a wide range of communications products and services, including voice, data, internet and multimedia services, and offering a comprehensive range of managed and packaged communications solutions. </p>
<p>BT Global Services provides a range of products and services, including communications, networked IT and consultancy services to address the needs of major corporations, governments and multi-site global organisations. In April 2007, we announced a new structure, which includes two new business units; BT Design will be responsible for the design and development of the platforms, systems and processes which will support our services; BT Operate will be responsible for their deployment and operation. </p>
<p>When we refer to "we" or "our" or "BT" we are referring to BT Group plc (which includes British Telecommunications plc) and its subsidiaries, or any of them, as the context requires.</p>
<h2><a name="Why do we have a policy?" id="Why do we have a policy?"></a>Why do we have a Privacy Policy?</h2>
<p>We have developed this policy because we want you to feel confident about the privacy and security of your personal information. BT is registered under the data protection laws in the United Kingdom and takes all reasonable care to prevent any unauthorised access to your personal information.</p>
<p>When we refer to "personal information" in this privacy policy, we mean information, which identifies you as an individual, or is capable of doing so. Accordingly, we may hold and use data about you in your capacity as a consumer, a business customer, as an individual acting on behalf of a business customer, as a shareholder, or in any other capacity, for example, when you visit our websites.</p>
<p>Please read this privacy policy carefully. If you are visiting any of our websites or using any our services, by continuing to do so, you indicate your agreement to our use of your personal information as set out in this privacy policy.<br>&nbsp;<br><a id="a_PSR_53d2dd08-000e-4d70-80ea-225ade768cae" title="Back to top hyperlink 21" href="#top">Back to top</a></p>
<h2><a name="What does this cover?" id="What does this cover?"></a>What does this privacy policy cover?</h2>
<p>This privacy policy only applies to how BT deals with your personal information. It does not apply to any other company or to any other company's websites even if you access them through BT. If you disclose your personal information to other companies your information will be dealt with according to their privacy practices.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br><a id="a_PSR_54a5ca6a-04b8-4b77-a245-38a0d5193db7" title="Back to top hyperlink 23" href="#top">Back to top</a></p>
<h2><a name="What personal information" id="What personal information"></a>What personal information do we collect about you, and when do we collect it?</h2>
<p>We may ask you for information to enable us to provide a service to you and we collect this information by telephone, written correspondence or via a website. We may ask you for information including your name, private/business address, contact telephone numbers and email address. We may also ask you for other information that relates to the service you are using or ordering. For example, we may need your credit card number to charge you for certain services.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>When you (or someone using your telephone line) make a telephone call or send a fax that uses our telephone network or connect to the world wide web, we keep a record of that call (including the number called) to enable BT to charge for it. We also receive from other operators information about calls made over our network, where we need that information for connecting and billing purposes.</p></li>
<li>
<p>If someone abuses or damages the telephone network, for example by making offensive or nuisance calls, we may keep information relating to that abuse. </p></li>
<li>
<p>We have information about your use of our services (such as the amount of time you spend on-line), which we use to manage our network, and for billing. We may also use this information for marketing products and services but we will give the option to opt out of receiving this material. </p></li>
<li>
<p>If you enter into any of our competitions or promotions, we may ask for information about you, which will be made clear at the time you enter. We will also inform you of the purposes for which the information you provide may be used. </p></li>
<li>
<p>We may ask you from time to time about what use you make of the services we provide, what other services you would like us to provide in the future, and for other information, such as lifestyle data. </p></li>
<li>
<p>We collect information from visitors to our websites to help us to make improvements to the websites and to the services we make available. We know, for instance, how many visitors there are to each website, when they visited, for how long and to which areas of our website they went. We may share this information with our advertisers and to other companies which offer their goods or services on our websites. It helps to show these organisations how effective our websites are as sales channels for their products. You or any other individual cannot be identified from the information we share as the data is aggregated and anonymised.</p></li></ul>
<p>We do not use this information to: </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>identify individuals visiting our website; or </p></li>
<li>
<p>analyse your visits to any other websites (except that we do track you if you go to websites carrying our banner, but we do not identify personal details while we do this); or </p></li>
<li>
<p>track any Internet searches which you may make while on our website.</p></li></ul>

<h2><a name="Companies and organisations" id="Companies and organisations"></a>What personal information do we collect about you from other companies and organisations?</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>We may receive personal information about you from other companies and organisations (for example, for marketing purposes) and we rely on these third parties to obtain your consent for us to use this information. </p></li>
<li>
<p>We receive information from other telecommunications operators about their customers to enable us to enter their details (together with our own customer's information) in telephone directories. We also make telephone numbers available on directory enquiry services unless customers (BT or other licensed telecommunications operators) have chosen to be ex-directory.</p></li>
<li>
<p>Please note that when you order goods and services from BT we may make enquiries about you for credit reference purposes. These enquires include searching your records held by Experian / Equifax or any other credit reference agency and checking any details held on you by the Interactive Media in Retail Group (IMRG) Security Alert or any other fraud prevention scheme. At all times where your information is disclosed to us we will protect it in accordance with this policy and keep it secure.</p></li></ul>

<h2><a name="Do we share" id="Do we share"></a>Do we share your personal information with anyone else?</h2>
<p>As a normal part of our business we share with other communications companies information for connecting and charging for calls over each others networks.</p>
<p>We sometimes use other companies to provide services to you or to provide services to us. To enable them to do this, we may need to share your personal information with them. When we do so, these companies are required to act in accordance with the instructions we give them and they must meet the requirements of the Data Protection Act to keep the information secure.</p>
<p>We may share your personal information with other parts of BT to enable them to conduct their own businesses and to market their products and services to you. We provide this information in accordance with our code of practice on the disclosure of customer information. This code limits BT's ability to share information in this manner and is intended to prevent BT gaining unfair competitive advantage over its competitors.</p>
<p>We may share your personal information with other companies so that they can contact you with details of other products or services you may be interested in. We will only do this if you have agreed to this and where the companies agree to use your personal information for that purpose only. If you have agreed to receive information about products and services from another company and later decide not to you will need to contact that company yourself to let them know. You can of course ask us not to continue to provide your personal information to any more companies in future.</p>
<p>We may provide information, in response to properly made requests, for the purposes of the prevention and detection of crime, and the apprehension or prosecution of offenders. We may also provide information for the purpose of safeguarding national security. In either case we do so in accordance with the Data Protection Act. We also provide information when required to do so by law, for example under a court order, or in response to properly made demands, under powers contained in legislation.</p>
<p>If there is a change (or prospective change) in the ownership of BT or any of its assets, we may disclose personal information to the new (or prospective) owner. If we do so, we will require them to keep it confidential.</p>
<p>If you believe the personal information we hold on your is incorrect you may amend it by following the procedure set out below in "How can I change the personal information BT holds about me?"</p>
<p><a id="a_PSR_2df62066-4523-4aa3-94ec-96264413bdf5" title="Back to top hyperlink 29" href="#top">Back to top</a></p>
<h2><a name="How long" id="How long"></a>For how long does BT keep personal information?</h2>
<p>The time period for which we keep information varies according to what the information is used for. In some cases, there are legal requirements to keep data for a minimum period. Unless there is a specific legal requirement for us to keep the information, we will retain it for no longer than is necessary for the purposes for which the data was collected or for which it is to be further processed.</p>
<h2><a name="How do we protect" id="How do we protect"></a>How do we protect your data when it is transferred out of Europe?</h2>
<p>Countries in the European Economic Area (EEA) are required to have a similar standard of protection of personal data but this is not always the case in countries outside of the EEA. We do sometimes transfer data outside the EEA but before doing so take steps to ensure that your data will be given adequate protection as required by the Data Protection Act.</p>
