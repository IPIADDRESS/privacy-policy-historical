Internet Privacy Policy
</p>
</font></b>

<font size="2" face="Arial,Helvetica">
<p>BNA, Inc. has been a leading publisher of specialized news and information services for business and professionals in many fields--including economics, environmental protection, health care, human resources, labor relations, law, occupational safety, and taxation--since 1929. The BNA family of companies includes the following wholly owned subsidiaries (collectively BNA): BNA International, Inc., BNA Communications, Inc., Tax Management, Inc., BNA Software, Pike &amp; Fischer, and the Institute of Management &amp; Administration, Inc. 

</p><p>BNA,Inc. publishes its information services in print and various electronic media, including Web-based formats. We are continually adapting to changes in technology to bring you the information you rely on faster and more efficiently than ever before.

</p><p>BNA publishes this Privacy Policy to reaffirm our commitment to maintaining the privacy of our customers in the electronic environment and inform you of our practices concerning the collection and use of information you provide us.

</p><h5>Browsing a BNA Web Site</h5>

<p>A visitor to a BNA Web site is not required to reveal any individually identifiable information, such as name, address, or telephone number. Nor is such information collected passively by electronic means. BNA Web servers collect other information-such as the make of a visitor's browser software and the Internet domain name of the location the visitor enters from-to help us diagnose technical problems and manage our sites by tracking user interests. We use this information only in the aggregate, so that we can better serve you.

</p><h5>Ordering Products &amp; Customer Registrations</h5>

<p>Some pages within BNA sites ask users to provide individually identifiable information to order a product, for customer service, or to register for a trial subscription.  You will know when this information is recorded because you will be asked to complete a form and submit it. The requested data may include your name, mail and e-mail addresses, and telephone or fax numbers.

</p><p>BNA collects this voluntarily provided information because it is needed to deliver products and services to those requesting them, provide customer support, or administer accounts. BNA occasionally compiles online transaction and registration information for internal analysis, such as identifying market segments and needs, as well as to inform current and prospective customers about BNA products and services. 

</p><p>Occasionally BNA is approached by companies and professional associations seeking to inform our subscribers about products or services that may be of interest to them.  We review these requests and when, in our judgement, we think the information would be of benefit to our subscribers, we cooperate in getting you this information.  We view receiving such information as a benefit for our subscribers who are seeking new tools to help them perform their jobs.

</p><h5>Credit Cards</h5>

<p>In some instances, BNA collects credit card information provided by you for billing purposes. BNA collects this information for the convenience of our customers but does not store, use, or share credit card information for any other purpose.

</p><h5>Security Safeguards</h5>

<p>BNA takes technical, administrative, and physical steps to protect against unauthorized access to and disclosure of individually identifiable information used to administer its customer accounts. All such information is handled securely within BNA and is not disclosed to unauthorized third parties.

</p><h5>Evolving Data Protection Practices for the Internet</h5>

<p>As communication technology continues to evolve, BNA will from time to time review and revise its data protection practices. Changes will be incorporated in this policy.

</p><h5>Questions and Concerns</h5>

<p>If you have any questions or concerns regarding BNA data protection practices, please send an e-mail message to BNA's Web site administrator at <a href="mailto:webmaster@bna.com">webmaster@bna.com</a>.
