            <h4>FOR EUROPEAN UNION CITIZENS</h4>

            <p>The European Union ("EU") maintains strict privacy laws. These rules differ significantly from the laws of the United States of America ("US"). To reconcile these differences, the US and the EU have created a safe harbor ("Safe Harbor") that defines mutually acceptable privacy operations. For more information see http://www.export.gov/safeharbor/.</p>

            <p>Blink New Media complies with the U.S.-EU Safe Harbor Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information from European Union member countries.  We have certified that we adhere to the Safe Harbor Privacy Principles of notice, choice, onward transfer, security, data integrity, access, and enforcement.  To learn more about the Safe Harbor program, and to view the company's certification, please visit http://www.export.gov/safeharbor/.</p>

            <p>In compliance with the Safe Harbor Principles, we commit to resolve complaints about your privacy and our collection or use of your personal information.  In the first instance, European Union citizens with inquiries or complaints regarding this privacy policy should first contact: privacy@bnmla.com.   Blink New Media  has further committed to refer unresolved privacy complaints under the Safe Harbor Principles to an independent dispute resolution mechanism, the BBB EU Safe Harbor, operated by the Council of Better Business Bureaus. Thus, if you do not receive timely acknowledgment of your complaint, or if your complaint is not satisfactorily addressed by Blink New Media you may contact:  </p>
