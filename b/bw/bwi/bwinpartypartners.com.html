<p><strong>1. PRIVACY</strong></p>
<p>We are GVC Services Limited of Suite 6, Atlantic Suites, Europort Avenue, Gibraltar, and We are committed to protecting your Personal Information. We have created this Privacy Notice to let you know what information We collect when you participate in the Affiliate Network at the <a href="http://www.bwinpartypartners.com/">bwin.party partners Website</a> (collectively, the 'Affiliate Network'), why We collect this information and how We use the collected information.</p>
<p>Please note that this Privacy Notice will be agreed between you and GVC Services Limited and the GVC Group, being GVC Holdings PLC together with its Group companies as defined in the <a href="/legal.do">Standard Affiliate Agreement</a> ('bwin.party partners', 'We', 'Us' or 'Our', as appropriate).</p>
<p>We may periodically make changes to this Privacy Notice and will notify you of these changes by posting the modified terms on the <a href="http://www.bwinpartypartners.com/">bwin.party partners Website</a>. We recommend that you revisit this Privacy Notice regularly.</p>
<p><strong>2. INFORMATION WE COLLECT</strong></p>
<p>We consider information that may be used to identify an individual, including, but not limited to, first and last name, date of birth, bank account details, home or other physical address, email address, phone number or other contact information to be Personal Information ('Personal Information').</p>
<p><strong>Personal Information you provide to Us</strong></p>
<p>You may be asked to provide Personal Information when you use the <a href="http://www.bwinpartypartners.com/">bwin.party partners Website</a>, open an affiliate account or to use the Affiliate Network. The Personal Information that We collect may include information such as: contact information (including telephone number), shipping information, billing information, transaction history, website usage preferences, and feedback regarding the Affiliate Network. From time-to-time, We may request information from you via surveys or contests. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary, and, therefore, you have the choice of whether or not to disclose such information. Information requested may include contact information (such as name, correspondence address and telephone number), and demographic information (such as zip or postal code or age).</p>
<p><strong>Personal Information we collect about you</strong></p>
<p>In addition, when you interact with the Affiliate Network, Our servers keep an activity log unique to you that collects certain administrative and traffic information including: source IP address, time of access, date of access, web page(s) visited, language use, software crash reports and type of browser used. This information is essential for the provision and quality of the Affiliate Network.</p>
<p>We reserve the right to conduct a security review at any time to validate your identity, age, the registration data provided by you and to verify your use of the Affiliate Network and your financial transactions for potential breach of Our Standard Affiliate Agreement and of applicable law. Accordingly, We (along with Our staff, agents and suppliers) shall be able to use your Personal Information and disclose your Personal Information to third parties for the purposes of validating the information you provide to Us in the course of using the Affiliate Networks, including, where necessary, the transfer of information outside of your country. Security reviews may include but are not limited to ordering a credit report and/or otherwise verifying the information you provide against third-party databases. We may also receive Personal Information from customer lists lawfully acquired from third-party vendors.</p>
<p><strong>3. HOW WE USE YOUR INFORMATION</strong></p>
<p>We process your Personal Information so that We can perform Our everyday functions.</p>
<p>In particular, We use your information:</p>
<ul>
<li>Where We have obtained your consent (and before any withdrawal of your consent - see below "Your Rights").  For example, you may have given your consent to marketing,</li>
<li>Where it is necessary for the performance of a contract with you.  This includes the following:
	<ul>
	<li>to provide customer support; and</li>
	<li>to process any of your online transactions.</li>
	</ul>
</li>
<li>Where it is in line with Our legitimate business interests. This includes the following:
	<ul>
	<li>to undertake necessary security and identify verification checks;</li>
	<li>to meet certain business requirements;</li>
	<li>to provide you with promotional offers and information regarding bwin.party products and services;</li>
	<li>in order for the bwin.party partners to better provide a range of products and services and improved customer service; and</li>
	<li>for any other purpose related to the operation of the Affiliate Network.</li>
	</ul>
</li>
</ul>	
<p>Where We have relied on Our legitimate interests to process your Personal Information, you may contact Us to obtain more information, including in relation to Our assessment of the impact on you.</p>
<p><strong>4. HOW LONG WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION</strong></p>
<p>We only keep your information for as long as is reasonably necessary for the purposes set out in this Privacy Notice and to fulfil Our legal obligations.</p>
<p>In summary, however, We keep:</p>

	<li>your information and correspondence for 6 years post-termination of your account;</li>
	<li>otherwise, we only keep  Personal Information for as long as is necessary.</li>
	</ul>
<p>We will securely erase as or anonymise your information in advance of these deadlines if We decide that We no longer need it.</p>
