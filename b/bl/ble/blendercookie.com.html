<h2 class="intercom-align-left">Use of Internet Cookies:</h2>
<p class="intercom-align-left">Our website uses “cookies” and other tracking technologies. Cookies enable us to serve secure pages to our users and members without asking them to sign in repeatedly. Most browsers allow you to control cookies, such as acceptance, denial, and/or removal thereof.</p>
<p class="intercom-align-left">If a user’s or member’s system is idle for a defined time, the cookie will expire, forcing the user to sign in again to continue their session. This prevents unauthorized access to the user’s information while they are away from their computer. You may set most browsers to notify you if you receive a cookie, or you may choose to block cookies with your browser, but please note that if you choose to erase or block your cookies, you will need to re-enter your original user ID and password to gain access to certain parts of this site.</p>

We take appropriate security measures to protect your information against unauthorized access to or unauthorized alteration, disclosure or destruction of information. To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the correct use of information, we maintain appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information and data stored on our system.</p>
<p class="intercom-align-left">While no computer system is completely secure, we believe the measures we have implemented reduce the likelihood of security problems to a level appropriate to the type of data and information involved. By using this website, you acknowledge and agree that no data and/or information transmitted over the Internet is completely secure, and you acknowledge and agree that you are using this website at your own risk.</p>
