                    <h1>Blend Series Privacy Policy</h1>

<div class="caption">
    <p>
    This Privacy Policy applies only to information we collect about you at
    <a href="http://blendseries.com">Blend Series</a>
    (the "Website") 
    and how we use this information.<br id="yg2x0">
    </p>
    <h2>Collection of your Blend Series Information</h2>
    <p>
    Your "Blend Series information" includes certain technical information gathered
    or received when you use Blend Series. Some of the technical information that may
    be collected or received includes: the type of browser you are using
    (e.g., Netscape, Internet Explorer), the type of operating system you are
    using (e.g., Windows or Mac OS), your manner of connecting to
    the Internet (e.g., connection speed through narrowband or broadband
    access); Internet protocol address; information about the version of
    service from an affiliate that you used prior to registering with the
    service; other information about your geographic location; and the domain
    name of your Internet service provider.
    </p>
    <p>
    While registering to use most of the Blend Series services is not required, there
    are a limited number of optional services (for example, comment on a tv-show) that require an "account". Registration functionality for Blend Series is
    provided by the Blend Series. If you choose to "Register an Account", you
    will need to register with and provide information to Blend Series. You will then
    obtain a Screen Name or other credential issued by Blend Series (collectively,
    "Screen Name") in order to access and use these optional services, and
    your Screen Name and associated services account will be subject to the
    Blend Series Terms of Service Agreement and Privacy Practices indicated in your
    registration process.
    </p>
    <h2>How Your Blend Series information is Used</h2>
    <p>
    Your Blend Series information is used:
    </p><ul>
    <li> to operate and improve the websites, services and offerings available through Blend Series; </li>
    <li> to personalize the content provided to you; </li>
    <li> to fulfill your requests for products, programs, and services; </li>
    <li> to communicate with you and respond to your inquiries; </li>
    <li> to conduct research about your use of Blend Series; and </li>
    <li> to help offer you other products, programs, or services that may be of interest. </li>
    </ul>
    Your Blend Series information will not be shared with third parties unless it is
    necessary to fulfill a request, in other circumstances in which you have
    consented to the sharing of your Blend Series information, or except as described
    in this Privacy Policy. We may use your Blend Series information to present
    offers to you on behalf of business partners and advertisers. These
    business partners and advertisers may receive aggregate data about groups
    of Blend Series users, but do not receive information that personally identifies
    you.
    <p></p>
    <p>
    If you use our communications tools to disclose information about yourself
    publicly (for example, by making your screen name and/or video lists
    publicly available), other online users may obtain access to any
    information you provide. The contents of your online communications, as
    well as other information about you as a Blend Series user, may be accessed and
    disclosed in response to legal process (for example, a court order, search
    warrant or subpoena); in other circumstances in which we believe Blend Series is
    being used in the commission of a crime; when we have a good faith belief
    that there is an emergency that poses a threat to the safety of you or
    another person; or when necessary either to protect our rights or property
    or the rights or property of our affiliated providers, or for us to render
    the service you have requested. We may use agents and contractors in order
    to help operate the service. If such agents and contractors have access to
    your Blend Series information, they are required to protect this information in a
    manner that is consistent with this Privacy Policy by, for example, not
    using the information for any purpose other than to carry out the services
    they are performing for Blend Series.
    </p>
    <p>
    In the event that ownership of us or the Blend Series service was to change as a
    result of a merger, acquisition or transfer to another company, your Blend Series
    information may be transferred. If such a transfer results in a material
    change in the use of your Blend Series information, we will provide notice about
    the choices you have to decline to permit such a transfer.
    </p>
    <h2>Cookies, Web Beacons and Similar Technologies</h2>
    <p>
    Cookies are text files that are placed in your computer's browser, and
    that can be used to help recognize you as a Blend Series user. Web beacons are
    small pieces of code placed on Web pages that can be used, among other
    things, to count the users who visit that Web page, or to deliver a cookie
    to the browser of a user viewing that page. You can control cookies
    through your browser's settings. If you reject all cookies, however, you
    will not be able to take advantage of certain Blend Series offerings.
    </p>
    <p>
    We may use cookies, web beacons or similar technologies in combination
    with your Blend Series information to enhance and personalize your experience on
    Blend Series, including to operate and improve offerings through Blend Series; to help
    authenticate you when you use Blend Series; to remember your preferences; to
    present and help measure and research the effectiveness of Blend Series offerings
    and advertisements; and, to customize the content and advertisements
    provided to you through Blend Series.
    </p>
    <p>
    Blend Series and its advertisers may use advertising network providers to help
    present advertisements on Blend Series. These advertising networks may use
    cookies, web beacons, or similar technologies on your computer in order to
    provide targeted advertisements about goods and services that may be of
    interest to you while visiting other Web sites. The use of cookies, web
    beacons, or similar technologies by ad network providers is subject to
    their own privacy policies. Any choices that you have about these
    technologies will be presented here in the event we utilize the services
    of any advertising network provider. Therefore, you are encouraged to
    return to this section periodically for updated information about
    advertising networks.
    </p>
    <h2>Security</h2>
    <p>
    We have established safeguards to help prevent unauthorized access to or
    misuse of your Blend Series information, but cannot guarantee that this
    information will never be disclosed in a manner inconsistent with this
    Privacy Policy (for example, as a result of unauthorized acts by third
    parties that violate applicable law or the policies of the service and its
    affiliated providers).
    </p>
    <h2>How to Contact Us</h2>

    implementation, you may contact us by going to the following link:

    <h2>Changes to this Privacy Policy and Additional Information</h2>

    <p>
    We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time, and so you should
    review this Policy periodically. If there are significant changes to
    Blend Series's information practices, you will be provided with appropriate
    online notice. You may be provided other privacy-related information in
    connection with your use of offerings from Blend Series, as well as for special
    features and services not described in this Policy that may be introduced
    in the future.
