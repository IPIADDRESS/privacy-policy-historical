    <h1>OMG Shows Privacy Policy</h1>

<div class="caption">
    <p>
    This Privacy Policy applies only to information we collect about you at
    <a href="http://omgshows.com">OMG Shows</a>
    (the "Website") 
    and how we use this information.<br id="yg2x0">
    </p>
    <h2>Collection of your OMG Shows Information</h2>
    <p>
    Your "OMG Shows information" includes certain technical information gathered
    or received when you use OMG Shows. Some of the technical information that may
    be collected or received includes: the type of browser you are using
    (e.g., Netscape, Internet Explorer), the type of operating system you are
    using (e.g., Windows or Mac OS), your manner of connecting to
    the Internet (e.g., connection speed through narrowband or broadband
    access); Internet protocol address; information about the version of
    service from an affiliate that you used prior to registering with the
    service; other information about your geographic location; and the domain
    name of your Internet service provider.
    </p>
    <p>
    While registering to use most of the OMG Shows services is not required, there
    are a limited number of optional services (for example, comment on a tv-show) that require an "account". Registration functionality for OMG Shows is
    provided by the OMG Shows. If you choose to "Register an Account", you
    will need to register with and provide information to OMG Shows. You will then
    obtain a Screen Name or other credential issued by OMG Shows (collectively,
    "Screen Name") in order to access and use these optional services, and
    your Screen Name and associated services account will be subject to the
    OMG Shows Terms of Service Agreement and Privacy Practices indicated in your
    registration process.
    </p>
    <h2>How Your OMG Shows information is Used</h2>
    <p>
    Your OMG Shows information is used:
    </p><ul>
    <li> to operate and improve the websites, services and offerings available through OMG Shows; </li>
    <li> to personalize the content provided to you; </li>
    <li> to fulfill your requests for products, programs, and services; </li>
    <li> to communicate with you and respond to your inquiries; </li>
    <li> to conduct research about your use of OMG Shows; and </li>
    <li> to help offer you other products, programs, or services that may be of interest. </li>
    </ul>
    Your OMG Shows information will not be shared with third parties unless it is
    necessary to fulfill a request, in other circumstances in which you have
    consented to the sharing of your OMG Shows information, or except as described
    in this Privacy Policy. We may use your OMG Shows information to present
    offers to you on behalf of business partners and advertisers. These
    business partners and advertisers may receive aggregate data about groups
    of OMG Shows users, but do not receive information that personally identifies
    you.
    <p></p>
    <p>
    If you use our communications tools to disclose information about yourself
    publicly (for example, by making your screen name and/or video lists
    publicly available), other online users may obtain access to any
    information you provide. The contents of your online communications, as
    well as other information about you as a OMG Shows user, may be accessed and
    disclosed in response to legal process (for example, a court order, search
    warrant or subpoena); in other circumstances in which we believe OMG Shows is
    being used in the commission of a crime; when we have a good faith belief
    that there is an emergency that poses a threat to the safety of you or
    another person; or when necessary either to protect our rights or property
    or the rights or property of our affiliated providers, or for us to render
    the service you have requested. We may use agents and contractors in order
    to help operate the service. If such agents and contractors have access to
    your OMG Shows information, they are required to protect this information in a
    manner that is consistent with this Privacy Policy by, for example, not
    using the information for any purpose other than to carry out the services
    they are performing for OMG Shows.
    </p>
    <p>
    In the event that ownership of us or the OMG Shows service was to change as a
    result of a merger, acquisition or transfer to another company, your OMG Shows
    information may be transferred. If such a transfer results in a material
    change in the use of your OMG Shows information, we will provide notice about
    the choices you have to decline to permit such a transfer.
    </p>
    <h2>Cookies, Web Beacons and Similar Technologies</h2>
    <p>
    Cookies are text files that are placed in your computer's browser, and
    that can be used to help recognize you as a OMG Shows user. Web beacons are
    small pieces of code placed on Web pages that can be used, among other
    things, to count the users who visit that Web page, or to deliver a cookie
    to the browser of a user viewing that page. You can control cookies
    through your browser's settings. If you reject all cookies, however, you
    will not be able to take advantage of certain OMG Shows offerings.
    </p>
    <p>
    We may use cookies, web beacons or similar technologies in combination
    with your OMG Shows information to enhance and personalize your experience on
    OMG Shows, including to operate and improve offerings through OMG Shows; to help
    authenticate you when you use OMG Shows; to remember your preferences; to
    present and help measure and research the effectiveness of OMG Shows offerings
    and advertisements; and, to customize the content and advertisements
    provided to you through OMG Shows.
    </p>
    <p>
    OMG Shows and its advertisers may use advertising network providers to help
    present advertisements on OMG Shows. These advertising networks may use
    cookies, web beacons, or similar technologies on your computer in order to
    provide targeted advertisements about goods and services that may be of
    interest to you while visiting other Web sites. The use of cookies, web
    beacons, or similar technologies by ad network providers is subject to
    their own privacy policies. Any choices that you have about these
    technologies will be presented here in the event we utilize the services
    of any advertising network provider. Therefore, you are encouraged to
    return to this section periodically for updated information about
    advertising networks.
    </p>
    <h2>Security</h2>
    <p>
    We have established safeguards to help prevent unauthorized access to or
    misuse of your OMG Shows information, but cannot guarantee that this
    information will never be disclosed in a manner inconsistent with this
    Privacy Policy (for example, as a result of unauthorized acts by third
    parties that violate applicable law or the policies of the service and its
    affiliated providers).
    </p>

    implementation, you may contact us by going to the following link:

    <h2>Changes to this Privacy Policy and Additional Information</h2>

    <p>
    We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time, and so you should
    review this Policy periodically. If there are significant changes to
    OMG Shows's information practices, you will be provided with appropriate
    online notice. You may be provided other privacy-related information in
    connection with your use of offerings from OMG Shows, as well as for special
    features and services not described in this Policy that may be introduced
    in the future.
