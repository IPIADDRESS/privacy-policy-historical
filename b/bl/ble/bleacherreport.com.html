We collect the following types of information from our users:<br><br>1. Information You Provide to Us:<br><br>We receive and store any information you enter on our website or provide to us in any other way. You can choose not to provide us with certain information, but then you may not be able to take advantage of many of our special features. The personal information we collect includes:<br><br>* Registration: In order for you to use certain Bleacher Report services, such as submitting new articles to the Site, you must complete a registration form including your full name and email address.&nbsp; </p><p>* Member Profile: You have the option (but are not required) to enter your full name and the URL of your blog into your member profile for public display on the Site.</p><p>* User Content:&nbsp; You may post your own stories on the Service as well edit and comment on the stories of others (collectively your "User Content").&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p><p>2. Automatic Information:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>* We receive and store certain types of non-personally identifiable information whenever you interact with us. Bleacher Report automatically receives and records certain "traffic data" on our server logs from your browser including your IP address, Bleacher Report cookie information, and the page you requested. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>* Bleacher Report may display a counter on any page indicating the total number of times that page has been viewed. This includes member profile pages.</p><p>* Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer's hard drive through your Web browser to enable our systems to recognize your browser and tell us how and when pages in our website are visited and by how many people. Bleacher Report cookies do not collect personal information, and we do not combine information collected through cookies with other personal information to tell us who you are or what your screen name or email address is.<br><br>The "help" portion of the toolbar on the majority of browsers will direct you on how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies , how to command the browser to tell you when you receive a new cookie, or how to fully disable cookies. You may choose to disable or&nbsp; reject cookies when using the Service, but you may not be able to access some of Bleacher Report's most attractive features.<br><br>Some of our business partners may use cookies on our website (for example, advertisers). Bleacher Report has no access to or control over these cookies.</p><p>* If you choose to provide posts from your blog via Bleacher Report, we may ask you to paste confirmation code into the external template of your blog that communicates with us to authenticate the blog as an authorized feed and places a badge on your blog identifying you as a Bleacher Report Affiliate.<br><br><br><strong>How Does Bleacher Report Use My Information?</strong><br><br>* Social sharing of User Content: Bleacher Report allows other users to browse stories that you have written, edited, or commented on. This information is made available via your member profile, on the Bleacher Report Play-by-Play, or within the article or history page of the story in which you performed the action on. Bleacher Report may choose to post this data on other site features in the future.<br><br>* Profile information: Bleacher Report allows other users to browse your full name, and blog URL within your member profile should you provide this optional information.&nbsp;</p><p> * Syndication: Bleacher Report allows for the RSS syndication of all of its public content within the website.<br><br>* API: Bleacher Report may allow third parties access to all Bleacher Report data that is already publicly available through Bleacher Report.com through an application program interface that allows other programs to interact with the Site.

We may also transfer such information in the course of corporate divestitures, mergers, or dissolution.&nbsp; In any such transfer of information, your user information would remain subject to the promises made in our Privacy Policy.<br><br>* Protection of Bleacher Report and Others:&nbsp; We may release personal information when we believe in good faith that release is necessary to comply with the law; to enforce or apply our Terms of Use and other agreements; or to protect the rights, property, or safety of Bleacher Report, our employees, our users, or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction.<br><br>* With Your Consent: Except as set forth above, you will be notified when your personal information may be shared with third parties or used for a purpose incompatible with the purpose(s) for which it was originally collected, and you will be able to prevent the sharing of this information by opting out.<br><br><br><strong>Is Information About Me Secure?</strong><br><br>* Your Bleacher Report account information is protected by a password for your privacy and security.

However, please note that this is not a guarantee that such information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards.&nbsp; This information includes your User Content. You understand and acknowledge that, even after removal, copies of User Content may remain viewable in cached and archived pages or if other users have copied or stored your User Content.<br><br><strong><br>What Information Can I Access?<br></strong><br>You can access your personal information on our website and correct, amend, or delete information that is inaccurate by visiting your user profile setting page.</p><p><br><strong>What Choices Do I Have?</strong><br><br>* You can always opt not to disclose information, but then you may be unable to use certain features on our website.&nbsp; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>* You can choose to disable or reject cookies from the Service, but you may not then be able to access many features of Bleacher Report. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p><p>* You can add or update certain information on pages of the Site. When you update information, however, we often maintain a copy of the unrevised information in our records.<br><br>* You may request deletion of your Bleacher Report account by emailing us at <a href="mailto:support@bleacherreport.com">support@bleacherreport.com</a>.<br><br><br><strong>Can Children Use Bleacher Report's Services?</strong><br><br>You must be at least 13 years or older to register to use the Bleacher Report website.
