</li>
</ul>  
<p>We require all third parties to respect the security of your personal data and to treat it in accordance with the law.

<p><span id="international-transfers"></span></p>
<h2>6.	International transfers</h2>
<p>Some of our external third parties are based outside the European Economic Area (EEA) so their processing of your personal data will involve a transfer of data outside the EEA.
Whenever we transfer your personal data out of the EEA, we ensure a similar degree of protection is afforded to it by ensuring at least one of the following safeguards is implemented:</p>
<ul>
<li>We will only transfer your personal data to countries that have been deemed to provide an adequate level of protection for personal data by the European Commission. For further details, see European Commission: Adequacy of the protection of personal data in non-EU countries.</li>
<li>Where we use certain service providers, we may use specific contracts approved by the European Commission which give personal data the same protection it has in Europe. For further details, see European Commission: Model contracts for the transfer of personal data to third countries.</li>
<li>Where we use providers based in the US, we may transfer data to them if they are part of the Privacy Shield which requires them to provide similar protection to personal data shared between the Europe and the US. For further details, see European Commission: EU-US Privacy Shield.</li>
</ul>
<p>Please <a href="#" onclick="zE.activate({hideOnClose: true}); return false;">contact us</a> if you want further information on the specific mechanism used by us when transferring your personal data out of the EEA.</p>
<p><span id="data-security"></span></p>
<h2>7.	Data security</h2>
<p>We have put in place appropriate security measures to prevent your personal data from being accidentally lost, used or accessed in an unauthorised way, altered or disclosed. In addition, we limit access to your personal data to those employees, agents, contractors and other third parties who have a business need to know. They will only process your personal data on our instructions and they are subject to a duty of confidentiality.</p>
<p>We have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected personal data breach and will notify you and any applicable regulator of a breach where we are legally required to do so.</p>
<p><span id="data-retention"></span></p>
<h2>8.	Data retention</h2>
<h3>How long will you use my personal data for?</h3>
<p>We will only retain your personal data for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements.</p>
<p>To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of your personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements.</p>
<p>By law we have to keep basic information about our customers (including Contact, Identity, Financial and Transaction Data) for six years after they cease being customers for tax purposes.</p>
<p>In some circumstances you can ask us to delete your data: see <a href="#request-erasure">Request erasure</a> below for further information.</p>
<p>In some circumstances we may anonymise your personal data (so that it can no longer be associated with you) for research or statistical purposes in which case we may use this information indefinitely without further notice to you.</p>
<p><span id="your-legal-rights"></span></p>
<h2>9.	Your Legal Rights</h2>
<p>You have the right to make a complaint at any time to the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO), the UK supervisory authority for data protection issues (www.ico.org.uk). We would, however, appreciate the chance to deal with your concerns about data protection before you approach the ICO so please contact us in the first instance.</p>
<p>You also have the right in certain circumstances to:</p>
<table>
  <tbody><tr>
    <td>Request access to your personal data (commonly known as a "data subject access request").</td>
    <td>This enables you to receive a copy of the personal data we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it.</td> 
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Request correction of the personal data that we hold about you.</td>
    <td>This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide to us.</td> 
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Request erasure of your personal data. <span id="request-erasure"></span>
</td>
    <td>This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal data where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal data where you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below), where we may have processed your information unlawfully or where we are required to erase your personal data to comply with local law. Note, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request. </td> 
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Object to processing of your personal data where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms.</td>
    <td>You also have the right to object where we are processing your personal data for direct marketing purposes. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which override your rights and freedoms.</td> 
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Request restriction of processing of your personal data.</td>
    <td>This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal data in the following scenarios: (a) if you want us to establish the data's accuracy; (b) where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it; (c) where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims; or (d) you have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it. </td> 
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Request the transfer of your personal data to you or to a third party.</td>
    <td>We will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Note that this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you. </td> 
  </tr>
</tbody></table>
<h3>No fee usually required</h3>
<p>You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to exercise any of the other rights).</p>
<h3>What we may need from you</h3>
<p>We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your personal data (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response.</p>
<h3>Time limit to respond</h3>
<p>We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month. Occasionally it may take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this case, we will notify you and keep you updated.</p>
<p><span id="glossary"></span></p>

<p><strong>Legitimate Interest</strong> means the interest of our business in conducting and managing our business to enable us to give you the best product and the best and most secure experience. We make sure we consider and balance any potential impact on you (both positive and negative) and your rights before we process your personal data for our legitimate interests. We do not use your personal data for activities where our interests are overridden by the impact on you (unless we have your consent or are otherwise required or permitted to by law). You can obtain further information about how we assess our legitimate interests against any potential impact on you in respect of specific activities by contacting us</p>
<p><strong>Performance of Contract</strong> means processing your data where it is necessary where you buy or seek to buy something from us.</p>
