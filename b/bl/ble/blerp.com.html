RocketOn, Inc. ("RocketOn") recognizes that its customers, visitors, users, and
others who use Blerp.com, Hyperlayers.com or other web sites owned or operated by RocketOn
(the "RocketOn Sites") (collectively or individually "Users") value their
privacy. The RocketOn Sites include, but are not limited to, the domain names
Blerp.com, Hyperlayers.com and RocketOn.com. This Privacy Policy details important
information regarding the use and disclosure of User information collected on
the RocketOn Sites. RocketOn provides this Privacy Policy to help you make an
informed decision about whether to use or continue using the RocketOn Sites.
<br>
<br>

This Privacy Policy is incorporated in and is subject to the RocketOn's
<a href="/account/terms_of_use">Terms
of Use</a>. Your use of the RocketOn Sites and any personal information you
provide on the RocketOn Sites remains subject to the terms of this
Privacy Policy and our <a href="/account/terms_of_use">Terms
of Use</a>.<br>
<br>

Please note that any images, photos, videos, messages, text, or any
other content posted at the discretion of Users onto the RocketOn Sites
becomes published content and is not considered personally identifiable
information subject to this Privacy Policy.<br>
<br>

<b>The Information RocketOn Collects:</b><br>
<br>

</font>
<ul>

	<font size="2">
	<li>User Provided Information:<br>
	<br>

	You provide certain personally identifiable information (such as your
	name and email address) to RocketOn when choosing to participate in
	various activities on the RocketOn Sites. Examples of such activities
	include, but are not limited to: posting or uploading images, photos,
	videos, ideas and messages, entering contests or sweepstakes, taking
	advantage of promotions, responding to surveys, or subscribing to
	newsletters or other mailing lists.<br>
	<br>

	</li>
	<li>Cookies Information:<br>
	<br>

	When you visit the RocketOn Sites, we may send one or more cookies - a
	small text file containing a string of alphanumeric characters - to
	your computer that uniquely identifies your browser. RocketOn uses both
	session cookies and persistent cookies. A persistent cookie remains
	after you close your browser. Persistent cookies may be used by your
	browser on subsequent visits to the site. Persistent cookies can be
	removed by following your web browser help file directions. A session
	cookie is temporary and disappears after you close your browser. You
	can reset your web browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a
	cookie is being sent. However, some features of the RocketOn Sites may
	not function properly if the ability to accept cookies is disabled.<br>
	<br>

	</li>
	<li>Browser Plug-In:<br>
	<br>

	When you use our Browser Plug-In, we may employ web tracking and data gathering
  techniques which are used to track the online usage patterns of our Users
  anonymously (i.e. in a non-personally-identifiable manner). This information
  may be available to our web and advertising partners. You can turn off the web
  tracking and data gathering; however, some features of our Browser Plug-In, may
  not function if this is disabled.<br>
	<br>

	</li>
	<li>Log File Information:<br>
	<br>

	When you use the RocketOn Sites, our servers automatically record
	certain information that your web browser sends whenever you visit any
	website. These server logs may include information such as your web
	request, Internet Protocol ("IP") address, browser type, browser
	language, referring / exit pages and URLs, platform type, number of
	clicks, domain names, landing pages, pages viewed and the order of
	those pages, the amount of time spent on particular pages, the date and
	time of your request, and one or more cookies that may uniquely
	identify your browser.<br>
	<br>

	</li>
	<li>Clear GIFs Information:<br>
	<br>

	When you use the RocketOn Sites, we may employ "clear GIFs" (a.k.a. Web
	Beacons) which are used to track the online usage patterns of our Users
	anonymously (i.e. in a non-personally-identifiable manner). In
	addition, we may also use clear GIFs in HTML-based emails sent to our
	users to track which emails are opened by recipients.<br>
	<br>

	</li>
	</font>
</ul>

<font size="2"><b>The Way RocketOn Uses Information:</b><br>
<br>

Submitting your personally identifiable information to us through the
RocketOn Sites enable us to operate, maintain, and provide to you the
features and functionality of the RocketOn Sites.<br>
<br>

Any personal information, images, photos, videos, text or other content
that you voluntarily disclose online (on discussion boards, in messages
and chat areas, within your public profile page, etc.) becomes publicly
available and can be collected and used by others. Your account name
(not your email address) is displayed to other Users when you upload,
post or contribute images, photos, videos, messages, text, or send
messages through the RocketOn Sites, and other Users can contact you
through messages and comments. Additionally, any images, photos, videos,
messages, text, or other content that you submit to the RocketOn Sites
may be redistributed through the internet and other media channels, and
may be viewed by the general public.<br>
<br>

We do not use your email address or other personally identifiable
information to send commercial or marketing messages without your
consent, except as part of a specific program or feature for which you
will have the ability to opt-in or opt-out. We may, however, use your
email address without consent for non-marketing or administrative
purposes (such as notification of major RocketOn Site changes or for
customer service purposes).<br>
<br>

We use both your personally identifiable information and certain
non-personally-identifiable information (such as anonymous User usage
data, cookies, IP addresses, browser type, clickstream data, etc.) to
improve the quality and design of the RocketOn Sites and to create new
features, promotions, functionality, and services by storing, tracking,
and analyzing User preferences and trends.<br>
<br>

We use cookies, clear gifs, and log file information to (a) remember
information so that you will not have to re-enter it during your
subsequent visits; (b) provide custom, personalized content and
information; (c) monitor the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns;
(d) monitor aggregate metrics such as total number of visitors, pages
viewed, etc.; and (e) track your entries, submissions, and status in
promotions, sweepstakes, and contests.<br>
<br>

<b>When RocketOn Discloses Information:</b><br>
<br>

We provide personally identifiable information and
non-personally-identifiable information to our subsidiaries, affiliated
companies, other businesses or persons for the purpose of processing
such information on our behalf. We require that these parties agree to
process such information in compliance with our privacy policy. We also
use reasonable efforts to (a) limit their use of such information, and
(b) use other appropriate confidentiality and security measures.<br>
<br>

We do not share your personally identifiable information (such as name
or email address) with other, third-party companies for their commercial
or marketing use without your consent, except as part of a specific
program or feature for which you will have the ability to opt-in or
opt-out.<br>
<br>

We do share non-personally-identifiable information (such as anonymous
User usage data, referring / exit pages and URLs, platform types, number
of clicks, etc.) with interested third-parties to assist them in
understanding the usage patterns for certain content, services,
advertisements, promotions, and/or functionality on the RocketOn Sites.<br>
<br>

We may release personally identifiable information and/or
non-personally-identifiable information if required to do so by law, or
in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with
state and federal laws (such as U.S. Copyright Law), or respond to a
court order, subpoena, or search warrant.<br>
<br>

RocketOn also reserves the right to disclose personally identifiable
information and/or non-personally-identifiable information that RocketOn
believes, in good faith, is appropriate or necessary to enforce our <a href="/account/terms_of_use">Terms
of Use</a>, take precautions against liability, to investigate and defend
itself against any third-party claims or allegations, to assist
government enforcement agencies, to protect the security or integrity of
our website, and to protect the rights, property, or personal safety of
RocketOn, our Users or others.<br>
<br>

<b>Your Choices About Privacy:</b><br>
<br>

You may decline to submit personally identifiable information through
the RocketOn Sites, in which case RocketOn may not be able to provide
certain services to you. You may update or correct your personal profile
information and email preferences at any time by visiting your account
profile, if you have one.Please note that any images, photos, videos,
text or other content uploaded by Users to the RocketOn Sites cannot be
removed by Users and remain subject to our <a href="/account/terms_of_use">Terms
of Use</a>.<br>
<br>

To protect your privacy and security, we take reasonable steps (such as
requesting a unique password) to verify your identity before granting
you profile access or making corrections. You are responsible for
maintaining the secrecy of your unique password and account information
at all times.<br>
<br>

Please contact RocketOn with any questions or comments about this
Privacy Policy, your personal information, your consent, or your opt-in
or opt-out choices using our <a href="#contact">Contact Page</a>.<br>
<br>

<b>Third-party Advertisers, Links to Other Sites:</b><br>
<br>

RocketOn may allow other companies, called third-party ad servers or ad
networks, to serve advertisements within the RocketOn Sites. These
third-party ad servers or ad networks use technology to send the
advertisements and links that appear on the RocketOn Sites directly to
your browser. They may also use other technologies (such as cookies,
JavaScript, or Web Beacons) to measure the effectiveness of their
advertisements and to personalize the advertising content you see.<br>
<br>

RocketOn does not provide any personally identifiable information to
these third-party ad servers or ad networks without your consent, except
as part of a specific program or feature for which you will have the
ability to opt-in or opt-out. However, please note that if an advertiser
asks RocketOn to show an advertisement to a certain audience (for
example, men ages 18-34) or audience segment (for example, men ages
18-24 who have viewed certain types of content) and you respond to that
advertisement, the advertiser or ad-server may conclude that you fit the
description of the audience they are trying to reach. The advertiser may
also use information regarding your use of the RocketOn Sites, such as
the number of times you viewed an ad, to determine which ads to deliver
to you.<br>
<br>

You should consult the respective privacy policies of third-party ad
servers or ad networks for more information on their practices and for
instructions on how to opt-out of certain practices. RocketOn's privacy
policy does not apply to, and we cannot control the activities of, such
other advertisers or web sites.<br>
<br>

Currently, RocketOn relationships include, but are not limited to, the
following third-party ad servers or ad networks:<br>
<br>

Google: <a href="http://www.google.com">www.google.com</a><br>
<br>

<b>Third-party Services:</b><br>
<br>

RocketOn may allow other companies, called third-party services, to
fulfill certain functions within the RocketOn Sites. These functions
include without limitation: processing orders, processing credit card
transactions, fulfilling orders, delivering content. These third-party
services may ask for your private information.<br>
<br>

You should consult the respective privacy policies of these third-party
services for more information on their practices and for instructions on
how to opt-out of certain practices. RocketOn's privacy policy does not
apply to, and we cannot control the activities of, such third parties or
web sites.<br>
<br>

<br>

<b>Our Commitment To Data Security:</b><br>
<br>

RocketOn uses commercially reasonable physical, managerial, and
technical safeguards to preserve the integrity and security of your
personal information. We cannot, however, ensure or warrant the security
of any information you transmit to RocketOn, and you do so at your own
risk. Once we receive your transmission of information, RocketOn makes
commercially reasonable efforts to ensure the security of our systems.
However, please note that this is not a guarantee that such information
may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any
of our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards.<br>
<br>

If RocketOn learns of a security systems breach, then we may attempt to
notify you electronically so that you can take appropriate protective
steps. RocketOn may post a notice on the RocketOn Sites if a security
breach occurs. Depending on where you live, you may have a legal right
to receive notice of a security breach in writing. To receive a free
written notice of a security breach (or to withdraw your consent from
receiving electronic notice) you should notify us using our <a href="#contact">Contact Page</a>.<br>
<br>

<b>Our Commitment To Childrens' Privacy:</b><br>
<br>

Protecting the privacy of young children is especially important. For
that reason, RocketOn does not knowingly collect or maintain personally
identifiable information or non-personally-identifiable information on
the RocketOn Sites from persons under 13 years of age, and no part of
our website is directed to persons under 13. If you are under 13 years
of age, then please do not use or access the RocketOn Sites at any time
or in any manner. If RocketOn learns that personally identifiable
information of persons under 13 years of age has been collected on the
RocketOn Sites without verified parental consent, then RocketOn will
take the appropriate steps to delete this information.<br>
<br>

<b>Special Note to International Users:</b><br>

and directed to Users in the United States. If you are a User accessing
the RocketOn Sites from the European Union, Asia, or any other region
with laws or regulations governing personal data collection, use, and
disclosure, that differ from United States laws, please be advised that
through your continued use of the RocketOn Sites, which are governed by
U.S. law, this Privacy Policy, and our <a href="/account/terms_of_use">Terms
of Use</a>, you are transferring your personal information to the United
States and you consent to that transfer.<br>
<br>

<b>In the Event of Merger, Sale, or Bankruptcy:</b><br>
<br>

In the event that RocketOn is acquired by or merged with a third party
entity, we reserve the right to transfer or assign the information we
have collected from our Users as part of such merger, acquisition, sale,
or other change of control. In the unlikely event of our bankruptcy,
insolvency, reorganization, receivership, or assignment for the benefit
of creditors, or the application of laws or equitable principles
affecting creditors' rights generally, we may not be able to control how
your personal information is treated, transferred, or used.<br>
<br>

<b>Changes &amp; Updates to this Privacy Policy:</b><br>
<br>

This Privacy Policy may be revised periodically which will be reflected
by the "effective date" below. Please revisit this page to stay aware of
any changes. In general, we only use your personal information in the
manner described in the Privacy Policy in effect when we received the
personal information you provided. Your continued use of the RocketOn
Sites constitutes your agreement to this Privacy Policy and any future
revisions.<br>
<br>

For revisions to this Privacy Policy that may be materially less
restrictive on our use or disclosure of the personal information you
have already provided to us, we will attempt to obtain your consent
before implementing such revisions with respect to such information.<br>
