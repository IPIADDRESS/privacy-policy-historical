<b>Updated March 15, 2004</b>

<p>
<font color="#0000FF"><b>Overview</b></font>
</p>

<p>
Bleeping Computer is strongly committed to protecting the privacy of consumers of its services and of visitors to its 
site. We want to contribute to providing a safe and secure environment for our members and, in particular, ensure that 
children's information is protected.
</p>

<p>
BleepingComputer is dedicated to protecting your persional information and due to the rapidly evolving nature of the 
technologies BleepingComputer uses, we will sometimes update our privacy policy to accomodate this.  Any comments or 
questions regarding our privacy practices should be submitted using this <a href="/contactus.php">feedback form</a>. 
</p>

<p>
<font color="#0000FF"><b>Overview of the information we collect.</b></font>
</p>

<p>
BleepingComputer.com will collect personally identifying information during the following: (i) user surveys; (ii) events, 
sweepstakes, contests or promotion registrations; (iii) member registration; and (iv) registrations for certain interactive 
parts of our site where visitors can provide content and suggestions or participate in interactive discussions.
</p>

<p>
Each time a visitor connects to our Web Page, our Web Server will automatically log that visitor's domain name and ip address.  This is standard policy with all sites and is used to track which pages visitors access and how long they spend there.  This information will only be used internally to Bleeping Computer to allow us to find what content is relevant to our members. We will collect information that visitors provide to us through surveys and other submissions but will never share this information unless given permission by the member. BleepingComputer.com may retain information indefinitely.
</p>

<p>
BleepingComputer.com may at time allow user profiles to be visible to the public.  These profiles may contain personally 
indentifying information volunteered by its visitors.  All information that is publicly visible can be changed by the user by editing their profile.  Under no circumstances will unauthorized member information be able to be seen by the public.
</p>

<p>
From time to time Bleeping Computer may offer surveys, sweekpstakes, and promotions to visitors.  Any information that is collected 
by these surveys, sweepstakes, or promotions may be passed on to third party organizations.  Under no circumstances will we pass on
this information without notifying you that this will be done at the beginning of the survey, sweepstake, or promotion.  If you choose not to participate in these promotions then your information will never be released to any third-party organizations.
</p>


<p>
<font color="#0000FF"><b>What does BleepingComputer.com do with the information it collects?</b></font>
</p>

<p>
BleepingComputer.com uses the information in a myriad of ways.  BleepingComputer may use the information to award prizes, for editorial and feedback purposes, and to track Rules of Use issues.
</p>

<p>
In addition, BleepingComputer has the right to disclose personally identifying information if BleepingComputer believes that such action is reasonably necessary to enforce its User Agreement, to comply with the law, to comply with the legal process, or to protect the property and rights of the site itself and its users.
</p>

<p>
Our third party partners, which advertise on our site or provide promotions, may collect information about you. BleepingComputer does not control the collection or use of this information and you should contact our partners directly if you have any issues on how they use this information.
</p>

<p>
At times with the permission of a visitor who is 13 years of age or over, information submitted at the time of registration or submission, which can include but not be limited to, age, genders, phone number, address and income level, may be used for marketting and promotion purposes by BleepingComputer.  This information will never be provided to third-party companies or organizations without the direct consent from the visitor.  If a visitor objects to such use of their information, they will have the option to now allowing the sharing of this information on submission or they may contact using this <a href="/contactus.php">feedback form</a>.
</p>

<p>
If a postal address is supplied to us during registration or future promotion or sweepstake, you may receive periodic mailings from us with information on new products, services, and upcoming events.  If you do not wish to receive these mailings, you will have the ability to specifiy this at submission or you can mail us using this <a href="/contactus.php">feedback form</a> with your contact information.
</p>

<p>
As was stated above, from time to time Bleeping Computer will present to its visitors surveys, sweepstakes, and promotions.  At the beginning of such survey, sweepstake, and promotion a user will be notified as to whether the information they submit can be passed on to third-party organizations. By completing the submission you acknowledge that Bleeping Computer has notified you and that you expressly agreed to the passing of your submitted information to a third-party.  If you choose not to participate in these surveys, sweepstakes, or promotions your information will never be given out.
</p>

<p>
<font color="#0000FF"><b>How does BleepingComputer protect and secure my information?</b></font>
</p>

<p>
BleepingComputer will make all means necessary to protect your sensitive information from unauthorized access.  If you ever give credit card information on BleepingComputer.com, we will take commercially reasonable steps to establish a secure connection with your web browser.
</p>

<p>
<font color="#0000FF"><b>How can I update my personal information?</b></font>
</p>

<p>
You can update almost all information about your account by logging in and clicking on My Control Panel.  From the control panel you can Edit your profile.  If there is information that you can not change with this method, please send an email to us using this <a href="/contactus.php">feedback form</a> with all relavant information.
</p>

<p>
<font color="#0000FF"><b>Policies for individuals under 13 (COPPA)</b></font>
</p>

<p>
BleepingComputer firmly believes that everyone can gain something from using our site, but we are a big believe in requiring the permission from parents for their children (anyone 13 years old or younger) to have access to our discussion boards.
</p>

<p>
We will not knowingly use information collected from visitors under 13 years of age for any marketing or promotional purposes whatsoever, either inside or outside BleepingComputer. Visitors' e-mail addresses are not posted on BleepingComputer, unless provided by a visitor as part of a user profile. In order for a user who is under 13 years old to become a member at BleepingComputer.com we require the parent to fill out a COPPA form giving us permission to allow the user to be validated as a member.
</p>

<p>
<font color="#0000FF"><b>IP addresses and How we Use them</b></font>

</p><p>
BleepingComputer collects IP addresses for the purpose of statistical reporting and to report statistical information to our advertisers.  An IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you are surfing the web. The web servers that our site is running, will automatically log that information for our future use.
</p>


<font color="#0000FF"><b>How we use Cookies.</b></font> 

<p>
Cookies are small text files that a web site sets on your computer in your hard drive in order to recognize you in the future.  Cookies make using our site easier, as they allow you to save your password, and automatically log into BleepingComputer.com.  The use of cookies is an industry standard and you will find them at almost all major web sites.
</p>

<p>
By using cookies we can also see how our guests use the site.  From the cookies we can see which areas are most frequented and therefore most popular.  From this information we can then gear our content towards what you want to find at BleepingComputer.com.
</p>

<p>
BleepingComputer.com uses cookies to save your password for future visits as well as for identifying what the more popular sections of the site are.  At times we will use another company to handle our online commerce.  When this is the case that company may use cookies to keep track of your shopping cart while you are shopping.
</p>

<p>
We do not use cookies to retrieve information from your computer that was not originally sent in a cookie nor use cookies to track your movments on the Internet or any other information.  We will not use any information transferred through cookies for any promotional or marketing purposes other than what has been discussed before.
