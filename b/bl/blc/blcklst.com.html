            <h2>PRIVACY POLICY</h2>
            <h4>The Blcklst.com Privacy Policy</h4>
            <p class="small_paragraph">
            When you visit sites on the Internet, the owner of the site is able to collect information about you, such as your 
            name and address, your interests, etc. The BLCKLST.COM is committed to respecting your privacy and recognizes your 
            need to protect the personal information that you share with us. The following is our privacy policy. In it we inform 
            you what information we might collect from you when you visit our Internet site, how we might use such information, 
            the choices you have regarding our use of, and your ability to review and correct, such information, the process by 
            which we notify you of any material changes to our privacy policy, and the effective date of our privacy policy. 
            </p>
            <h4>Types of Information We Collect</h4>
            <p class="small_paragraph">
            We have the ability to collect two types of information from people who visit our site: Personally Identifiable 
            Information and Aggregate Information.</p>
            <p class="small_paragraph">
            Personally Identifiable Information is any information by which you can be identified, such as your name, address, 
            telephone number, email address, credit card information, personal interests, etc.
            </p>
            <p class="small_paragraph">
            Aggregate Information is anonymous data such as your IP address (i.e., a number that is assigned to your computer whenever 
            you connect to the Internet), your domain name (e.g., "XYZ.com") and user statistics (e.g., 45% of our users live in California). 
            Aggregate data is very much like television ratings that show the television network how many viewers are watching a particular 
            television program.
            </p>
            <h4>What We Do With the Information</h4>
            <p class="small_paragraph">
            We collect Aggregate Information to diagnose technical problems on our site, to help us administer the site, to help us 
            improve the quality of the pages that make up our site, to permit us to provide data regarding the volume of use on, and 
            frequency of visitors to, the site, to gather broad demographic information and to improve our site to assure that it is 
            as appealing as we can make it for as many people as possible. In no event, however, is this information matched to your 
            Personally Identifiable Information.
            </p>
            <p class="small_paragraph">
            BLCKLST.COM also collects Personally Identifiable Information. This can be done when you choose certain products, services 
            or programs offered on our site. For example, when you subscribe to our service, when you submit required information on the 
            page entitled "(submission page)", you are supplying us with your Personally Identifiable Information. We use such information 
            to try to offer you our products, services and programs, to improve the quality of the content that we provide on the site, 
            to personalize your online experience, and to build a strong community.
We may disclose your Personally Identifiable Information to (i) BLCKLST.COM’s current and future entertainment and sponsorship, advertisement and development partners and strategic alliances, and (ii) BLCKLST.COM’s contractors, vendors, consultants and professional advisors to the extent necessary for them to perform services on our behalf, and only under disclosure restrictions.  Additionally, we may transfer your Personally Identifiable Information as part of the assets of BLCKLST.COM if BLCKLST.COM is, or parts of its business are, sold to, merged with or acquired by, a third party. BLCKLST.COM may also disclose your Personally Identifiable Information when required by law or court order.
            </p>
            <p class="small_paragraph">
            Whether or not you provide such information is completely your own choice. You are not obligated to answer any question that 
            is presented to you. Of course, if you choose not to provide the information, you might be unable to access certain services, 
            offers and content on our site if you do not tell us your e-mail address, etc.
            </p>
            <h4>Deleting Information About You</h4>
            <p class="small_paragraph">
            If you have provided Personally Identifiable Information but later you object to the use that we are making of that information 
            (for example, you no longer wish to receive email from BLCKLST.COM) you can ask us to stop making use of that information by 
            emailing to support@blcklst.com and requesting your name to be removed for our list.
            </p>
            <h4>Protecting Children</h4>
            <p class="small_paragraph">
            We take special care to protect the safety and privacy of children. Our site is general audience site. Nevertheless, we do not 
            permit children under age 18 to register on our site for any product, service or program. We do not collect or solicit personal 
            information about users under age 18. We urge parents and guardians to participate in your children's online activities and use 
            parental control or other Internet filtering technology to supervise your children's access to the Internet.
            </p>
            <h4>Cookies</h4>
            <p class="small_paragraph">
            Our site uses "cookies." A cookie is a small amount of data that is sent to your browser from an Internet server and stored in 
            your computer. Generally, we use cookies to remind us of who you are, tailor our products, services and programs to suit your 
            personal interests, estimate our audience size, track your status in our promotions, and/or analyzing your visiting patterns. 
            You can set your browser to notify you when you are sent a cookie, giving you the chance to decide whether or not to accept it.
            </p>
            <h4>Security</h4>
            <p class="small_paragraph">
            In an effort to ensure security and protection of your Personally Identifiable Information, we encrypt all submissions using 
            Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software, the industry standard method for securing online transactions. All Personally Identifiable 
            Information including credit card number, name and address is encrypted in an effort to prevent such information from being 
            used as transmitted over the Internet.
            </p>
            <p class="small_paragraph">
            Protecting the security of your personal information that you share with us is of the utmost importance to us. Unfortunately, 
            however, no data transmission over the Internet or data storage can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive 
            to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee or warrant the security of any information you transmit to or from our site, 
            and you do so at your own risk. 
            </p>
            <h4>Links to Third Party Sites or Products</h4>
            <p class="small_paragraph">
            Our site contains links to sites operated and maintained by third parties as well as links to products and services provided by third 
            parties. BLCKLST.COM has no control whatsoever over such third parties, their Internet sites or their products or services. Privacy 
            policies for such linked sites may be different from our privacy policy. You access such linked sites or products or services at your 
            own risk. You should always read the privacy policy for a linked site or product or service before disclosing any personal information 
            on such site or in exchange for such product or service.
            </p>
            <h4>Policy Changes</h4>
            <p class="small_paragraph">
            If we decide to change our privacy policy in whole or in part, we will inform you by posting a notice on our Internet site. 
            </p>
            <h4>Effective Date of Privacy Policy</h4>
            <p class="small_paragraph">
