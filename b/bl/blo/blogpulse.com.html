                    <p><span class="headline">Privacy Philosophy </span> </p>
                    <p>The Internet is rapidly changing the way all of us communicate
                      and interact with each other. While the Internet allows each
                      of us access to a greater array of information and services
                      than has ever been available, these new online activities
                      do raise new challenges, such as the privacy issues addressed
                      in this policy. Intelliseek is committed to working with
                      public policy organizations, industry groups, and government
                      institutions to understand and address these challenges as
                      they arise. But most importantly, having a relationship with
                      our customers that is founded on trust, is not only good
                      manners, it is also good business. Any <a href="Javascript:MakeMail('infoemail')">feedback</a> you'd
                      like to provide to help us better meet your expectations
                      in this arena is welcomed. </p>
                    <p> <b>Our Commitments to You </b></p>
                    <p> Intelliseek wants to make your online experience satisfying
                      and safe. Our data collection policies allow you to choose
                      how much information to provide to us, and to control how
                      we use that information. Our goal is to provide you with
                      a personalized, robust and productive online experience while
                      allowing you to control your privacy. </p>
                    <p>Intelliseek collects information online primarily to make
                      it easier and more rewarding for you to use our services.
                      Depending on the service you are accessing, you could be
                      asked at various times to provide information such as your
                      name, e-mail address, or information about what you like
                      and do not like. On other occasions such as when we provide
                      items for purchase online, we may request your credit card
                      number to conclude the transaction, or your mailing address
                      to ensure proper delivery. We request this information to
                      provide our strongest value to you — a personalized online
                      experience. Customers who personalize our service come back
                      more often — and it's the customers that visit us often who
                      make us successful — so we do everything we can to make Intelliseek
                      your service and to give you just the content you want. Information
                      collected online is often defined as being either anonymous
                      or personally identifiable: </p>
                    <ol>
                      <li>
                        <p><b>Anonymous Information</b> refers to information that
                          cannot be tied back to a specific individual. For instance,
                          we may know that 10,000 people visit this Privacy Policy
                          today, but we do not necessarily know their names, where
                          they live, or their date of birth. What we collect from
                          transactions, such as this, constitutes anonymous information,
                          much like how your hometown's bus service knows how many
                          people take a given route — but doesn't necessarily know
                          specifically who those people are. Many of the individuals
                          who access our services choose not to register with Intelliseek,
                          and therefore those individuals are anonymous to us and
                          the data we collect is similarly anonymous information. </p>
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        <p><b>Personally Identifiable Information</b> refers to
                          information that tells us specifically who you are, such
                          as your name, phone number, or postal address. In many
                          cases we ask for this information to provide you with
                          enhanced services. Examples of the use of such information
                          would include shipping products purchased from Intelliseek
                          . We hope that, like many of our customers, you will
                          find it beneficial to judiciously provide Personally
                          Identifiable Information to Intelliseek so that we may
                          provide more valuable free content, information and products
                          to you, on a timely basis. The amount of Personally Identifiable
                          Information that you choose to disclose to Intelliseek
                          is completely up to you. The only way we know something
                          about you personally is if you register with Intelliseek
                          or enter one of our Intelliseek sweepstakes. In other
                          words, we will know Personally Identifiable Information
                          about you only if you choose to provide this type of
                          information to us. </p>
                      </li>

                    <p class="headline"><a name="1"></a><strong>What Personally Identifiable
                      Information of yours is collected?</strong></p>
                    <p>In our effort to provide personalization and opportunities
                      for prizes and services, we may at times ask you to submit
                      information such as your Name or e-mail address, or to share
                      your interests and hobbies with us. You never have to answer
                      these questions, and you can decline this exchange of information
                      on any site on the Internet — not just ours — at any time. </p>
                    <p>However, if should you choose to withhold requested information,
                      we may not be able to provide you with some of the services
                      dependent upon the collection of this information, such as
                      updated Intelligent Agents, the latest product releases,
                      a sweepstakes entry, or the purchase and shipment of products
                      and prizes.. If you are an Intelliseek BullsEye Pro customer,
                      you are electing to use a paid product that requires you
                      to supply certain information to establish the shipping information.
                      For instance, your name, address, phone number, and potentially
                      your credit card number must be provided to purchase the
                      product. </p>
                    <p>When you surf the Internet, your Internet browser (such
                      as Netscape Navigator® or Microsoft Internet Explorer)
                      automatically transmits some information to Intelliseek every
                      time you access content on one of our sites. Examples of
                      such information include the Universal Resource Locator (URL)
                      of the Web page you were just on (known as the "Referer"),
                      the IP (or Internet Protocol) address of the computer you
                      are using, or the browser version you are using to access
                      our site. All of this information is collected by Intelliseek
                      servers and is used to help improve our offerings to you.
                      For instance, from this information we determined that a
                      very few of our customers use older browser versions. Because
                      of this we recently decided to enhance the quality of content
                      available to all of our customers by using the advanced features
                      of HTML that cannot be accessed from those older browser
                      versions. All of the information that is automatically submitted
                      to us by your browser is considered Anonymous Information. </p>
                    <p>To enable many of the features available within Intelliseek,
                      we will assign "cookies" to your Internet browser
                      (such as Netscape Navigator or Microsoft Internet Explorer).
                      A cookie is a small text file that contains a unique identification
                      number stored on your computer. Cookies by themselves cannot
                      be used to find out the identity of any user. This unique
                      identification number automatically identifies your browser
                    — but not you — to our computers whenever you interact on
                      one of our Internet domains using that browser. When you
                      visit our site, a cookie in effect says to our server computers "Hello,
                      I'm browser #655. What do you do just for me?" Every
                      Web page that you access that includes advertising or content
                      served from Intelliseek will have the contents of your cookie
                      reported in our server logs. But only when you agree to provide
                      Personally Identifiable Information directly to an Intelliseek
                      branded service, such as through registration, will we be
                      able to know anything about you other than the random number
                      that our server computers originally assign to your browser. </p>
                    <p>There is a lot of confusion about cookies, how they are
                      used, and what they can do. Cookies only contain information
                      that the server computer "knew" in the first place,
                      and can only be read by the serving domain that placed them.
                      For instance, Yahoo! utilizes cookies, but Intelliseek's
                      servers can't read their contents nor can Yahoo!'s servers
                      read ours. Cookies are an essential part of how the Internet
                      works today, and allow server computers to recognize your

                      you having to "sign in," such as your own stock

                      the information?</strong></p>
                    <p>The data you provide in any Intelliseek domain or with any
                      Intelliseek product, is collected by the Intelliseek Corporation
                      with its headquarters at 1128 Main Street, Fourth Floor,
                      Cincinnati, OH 45202—7236. </p>
                    <p class="headline"><a name="3"></a><strong>How is the information
                      used?</strong></p>
                    <p>The majority of the services that are provided for free
                      through Intelliseek are supported by banner advertising revenues
                      or through other sponsorships. Our ability to provide enhanced
                      services and content to our customers is dependent on our
                      ability to provide venues for our advertisers, advertising
                      and promotion partners or business partners (referred to
                      collectively as "Partner" or "Partners")
                      that reach specific demographic segments of our customer
                      base. Generally, Partners have little interest in reaching
                      a specific customer of our services — and as a matter of
                      policy we provide no mechanism for Partner to reach you or
                      any other specific customer unless you request that contact.
                      Instead, our Partners have the need to reach general collection
                      of customers who share common demographic characteristics
                      such as a specific gender or age range. </p>
                    <p>For instance, certain products are more often purchased
                      by women then by men and therefore when advertising those
                      products, in this example, the Partner would prefer to target
                      their messages just to women. The better job Intelliseek
                      does in providing a mechanism for Partners to reach specific
                      sub—segments of our users, the more revenue we can generate
                      from advertising and that ultimately is what allows you,
                      the consumer, to get to the wealth of new technologies and
                      free content from Intelliseek's various services. Importantly,
                      at no time, is your Personally Identifiable Information used
                      to determine what advertising you receive nor do we use it
                      to determine what type of advertising any other customer
                      of Intelliseek will receive.</p>
                    <p>Below is a description of the uses of the information that
                      we collect and how our visitors and advertisers Partners
                      benefit from these actions: </p>
                    <ol class="pagetext">
                      <li>
                        <p>We pay attention to what our customers do and do not
                          use on our service, and modify our content and technology
                          appropriately.</p>
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        <p>We match the patterns of usage that our consumers exhibit
                          during use of our products or Web sites where we serve
                          advertising to create "imputed profiles" about
                          our anonymous customers. The creation of an imputed profile
                          allows Intelliseek to statistically model the demographic
                          characteristics of an otherwise anonymous customer, without
                          ever knowing that anonymous customer's name or any other
                          Personally Identifiable Information about them. These
                          imputed profiles are used to target advertising — primarily
                          banners — to those anonymous customers, both on Intelliseek
                          domains. Through the use of imputed profiles, Intelliseek
                          can surface advertising to our customers that is more
                          likely to be for products they would want, and sell that
                          advertising in the marketplace for a higher price. This
                          is essential to our ability to provide access to state
                          of the art technologies and high quality content to our
                          customers for free. Intelliseek never matches "Who
                          you are" with "Where you've been" on the
                          Internet because we do not use personal data characteristics
                          such as your name, address or phone number to create
                          these imputed profiles but rather use primary demographic
                          characteristics such as your age or gender. Finally,
                          imputed profiles present no privacy risk to our customers
                          because they are worthless to third parties; since any
                          potential third party would be unable to read the cookies
                          that we set on our domains, only Intelliseek can create
                          value from these imputed profiles. </p>

                      <li>
                        <p>We provide advertisements that support our customers'
                          specific requests for information through Keyword searches
                          and editorial content. Do a search on "cars," for
                          instance, and you might see a banner advertisement from
                          an automobile company. </p>

                      <li>
                        <p>We develop summary reports for our Partners. An example
                          of a summary report might be "12,000 people clicked
                          on Advertisement 'X' today, and of those people, 35%
                          had previously indicated they had an interest in sports." Our
                          Partners, who make it possible for you to use Intelliseek
                          for free, need this information to determine how effective
                          their advertising investments are. We never tell our
                          Partners who in particular (with name, address or any
                          such identifiable information) it was that saw or clicked
                          on their advertisements, unless you have specifically
                          told us it is acceptable to do so. </p>

                      <li>
                        <p>If you enter a sweepstakes or a contest, we'll use the
                          information you supplied to contact you. We'll probably
                          also congratulate you!</p>

                      <li>
                        <p> We will send registrants of Intelliseek outbound e-mail
                          communications on information we think they will find
                          useful, including information about new products and
                          services from selected Partners. It is our policy to
                          never send messages to Members who have asked us not
                          to do so, either at initial registration or later through
                          an unsubscribe process. In every e-mail from any company
                          or Web site of Intelliseek, we intend to remind you of
                          your option to change your preferences regarding receipt
                          of future e-mail communications</p>

                      <li>
                        <p> Finally, if we believe that Intelliseek property or
                          an individual's safety or security is at risk, we will
                          disclose this information to proper court or law enforcement

                    <p>Please note, if we are going to use your Personally Identifiable
                      Information in a manner different from that stated at the
                      time of collection we will notify you via email. You will
                      have a choice as to whether or not to allow us to use your
                      information in this different manner. In addition, if we
                      make any material changes in our privacy practices that do
                      not affect user information already stored in our database,
                      we will post a notice on our Web site notifying users of
                      the change. In some cases where we post the notice we will
                      also email users, who have opted to receive communications
                      from us, notifying them of the changes in our privacy practices.</p>

                      it will only be used within Intelliseek Internet domains
                      unless you choose to allow third party data sharing (by opting
                      in for such distribution during the registration process).
                      Should you choose to provide your information to third parties,
                      Intelliseek will share aspects of your information with our
                      valued Partners. Some of these transactions will include
                      financial payment to Intelliseek for the information provided
                      but are only undertaken with companies whose privacy practices
                      are consistent with the principles established within this
                      policy and with whom Intelliseek believes that a product
                      that truly benefits our customers can be promoted. Our Partners
                      help contribute towards many of the free services available
                      from Intelliseek </p>
                    <p>Although unlikely, Intelliseek may be required by law enforcement
                      or judicial authorities to provide personally Identifiable
                      Information to the appropriate governmental authorities.
                      If requested by law enforcement or judicial authorities,

                    <p>Other companies that place advertising on our site, products
                      or services may collect information about you when you view

                      of cookies (using the same techniques as described above).
                      Due to the way the Internet technically operates, we cannot
                      control this collection of information — but we can control
                      which companies are allowed to place such advertising on

                      if you have any questions about their use of the information
                      they potentially collect. It should be noted that anyone
                      placing advertising on our Web sites or products could only
                      collect Anonymous Information about you unless you actively

                    <p>Finally, Intelliseek does not control the information collection
                      and distribution policies on Internet domains other than

                      communications we make to you. It is our intention to give
                      you as much control over our relationship as possible. </p>
                    <p>First, as mentioned earlier, the consumer always has the
                      final word on whether Intelliseek—or any Internet company—knows
                      who you are. It is your choice to share Personally Identifiable
                      Information with Intelliseek and we encourage
                      you to consider only sharing information with any site on
                      the Internet if you receive true value in exchange for that
                      information transfer and if you respect the privacy practices
                      of the firm. </p>
                    <p>If you do choose to share Personally Identifiable Information
                      with Intelliseek, you can control whether we contact you
                      or share the information with third parties, either through
                      declarations you make at the time you share information with
                      us, or through updates to your information by <a href="Javascript:MakeMail('support')">contacting
                      us</a>. Intelliseek will always give you a chance to unsubscribe
                      to any e-mail communication from us—clear directions for
                      doing so will appear in any e-mail message we send to you. </p>
                    <p>Co-Branding partnerships provide an ASP solution to our
                      clients by customizing Intelliseek products to reflect the
                      client's brand identity. At times, Intelliseek may enter
                      into Co-Branding arrangements with other companies, and if
                      so, an opt-in question may be present for contact from these
                      firms as well. </p>
                    <p>Their opt-out features are specific to each organization,
                      but you should never receive e-mail from these organizations
                      unless you have indicated that it is acceptable. All e-mail
                      from Intelliseek, or from Intelliseek co—brand partners who
                      gain your permission to send you commercial e-mail, will
                      include an opportunity to opt out of future communications. </p>
                    <p>Intelliseek does reserve the right to send one-time registration
                      confirmation e-mail, and Agent Update messages to its customers
                      to inform them of specific changes that may impact their
                      ability to use a service they have previously signed up for,
                      regardless of e-mail contact opt-in status. An example of
                      an Agent Update message would be notification of the availability
                      of new or modified agents. And finally, we also reserve the
                      right to contact you if compelled to do so as part of a legal
                      proceeding or if there has been a violation of our Terms
                      of Service. Intelliseek is retaining these rights because
                      in limited cases we feel that we may need the right to contact
                      you as a matter of law or regarding matters, which will be
                      important to you. These rights do not allow us to contact

                    <p>Intelliseek believes strongly in providing you with the
                      ability to edit the personal information that you have provided
                      to us. To update the information retained about you, or to

                      in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection
                      we will notify you via email. You will have a choice as to
                      whether or not we use your information in this different
                      manner. In addition, if we make any material changes in our
                      privacy practices that do not affect user information already
                      stored in our database, we will post a prominent notice on
                      our Web site notifying users of the change. In some cases
                      where we post the notice we will also email users, who have
                      opted to receive communications from us, notifying them of
                      the changes in our privacy practices.</p>

                      procedures are in place to protect against the loss, misuse,

                    <p>Security procedures are in place to protect against the
                      loss, misuse, or alteration of information under the company's
                      control. Intelliseek operates secure data networks protected
                      by industry standard firewalls and password protection systems.
                      Our security and privacy policies are periodically reviewed
                      and enhanced as necessary, and only authorized individuals
                      have access to the information provided by our customers.
                      Even your registration account password is encrypted before
                      it is sent to our computers—no one in the company could
                      tell you what your password is even if you asked! Any other
                      particularly sensitive information, such as a customer's
                      credit card number collected for a commerce transaction,
                      is also encrypted prior to transmission. </p>
                    <p>You, the consumer, are ultimately responsible for the security
                      of your registration id. </p>
