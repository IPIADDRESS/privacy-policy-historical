<h1>privacy policy</h1>
<h1>blo.gs privacy policy</h1>

<p>Please Note:  As of June 13, 2005, the blo.gs site will be joining the Yahoo!
network of products and services.  Data collected on the Blo.gs site will be
subject to the Blo.gs privacy policy posted here.  To learn more about how
Yahoo! uses other information not collected on the Blo.gs site please see read
the Yahoo! Privacy Policy <a href="http://privacy.yahoo.com/">http://privacy.yahoo.com/</a>.

</p><p>like most web sites, we collect a standard access log that includes
pages accessed along with the ip addresses that accessed them. this is
used to track usage of the website.</p>

<p>we also collect information from <i>registered users</i> that
includes an email address, a list of weblogs to watch, and
(optionally) name. the name provided is used in the <a href="favs.php">xml versions of the list of weblogs to watch</a>,
which are only available if you have selected to make your favorites
lists public. the javascript version of this list is also available
only when you have selected to make that list public.</p>

<p>the email address collected is only used in sending the opt-in
daily list of changed weblogs, handling forgotten password requests,
and in sending notification of a change of ownership of the site so
that registered users can opt out of having their data transferred to
the new owner.</p>

<p>we also have a contact form that requires an email address, which
we may use to respond to queries, but is not otherwise used. this form
also collects the ip address of the sender, which may be used in
tracking abuse of the contact form.</p>

<p>we only use cookies for authentication purposes. upon login, a
cookie is set that is used to authenticate later requests, as well as
cache some of the account details so they can be accessed on those
later requests.</p>

<p>we may share any data collected (that you have not elected to make
public as explained above), including your email address, in the face
of legal proceedings (such as subpoenas, court orders, or legal
process, or to establish or exercise our legal rights or defend
against legal claims), or if we believe it is necessary to share
information in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding
illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential
threats to the physical safety of any person, , or as otherwise
required by law.</p>

<p>if this service is acquired by another individual or company, there
may be a one-time transfer of all information collected. registered
users will have the opportunity to opt out of this transfer.</p>

<p>this privacy policy may change in the future. we will announce any
such changes on our <a href="news.php">news page</a>.</p>
