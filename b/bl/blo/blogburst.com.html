	<h1>BlogBurst Privacy Policy</h1>
<p>Pluck is committed to protecting your privacy and respects the privacy of individuals who use Pluck's software and services. This Privacy Statement covers how Pluck treats personal information that is either collected or received. This includes, but is not limited to email addresses, phone numbers, names, addresses, age, gender, and interests.
Because protecting your privacy is important to Pluck, we adhere to the Safe Harbor Agreement concerning the transfer of personal data from the European Union ("EU") to the United States of America. Accordingly, we follow the Safe Harbor Principles published by the U.S. Department of Commerce ("Principles") with respect to all data that we receive, whether directly from the end user or from one of our Customers. If there is any conflict between the policies in this statement and the Principles, the Principles will govern. This statement outlines our general policy and practices for implementing the Principles, including the types of information we receive, how we use it, and the choices affected individuals have regarding our use of, and their ability to correct, that information.
This privacy statement applies to all personal information we receive (except as noted below). For purposes of this privacy statement, "personal information" means information that:</p>
<ul>	<li>is transferred from the EU to the United States; </li>
	<li>is recorded in any form; </li>
	<li>is about, or pertains to, a specific individual; and </li>
	<li>can be linked to that individual. </li>
</ul>

<p>It does not include information that pertains to a specific individual, but from which that individual could not reasonably be identified.</p>
<h2>Notice and Choice</h2>

<p>Pluck currently collects personal information, including email addresses, when a user of BlogBurst registers to use the optional content matching and distribution services. Pluck also monitors usage information from web servers owned by Pluck, including page views, product usage and download counts, obtained during the normal course of use of Pluck's software and services. Users can have their account terminated at anytime by contacting Pluck at: blogburst-editors@pluck.com.</p>

<h2>Disclosures and Transfers</h2>

<p>Unless required by law, Pluck will not share your personal information with third parties with the following exceptions:</p>

<p>Pluck will not disclose an individual's personal information to third parties, except when one or more of the following conditions is true:</p>
<ul><li>We have the individual's permission to make the disclosure, whether such permission is made directly to Pluck or to our Customer; 
	</li><li>The disclosure is required by law or professional standards; </li>
	<li>The disclosure is reasonably related to the sale or disposition of all or part of our business; </li>
	<li>The information in question is publicly available; </li>
	<li>The disclosure is reasonably necessary for the establishment or defense of legal claims; or </li>
	<li>The disclosure is to another Pluck entity or to persons or entities providing services on our or the individual's behalf (each a "transferee"), consistent with the purpose for which the information was obtained, if the transferee, with respect to the information in question: </li>
	<ul><li>is subject to law providing an adequate level of privacy protection; 
	</li><li>has agreed in writing to provide an adequate level of privacy protection; or 
	</li><li>subscribes to the Principles.</li>
		</ul>
		</ul>
<p>Permitted transfers of information, either to third parties or within Pluck, include the transfer of data from one jurisdiction to another, including transfers to and from the United States of America. Because privacy laws vary from one jurisdiction to another, personal information may be transferred to a jurisdiction where the laws provide less or different protection than the jurisdiction in which the information originated.  Notwithstanding, Pluck may share aggregate data with 3rd parties per our agreement with the Pluck Customer.  This information will not identify the related end-user.</p>
<h2>Data Security</h2>
<p>Pluck takes your security seriously and takes reasonable steps to protect your information. To prevent unauthorized access or disclosure, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the appropriate use and confidentiality of information, either for its own purposes or on behalf of our clients, Pluck has put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we process. However, we cannot guarantee the security of information on or transmitted via the Internet.</p>

<h2>Data Integrity</h2>

<p>We process personal information only in ways compatible with the purpose for which it was collected or subsequently authorized by the individual. To the extent necessary for such purposes, we take reasonable steps to make sure that personal information is accurate, complete, current, and otherwise reliable with regard to its intended use.</p>

<h2>Access and Correction</h2>

<p>BlogBurst users can maintain their account information via the BlogBurst website (http://www.blogburst.com). In the event that a user cannot access their BlogBurst account via the website they may contact us at blogburst-editors@pluck.com. The individual will need to provide sufficient identifying information, and we may request additional identifying information as a security precaution. In addition, we may limit or deny access to personal information where providing such access would be unreasonably burdensome or expensive in the circumstances, or as otherwise permitted by the Safe Harbor Agreement. In some circumstances, we may charge a reasonable fee, where warranted, for access to personal information.</p>

<h2>Enforcement and Dispute Resolution</h2>

<p>Pluck utilizes the self-assessment approach to assure its compliance with our privacy statement. Pluck periodically verifies that the policy is accurate, comprehensive for the information intended to be covered, prominently displayed, completely implemented, and in conformity with the Principles. We encourage interested persons to raise any concerns with us using the contact information below. We will investigate and attempt to resolve complaints and disputes regarding use and disclosure of personal information in accordance with the principles contained in this policy.</p>
<p>If you would like to speak to someone at Pluck about your information, or if you have a concern about information we have collected or stored, please contact privacy@pluck.com. We will do our best to respond to you in a timely and professional manner to answer your questions and resolve your concerns.</p>
<p>In the unfortunate and unlikely event that we cannot resolve your concerns, we have contracted with BBBOnline as a dispute resolution provider. You can contact the BBBOnline at <a href="http://www.bbbonline.org/consumer/complaint.asp">http://www.bbbonline.org/consumer/complaint.asp</a> and follow their guidelines for initiating their dispute resolution procedures.</p>

<h2>Privacy Statement Changes</h2>

<p>This privacy statement may be changed from time to time, consistent with the requirements of the Safe Harbor. We will post any revised policy on this Web site, or a similar Web site that replaces this Web site.</p>
