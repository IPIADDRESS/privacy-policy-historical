If you prefer, you can choose to have your computer warn you each time a cookie is being sent, or you can choose to turn off all cookies via your browser settings.

This information may include but is not limited to: Internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, Internet service provider (ISP), referring entry/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp and/or clickstream data, and other data that could directly or indirectly identify you. DropCatch uses this information to help personalize your experience and search results, diagnose problems with its systems, to administer the services on this site, and for other corporate uses.</p> <p class="useNoSpacing"></p><div class="newPara"></div><p></p> <p class="useNoSpacing"><b>How DropCatch Uses this Information</b></p> <p class="useNoSpacing"></p><div class="newPara"></div><p></p> <p class="useNoSpacing">DropCatch must first and foremost abide by local law. As a US company, DropCatch will first abide by US laws and regulations when two laws might differ and/or conflict with one another.</p> <p class="useNoSpacing"></p><div class="newPara"></div><p></p> <p class="useNoSpacing">DropCatch securely holds on to personal data internally. Such data can be held indefinitely in order to keep accurate records that may be required under local law and regulation. </p> <p class="useNoSpacing"></p><div class="newPara"></div><p></p> <p class="useNoSpacing">DropCatch uses customer information to communicate directly with their customers. It is important for customers to keep their email address up to date and check their email regularly for updates regarding a DropCatch account. </p> <p class="useNoSpacing"></p><div class="newPara"></div><p></p> <p class="useNoSpacing">DropCatch may have the need to provide customer information to third parties for certain services required by DropCatch, including but not limited to, credit card processors, technical support services, shipping of goods or services, customer relationship management, SMS delivery, Collections Agencies, <span> <span>UDRP dispute providers, Whois Data Escrow providers, ICANN,</span> registry compliance, law enforcement, among other third parties for other similar such reasons. <span></span> DropCatch will only share information that is necessary for the third party to provide the required services. This information will not be sold nor voluntarily disseminated unless reasonably needed at DropCatch's sole discretion. <span> </span><span>Upon purchasing a domain from DropCatch your personal information may be provided to the current registrar of record, which may or may not be DropCatch.com, allowing you to gain control and access to your domain name. Please note domain name registration contact information is made public through "whois" services, and by providing information to DropCatch.com means the contact information may be made public as required by the domain name registrar which maintains the domain registration.</span><span></span></span></p> <p class="useNoSpacing"></p><div class="newPara"></div><p></p> <p class="useNoSpacing">When a DropCatch account is cancelled/suspended/terminated, either voluntarily or involuntarily, this does not mean that the customer's personally identifiable information has been deleted entirely from DropCatch's systems and databases. Some or all this information may be retained by DropCatch, including but not limited, to comply with legal obligations, resolve disputes, prevent fraud and/or enforce company agreements. <span>One such example would be if you bought a domain on DropCatch.com, and manage that domain at NameBright.com, in this circumstance DropCatch will not be able to terminate your DropCatch account without affecting the registration of your NameBright account. Customers may alter, update or deactivate their DropCatch account information any time, in order to do so you must disable all such backorders and active auctions in your account and submit a support ticket to the customer support team. However, in varying situations, certain information will be required and persisted without exception. In addition, you will not be able to submit a form on this website without providing the exact information required to complete that specific action. It is forbidden and against of ICANN's rules to provide false Registrant information about any domain name registration(s). Providing false or fake information may and will result in suspension of the customer's DropCatch account and forfeiture of any related domain name(s) registered with DropCatch or any of its affiliate companies or domain name registrars.</span></p> <p class="useNoSpacing"></p><div class="newPara"></div><p></p> <p class="useNoSpacing">DropCatch will cooperate with government, law enforcement officials and relevant private parties to enforce and comply with Unites States law and with applicable and mandatory regulations regarding the services it provides. If necessary, DropCatch will disclose any customer information to the relevant officials or private parties when appropriate or deemed reasonably necessary. Further, if DropCatch believes, in its sole discretion, (including without limitation to subpoenas), that the preservation of certain customer information is necessary to protect its rights or the property and/or the rights of a third party. DropCatch may further maintain or share customer information in order to protect the safety of the public or any person, to prevent or stop activity DropCatch considers to be illegal based on applicable laws, or to otherwise uphold the law. <span>Due to the nature of DropCatch's domain backordering service, it may be required in certain circumstances to release customer data to comply with US law and to ensure that all systems are not being used for illegal, or potentially illegal activities. <span> </span>By using DropCatch's website and services, all customers expressly consent to this Privacy Policy. DropCatch further reserves the right to modify this Policy at any time. If changes are made to this Policy, those changes will be publicly posted. DropCatch is not required to directly notify its customers of changes made to this Policy, however, if material changes are made, DropCatch will notify its customers by email or through a public notice on its website.</span></p> <p class="useNoSpacing"></p><div class="newPara"></div><p></p> <p class="useNoSpacing"><b>To Access, Update, or Delete Your Personal Information</b></p> <p class="useNoSpacing"><b></b></p><div class="newPara"></div><p></p> <p class="useNoSpacing">You have the right to correct any personal information held about you that is inaccurate or incomplete.
