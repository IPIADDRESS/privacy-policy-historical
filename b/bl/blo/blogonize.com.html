<h1>PRIVACY POLICY - COMMITMENT TO YOUR PRIVACY</h1>
<br>
This site is owned and operated by Blogonize. Your privacy on the
Internet is of the utmost importance to us. At Blogonize, we want to
make your experience online satisfying and safe. <br>
Because we gather certain types of information about our users, we feel
you should fully understand our policy and the terms and conditions
surrounding the capture and use of that information. This privacy
statement discloses what information we gather and how we use it. <br>
<br>
<h1><br>
  <br>
INFORMATION WE GATHER AND TRACK</h1><br>
Blogonize gathers two types of information about users: <br>
<br>
* Information that users provide through optional, voluntary
submissions. These are voluntary submissions to receive our electronic
newsletters, to participate in our message boards or forums, to email a
friend, and from participation in polls and surveys: <br>
<br>
* Information Blogonize gathers through aggregated tracking information
derived mainly by tallying page views throughout our sites. This
information allows us to better tailor our content to readers' needs
and to help our advertisers and sponsors better understand the
demographics of our audience. Because Blogonize derives its revenue
mainly from sponsorships and advertising, providing such aggregated
demographic data is essential to keeping our service free to users.
Under no circumstances does Blogonize divulge any information about an
individual user to a third party. <br>
