<h1>Welcome to the Blocksi Privacy Policy</h1>

<p>When you use Blocksi services, you trust us with your information. This Privacy Policy is meant to help you understand what data we collect, why we collect it, and what we do with it. This is important; we hope you will take time to read it carefully. 
</p>
    
<p>At Blocksi ("Service") we take privacy and the security of your data very seriously, so we'd like to be transparent with you about how we collect, utilize and protect it.</p>

<p>A lot of what you'll read in this document is designed to address various laws and regulations such as the <a href="https://www.eugdpr.org/" target="blank">GDPR.</a> or <a href="https://secure2.cpsd.us/cspa/agreements/CSDPA_Final_V1_Overview_022717.pdf" target="blank">California Student Data Privacy Agreeement (CSDPA)</a>  That said, we'd like to take a moment to share a few philosophies that guide how we treat data and privacy here at Blocksi now and going forward:</p>

    <li>Data you provide us, or that is collected on your behalf, is owned entirely by you and will be available to you on demand as well as removed on demand.</li>
<li>We consider data a liability and only collect and share the minimum amount required to provide you with a great service.</li>
    
<p>We've made an effort to make this document as clear and easy to understand as we can, but if you have any questions, please don't hesitate to reach out at <strong>privacy@blocksi.net</strong>.</p>

<i>If you do not agree with this policy, please do not access or use our Service.</i>

<p style="text-decoration:underline;">Who this policy applies to</p>
<li>Our Customers who have signed up for our Service</li>
<li>End-Users of our Customers who interact with our Service</li>

    
<h2>Privacy policy</h2> 
<p>There are many different ways you can use Blocksi Manager for  Cloud Filtering and Classroom Management services –Either by using the Administrator dashboard, the Parent dashboard or the Teacher dashboard. As you use our services, we want you to be clear how we’re using information and the ways in which you can protect your privacy.</p>
    
<p>Our Privacy Policy explains:</p>
<li>What information we collect and why we collect it.</li>
<li>How we use that information.</li>
 
<p>We’ve tried to keep it as simple as possible, but if you’re not familiar with terms like, IP addresses, Hostname, URL  and browsers, then read about these <a href="key-terms.php" target="_blank">key terms</a> first. Your privacy matters to Blocksi so whether you are new to Blocksi or a long-time user, please do take the time to get to know our practices – and if you have any questions <a href="contact-us.php" target="_blank">contact us</a> (privacy@blocksi.net).
</p>
    
<h2>Information we collect</h2>
<p>We collect information to provide 	a cloud based internet and youtube filtering service for any  GSuite Education user that has authenticated himself by logging into his google account whether on a desktop machine or a chromebook.  
</p>

<h3>Information you give us.</h3>
<p>As an Administrator , many of our services require you to sign up for a Blocksi Manager Education Everywhere  Account either on the Administrator or on the teacher dashboard or on the portal dashboard. When you do, we’ll ask for personal information, like your name, email address, telephone number. 
As a student, you need to sign up for a Google account (GSuite Education) and we will collect then your email address and the Blocksi extension will then be enforced onto your chrome browser or chromebook.
As a teacher, you need as well to sign up for a Google account to be able to use the Chromebook Classroom Management System (Teacher Dashboard)
</p>
   
<h3>Information we get from the student when Blocksi extension is enabled on his GSuite account</h3>
<p> We collect information about the websites, every  student visit or has attempted to visit, or has been denied access to , about  youtube videos that have been  watched or currently being  watched . </p>
    
<p>This information includes:</p>

<li><strong><a href="https://blocksi.net/key-terms.php#key05" target="_blank">Device</a> information</strong></li>
<li>We collect device-specific information (such as your hardware model, operating system version, <a href="https://blocksi.net/key-terms.php#key15" target="_blank">unique device identifiers.</a> Blocksi may associate your device identifiers  with your Google Account.</li>
<li><strong>Log information</strong></li>
<li>When students view internet content on Blocksi enabled chrome client, we automatically collect and store certain information in <a href="https://blocksi.net/key-terms.php#key14" target="_blank">server logs.</a> This includes:</li>
<ul>
    <li>Details of the students  search queries.</li>
    <li><a href="https://blocksi.net/key-terms.php#key08" target="_blank">Internet protocol address.</a></li>
    <li>User google email address</li></ul>
<li><strong>Location information</strong></li>
<li>When you use Blocksi services, we may collect and process information about your actual location. We use various technologies to determine location, including IP address, GPS, and other sensors that may, for example, provide Blocksi with information on nearby devices,Wi-Fi access points and cell towers.</li>
<li><strong>Local storage</strong></li>
<li>We may collect and store information (including personal information) locally on your device using mechanisms such as <a href="https://blocksi.net/key-terms.php#key03" target="_blank">browser web storage</a> (including HTML 5) and <a href="https://blocksi.net/key-terms.php#key02" target="_blank">application data caches.</a></li>
    
<p>Information we collect, when a student is  signed into  a Blocksi enabled GSuite Education account , is associated with the student  Google Account. 
When information is associated with your Google Account, we treat it as personal information. </p>
    
<h3>How we use information we collect</h3>
    
    
<li>In Blocksi Manager Analytics and Insights Admin and Teacher Dashboard</li>
<li>These services are provided to a school under its <a href="blocksi-edu-agreement.php" target="_blank">Blocksi  for Education agreement</a> and, as applicable, <a href="data-amendment.php" target="_blank">Data Processing Amendment.</a> (Users and parents can ask their school if it has accepted the Data Processing Amendment.) </li>
<li>Blocksi  does not serve ads nor use personal information collected  for advertising purposes.</li>
<li>The Blocksi  Privacy Policy describes fully how Blocksi services generally use information. To summarize, we use the information we collect from all of our services to provide, maintain, protect and improve them, to develop new ones, and to protect Blocksi and our users. We also use this information to offer users tailored content, such as more relevant search results. We may combine personal information from one service with information, including personal information, from other Google services.</li>
<li>For Blocksi Apps for Education users in primary and secondary (K-12) schools, Blocksi  does not use any user personal information (or any information associated with an GSuite Apps for Education Account) to target ads, while using an Apps for Education account.</li>
    
<p>Blocksi processes personal information on our servers in many countries around the world. We may process your personal information on a server located outside the country where you live.</p>
 
<h2>Information you share</h2>
    
<p>When a student GSuite account is enabled for Blocksi services, Blocksi only collects analytics related to the internet browsing activity of the student and whether he has been denied access to some category of internet content or some specific sites. Teacher dashboard allows to monitor students screen during the class. Our services provide you with different options on sharing and removing your content.
</p>
    
<h2>Accessing and updating your personal information</h2>
    
<p>Whenever a student filtering is enforced by Blocksi, we aim to provide parents and guardian with access to their children web analytics and insights through the Parent Dashboard. If that information is wrong, we strive to give you ways to update it quickly or to delete it – unless we have to keep that information for legitimate business or legal purposes. When a parent request to update its children information, we may ask them to verify their identity before we can act on your request. To note that emancipated student or student aged above 18 years of age, are entitled to sign up for a Parent dashboard account and access their data with the same privileges (update or delete)  as a regular parent or guardian.  We may ask them to verify their identity before we can act on their request.</p>
<p>We may reject requests that are unreasonably repetitive, require disproportionate technical effort (for example, developing a new system or fundamentally changing an existing practice), risk the privacy of others, or would be extremely impractical (for instance, requests concerning information residing on backup systems).</p>
<p>Where we can provide information access and correction, we will do so for free, except where it would require a disproportionate effort. We aim to maintain our services in a manner that protects information from accidental or malicious destruction.  Blocksi will delete such data from its systems as soon as reasonably practicable within a maximum period of 180 days, unless applicable legislation or legal process prevents it from doing so.

<h3>Transparency and choice</h3>   
    <p>We provide a variety of user controls that enable Blocksi Manager For Education users (administrator and guardians)  to make meaningful choices about how long information is stored in Blocksi services. Depending on the settings enabled by the school, users can use the various controls described in the Privacy Policy, such as Blocksi activity controls, to manage their privacy and information. We provide additional information for parents, students, and administrators on the Blocksi Manager  for Education Privacy Center.</p>
    
<h3>Parental review and deletion of information</h3>
    <p>The parents of Blocksi Manager  For Education users in Primary/Secondary (K-12) schools can access their child’s personal information  from the Parent Dashboard and  request that it be deleted through their dashboard. School administrators can provide for parental access and deletion of personal information consistent with the functionality of our services. If a parent wishes to stop any further collection or use of the child's information, the parent can request that the administrator use the service controls available to them to limit the child’s access to features or services, or delete the child’s account entirely. Guidance for administrators on how to use service controls to accomplish this is available in the  <a href="https://support.google.com/a" target="_blank">Help Center.</a></p>

<h1 style="text-align:center; margin:80px 0; padding-top:44px; border-top:1px solid lightgray;">GDPR- The key data protection principles</h1>
    
<p>
    As you probably heard, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) took effect on May 25, 2018. GDPR has been designed to provide individuals with greater control over how their personal data is collected, stored, transferred, and used, while also simplifying the regulatory environment across the European Union (EU). This new regulation impacts both organizations that conduct business in the EU, as well as businesses that maintain or process EU personal data. LogMeIn recognizes the importance of the evolving legal and regulatory landscape around information security and data privacy and remains firmly committed to GDPR readiness by no later than the effective date.</p>
 
    <br>
    
<p>Some key GDPR principles to consider in implementation include:</p>
<p><strong>Integrity:</strong> Securing and safeguarding personal data using appropriate technical and organizational security measures.</p>
<p><strong>Lawfulness:</strong> Organizations must, among other things, ensure they have a legal basis for processing personal data, and process that data in a fair and transparent manner.</p>
<p><strong>Limited Use:</strong> Personal data may only be collected for specific, explicit, or legitimate purposes.</p>
<p><strong>Data Minimization:</strong> Only collect data that is relevant and necessary for its intended use.</p>
<p><strong>Accuracy:</strong> Personal data must be accurate and up-to-date.</p>
<p><strong>Storage Limitation:</strong> Subject to relevant exceptions, maintain personal data only for as long as is deemed necessary and reasonable.</p>
    <br><br><br>
    
<p>At Blocksi, accessible from https://www.blocksi.net/, one of our main priorities is the privacy of our visitors. This Privacy Policy document contains types of information that is collected and recorded by Blocksi and how we use it.</p>

<p>If you have additional questions or require more information about our Privacy Policy, do not hesitate to contact us through email at tdraksler@block.si</p>
