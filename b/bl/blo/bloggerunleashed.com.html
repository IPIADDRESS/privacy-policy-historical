								<p>IMPORTANT! THIS PRIVACY POLICY (“POLICY”) DESCRIBES HOW BLOGGERUNLEASHED.COM, INCORPORATED (“BU”) PROTECTS, USES AND SHARES ANY INFORMATION WHICH IS PROVIDED BY YOU AT WWW.BLOGGERUNLEASHED.COM (COLLECTIVELY, THE “SITE”). BY ACCESSING THE SITE, YOU ARE INDICATING THAT YOU HAVE READ, UNDERSTOOD AND AGREE TO THIS PRIVACY POLCY AND OUR TERMS OF SERVICE</p>
<p>IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THE TERMS OF SERVICE OR OUR PRIVACY POLICY, PLEASE DO NOT USE THE SITE OR ANY SERVICES OFFERED AT THE SITE.</p>
<p>Types of Information that BU Collects</p>
<p>BU collects two different types of information from You when You use the Site. We collect certain types of personally identifiable information from You (“Personal Information”) when You register a member or affiliate account (“Account”). We also collect certain non- personally identifiable, aggregate information from visitors to our Site regardless of whether they create or sign in to an Account (“Traffic Data”).</p>
<p>Personal Information</p>
<p>In order to create an Account You will have to provide Personal Information that may include:</p>
<p>a. name</p>
<p>b. address</p>
<p>c. telephone number</p>
<p>d. billing information (such as a credit card number)</p>
<p>e. the type of personal computer being used to access the services</p>
<p>f. payment and tax withholding information</p>
<p>Your Personal Information is used to manage Your Account and is not shared with third parties, unless specifically stated otherwise or in special circumstances. In compliance with applicable laws, it is our policy to require only the Personal Information necessary to manage Your Account and enable You to participate in our programs (as applicable, the “Program”). BU does not condition Your participation in any specific activity on our Site on the disclosure of more information than is reasonably necessary.</p>
<p>Traffic Data</p>
<p>BU may also use certain web technologies such as “cookies” to track Your use of our Site. Your browser may have an option that allows You to reject cookies, but doing so may limit Your use of our Site. Usage Information is anonymous and does not personally identify You. In addition, BU may use web beacons or other tools to measure the effectiveness of, and otherwise manage, our online advertising. These web beacons enable our advertising server to recognize You when You visit the Site and to determine which banner ads bring users to the Site. BU does not use spyware, adware or any other similarly intrusive software. The Usage Information that BU collects depends on how You choose to use this Site.</p>
<p>Use of Your Information</p>
<p>BU may use Your Personal Information to manage Your Account, such as responding to Your email inquiries or providing You with voluntary customer surveys to helps us to improve the types of products and services we offer to You. In addition, BU may use Traffic Data to deliver tailored advertisements or joint ventures. For instance, an advertiser or joint venture company tells us the audience they want to reach and provides us an advertisement tailored to the audience. Based upon the aggregated and non-identifying information we have collected, we may then display or send the advertisement to the intended audience. Additionally, BU may share non-identifying and aggregate information (except as described above), but not Personal Information, with third parties to administer certain co-branded products or services. BU does not share Your Personal Information with these advertisers or joint venture companies unless You have provided Your permission beforehand. In these instances, You will be notified before any such data is collected or transferred and may decide not to use that particular service or feature. Finally, BU may take the information collected in response to customer surveys and combine (or aggregate) it with the responses of other customers to create broader, generic responses to the survey questions (such as gender, age, residence, hobbies, education, employment, industry sector, or other demographic information). This aggregated, non-personally identifying information may be shared with third parties.</p>
<p>Third Party Websites</p>
<p>The Site may be hyper-linked to other sites which are not maintained by, or related to, BU. If You opt to provide information to such web sites, for example, to purchase products and services or register to receive materials, such as a newsletter, catalog or new product and service updates, please be aware that BU has no control over the third parties’ use of any personal information You provide when placing such an order. Please exercise care when doing so and carefully review such website’s privacy policies before providing any information. If You provide information about someone else, such as a person’s name, address, and phone number, please be aware that such provision may be prohibited by certain laws and that You, and not BU, are solely responsible for doing so.</p>
