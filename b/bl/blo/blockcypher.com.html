We may ask you to identify which country you are located in when you use some of the Services, or we may rely on your IP address to identify which country you are located in. Where we rely only on your IP address, we cannot apply the terms of this Section to any User or Customer that masks or otherwise obfuscates their location information so as not to appear located in the Designated Countries. If any terms in this Section conflict with other terms contained in this Policy, the terms in this Section shall apply to Users and Customers in the Designated Countries.</span></p>

BlockCypher.com is a data controller with regard to any personal information collected from Customers or Users of its Services. A “data controller” is an entity that determines the purposes for which and the manner in which any personal information is processed. Any third parties that act as our service providers are “data processors” that handle your personal information in accordance with our instructions.</span></li><li class="c7"><span class="c1">Lawful Basis for Processing Your Personal Information. We describe our lawful bases for processing in Section 6 (“How Is Collected Information Used”) and Section 7 (“Information We Share”) under headings entitled “Designated Countries.” The lawful bases on which we rely to process your personal information include: your consent to the processing; satisfaction of our legal obligations; to protect your vital interests; to carry out our obligations arising from any contracts we entered with you or to take steps at your request prior to entering into a contract with you; in the public interest; or for our legitimate interests as described in those sections.</span></li><li class="c5"><span class="c1">Marketing Activities. Direct marketing includes any communications we send to you that are only based on advertising or promoting products and services. Transactional communications about your account or our Services are not considered “direct marketing” communications. We will only contact Users or Customers by electronic means (including email or SMS) based on our legitimate interest or their consent. When we rely on legitimate interest, we will only send you information about our Services that are similar to those which were the subject of a previous sale or negotiations of a sale to you.</span></li><li class="c5"><span class="c9">If you do not want us to use your personal information in this way, please click the </span><span class="c4"><a class="c12" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://blockcypher.us10.list-manage.com/unsubscribe?u%3D7a5b3e78c79c38799e1c31678%26id%3D941e1863b2%26e%3D%26c%3D325299f784&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1535052709857000">unsubscribe link</a></span><span class="c9">&nbsp;in your emails, or contact us at support@BlockCypher.com.

If we share your personal information with third parties, we will notify them of any requests for rectification, erasure or restriction of your personal information, unless this proves impossible or involves disproportionate effort.
