<b>Gathering of Information<br>
</b><br>
<b>Voluntary Submission:</b> Blogz does not collect personally identifying information about any individual web site user except when knowingly provided by such individual. For example, when a visitor comes to Blogz to read an article, we do not ask for nor do we collect personally identifiable information.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<b> Cookies: </b>A cookie is a data file that certain Web sites write to your computer's hard drive when you visit such sites. A cookie file can contain information, such as a user identification code, that the site uses to track the pages you have visited. Blogz uses cookies solely to track user traffic patterns throughout the Blogz Web site. We use this data on an anonymous basis and we do not correlate this information with personal data of any user.<br>
<br>
Most Web site browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually change your browser settings to display a warning before accepting a cookie, or to refuse all cookies. However, if you choose to disable the receipt of cookies from our Web site, you may not be able to use certain features of the site. We also use third party advertisements on Blogz to help support our site. Some of these advertisers may use technology such as cookies and web beacons when they advertise on our site, which will also send these advertisers (such as Google through the Google AdSense program) information including your IP address, your ISP , the browser you used to visit our site, and various browser options you may have installed on your web browser. This is generally used for geotargeting purposes or showing certain ads based on specific sites visited.<br>
<br>
<b>Log Files &amp; Browser Level Information: </b>As with most other websites, we collect and use the data contained in log files. The information in the log files include your IP address, your Internet Service Provider, the web browser you used to visit our site, the time you visited our site and which pages you visited throughout our site. If available, we may also record referral information to determine how you were referred to our site from external web sites.<br>
<br>
<b> Use of Information: </b>Our primary goal in collecting user information is to enhance your experience on our Web site.

<br>

<br>

<b>Definitions: </b><br>
<br>
<b>IP address:</b> Every computer connected to the Internet has a numeric address called an “IP address." This may or may not correspond uniquely to a particular computer. In some cases, IP addresses can be resolved to domain names, which may indicate a site visitor's Internet service provider, employer, university, etc. As part of its database analysis Blogz resolves IP addresses to domain names.<br>
<br>
<b>Browser type:</b> A user’s browser is a software program running on a computer that allows users to access documents on the World Wide Web. Browsers can be either text or graphic. They read HTML coded pages that reside on a server and interpret the coding into what the user sees as Web pages. Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer are examples of Web browsers.
