						The Supplier of the Educational Site (heretofore referred to as the Supplier) is committed

				 to protecting your privacy and earning your trust. This policy discloses

						the privacy practices for the Supplier's Web site. We use the information

						we collect about you from the Supplier's Web site to process orders and

						to provide a more personalized experience as you use our products and

						services. This policy explains how your personal information is safeguarded.

						It is our intent to give you as much control as possible over your privacy

						and personal information and the use we make of it in our business. This

						policy may change, so please check back from time to time.<br>

						<b><a name="kinds"></a>What kinds of personal information does the Supplier

						collect?</b><br>

						<br>

						In general, you can visit the Supplier's site on the Web without telling

						us who you are or revealing any personal information about yourself. The

						more information you volunteer (and the more accurate it is), the better

						we are able to customize your experience. We ask for information from

						you in several ways from different parts of our Web site. <br>

						<br>

						* We ask for personal information from you when you become a registered

						user of the Supplier's site. You are required to register and receive

						a logon name to be able to access and use certain features of the Supplier's

						site and to buy products or services. At that time, the Supplier asks

						for certain required information such as your name, e-mail address, credit

						card number and expiration date, and other information to process and

						fulfill your order. We also request certain other optional information

						that will enable us to provide you with a more personalized experience

						when using the Supplier's site. We will let you know what information

						is optional, and you decide whether or not you want to provide that information

						or to receive newsletters or third party correspondence. <br>

						<br>

						* As you use the Supplier's site, you may be required to enter personal

						information in order to receive specific benefits. For example, we ask

						for information from you when you register for a course or purchase product

						or service through our catalog or affiliate relationships or when you

						enter a contest or promotion sponsored by the Supplier or its many partners.

						This enables us to administer the contest and notify winners. <br>

						<br>

						* In the course of using our site, we automatically track certain information

						about you. This information includes what type of browser you are using.

						This information may include the URL that you just came from and the next

						URL you go to, regardless of whether these URLs are on our Web site or

						not. It also includes your IP address. The Supplier uses this information

						to identify broad demographic trends that may be used to provide information

						tailored to your interests. <br>

						<br>

						* If you choose to buy products or services on our site or through affiliate

						relationships, we collect information about your buying behavior. If those

						products or services are provided by a third party, then we will send

						the third party information about you that is needed to process the order.

						We do not control how the third party uses that information, and this

						policy does not cover the privacy practices of those businesses. <br>

						<br>

						* We also monitor customer traffic patterns and site usage to help us

						refine and improve the design and layout of the Supplier site and the

						user experience. <br>

						<br>

						* If you send us personal correspondence, such as e-mails or letters,

						we may keep a record of that correspondence. We also periodically ask

						users for feedback that we use to improve our service and products and

						add new features. If you respond to these requests, we may keep a record

						of your response. <br>

						<br>

						* We also collect IP addresses for system administration. <br>

						<br>

						<b><a name="supplier use"></a>How does the Supplier use my information?</b><br>

						<br>

						We collect personal information to give you a customized experience and

						to help the Supplier understand its customers better. The Supplier does

						not sell, trade, or rent your personal information to others. In the future,

						we may choose to do so with trustworthy third parties if you consent to

						receiving newsletters and correspondence and e-mails from third parties

						on the registration page on our Web site. <br>

						<br>

						* The personal information you choose to give us allows the Supplier to

						process and fulfill your orders and to notify you of your order status.

						<br>

						<br>

						* We use the personal information you give us to provide you with up-to-date

						information about the Supplier's products and services. <br>

						<br>

						* We may use the information we collect to notify you from time to time

						about important functionality changes to the Web site, new Supplier services

						and products, and special offers we think you will find valuable. <br>

						<br>

						* When you provide us with personal information to enter a contest or

						promotion sponsored by the Supplier or its partners, we use this information

						to administer the contest and notify winners. We store all information

						relating to such contests and promotions. <br>

						<br>

						* In order for the Supplier to provide free services on our Web site,

						we include third party advertisements on our Web site. <br>

						<br>

						* We will deliver targeted advertisements to our customers using the personal

						information you give us. Third parties provide us with advertisements

						and identify an audience they want to reach. We display these advertisements

						on our Web site to people who fit the criteria. We do not allow advertisers

						to have access to individual account information. These advertisements

						are usually banner ads and promotional e-mails. You will only receive

						e-mail announcements of special offers if you have asked to receive newsletters

						and/or third party information when registering on our Web site. You can

						change your preferences at any time. <br>

						<br>

						* We also research our users' demographics, interests, and behavior based

						on the information you give us. We compile and analyze this information

						on an aggregate or anonymous basis. <br>

						<br>

						* We use the IP addresses we collect to report aggregate or anonymous

						information to our advertisers. <br>

						<br>

						<b><a name="who collects"></a>Who collects information?</b><br>

						<br>

						When you supply personal information on the Supplier's site, you share

						that information only with the Supplier and NotHarvard.com, its parent company,

						unless you are specifically told otherwise. NotHarvard.com will comply with

						this privacy policy and may use your personal information in the same

						manner it is used by the Supplier. If a company other than the Supplier

						and NotHarvard.com is gathering or maintaining your personal data from our

						Web site, you will be told before it is collected or transferred. You

						can always choose not to share the information. <br>

						<br>

						When companies other than the Supplier sponsor promotions, data collected

						on the Supplier's site in connection with these promotions may be shared

						with the sponsor. Once again, if this is the case, you will be notified

						before the data is collected or transferred, and you can decide not to

						participate. Most of these promotions are limited to United States or

						North American residents. <br>

						<br>

						If you leave our Web site using links to go to other third party Web sites,

						those third parties may gather information about you. This privacy policy

						does not cover the practices of those businesses.<br>

						<b><br>

						<a name="share"></a>Does the Supplier share my information?</b><br>

						<br>

						Other than as stated in this policy, the Supplier does not disclose any

						of your personal information to third parties without your permission.

						Read the following sections to learn more.<br>

						<br>

						<i>Business partners and sponsors<br>

						</i><br>

						The Supplier may disclose your personal information to business partners

						or sponsors, but you will be notified beforehand and will be able to choose

						not to share your information. Many promotions give you the chance to

						request additional information from the sponsors. When you ask for more

						information, you give the Supplier permission to send your personal information

						to the sponsor so they can fulfill your request. Much of the time, only

						your e-mail address will be shared. You will be notified if more information

						will be shared, and you can choose not to share the information.<br>

						<br>

						<i>The Supplier shopping</i><br>

						<br>

						When you buy services or products offered through the Supplier, the provider

						of the product or service receives only the information required for the

						transaction to take place, unless additional information is collected

						by the product or service provider. You may be required to give these

						providers certain additional information to purchase some products or

						services. These providers have separate privacy and data collection practices.

						The Supplier has no responsibility or liability for their policies. The

						service provider's home page usually provides a link to its privacy policy.<br>

						<br>

						<i>Third-party data and aggregate data</i><br>

						<br>

						The Supplier discloses aggregated or anonymous statistics (for example,

						the percentage of users from the western U.S.) to prospective partners

						and advertisers and for other lawful purposes.<br>

						<b><br>

						</b><i>Other situations</i><br>

						<br>

						The Supplier also may disclose your information where disclosure is necessary

						to identify, contact, or bring legal action against someone who may be

						causing injury to or interference with our rights or property rights,

						the users' rights, or others' rights. In the same way, the Supplier will

						disclose information when we reasonably believe disclosure is required

						by law or to comply with a legal process served on the Supplier or its

						Web site. We may disclose your personal information in the good faith

						belief that we must act under exigent circumstances to protect the personal

						safety of users of the Supplier, its Web site, or the public.<br>

						<br>

						<b><a name="choice"></a>Do I have a choice about how my information is

						gathered, used and distributed?</b><br>

						<br>

						Yes. When you log in or register with the Supplier, you can choose to

						receive newsletters, information, and e-mails from NotHarvard.com and third

						parties. If you change your mind, you can simply update your account information

						on our Web site so that the information will not be sent. It's your choice.

						<br>

						<br>

						Some of our promotions may request your e-mail address so that you can

						receive periodic updates about the status of the promotion. When you participate

						in these types of promotions, you will automatically receive promotion-related

						e-mail; however, you can choose the no-e-mail option that some promotions

						offer. Occasionally these promotion-related e-mail messages may include

						targeted advertisements.<br>

						<br>

						You can make decisions about cookies. You can modify your browser preferences

						to accept all cookies, be notified when a cookie is set, or to reject

						all cookies. If you decide to reject all cookies, you cannot participate

						in the Supplier's services that require registration to participate.<br>

						<br>

						We will notify you any time we want to transfer the data we have collected

						or share it with a third party, and you always have the option to forbid

						the transfer.<br>

						<br>

						<b><a name="precautions"></a>What security precautions does the Supplier

						take to protect me?</b><br>

						<br>

						Your account information and profile are password-protected so that you

						are the only one who has access to your personal information. You can

						edit your account information and profile by using your logon name and

						password. We recommend that you follow these guidelines to protect yourself:

						<br>

						<br>

						* Do not tell anyone your password. If your password has been compromised

						for any reason, you should immediately change your password. <br>

						<br>

						* Do not respond to unsolicited e-mail by giving your password, even if

						the e-mail claims to be from us. The Supplier will never ask you for your

						password in this way. <br>

						<br>

						* When you are done using the Supplier's site, sign out of your account

						and close your browser window. <br>

						<br>

						No data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.

						Although we are committed to protecting your personal information, the

						Supplier cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you

						send to us or from our online services, and you do so at your own risk.<br>

						<br>

						<b><a name="protect"></a>How does the Supplier protect my credit card

						and financial information?</b><br>

						<br>

						We are committed to protecting the privacy of your credit card and financial

						account information. We do not sell, trade, or rent your financial or

						credit card information. This includes any information you keep in your

						personal account on our Web site. We do not make this information available

						to anyone without your permission. We may provide statistical data on

						our customers to advertisers, partners, vendors, and other reputable third

						parties which is comprised of aggregate or anonymous data only, which

						does not contain any personally identifiable information. For example,

						we will not disclose that you purchased a specific product, but we might

						disclose statistics on how many customers have purchased a specific product.

						<br>

						<br>

						When you enter credit card information on our Web site, we transmit the

						information in encrypted format, using industry standard, secure socket

						layer (SSL) encryption.<br>

						<b><br>

						<a name="cookies"></a>What are cookies and how does the Supplier use them?</b><br>

						<br>

						Part of our customized service involves using "cookies" so that we can

						immediately recognize you, determine when you - or someone using the same

						browser you previously used - revisits the Supplier's site, and to provide

						a more personalized experience. A "cookie" is a chunk of data that is

						sent to your browser from a web server and stored by your browser on the

						hard drive of your computer. Your browser settings must be set to accept

						cookies before you can log-in or customize. Most browsers are set up to

						accept cookies, but you can usually change your browser settings to refuse

						them. The Supplier does not use cookies to retrieve personal information

						about you from your computer. This policy does not cover the use of cookies

						by any advertisers on our Web site.<br>

						<b><br>

						</b><i>The Supplier uses cookies to: </i><br>

						<br>

						1. Locate your name and account information when you log in to our Web

						site so that you can access your account information. When you log in,

						the cookie is set, and when you sign-out, the cookie is modified. <br>

						<br>

						2. Estimate the size of our audience. Each browser that accesses the Supplier's

						site is given a unique cookie, which is used to calculate how many people

						return to our Web site, compare the number of registered and unregistered

						visitors to our site, and use customer interests and behavior to target

						our advertisements. <br>

						<br>

						3. Help the Supplier's partners track visits and complete business transactions.

						This information is sometimes called "clickstream" or "click trail." <br>

						<br>

						4. Track the way you use our promotions, contests, and sales. When a Supplier-hosted

						promotion uses cookies, the information written to the cookie tracks the

						user's progress through the promotion (for example, entries, submissions,

						and status in prize drawings). <br>

						<br>

						5. Measure the traffic to various areas of the Supplier's Web site. We

						measure the areas of the network of Web sites you visit and your visiting

						patterns in the aggregate. This research helps us understand the ways

						in which our customers are alike and the ways in which they differ. We

						may use this information to personalize the information and design in

						our Web site. <br>

						<br>

						<b> <a name="children"></a>What about the privacy of children?</b><br>

						<br>

						The Supplier is a general audience Web site and does not request the age

						of its customers. If a child wants to log in or register at our site,

						we prefer that a parent or guardian do so instead of the child. In this

						way, we have a parent or guardian's consent before we gather any information

						from the user.
