	the understanding, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of disorders affecting
	the blood, bone marrow, and the immunologic, hemostatic and vascular systems,
	by promoting research, clinical care, education, training, and advocacy in hematology.</p><h2><a name="4"></a>Information We Collect About You</h2><p>We collect two types of information from you when you visit
	our Sites or when you become a Member of ASH: (1) "personally identifiable
	information" ("PII") (as defined below) and (2) non-personally
	identifiable information ("NPII") (as defined below).</p><p>PII for the purposes of this Privacy Policy is information
	that identifies you personally, such as your name, address, telephone number,
	email address. </p><p>Here are some examples and explanations of the ways in which
	we may collect, store, transfer, share or otherwise make your PII available to
	ASH.</p><ul><li><u>Participation and Engagement
		History</u>. When you use our services
		and/or become a member of ASH we track your participation and engagement
		history and in some circumstances make this information available to other
		members of ASH or to the general public.
		<ul><li>Participation history may include
				information about your committee membership and participation generally in the
				mission of ASH. We maintain PII on all of
				our members that can be accessedthrough a secure online member directory.
				Inclusion in this directory is AUTOMATIC unless you OPT OUT in the membership
				options account settings. Inclusion in this directly means your information may
				be accessed only by other current ASH members through a password-protected,
				members-only area of the Sites. </li><li>We also offer a voluntary,
				publicly accessible online directory of members through a section on our Site called
				"<a href="http://www.findahematologist.org/" target="_self">Find a
					Hematologist</a>". Inclusion in this
				directory is based upon an affirmative OPT IN selection in address field table
				in your account settings. The Find a Hematologist directory allows patients and
				other members of the public to search for hematologists and provides users with
				contact information for members who have chosen to be listed in the directory. You
				may choose to OPT OUT of this directory at any time by accessing their
				membership profile and adjusting your account settings accordingly.</li></ul></li><li><u>Survey Data</u>. The gathering of this information may include
		analysis and sharing of online surveys for which you may choose to participate. </li><li><u>Contribution and Payment
		Information</u>. We collect information
		on the amount of contributions you have made to ASH and your purchase history
		from the Sites. </li><li><u>Award and Grant Recipient Data</u>. When you accept an award or grant from ASH, we track
		your acceptance and engagement with the award/grant program and with your
		permission we may make your name, institution, and in some cases, your project
		topic, available to the general public.</li></ul><p>"NPII" can be technical information or it can be
	demographic information, such as your age, gender, or interests. Non-personally
	identifiable information may also mean aggregated, non-identifiable or
	anonymized information. Non-personally identifiable information does not
	identify you personally. If you do provide us with non-personally identifiable
	information, we may use it for the purposes described in this statement or
	where it is collected, or any other legal purpose.</p><p>Here are some examples of the ways in which we may collect
	and store your non-personally identifiable information through our services,
	and how we use such information:</p><ul><li><u>Log Information</u>. <br>
		When you use our services or view content provided
		by ASH we automatically collect and store certain information in our server
		logs. This type of information includes details of how you used our service, IP
		address information described below, web pages which have been viewed by a
		visitor, data and time, domain type, device event information such as crashes,
		system activity, hardware, settings, browser type or version, browser language,
		the date and time of your request and referral URL. </li><li><u>Internet Protocol (IP) address.</u><br>
		Your "IP address" is a number that lets
		computers attached to the Internet know where to send you data, such as the
		screens and pages of our services that you view. We use this information to
		deliver our screens and pages to you upon request, to tailor our services to
		the interests of you and our other visitors, and to measure traffic to and
		within our services.</li><li><u>Demographic Information</u>.<br>
"Demographic information" may be your
		gender, age, zip code, and interests. We may collect such information about you
		through our services and use it to provide you with personalized services and
		to analyze trends to ensure that our services and the information on them is
		targeted to meet your needs. Please note that we also consider aggregated
		information, which is not personally identifiable, to be non-personally
		identifiable information.</li><li><u>Device Information</u>.<br>
"Device Information" may include
		information we collect such as your hardware model, operating system version,
		unique device identifiers and mobile network information including phone
		number. We may associate your device identifiers or phone number with your
		account.</li><li><u>Location Information</u>. <br>
		When you use ASH services we may collect and process
		information about your actual location. We use various technologies to
		determine location, including IP Address, Global Positioning Systems and other
		sensors that may provide ASH with information about nearby devices, Wi-Fi
		access points and cell towers. </li></ul><h2><a name="5"></a>How
	We Use Information</h2><p><u>Personally Identifiable Information</u>. If you do
	provide us with personally identifiable information, we will only use it for
	the purposes described in this statement or where it is collected. </p><p>We use personally identifiable information to provide you
	with services, to develop our membership and to provide members with certain
	opportunities, for Site troubleshooting and maintenance, to communicate with
	you about your membership, opportunities and our services, or to conduct
	marketing and fundraising research. We also use personally identifiable
	information in our services to:</p><ul><li> help us create and publish content

		of our Sites;</li><li>register you as a Member and
		develop your profile and enable you to take advantage of the personalized
		features of our Sites;</li><li>make our membership mailing list

		updated information, and our other new services or those of other
		third-parties;</li><li>forward promotional materials and

		additional information.</li></ul><p><u>Non-personally identifiable information</u>. We may use
	non-personally identifiable information for the purposes described in this
	Privacy Policy or where it is collected, or any other legal purpose, including, when and where applicable,
	combining non-personally identifiable information with personally identifiable
	information.</p><p><u>Reports</u>.  We periodically prepare analyses and
	reports reflecting visitor and member use of the services. In preparing these
	reports, we may combine and analyze the personal information you provide to us
	with information from other sources. However, these reports will only include
	aggregate information about visitors and members. The information in these reports
	will not identify individuals. Any business partner with whom such reports may
	be shared will also not be able to contact you from the information contained
	in the reports.</p><h2><a name="6"></a>Sharing and Disclosure</h2><p><u>Personally identifiable information</u>. Primarily, we may
	share or disclose your personally identifiable information in the following
	instances:</p><ul><li><strong>To fulfill a service to you.</strong></li><li><strong>To offer you products from our
		affiliates, strategic partners, agents, or from third-party marketers and other
		unaffiliated parties that we believe may be of interest to you, or to assist
		such parties for research, administrative, and/or business purposes.<br></strong>These parties may
		contact you with an offer or advertisement related to a product or service, or
		they may use such information for their own research, administration or
		business purposes.</li><li><strong>To unaffiliated third-party
		service providers, agents, or independent contractors who help us maintain our
		services and with other administrative services (including, but not limited to,
		order processing and fulfillment, providing customer service, maintaining and
		analyzing data, sending customer communications on our behalf, and entry
		collection, winner selection and prize fulfillment for contests, sweepstakes,
		and other promotions).</strong><br>
		We seek to ensure that
		such unaffiliated third-parties will not use your personally identifiable
		information for any purpose other than that for which they are responsible.
		However, we cannot guarantee that they will not use it for any other purpose.</li><li><strong>To complete your purchase.</strong><br>
		If you choose to make
		a purchase on or through our services, we may ask you for your credit card
		number, billing address, and other information in connection with completing
		such purchase, and we may use such information to fulfill your purchase. We may
		also provide such information, or other personally identifiable information
		provided by you, to unaffiliated third-parties to complete your purchase (for
	example, to process your credit card).</li><li><strong>To comply with law, or in the
		good faith belief that such action is necessary to conform to the requirements
		of law, or comply with legal process served on us, and to protect and defend
		our rights or property, including our rights and property and our services, or
		act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of you and our other
		visitors.</strong></li><li><strong>To third parties as part of a
		corporate reorganization process including, but not limited to, mergers,
		acquisitions, and sales of all or substantially all of our assets.</strong></li><li><strong>To track and analyze
		non-identifying, aggregate usage and volume statistical information from our
		visitors and customers and provide such information to third parties.</strong></li><li><strong>To protect against fraud and potential fraud.</strong><br>
		We may verify the
		information you provide using our services through third parties. In the course
		of such verification, we may receive additional personally identifiable
		information about you from such services. In particular, if you use a credit
		card or debit card to purchase services with us, we may use card authorization
		and fraud screening services to verify that your card information and address
		match the information you supplied to us, and that the card has not been
	reported as lost or stolen.</li></ul><p><u>Non-personally identifiable information</u>. We may share
	and disclose your non-personally identifiable information for the purposes
	described in this statement or where it is collected, or any other legal
	purpose, including, when and where applicable, sharing and disclosing
	non-personally identifiable information combined with personally identifiable
	information.</p><p>Legal Disclosure. We may disclose information about
	you and your use of the services if we believe that such disclosure is
	reasonably necessary to: </p><ol><li>Comply with the law and/or legal
		process where a formal request has been made (e.g. request from an
		administrative oversight agency, civil suit, subpoena, court order or judicial
		or administrative proceeding);</li><li>Protect or defend our rights and/or property or the rights and property of others;</li><li>Enforce our Terms and/or this Privacy Policy;</li><li>Respond to claims that the
		content(s) of a communication violates the rights of another.</li></ol><p>Also, circumstances may arise where, for business reasons,
	We may decide to reorganize, or divest all or part of our business through
	sale, assignment, merger or acquisition, or we may acquire a new business. In
	these circumstances, personal information may be shared with the actual or
	prospective purchasers or assignees, or with the newly acquired business. In
	such an event, we shall provide notice of any material change to this Privacy
	Policy, or our services, in the manner described in the Changes to this Policy
	section of this Privacy Policy above. </p><p>If you encounter a screen or page that requests information
	you do not want to share with us, do not enter the information and do not
	proceed with that screen or page. In addition to the above, we may use Cookies
	and other tracking technologies as explained below.</p><h2><a name="7"></a>Credit Card Information</h2><p>Users may be prompted to enter their credit card
	information, including, for example, when making purchases, renewing
	membership, or making a donation online. Any credit card information you may
	provide to us is secured during transmission over the Internet using
	industry-standard secure socket layer (SSL) encryption. We use your credit card
	information only to bill you for the products and services you order from us.
	We do not share your credit card information with anyone, except as may be
	necessary to process your transactions or comply with law. </p><h2><a name="8"></a>Controlling Your Information</h2><p>As a convenience to our members, we provide a number of
	different opportunities to review and change information in your profile and to
	unsubscribe from our Services. For example, you can go to the website and log

	where technically feasible, after we receive a request from you to delete
	information. Please be advised that by requesting that your data be removed
	from our database, you will be unsubscribed from our services.</p><p>Please be advised that we may reject requests that are
	unreasonably repetitive, require disproportionate administrative or technical
	efforts, risk the privacy of other individuals or would be commercially
	unreasonable or impracticable. </p><p>We will retain your information for as long as your account
	is active or as needed to provide you services. </p><p>Please contact us if you wish to cancel your account or
	request that we no longer use your information to provide you services. We will

	obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.</p><h2><a name="9"></a>Opt Out and Opt In</h2><p>Opt-Out of Communications: </p><p>You may choose to not receive promotional email

	opt-out by ticking or un-ticking the appropriate box, if such checkbox where

	you may receive a few more messages until your request is processed. You also
	may opt-out of receiving such emails by clicking on the "unsubscribe"
	link within the text of the applicable email.</p><p>Opt-Out of Third Party Mailings </p><p>While we make our membership mailing list available to outside
	groups for educational purposes, including mailings about grant opportunities
	that could be beneficial to members, educational publications (e.g., medical
	textbooks, scientific journals), and educational programs or courses, ASH
	members who do not wish to have their mailing addresses shared with outside
	parties in this manner may opt-out by contacting ASH Member Services at
	202-776-0544 or <a href="mailto:CustomerService@hematology.org"><em>CustomerService@hematology.org</em></a>.</p><h2><a name="10"></a>Children</h2><p>The Sites and services are not intended for use by
	children.  We do not intentionally gather personally identifiable
	information about visitors who are under the age of 13.  If a child has
	provided us with personally identifiable information, a parent or guardian of
	that child may contact us to have the information deleted from our records. If
	you believe that we might have any information from a child under age 13,
	please contact us at <a href="mailto:CustomerService@hematology.org"><em>CustomerService@hematology.org</em></a>.   If we learn
	that we have inadvertently collected the personal information of a child under
	13, or equivalent minimum age depending on jurisdiction, we will take steps to
	delete the information as soon as possible. </p><h2><a name="11"></a>Cookies and Tracking</h2><p>In connection with the services, we or other parties may use
	cookies, web beacons, or other technologies that store or track information
	related to your use of the services.</p><p>For some of our Sites, we may
	post a Cookie Policy that is Site specific. We do this in order to best
	describe the use of cookies for Sites that are administered by our third party
	vendor partners.  By posting a separate and site specific policy on these
	selected Sites, we are able to provide transparency to you and describe in
	detail where the use of cookies is configured in a way that is different than
	how ASH typically manages cookies on its Sites. The reasons for this is that
	some of our third party site administrators are in the process of developing
	and upgrading their compliance and technical use capabilities in the interest
	of providing maximum choice to visitors to the Sites. These Sites include <a href="http://www.bloodjournal.org">www.bloodjournal.org</a>, <a href="http://www.bloodadvances.org">www.bloodadvances.org</a>, <a href="http://www.ash-sap.org">www.ash-sap.org</a> and <a href="http://asheducationbook.hematology.org">asheducationbook.hematology.org</a>. For these
	Sites, we will continue to update you as the technical and compliance
	capabilities are enhanced and additional choices regarding the use of cookies
	becomes available to you. </p><h2><a name="12"></a>Third-Party Links and Websites</h2><p>Our Sites may contain links to third-party services. While
	we endeavor to work with third parties that share our respect for user privacy,
	we are not responsible for the websites or privacy practices of such
	third-parties. In addition, this Privacy Policy is not intended to describe
	data handling procedures for information collected by other linked websites or
	business partners. You are responsible for knowing when you are leaving our
	Sites to visit a third party website, and for reading and understanding the
	terms of use and privacy policy statements for each such third party. </p><h2><a name="13"></a>Social Media and Community Platforms</h2><p>Any information, communications, or material of any type or
	nature that you submit to the Sites (including, but not limited to any ASH
	Sites contained on a social media platform or website such as Facebook,
	Instagram or Twitter) by email, posting, messaging, uploading, downloading, or otherwise
	(collectively, a Submission), is done at Your own risk and without any
	expectation of privacy. ASH cannot control the actions of other users of any
	social media platform or website and ASH is therefore not responsible for any
	content or Submissions contained on such sites and platforms. By visiting any
	ASH Sites that is contained on a social media platform or website, you are
	representing and warranting to ASH that you have reviewed the applicable
	Privacy Policy and terms of use of such platform or website and that you will
	abide by all such provisions contained therein. We may provide public areas on
	our services, such as forums and chat rooms, where you can post information
	about yourself and others. Please exercise discretion and use caution with
	respect to your information, especially in such public areas. We do not control
	who reads postings on our services, or how they may use or disclose such
	information. If you choose to voluntarily disclose information on public
	portions of our services, that information will be publicly available and can
	be collected and used by others. For example, if you post your email address,
	you may receive unsolicited messages. PLEASE BE EXTREMELY CAREFUL WHEN
	DISCLOSING ANY INFORMATION ABOUT YOURSELF OR OTHERS IN PUBLIC AREAS OF OUR
	SERVICES. WE ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR THE USE OR DISCLOSURE OF SUCH INFORMATION.</p><h2><a name="14"></a>How We
	Protect Your Information</h2><p>ASH maintains
	reasonable and appropriate measures to protect your information from loss,
	misuse and unauthorized access, disclosures, alterations and destruction taking
	in to account the risk involved in the processing and the nature of PII.
	Unfortunately, no site, server or database is completely secure or "hacker
	proof." We therefore cannot guarantee that information about you will not
	be disclosed, misused or lost by accident or by the unauthorized acts of
	others.</p><p><a name="15"></a>California Residents Rights</p><p>(As provided by California Civil Code Section 1798.83)</p><p>A California resident who has provided personal information
	to a business with whom he/she has established a business relationship for
	personal, family, or household purposes ("California customer") is
	entitled to request information about whether the business has disclosed
	personal information to any third parties for the third parties' direct
	marketing purposes. In general, if the business has made such a disclosure of
	personal information, upon receipt of a request by a California customer, the
	business is required to provide a list of all third parties to whom personal
	information was disclosed in the preceding calendar year, as well as a list of
	the categories of personal information that were disclosed.</p><p>California customers may request further information about
	our compliance with this law by e-mailing <a href="mailto:CustomerService@hematology.org">CustomerService@hematology.org</a>.
	Please note that we are only required to respond to one request per customer

	than through this e-mail address.</p><h2><a name="16"></a>California Do
	Not Track Notice</h2><p><strong>Information Regarding Commercial Electronic Messages
	("CEM") in Canada</strong></p><p>Canada's Anti-Spam Law requires that the Company obtain the

	for your explicit consent when you provide us with your email address or other
	personal information through which we intend to encourage your participation in
	a commercial activity, such as a promotion for our products. </p><p>If you explicitly consent to receiving CEM, each
	communication sent to you will contain an option to unsubscribe to the

	you can contact us at the address or email provided below in the "Contact Us"
	section to be removed from our mailing lists. </p><h2><a name="17" id="17"></a>Your Rights and
	Choices</h2><p>You may have
	certain rights regarding the personally identifiable information we maintain
	about you. We offer you certain choices about what personally identifiable
	information we collect from you, how we use that information, and how we
	communicate with you. You may refrain from submitting information directly to
	us, although doing so may impact our ability to provide the products, services,
	and information you request. </p><p></p>
