        </p>
        <p>
            The Website is hosted and the Service is provided in the United States of
            America. In the performance of our Service and business operations,
            Personal Information we collect or receive may be stored or transferred
            internationally throughout our organization and to our service providers or
            agents, in accordance with applicable data privacy laws. Transfers to third
            parties are covered by the provisions in this Privacy Policy under “Notice”
            and “Choice”.
        </p>
        <p>
            We will endeavor to obtain assurances that any such service provider or
            agent will provide at least the same level of privacy protection as is
            required by this Privacy Policy and will notify us if it makes a
            determination it can no longer meet this obligation.
        </p>
        <p>
            We use model contractual clauses and other mechanisms approved by the
            European Union and Switzerland, respectively, for transfers of Personal
            Information from the European Economic Area (“<strong>EEA</strong>”) and
            Switzerland.

            Where we know that any third party to whom we have provided Personal
            Information is using or disclosing Personal Information in a manner
            contrary to this Privacy Policy, we will take reasonable steps to prevent
            or stop the use or disclosure. With respect to such onward transfers to
            agents, and to the extent we are responsible for the event, we will remain
            liable should our agents process Personal Information in a manner
            inconsistent with this Privacy Policy.

            complete, current, and otherwise reliable in relation to the purposes for
            which the information was obtained is used by us for as long as we retain
            possession of such information. Our personnel have a responsibility to

            from those countries have a right to access Personal Information about

            Information that is found to be inaccurate, incomplete or processed in a
            manner non-compliant with this Privacy Policy or applicable law, except
            where the burden or expense of providing access would be disproportionate

            law. Unless prohibited by applicable law, we reserve the right to charge a
