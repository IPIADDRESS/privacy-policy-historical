BlogRateDirectory.com Privacy Policy<br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
BlogRateDirectory.com has always protected our customer\'s privacy. BlogRateDirectory.com makes every effort to protect the privacy and confidentiality of your personal information. BlogRateDirectory.com maintains security standards to protect against the loss, misuse or alteration of the data under our control.<br>
Your personal information is not provided to third parties for their marketing purposes without your consent.<br>
This Privacy Policy describes how BlogRateDirectory.com handles the personal information BlogRateDirectory.com collects and receives through the Website. Personal information is information about you that is personally identifiable like your name, address, email address, or phone number, and that is not otherwise publicly available.<br>
This policy does not apply to the practices of companies that LiveDeal does not own or control or to people that LiveDeal does not employ or manage. By using the BlogRateDirectory.com Website, you expressly consent to our disclosure and use of your personal information as described in this Privacy Policy.<br>
Privacy Policy last updated on August 15 2007.<br>
<br>
Our Policy on Gathering Information<br>
In the course of providing service and tools to online auction users, we may obtain significant personal information from our customers, including: Personal contact information, including your name, mailing address, billing address, telephone numbers, and email addresses. We may also request online payment or credit card information to bill fees for the services we provide. We may also gain information from your interaction with BlogRateDirectory.com, including correspondence by mail or electronic mail, facsimile transmissions, telephone conversations, and personal meetings. We may also receive private information as a result of any other information you share with BlogRateDirectory.com in order to help us transact with other users, buyers or sellers showing products or services associated with BlogRateDirectory.com.<br>
At your direction, we may use this information to send you our e-mail newsletter. When you register for various services on the Website, we collect additional information from you in order to provide you with those specific services and to personalize your experience on the site. This information may also be used to contact you when necessary. You may always choose not to provide us with this information; however, this may limit our ability to provide you with a specific service. You may opt-out of receiving future mailings or services at any time. See the "Opt-Out Procedure" section below.<br>
<br>
Additional Procedures for Gathering Information<br>
<br>
Cookies<br>
BlogRateDirectory.com uses "cookies" to automatically recognize returning users. A cookie is a small file on your hard drive that allows us to display your previously defined user information when you visit the Website. Usage of a cookie does not link to any personally identifiable information while on our web site. We use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies. For the session ID cookie, once users close the browser, the cookie simply terminates. A persistent cookie is a small text file stored on the user\'s hard drive for an extended period of time. Cookies were implemented to allow user-id customization of web site information. Cookie related information is used by BlogRateDirectory.com to facilitate the user\'s transactions and to improve service and better match the user\'s needs. You may block cookies by changing the settings on your browser (contact your ISP for help), but doing so may limit the features and services contained within the Website.<br>
<br>
Log Files<br>
We use log files, as well as other data in our databases, to analyze site and user behavior, troubleshoot technical problems, resolve disputes, address complaints and prepare aggregated reports that we share with others. This includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, and number of clicks to analyze trends, administer the web site, track users\' movement in the aggregate, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use.<br>
<br>
Referral &amp; Wish List Services<br>
If a user elects to use our referral service for informing a friend about our site, we ask them for the friend\'s name and email address. BlogRateDirectory.com also uses email addressed entered by our users to share user wish lists with their chosen contacts. BlogRateDirectory.com collects the email address of your friend for the sole purpose of automatically sending the friend an email containing the user�s wish list information or inviting them to visit the site and does not store this information.<br>
<br>
Advertising<br>
We may use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our web site. These companies may use information (not including your name, address, email address or telephone number) about your visits to this and other web sites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. Third party ad servers may place or recognize a cookie and, using the cookie or otherwise, collect and use data (but not your name, address, email address or telephone number) from your visits to this and other websites to serve ads to you.<br>
<br>
Our Policy on Disclosing Your Information<br>
We do not disclose information relating to our business dealings with you except as authorized by you, as required by law or as otherwise reasonably necessary.  We may disclose such personal information as may be reasonably necessary, including in the following circumstances:<br>
      Those parties to whom you authorize us to give your information.<br>
      Those parties to whom we are permitted under the applicable laws relating to financial<br>
      matters and related services.<br>
      Those parties to whom we are required by applicable law.<br>
<br>
We retain records relating to the services we provide in order to comply with professional guidelines and to better serve your personal and business needs.  In order to protect information relating to our representation of you, we maintain physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards that comply with our professional standards. Please keep in mind that whenever you voluntarily disclose personal information online, that information can be collected and used by others. You should exercise caution in such disclosures.<br>
In addition, we may share data with any parent company, subsidiaries, JVs, other companies under a common control or acquirers. It is possible that BlogRateDirectory.com and/or any of our assets may be acquired. In such a transaction, customer information may be transferred to the acquiring entity. While we will endeavor to require the successor company to maintain this Privacy Policy, we cannot guarantee that our policy will remain in effect.<br>
<br>
Special Relationships<br>
BlogRateDirectory.com may enter into special relationships with other online auction and shopping websites to widen the array of services available to our users. On occasions when we partner with another service to bring you more comparison-shopping functionality, we do not host these pages on our own servers. In these instances, information may be collected but it is being collected by the partner and not by BlogRateDirectory.com. BlogRateDirectory.com may receive information from these partners only when it is clearly stated. Unless you give explicit permission, BlogRateDirectory.com has a strict policy against sharing or selling your personal information.<br>
<br>
Links to Other Sites<br>
The BlogRateDirectory.com Website contains links to other Websites. BlogRateDirectory.com is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of these sites. If you have concerns about how other Web sites collect and use information about you, make sure to read that site\'s own privacy policy.<br>
<br>
Changing Account Information and Preferences<br>
You can edit your BlogRateDirectory.com account information by accessing the �My Profile� option on the My BlogRateDirectory.com page of the Website. There, you may also opt-out of receiving marketing or promotional-related emails. You may also opt-out by sending an email to CustomerService@BlogRateDirectory.com.com . We reserve the right to send you certain communications relating to the LiveDeal web site, such as service announcements and administrative messages, without offering you the opportunity to opt-out of receiving them. Occasionally, we will send you emails about new services or promotions. Upon your request, we will deactivate your account, contact information, billing information and any financial information from our active databases. To make this request, email CustomerService@BlogRateDirectory.com.com . Such information will be deactivated as soon as reasonably possible based on your account activity and in accordance with our User Agreement and applicable law. We will retain in our files some personal information you have requested to edit or remove to prevent fraud, collect any fees owed, resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems, assist with any investigations, enforce our User Agreement and comply with legal requirements as is permitted by law. Therefore, you should not expect that all of your personal information will be completely removed from our databases in response to your requests. However, such personal information will be deactivated from public and user viewing and will only be available to select BlogRateDirectory.com personnel for the limited purposes described above.<br>
<br>
Opt-Out Procedure<br>
At any time, you have the ability to opt-out of receiving communications from BlogRateDirectory.com. To unsubscribe or opt-out of any BlogRateDirectory.com features, contact CustomerService@BlogRateDirectory.com.com and let us know that you would like to discontinue this service.<br>
<br>
Confidentiality and Security<br>
Your personal information is stored on BlogRateDirectory.com�s servers located in the United States. We use physical, procedural and technical safeguards to protect that information against loss or theft as well as unauthorized access and disclosure. Certain information is password-protected. Likewise, in certain areas, BlogRateDirectory.com uses certified industry-standard SSL-encryption and network firewalls to protect data transmissions and storage. Finally, all of our employees are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy practices.<br>
<br>
Your Responsibilities<br>
To help us maintain the security of your personal information, we ask that you not share your password with anyone. Sharing this information could put your personal information at risk. If you lose control of your password or suspect that someone has obtained unauthorized access to your account, immediately change your password.<br>
Remember that whenever you voluntarily disclose personal information online, (in message boards, through email, or in chat areas) that information can be collected and used by others. By disclosing personal information online, you may receive unsolicited communication from other parties in return. Be sure you exercise caution in these situations.<br>
<br>
Children<br>
Children (persons under the age of 18) are not eligible to use the web site unsupervised and we ask that children do not submit any personal information to us. If you are under the age of 18, you may use the web site only in conjunction with and under the supervision of a parent or legal guardian.<br>
<br>
Notification of Changes<br>
This policy may be revised over time as new features are added to the Website. We will post our new privacy policy, along with the date of its last revision. If you would like to receive e-mail notification of any such changes, please contact us at CustomerService@BlogRateDirectory.com.com .<br>
