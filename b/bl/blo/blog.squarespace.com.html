(collectively, the \u201CService\u201D) and you agree to be bound by the Terms of Service and this Privacy Policy. Some capitalized terms used in this Privacy Policy and not otherwise defined may be defined in the Terms of Service. This Privacy Policy only addresses activities from our servers.&amp;nbsp;</p><h3>1. INFORMATION COLLECTION &amp;amp; USE</h3><p><strong>Registration</strong></p><p>The Squarespace Service requires a login in order to provide you with a personalized account. During our account registration process, we will collect an email address, your first and last name, and a password from you. You must provide all of this information in order to obtain an account. After completing our registration form, you will receive a welcome email describing your new Squarespace account, and how to access that account. You may, at your option, also store your social media credentials as part of your account with our Service.&amp;nbsp;</p><p><strong>Communications with Squarespace</strong></p><p>We use third party service providers to assist us in managing and administering communications and emails sent to us through the Website and through some Squarespace managed sites. Any personal information disclosed through such communications will be governed by such third party vendors\u2019 privacy policy.&amp;nbsp;</p><p><strong>Account Subscriptions</strong></p><p>If you choose to continue service with Squarespace via a paid account, Squarespace will collect the following personally identifiable information from you: credit card number, credit card expiration date, and zip code, and keep this information on file in our secure server in order to process your recurring invoices. You may, at your option, also provide your company name, full billing address and phone number. This information is used to verify credit card authenticity, and process payments as per your applicable service agreement. Upon discontinuation of Squarespace service, your credit card information will be destroyed on our billing system. If we are unable to process your subscription for a given month, this information, along with your account information, may be used to contact you.&amp;nbsp;</p><p><strong>Third Party Payment Processors</strong></p><p>Squarespace uses third party payment processors to assist it in processing your personally identifiable payment information securely. Such third party processors\u2019 use of your personal information is governed by their respective privacy policies which may or may not contain privacy protections as protective as this privacy policy. Payments are currently processed and managed using the third party vendors below. We will inform you which payment processors are used when processing your payments.&amp;nbsp;</p><ul><li>Authorize.net - <a href=\&quot;http://www.authorize.net/company/privacy/\&quot; target=\&quot;_blank\&quot;>privacy policy</a></li><li>NewTek - <a href=\&quot;http://www.litle.com/about-us/privacy-policy\&quot; target=\&quot;_blank\&quot;>privacy policy</a></li><li>Litle - <a href=\&quot;http://www.litle.com/about-us/privacy-policy\&quot; target=\&quot;_blank\&quot;>privacy policy</a>\u200B</li><li>Zuora - <a href=\&quot;http://www.zuora.com/company/privacy.html\&quot; target=\&quot;_blank\&quot;>privacy policy</a></li><li>Stripe - <a href=\&quot;https://stripe.com/us/privacy\&quot; target=\&quot;_blank\&quot;>privacy policy</a>\u200B</li></ul><p><strong>Tell-A-Friend Tools</strong></p><p>Squarespace provides a number of tools that will allow you to promote your website (or articles on your website) over email. Email addresses entered into these forms are not stored in our database, but may be stored in our system logs in text format to assist us in tracking down abusive users (users flooding the system), or using these tools for spamming. We will never contact addresses logged in this manner. The email sent through any of these mechanisms is a one time email only.</p><p><strong>Hosted websites</strong></p><p>Users hosting websites with Squarespace are given tools that may ask you to optionally enter your email address when making comments on their website, or contacting them through their website. Since users on Squarespace can manipulate the HTML code on their site directly, there are opportunities available for a malicious user to inject code that would log your information before it reaches our system. In addition, once in our system, website owners will have the opportunity to review and modify any information entered into their website. Since we do not have full control over how members run their individual sites, this privacy policy does not apply to any hosted Squarespace website that you do not own. You should check that you trust the owner of a particular website before submitting personally identifiable information on that site.&amp;nbsp;</p><p>Squarespace uses the services of Peer1 Hosting for the Website and for Squarespace managed websites. Personal information hosted by or through Squarespace is subject to Peer1 Hosting\u2019s privacy policy which may or may not contain terms as protective as this privacy policy. A copy of Peer1 Hosting\u2019s privacy policy is available here.</p><p><strong>Server Logs</strong></p><p>When accessing web pages on the Website, Squarespace may log your IP address, access URL, time of access, geographic location, browser type, and referral URL in order to provide us with internal information regarding site traffic statistics. This information may also be used to identify users who are using the service for spam or other activity that is deemed in conflict with our Terms of Service. Otherwise, this information is used in the aggregate, and is never linked back to any personally identifiable information.</p><p><strong>Comments and User Content Posted to the Website</strong></p><p>If you post any Comments or User Content on the Website, you should be aware that any personally identifiable information you choose to provide there may be read, collected, or used by other users of the Website, as well as other third parties. We are not responsible for the information you choose to submit in these forums. We cannot guarantee that other users have not made copies of and/or will not use such information outside of the Website. We are not responsible for information you choose to post in this forum.&amp;nbsp;</p><p><strong>Social Media&amp;nbsp;</strong></p><p>The Website provides users the opportunity to interact and post content through various social media sites including, but not limited to, Twitter, Facebook, Google+, Instagram, Dropbox, Tumblr, foursquare, Flickr, YouTube and Vimeo. Your interactions with such tools, and any information you provide in connection with these interactions are publicly viewable outside of the Website domain. Each social media site has its own privacy policies which may be more or less protective than this Policy. If you do not wish for this information to be disclosed, then you should not use these tools. We are not responsible for information you choose to post in this forum.</p><p>Our site also includes Social Media Features, such as the Facebook button and Widgets, such as the Share this button or interactive mini-programs that run on our site. These Features may collect your IP address, which page you are visiting on our site, and may set a cookie to enable the Feature to function properly. Social Media Features and Widgets are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our Site. Your interactions with these Features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing it.</p><h3>2. USES OF INFORMATION</h3><p>Squarespace collects the aforementioned personally identifiable information in order to provide you with a service that allows you to maintain an online presence. Various features in our Website management system will, at your discretion, display your name, or adjust the date and time of events based on your locale. The Squarespace Website Manager interface will always give you an option before any piece of your personally identifiable information is presented on your website, and situations where information will be published is made clear in various spots in the interface (for example, your name is tied to welcome emails you send out from our system, and notice of this is given to you within the interface for that tool).&amp;nbsp;</p><p>Squarespace also uses information collected through its Service to send out notifications regarding service related issues (such as maintenance periods, billing problems, account expirations, and other items that may impact service). We do not send contact information unless the matter is deemed urgent, and most communication will occur through your Squarespace Website Manager interface. We also may use and disclose your information to our third party service providers in order to send you messages regarding new services or other products from Squarespace.&amp;nbsp;</p><p>Information collected through our service logs is used only to identify potential cases of abuse and establish statistical information regarding Website traffic. This statistical information is not otherwise aggregated in such a way that would identify any particular user of the system.&amp;nbsp;</p><p>Squarespace, Inc. is the sole owner of information collected on http://www.squarespace.com/. Your information is never shared, leased or given to any third parties in ways other than disclosed in this Privacy Policy.&amp;nbsp;</p><h3>3. INFORMATION SECURITY</h3><p>We store all user information in secure databases protected via a variety of industry-standard access controls. Secure passwords, SSL encryption, disk-based encryption, firewalls, and other measures are in place that helps us to protect your data. However, no company, including Squarespace, can fully eliminate security risks associated with the transmission of personal information through online transactions, and you do so at your own risk.</p><p>If you have any questions about security on the Website, you can send us a <a href=\&quot;/contact\&quot;>customer care request</a>.&amp;nbsp;</p><h3>4. ACCESS TO PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION</h3><p><strong>Changing Information</strong></p><p>All information that Squarespace stores related to your account, including any subscription billing information, is accessible through your Squarespace Website Manager interface. You may use this interface to correct, update or delete your information at any time, and we encourage you to keep this information up to date so that your customer service requests and billing processes operate efficiently. We will respond to your request to access within 5 business days.</p><p><strong>Removing Information</strong></p><p>To remove your personally identifiable information from our system, submit your account for deactivation. Your personal information will be removed immediately, though your actual login name will remain reserved on our system until re-collection. If you wish to only remove your billing subscription information, cancel your paid account. Both of these removals can be accessed through your Squarespace Website Manager interface.&amp;nbsp;</p><p><strong>Data Retention</strong></p><p>We will retain your information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you services. We will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.</p><h3>5. COMMUNICATIONS FROM SQUARESPACE, INC.</h3><p><strong>Service-related Announcements&amp;nbsp;</strong></p><p>We will send you service-related announcements on occasions when it is necessary to do so.
