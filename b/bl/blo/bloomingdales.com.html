It holds information a site may need to interact with you and personalize your experience. At bloomingdales.com, we use two kinds of cookies, session cookies and persistent cookies.</p>
                                            <p>Session cookies exist only for as long as your browser remains open. Once you exit your browser, they go away. We use session cookies to maintain information we need to have in order for you to shop at bloomingdales.com. For example, the Session_ID cookie that we ask your browser to hold retains the ID for your shopping bag. Without the Session_ID cookie, you cannot add merchandise to your bag or make any purchases.</p>
                                            <p>Persistent cookies, in contrast, last from visit to visit; they do not go away when you exit your browser. You can browse our site without accepting a persistent cookie. However, you cannot add merchandise to your bag or make any purchases. You may set your browser options to reject persistent cookies. Alternatively, you can set your browser to notify you when you receive a cookie, which provides you with the opportunity to decide whether you want to accept it or not. In many instances, the "help" button on your browser tool bar will tell you how you can take these steps.</p>
                                            <p>Cookies can be used by a web site to recognize you. But, that does not necessarily mean any personal information is stored in the cookies. At bloomingdales.com, we store no personal information about you in the cookies. Anything you choose to tell us about yourself as a registered user (like your address and e-mail address) is stored safely and separately on our secured servers.</p>
                                            <p> Bloomingdales.com uses pixels, or transparent GIF files, to help manage online advertising. These GIF files are provided by our ad management and email service partners. These files enable them to recognize a unique cookie on your Web browser, which in turn enables us to learn which advertisements bring users to our website. The cookie was placed by us, or by another advertiser who works with these partners. The information that we collect and  share is anonymous and not personally identifiable. It does not contain your name, address, telephone number, or email address.</p>

To try to prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the correct use of information, we have put in place the appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online.</p>
                                            <p>To the extent customer information is maintained, it is located on a secured server behind a firewall; it is not directly connected to the internet. The firewall meets recognized industry standards.</p>
                                            <p>Encryption is a process by which a message or information is scrambled while it is in transit to bloomingdales.com. It is based on a key that has two different parts, public and private. The public part of the key is distributed to those with whom you want to communicate. The private part is for the recipient's use only. So long as you use a browser that allows for encryption, when you send personal information to us, you use a public key to encrypt your personal information. If your information is intercepted during the transmission, it is scrambled and very difficult to decrypt. Once we receive your encrypted personal information, we use the private part of our key to decode it.</p>
