Personal information is any information about you that is personally identifiable, such as your name, address, email address or phone number, third-party sign-in information (e.g. Facebook Connect, if applicable), and any other information that is not otherwise publicly available. In addition, if you send email invitations to friends or family to join your Bloomz network, those email addresses are, in some instances, also collected. In addition, there is other information that is stored in our service when either parents or teachers use our apps, including but not limited to: School and class information, including name and address, the student(s) name(s) or age, as well as the information sent over the service, including messages, announcements, images, events and other.</p>

A session cookie disappears after you close your browser. A persistent cookie remains after you close your browser and may be used by your browser on subsequent visits. Like many services, we use these technologies to tailor the Service for you, and to help the Service work better for you - for example, for authentication, security and site integrity, localization, performance analytics, and other features and services.  It is possible to delete cookies or prevent cookies from being used in your browser by turning the feature off. If you do so, you may not be able to use features of our service to their full.</p>

                        <p>Providing a great experience is our outmost priority, but sometimes doing it all on our own is really hard, so we work with third party vendors, service providers, and other partners to help us provide the Service by performing tasks on our behalf.  We may need to share or provide information (including personal information) to them to help them perform these business functions, for example sending emails on our behalf, database management services, database hosting, providing customer support software, and security. These service providers do not have the right to use your personal information we share with them beyond what is necessary to assist us. Additionally, these service providers must adhere to confidentiality and security obligations in a way that is consistent with this Privacy Policy.</p>
                        <p>We may use third-party service providers to serve ads on our behalf across the Internet and on our Apps. They may collect anonymous information about your visits to our Apps and your interaction with our services. They may also use information about your visits to our Apps and other sites and mobile applications to target ads for products and services. For instance, they may collect web log data from you (such as IP address and information about your browser or operating system) or place or recognize a unique cookie on your browser to enable you to receive customized ads. Through this process, demographic or other interest data may be associated with your browser or device <b>in a non-personally identifiable manner</b>. No personally identifiable information is collected in this process. They do not know the name, address, email address, phone number or any personally identifiable information about the user.</p>
                        <p>We also work with third party service providers to monitor certain pages of our Apps for such purposes as reporting traffic and other advertising statistics. Where authorized by us, these third party providers may use cookies and/or other monitoring technologies to compile anonymous statistics about our visitors. No personally identifiable information is transferred to these third party service providers. This information is collected directly by the third party, and Bloomz does not participate in that data transmission. Information collected by third parties in this manner is subject to that third party's own data collection, use, and disclosure policies.</p>

Even when we talk to you outside of our service, we don't share any personally identifiable information.</p>

                        <p>We use your information for the following general purposes: to operate, maintain, and improve our services, to contact you, for internal business purposes, and to customize any advertising and content you see in our apps. We use third party information you provide to us solely to provide services you specifically request.</p>
                        <p>We will also use all of the information that you provide and that we collect to understand and analyze the usages trends and preferences of our users, to improve our product, and to create new features and functionality. We may use your information to personalize our services, such as remembering your information so that you will not have to re-enter it during your visit or the next time you visit the Apps;  provide customized advertisements and offer you other relevant products, content, and information; monitor and analyze the effectiveness of our services and third party marketing activities; monitor aggregate site usage metrics such as total number of visitors and pages viewed; and track your entries, submissions, and status in any promotions or other activities.</p>
                        <p>We will never use students’ personally identifiable information, or collect, use, or share such information for any purposes beyond the authorized educational or school purposes, or as explicitly authorized by the student or parent. We will never target advertisements to students or sell students’ personally identifiable information to third parties for any purpose.</p>
                        <p>When you invite recipients to join our service, we may contact them regarding our product and Service, using the appropriate form of communication. If they would prefer not to receive our communications, they may opt-out using the "Unsubscribe" or "STOP" instructions contained in those communications.  Rest assured that we will not use the email addresses that you enter through email invitations, or your address books through any of our Apps to send marketing communications to your friends and family, unless they sign up for an account on their own and accept our terms and services.</p>
                        <p>When a teacher invites parents to join their classroom on Bloomz via our SmartInvite feature in our app, the emails entered in the invitation will automatically be opted-in to classroom communications via email.  We do this to ensure parents who don't know how to create an account don't miss on important updates from the teacher.  Recipients can always opt-out by using the "Unsubscribe" instructions in those communications.</p>
                        <p>Your accounts also contain a calendar where you can store events and other key dates and details about friends and family. We may send you email reminders of the personalized dates you have entered in this calendar. You may decline to share certain personally identifiable information with us, in which case we may not be able to provide to you some of the features and functionality of the Service. You may update or correct your profile information and preferences at any time by accessing your account preferences page through the Service. Please note that while your changes are reflected promptly in active user databases, we may retain all information you submit for a variety of purposes, including backups and archiving, prevention of fraud and abuse, and analytics.</p>

The Rule also applies to a general audience site that knows it's collecting personal information from kids that age.  Because Bloomz doesn't collect information from children under 13, other than as previously stated, and any information related to students in Bloomz is knowingly entered by parents or by teachers with permission of the parents, Bloomz is COPPA compliant.</p>
