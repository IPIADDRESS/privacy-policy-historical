  <div style="margin-top: 8px;">
        Blockbuster may use Personal Information collected online in the following ways:
        <ul><li>
            to develop and improve the products, benefits and services We or carefully selected business partners offer to Our
            registered users and other users of the Site;
          </li><li>to enable users  to become registered users of the Site;</li><li>for processing customer orders;</li><li>
            for Site administration and development (for example to analyse usage trends
            and to make improvements to the Site in accordance with such usage trends);
          </li><li>for processing job applications submitted online to Us;</li><li>
            to contact you by post and email, or by SMS if you are a member of our Text Club, to inform you about any of Our products
            and services (including those of selected business partners) that We think may be of interest. We will not do this without having
            your prior permission. If at any time you subsequently wish to discontinue receiving post or emails about Our products and services
            please indicate this by checking the relevant checkboxes within the My Details sections of the Site. If you no longer wish to receive
            promotional communications by SMS, you should withdraw your membership of the Text Club in accordance with the Text Club Terms and
            Conditions. From time to time we may also wish to contact you by telephone. In the event that we do so we shall always respect any
            request you make to decline such telephone marketing in the future;
          </li><li>
            to contact you, where you have authorised Us to do so, when you have won a competition on the Site or to provide you with a
            email newsletter; and
          </li><li>
            in assessing your request for goods or services for the purposes of the prevention and detection of fraud. One of the purposes
            for which We may disclose your address and postcode details is to check them against the IMRG Security Alert or any other fraud
            prevention scheme.
          </li></ul>

        not match the marketing preferences that you have indicated through this website. However, We will take steps to correct as promptly as
        reasonably possible any inconsistencies in this regard that you bring to Our attention.
        <br><br>
			  We may also, in the event that We undergo a re-organisation of Our corporate group or sell any part of Blockbuster, transfer your 
				Personal Information to the new owner of Blockbuster if you are a registered user of the services on the Site.
