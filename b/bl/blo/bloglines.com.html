<h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
Respecting users' privacy is a key value for Bloglines&nbsp;and it's parent
company&nbsp;Ask Jeeves, Inc. As of July 19, 2005, Ask Jeeves has become a
wholly-owned subsidiary of <a href="http://www.iac.com/">IAC/InterActiveCorp</a>
(NASDAQ: IACI), and thus, IAC now controls Bloglines’ privacy practices.
<p>
IAC's brands include some of the best companies on the Internet, and we
are excited by the additional resources that IAC will be able to provide to
Bloglines users. IAC has informed us that it does not plan to make any
immediate changes to Bloglines' privacy practices. This means that the
<a href="http://www.bloglines.com/about/privacy">Bloglines’ privacy policy</a>
will continue to remain in place; and IAC will treat users' personal
information with the same respect, and subject to the same constraints, as
apply under the current policy. If in the future IAC decides to revise
Bloglines' privacy practices, those changes will be announced in the manner
required by the privacy policy. To learn about personal information Bloglines
collects and how it may be used, please read
<a href="http://www.bloglines.com/about/privacy">Bloglines’ privacy policy.</a>
