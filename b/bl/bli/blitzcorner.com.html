Users who would like to participate in our community shall create their own profiles within the Network. Creation of these profiles requires providing certain personal information some of which will be shared with other members and visitors within our community in order to allow such users to identify each other and expand their personal network. BlitzCorner members are entitled to edit or remove their profile information at any time.</p>
    <p>The information we learn from our visitors and customers helps us personalize and continually improve our services to you. We collect information in the following ways:</p>
    <p>&nbsp;1.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="corpPolicyUnderline">Information You Give Us</span>.
