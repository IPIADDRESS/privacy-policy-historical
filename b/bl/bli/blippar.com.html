<p style="text-align: center;" class="c2"><strong>Blippar Privacy Policy</strong></p>

<p align="center"><strong>Last modified: 5<sup>th</sup> December 2016</strong></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Blippar is the world's first visual discovery browser, using augmented reality, artificial intelligence and computer vision technology to transform how you connect with the world.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The Blippar app uses the camera on your smartphone, whilst the app is enabled, to recognise images through the camera and show on-screen dynamic content on top of what you see 'in the real world' – what the technology industry calls 'augmented reality'.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">We use artificial intelligence, computer vision technology and other functionality – including, where you choose to enable it, facial recognition technology – to make this happen. &nbsp;Scanning an item or a person with your mobile device is something we call 'blipping' and the online content we show you around that item or person is something we call 'blipp'.&nbsp;&nbsp; You can find out more about our app and how it works at <a href="https://blippar.com/en/resources/faq/">https://blippar.com/en/resources/faq/</a> &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">As part of our offering to other businesses, we enable them to offer blipp and augmented reality content as part of their advertising and marketing campaigns.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">At Blippar we are working to build a service which is useful and fun for our users and in doing that we are absolutely committed to your privacy.&nbsp; The Blippar app, the Blippar websites and related APIs and tools covered by this policy are constantly evolving as we add new features to improve your experience, but our users' privacy remains at the heart of what we do. As the Blippar app changes, so might the information we use and how we use it.&nbsp;&nbsp; We encourage users to consult this policy whilst using Blippar and we will notify material changes to it through the Blippar app.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The technology behind Blippar is complex, and you can do different things using the Blippar app, the Blippar websites and related APIs and tools, so we have tried hard to explain the ways we collect and use your data in a straightforward way so you know what is going on.&nbsp; &nbsp;We may provide sets of FAQs on how Blippar works and for specific products and features to help you understand them better.&nbsp; &nbsp;We welcome any feedback or questions you may have on privacy matters and how we use your data – please contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@blippar.com">privacy@blippar.com</a></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Who we are</strong></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Blippar is a technology business headquartered in London, UK, with local subsidiary companies in various countries around the world.&nbsp;&nbsp; For the purposes of European data protection law, Blippar.Com Limited (registered in England and Wales, number 07446749) is the ultimate data controller for personal data collected, processed and used through the app.&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>What this document tells you</strong></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">When you use the Blippar app, websites, APIs, tools and any other services we may make available, you will share some information with us. When we talk about the Blippar "app" or "service", we mean all the websites, APIs, tools and other services.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">This policy is designed to explain to you what information about you Blippar collects in providing the Blippar app and service, how that information is used and shared and how you can control what happens with that information.&nbsp;</p>

<h3 style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>What information we collect </strong></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">When you use the Blippar app or visit our websites we receive personal information about you which you choose to give us. For example, when you download the Blippar app and want to use our Face Profile tool, we ask you to register some basic information with us so we can provide our service to you, including your first name and surname, your email address and, with your consent, your location (both generally in respect of your locale, e.g. the UK and specifically, exact latitude and longitude coordinates) and confirmation that you are over 16 years old. You don’t have to create a Face Profile in order to use the Blippar app and services.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">We also collect some information about you as you use the Blippar app including:</p>

<ul>
	<li style="text-align: justify;">digital images of the objects and people you are 'blipping'.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
	<li style="text-align: justify;">the blipp and other online content you are shown and link to and your interests and preferences that your blipp and online content viewed suggest;</li>
	<li style="text-align: justify;">a unique user ID, which we assign to you, against which we maintain data about you and your use of the Blippar app</li>
	<li style="text-align: justify;">if you choose to create a Face Profile through the Blippar app, we will collect your face ‘signature’; if you then choose to make this public then – when someone points a phone at your face or an image of it, with the Blippar app enabled – it will search against our database of facial signatures (see section on <a href="http://blippar.com/en/app/privacy#facereco"><strong>facial recognition</strong></a> here for more detail) and will also store these scanned images that have been taken of you</li>
	<li style="text-align: justify;">certain content that you have chosen to associate with your Face Profile, that is specific to you (we may also ask your permission to review third party data about you, for example your Twitter or Facebook feeds, so that you can create an even more individual Face Profile)</li>
	<li style="text-align: justify;">certain mobile network and device identifiers to help us provide our services including the IP address that your internet network provider may allocate to your mobile or other internet enabled device</li>
</ul>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Blippar also uses cookies. Please see <a href="http://blippar.com/en/app/privacy/#cookies"><strong>cookies</strong></a> section below for details and collects IP addresses from visitors to our app and websites.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>How we use your information </strong></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">We use your personal information mainly to provide, monitor and improve the Blippar app, website, services and the technology which supports them and to provide you with a great, personalised experience.&nbsp;&nbsp; We occasionally will use your information to contact you, for instance if you send us requests or ask us questions about Blippar or if there are technical or operational issues or updates which we think our users need to know about. &nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">We provide augmented reality services to brands so that their marketing materials are blippable, showing users augmented reality content when they blipp the materials (like a magazine advert or packaging).&nbsp; Where we do this, we also report to our clients on an aggregated basis (so never revealing who you are), where users accessing their blippable content are located, how long they spent interacting with the client's Blippar content or our app generally and how they use the Blippar app.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">We also disclose information in aggregate (so that no individuals are identified) to third parties for marketing and strategic development purposes.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;" id="facereco"><strong>This section applies to Facial recognition &amp; Face Profiles</strong></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">We understand that engaging with facial recognition technology may be a new experience for you. At Blippar, we have worked hard to ensure that facial recognition is simple, fun and safe and that it puts the user in control.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Face Profiles and facial recognition is intended for users who are at least 16 years old</em></strong>.&nbsp; If you are aged under 16, please get your parent/guardian's permission before you provide any personal information to Blippar. Users without this consent are not allowed to provide us with personal information.&nbsp;&nbsp; By using the Face Profile tool, you are representing to us that you are 16 or over or have the specific consent of your parent or guardian to use Blippar, including in respect of facial recognition.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Creating Face Profiles</em></strong></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">A Face Profile is an augmented reality profile of someone’s face. You decide whether you want Blippar to scan your face in order to create what we call a 'Face Profile'. You can activate a scan of your face by activating the Face Profile setting and pointing the phone camera at your face; you then have to "join the dots" by using your nose to follow the dot around the screen so the camera sees your face from different angles. &nbsp;That process is called the ‘Blippar star’. This is important as it creates your unique ‘face signature’, which is essentially a set of measurements of your face features, which the Blippar app can then use to recognise as you.&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The great advantage about this process is that it makes it hard for people to create a Face Profile using someone else's image, because the process takes a while and requires movement – so a single photo with a smartphone cannot be used to create a Face Profile.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Once this is done, you can then complete your Face Profile by adding content about you which you want other users to see when they blipp you: you can link your profile to your other social media accounts, you can add photos, videos, your mood at the time using icons and 3D avatars and you can update this constantly.&nbsp;&nbsp; We will keep adding new kinds of content to add to your Face Profile so watch this space!&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The Face Profile is just a fun way to express yourself to other Blippar users – the content appears to other users when they blipp you or an image of you as a 'halo' of bubbles around your face.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>How are facial signatures and Face Profiles used?</em></strong></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Facial recognition is enabled in the Blippar app.&nbsp;&nbsp; This means that when the app is on, it recognises when your camera is pointed at a human face or an image of a face. The app then checks whether there is a recognized Face Profile (this may be a facial signature which matches a face that someone has specifically created or, for public figures, from images drawn from Blipparsphere (Blippar’s knowledge graph which pulls information from publicly available sources); if there is, the Face Profile for that user or public figure has augmented reality bubbles around the image of their face on your phone screen.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>What if you don’t have a Face Profile?</em></strong></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">If the person being blipped is not a Blippar user or is a Blippar user but does not have a Face Profile, the app will not display their Face Profile (because they don't have one) and a ‘famous’ lookalike will be shown instead, based on the public figure our platform thinks they most closely resemble.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">If you blipp a public figure in real life or an image of them from a newspaper or computer screen, you will see their Blippar Face Profile (if they have created one) and, if they haven't, you will see bubbles of online content which relates to them and which has been discovered in our extensive knowledge graph. To do this, we have created simple facial signatures for high-profile public figures in the public eye from photographs which are generally available online.&nbsp; We think this offers a fun way to add to their online engagement with fans!&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">We also allow you to blipp yourself and your friends to find your "famous lookalike" based on your facial signature just for fun, and upload your lookalike to your Face Profile.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We plan to add more fun ways for you to use your Face Profile and will launch them in the future and, where they involve using your information in different ways from what we have explained here, we will update this policy and explain how it all works.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Who can see my Face Profile?</em></strong></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Everyone who uses Blippar if they blipp you in person, or a photograph of you and you have consented to your Face Profile being public.&nbsp;&nbsp; You can make your Face Profile private when you first create it and it any time afterwards.&nbsp;&nbsp; A private Face Profile can only be seen by you.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">We do not allow users to search the database of facial signatures and images to find someone they want to, and we do not apart from in very limited circumstances share facial signatures and images with any third party – see <a href="http://blippar.com/en/app/privacy/#facedata"><em>Will you share my facial data</em>?</a></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Other users can only see your Face Profile by blipping you in person or by blipping an image they have of you – and users cannot blipp images stored on the same phone they blipp with.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>How are facial signatures stored?</em></strong></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">To make Face Profiles and related facial recognition services work, we retain the facial images you take of your face when creating a Face profile, and of public figures from online sources, and the facial signatures we create from them all on secure Amazon Web Services (“AWS”) data centres in the United States.&nbsp;&nbsp; We need to do this in order for the app to recognise a face as belonging to a user with a Face Profile and for the service to work.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>What control do I have other my facial signature and Face Profile?</em></strong></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">A Face Profile of a user is only created if the user wants to create one.&nbsp;&nbsp; We do create simple facial signatures from publicly available online images of public figures, and use them to present generic online information relating to them, or their own Blippar Face Profile if they have created one.&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">You can delete your Face Profile, and with it the facial signatures relating to you, through the profile settings section in settings in the Blippar app.&nbsp;&nbsp; You change your Face Profile from public (which means your Face Profile is discoverable by any Blippar user who blipp you or a photo of you) to private (visible only to you) and the other way around any time in the profile settings of the app.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Public figures can request to switch off the facial recognition feature by emailing us at <a href="mailto:privacy@blippar.com">privacy@blippar.com</a> and we will remove the facial recognition piece so their Blipparsphere profile does not come up when they are blipped. The information associated with them will stay in the knowledge graph.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">If you have any concerns about your Face Profile or data that we hold about you then please contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@blippar.com"><em>privacy@blippar.com</em></a></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;" id="facedata"><strong><em>Will Blippar share my facial data?</em></strong></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">We will not share your facial signatures or Face Profiles with our clients or third parties, other than when making the Face Profiles visible to other users when your Face Profile is set to public.&nbsp;&nbsp; We take keeping this biometric data secure extremely seriously and use AWS, one of the most secure data centres in the world.&nbsp; The only exception to this is where there are legal reasons for us to disclose – see section entitled <a href="http://blippar.com/en/app/privacy/#thirdpartylegal"><strong>With third parties for legal reasons</strong></a> for further detail.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">We will collect aggregated statistics which are not unique to you and cannot identify you about how our users or categories of users are interacting with Face Profiles and other services we offer using facial recognition.&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>This Section Has General Information About Your Personal Information </strong></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Where we store your information</strong></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The information we collect in relation to you is stored on data centres operated by our third party providers.&nbsp; The data centres are currently based in the United States and you consent to the hosting of your personal information in the USA.&nbsp;&nbsp; The USA has different regulations in relation to personal information, including in relation to rights of access by law enforcement authorities,</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Can I find out what personal information Blippar holds about me?</strong></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">You have the right to request a copy of the personal information Blippar holds about you and to have any inaccuracies corrected. We need to establish your identity as we do not want to release information to the wrong person, so we may ask for documents that prove your identity. Please address requests and questions about this to <a href="mailto:privacy@blippar.com"><em>privacy@blippar.com</em></a></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>How we share your information</strong></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">We may share information about you in the following ways:</p>

<ul>
	<li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>With other Blippar users</strong>. We may share the following information with other users:</li>
	<li style="text-align: justify;">Information about you, such as your username and name as you have provided it with other users but we will not share your contact details with them</li>
	<li style="text-align: justify;">Your Face Profile and the content you have posted in it, where your Face Profile is in public mode</li>
	<li style="text-align: justify;">Information about how you have interacted with the Blippar app, based on the number of blipps you do and how many users blipp your face, and celebrity users are able to view their top fans based on how many times users have blipped the celebrity.</li>
	<li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>With third parties.</strong> We may share your information with the following third parties:
	<ul>
		<li>With organisations who provide services or technology to us.&nbsp; See here in respect of facial data specifically <a href="http://blippar.com/en/app/privacy/#facedata"><em>Will Blippar share my facial data?</em></a> We may share information about you with service providers who perform services on our behalf – for instance our data centre providers who host the Blippar technology and data and partners that provide services to us.</li>
		<li>We provide augmented reality services to brands so that their marketing materials are blippable, showing users augmented reality content when they blipp the materials (like a newspaper ad).&nbsp; Where we do this, we also report to our clients on an aggregated basis (so never revealing who you are) where users accessing their blippable content are located, how long they spent interacting with the client's Blippar content or our app generally and how they use the Blippar app.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li style="text-align: justify;">We also disclose information in aggregate (so that no individuals are identified) to third parties for marketing and strategic development purposes.</li>
	<li style="text-align: justify;" id="thirdpartylegal"><strong>With third parties for legal reasons.</strong>&nbsp; We may share information about you if we believe that disclosing the information is needed to:
	<ul>
		<li>comply with any valid legal process, governmental request, or applicable law, rule, or regulation</li>
		<li>investigate, remedy, or enforce potential breaches of our Terms of Use.</li>
		<li>protect the rights, property, and safety of us, our users, or others.</li>
		<li>detect and resolve any fraud or security concerns.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>With our affiliates.</strong> We may share information with entities within the Blippar family of companies</li>
	<li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>With third parties if Blippar is acquired or its legal structure undergoes a reorganisation or all or a big chunk of our business is transferred to another company or companies.</strong> In that circumstance we may share your information with that company before and after the transaction closes so that we can still provide you with a great service.</li>
</ul>

<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>How old do I have to be to use Blippar?</strong></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Blippar’s services are intended for users who are at least 13 years old (other than Face Profiles which is 16 years old and above).&nbsp; If you are aged under 13, please get your parent/guardian's permission before you provide any personal information to Blippar. Users without this consent are not allowed to provide us with personal information.&nbsp;&nbsp; By using the Blippar app, you are representing to us that you are 13 or over or have the specific consent of your parent or guardian to use Blippar, including in respect of facial recognition (16 years old or above).</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>How long will Blippar keep my personal information? </strong></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">We will hold your personal information on our systems for as long as is necessary to provide access to our app and websites.&nbsp; Through the settings on the app, you can have all account data deleted – if you do this a red flag goes on the database and, while Blippar cannot use the personal information, it stays on the system for a period for administration purposes before being deleted automatically.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">If we are subject to a legally binding requirement to retain user information for a specific period, this may (subject to the law in question) override your ability to require deletion.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Please remember that other Blippar users may have content and information you have made available through Blippar, for instance through screen shots or other image capture and we do not control how they use or how long they keep that content.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;" id="cookies"><strong>Web browser cookies</strong></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>What is a cookie?</em></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">A cookie is a small amount of data, which often includes a unique identifier that is sent to your computer, tablet or mobile phone web browser from a websites’ computer and is stored on your computer, table or mobile phone web browser.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>How does Blippar use cookies?</em></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">In general terms, Blippar only uses cookies to record information about your preferences, how you prefer to use our websites and our services. They allow us to tailor our app, websites and our other services to your interests.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Information supplied by cookies can help us to analyse the profile of visitors to our app and website and users of our other services and help us to provide you with a better user experience.&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Third party cookies</em></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">We use analytics cookies and mobile device equivalents served by our third party providers to analyse how users use our app and websites and report back to us. This helps us work out what elements of the app and websites are working and helps us improve them. In the future, we may have digital advertising partners who may use cookies, mobile equivalents and other technologies to collect information to support the delivery of interest-based advertising to users. We will ensure you are properly notified including through updates to this policy before that happens.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Third Party Cookies in embedded content on Blippar pages</em></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Please note that during your visits to our websites you may notice some cookies that are not related to Blippar or Blippar’s partners. When you visit a page with content embedded from, for example, YouTube or Flickr, you may be presented with cookies from these websites (“Third Party Websites”). Blippar does not control the dissemination of these cookies. You should check the Third Party Websites for more information about these.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Blippar cookies and how to reject cookies</em></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">If you wish to control what cookies are set on your device through our app, websites or other services then you can by changing the settings on your personal computer or mobile device web browser. It is important to note that if you change your settings and block certain cookies, this means that certain personalised features and other functionality cannot then be provided to you and accordingly you may not be able to take full advantage of all of the app, websites or our other services features.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Other information collected from web browsers</em></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Your web browser may also provide Blippar with information about your device, such an IP address and details about the browser that you are using. It may also provide Blippar with access to details of your personal computer or mobile device’s location.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Mobile devices</strong></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">When you download or use the app on your mobile device, information may be accessed from or stored to your mobile device. This is used in a similar way to a web browser cookie, such as by enabling the apps to ‘remember’ you or provide you with the content you have requested.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Your web browser on your device or your mobile device’s operating system may also provide Blippar with information about your mobile device, such as a device identifier or IP address. Device identifiers may be collected automatically, such as the device ID, IP address and apps ID (a unique identifier relating to the particular copy of the Apps you are running). In the future we may use mobile device identifiers for advertising use which perform a similar role to cookies, like the IDFA used by Apple devices and the Advertising ID used by Android devices.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Changes to Blippar's Privacy Policy</strong></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time so please check from time to time. Major changes to the data we collect or how we use and share it will be notified through the Blippar app. The date of the most recent revisions will appear at the beginning of this policy. If you do not agree to these changes, please do not continue to use the apps, websites or our other services to submit personal information to Blippar.</p>
