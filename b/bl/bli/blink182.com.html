  <br><br><h1>Cookies</h1>
    "Cookie" is the term we use for a text file that is stored on the database of your computer.  Nearly all modern websites use cookies to enhance your browsing experience and provide more streamlined interactivity.  Cookies are used to send information to your Internet browser from a web server. These little bits of information are stored on your computer's hard drive. We use the information collected by cookies to determine which parts of our website are visited most often. They are also used to figure out where on our site you may be experiencing technical difficulties.<br>
    <br>
    Our goal is to improve the quality of our website, tailor our products and services to suit your personal interests, track and/or analyze visiting patterns and resolve difficulties you may encounter while on our site.<br>
    <br>
    <h1>Online Contests</h1>
    Modlife offers a variety of fun and exciting online contests. Most of these contests are open to U.S. residents 13 years of age and older. <strong>If you are a teen under 16 years of age, it is absolutely necessary to obtain your parent or guardian's permission before providing any personal information.</strong><br>
    <br>
    Third Party Advertising The ads appearing on modlife.com are delivered to users by our web advertising partners.  Information about users' visit to modlife.com, such as number of times they have viewed an ad (but not user name, address, or other personal information), is used to serve ads to users on our website.  This Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies by Modlife only and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers. <p></p>
  <br><br><h1>Use of IP Addresses</h1>
    An IP address is a computer identification number that is used any time your computer is connected to the Internet.  Web serves, the computers that "serve up" web pages, identify your computer by its IP address.  Modlife collects IP addresses for the purposes of system administration and to audit the use of our website.  When visitors request pages from our website, our servers log the visitors' IP addresses.  WE do not link IP addresses to anything personally identifiable, which means that a visitor's session on our website will be logged, but the user remains anonymous to us.  WE can and will use IP addresses to identify a user when we feel it is necessary to enforce compliance with our Terms of Use, to protect our services, site, customers or others.<p></p>
  <br><br><h1>Security</h1>
    Modlife takes every precaution to protect our users' information.  When users submit sensitive information via modlife.com, their information is protected both online and off-line.<br>
    <br>
    Your personal information is contained behind secured networks and is only accessible by a limited number of employees who have special access rights to such systems.  Please be aware, however, that no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.  As a result, while we strive to protect your personal information, Modlife cannot insure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us or from our online products or services.  Once we receive your transmission, we make our best effort to ensure its security on our systems.<p></p>
  <br><br><h1>Children</h1>
    We do not intentionally collect information from children under 13 years of age. If you are a parent and you think we have inadvertently collected such information from your child, you may e-mail us at info@modlife.com. <p></p>
  <br><br><h1>Fair Credit Billing Act</h1>
    The Fair Credit Billing Act was passed by Congress in 1975. This Act prohibits your bank or credit card processor from holding you liable for more than $50 on fraudulent charges made to your credit card. If you are held liable for this charge, Modlife will reimburse you the $50.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>In Summary</strong><br>
Modlife is committed to protecting your privacy.  We use the information we collect on the site to service you and to enhance your overall experience.  We do not sell, trade, or rent your personal information to others.<br>
    <br>
