    <h2>General Terms and Conditions Blinkist</h2>


    <p><strong>Effective on 2015-1-1</strong></p>

    <h3>1. Subject and Scope of the General Terms and Conditions</h3>

    <h4>1.1</h4>

    <p>Blinks Labs GmbH, Wiener Straße 35, 10999 Berlin, Germany (thereafter “Blinkist”) operates a platform for mobile
      reading on the internet portals http://www.blinkist.com, http://www.blinkist.de and other websites as well as via
      mobile applications - so called “Apps” - (thereafter platform). Within this scope, Blinkist’s authors will
      summarize the essential statements and contents of nonfiction books on a few pages in a concise manner. This
      enables you to comprehend the most important information of a nonfiction book on your PC or mobile device within
      the shortest amount of time. </p>

    <h4>1.2</h4>

    <p>Use of the platform (including Apps) shall be exclusively subject to the following general terms and
      conditions.</p>

    <h4>1.3</h4>

    <p>No special contractual text is intended for the contract regarding platform use. The content of the contract
      concluded between you and Blinkist follows these general terms and conditions as well as the information provided
      during the process of registration (cf. cipher 3.) as well as during contracting of a fee-based subscription (
      cipher 5) that will be saved by Blinkist and available at any time in your user account.</p>

    <h4>1.4</h4>

    <p>By registering and/or using the Blinkist services, you accept the use and application of these terms and
      conditions.</p>

    <h4>1.5</h4>

    <p>Blinkist shall retain the right to change individual clauses with effect for the future. If we do not obtain
      your specific consent for a terms and conditions amendment, you will be timely informed of any changes to the
      terms and conditions (at least four weeks prior to the effective date of the amended terms). For this purpose,
      Blinkist will send you the new version of the terms and conditions to the email address you provided during
      registration. In this context, Blinkist will notify you explicitly regarding the opportunity and objection period
      against the changes as well as about the consequences of an omitted objection.</p>

    <h4>1.6</h4>

    <p>If you do not object to the changes within four weeks after the effective date of the changed user conditions,
      the changed user conditions shall be deemed accepted. The period shall start with the day that it is communicated
      to you via email as the effective date of change.</p>

    <h4>1.7</h4>

    <p>In the event that you object the changes, Blinkist shall be entitled to terminate the user contract and delete
      your user account, under consideration of your interests if continuing of the contractual relationship under the
      scope of the current terms and conditions is not possible or unreasonable for Blinkist, effective from the date
      the changed user terms come into force.</p>

    <h3>4. Subscription to Subscription Access</h3>

    <h4>4.1</h4>

    <p>There is a fee-based subscription available (“Subscription Access”) so that you can use the full scope of
      Blinkist’s services. The subscription can be entered into for different periods which are presented to you in
      the order options.</p>

    <h4>4.2</h4>

    <p>Blinkist’s subscription accesses are fee-based and advertisement-free subscriptions which enable you to access a
      set of our content and features through our mobile and web based applications, depending on the subscription
      tier you’ve purchased. We offer two subscription tiers with the following service levels:</p>

    <p>Blinkist Plus gives you unlimited reading access to all of our existing books and new releases and lets you make
      as many highlights / textmarkers as you want. </p>

    <p>Blinkist Premium contains all the services of Blinkist Plus, but in addition gives you unlimited access to our
      Audio summaries (“listening access”) and lets you use our Send-to-Kindle and Evernote-Sync features.</p>

    <p>The access to our library persists for the subscription period.</p>

    <h4>4.3</h4>

    <p>To become the holder of a Blinkist account with subscription access you will have to register with your user
      data, submit your credit card data and confirm your subscription by clicking the button “subscribe for xx€”.
      You will receive a subscription confirmation email as soon as you have done this. Your subscription starts on
      this day. Please read our data protection notification for information regarding gathering, using and processing
      of your data.</p>

    <h4>4.4</h4>

    <p>You can also subscribe via In-App-Purchase via iOS- or Android-Apps. For this purpose, you will have to choose
      the desired option on the subscription screen of the App, whereupon a pop-up will appear in which you have to
      enter your Apple- / Google-Play-password. As soon as you have done this, another pop-up will appear in which you
      have to confirm the subscription purchase again. You may still cancel the process at this stage.</p>

    <h3>5.&nbsp;Trials/Test Periods</h3>

    <h4>5.1</h4>

    <p>Blinkist will occasionally offer new users the use of the subscription access for trial purposes for a certain
      time free-of-charge (so called “trial”). Blinkist determines at its own discretion if you can participate in the
      trial. Blinkist shall have the right to stop or change a free trial at any time without prior notification or
      termination period if good cause is present.</p>

    <h4>5.2</h4>

    <p>Participation in certain trials might only be possible if you enter your payment data during trial registration.
      In such event, we will need your consent at the beginning of the trial that your free access will be switched to
      a fee-based subscription access on the day after your trial expired (cipher 4.). In this event your subscription
      will subsequently renew itself depending on the term you’ve committed to when accepting the trial access and can
      be terminated until one day before the subscription is set to renew (cipher 8.3).</p>

    <h4>5.3</h4>

    <p>If you do not want the subscription service in an event of cipher 5.2 and the corresponding charges, you will
      have to terminate the subscription access provided within the trial prior to the trial expiry
      (e.g. conveniently via your Blinkist Account Settings).</p>

    <h3>6.&nbsp;Revocation Right</h3>

    <p>If you are a consumer (meaning an individual making the order for a purpose that is not for commercial or
      self-employed activity), the following revocation right shall apply for using Blinkist regarding conclusion
      of fee-based subscriptions as well as for the purchase of codes or download bundles:</p>
