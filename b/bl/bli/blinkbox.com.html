        <li>We reserve the right to conduct a security review at any time to validate your identity,
            age, the registration data provided by you and to verify your use of the blinkBox
            Services for potential breach of the Terms and Conditions and of applicable law.
            By accepting the Terms and Conditions, you authorise us, our staff, affiliates,
            subsidiaries, agents and suppliers to use your Personal Information and to disclose
            your Personal Information to third parties for the purposes of validating the information
            you provide to us in the course of using the blinkBox Services, including, where
            necessary, the transfer of information outside of your country. Security reviews
            may include verifying the information you provide against third-party databases.
            In addition, to facilitate these security reviews, you agree to provide such information
            or documentation as we may request.</li>
        <li><em>5.1 Security</em>
            <ul>
                <li>We store all of the Personal Information we receive directly from you and use reasonable
                    measures to protect all Personal Information that is stored within our database.
                    We also take steps to ensure that our agents, affiliates and suppliers also employ
                    adequate levels of security. For any additional information about the security measures
                    we employ please email us.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><em>5.2 Children</em>
            <ul>
                <li>The blinkBox Services are not intended for or directed at persons under the age
                    of 13 (or the lawful age in the relevant user's respective jurisdiction). Any person
                    who provides their information to us through any part of the blinkBox Service represents
                    to us that they are 13 years of age (or the lawful age in their respective jurisdiction)
                    or older. If we become aware that a minor has attempted to or has submitted personal
                    information via the online site, we will not accept this information and will take
                    steps to remove such information from our records.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><em>5.3 Third-Party Practices</em>
            <ul>
                <li>We cannot ensure the protection of any information or images that you provide to
                    a third-party online site that links to or from http://www.blinkbox.com, since these
                    third-party online sites are owned and operated independently of us. Any information
                    collected by these third parties is not governed by this Privacy Notice but by the
                    privacy policy, if any, of such third party. If you have questions about a third
                    party's information practices, please read its privacy policy. We assume no responsibility
                    or liability whatsoever for the practices, actions or policies of such third parties,
                    and we are not responsible for the content or privacy practices of such online sites.</li>
