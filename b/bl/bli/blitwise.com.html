                    of BlitWise Productions LLC ("BlitWise") for this 
                    website, www.blitwise.com, (the "Site"). If you 
                    have objections to the Privacy Policy, you should not access 
                    or use this Site. This Privacy Policy does not govern privacy 
                    practices associated with offline activities or the collection 
                    of information other than through the Site. Your use of the

                    BlitWise is committed to safeguarding the privacy of visitors 
                    to the Site. We will use our best efforts to ensure that the 
                    information you provide us remains private and is used only 
                    for the purposes set forth herein. Additionally, in no event 
                    will BlitWise sell customer lists or profiles to outside sources. 
                    <br><br>
                    <b>Changes in Privacy Policy</b><br>
                    <br>
                    All "personal information" ("personal information" 
                    is defined as any information that identifies or can be used 
                    to identify, contact, or locate the person to whom such information 
                    pertains, examples being names, street addresses, email address, 
                    billing address, credit card number and expiration dates) 
                    that we collect and maintain will be subject to the version 
                    of the Privacy Policy in effect at the time of such collection. 
                    BlitWise reserves the right to change the Privacy Policy from 
                    time to time at its sole discretion. <br><br>
                    Please note that if BlitWise sells assets (or the assets of 
                    a division or subsidiary) to another entity, or BlitWise (or 
                    a division or subsidiary) is acquired by, or merged with, 
                    another entity, BlitWise may provide to such entity customer 
                    and personal information that is related to that part of our 
                    business that was sold to or merged with the other entity 
                    without your consent.<br><br>
                    <b>Third Parties</b><br><br>
                    The Site contains links to other sites at which personal information 
                    is collected. In such instances, unless expressly provided 
                    to the contrary, the collection and use of your personal information 
                    will not be governed by this Privacy Policy but by the privacy 
                    policy applicable to that site. That privacy policy should 
                    identify the entity that is collecting your personal information. 
                    Because BlitWise does not control the privacy practices of 
                    third parties you are subject to the privacy customs and policies 
                    of those third parties. When you link to another website, 
                    you are subject to the privacy policy of that website. We 
                    encourage you to ask questions and review the applicable privacy 
                    policy before you disclose your personal information to third 
                    parties. We do not try to control, and disclaim responsibility 
                    for, information provided by other users or third parties 
                    that is made available through our Site. Such information 
                    may contain errors, intentional or otherwise, or may be inappropriate 
                    or inaccurate and in some cases will be mislabeled. <br>
                    Collection of personal information<br><br>
                    As a visitor to this Site, you can engage in many activities 
                    without providing any personal information. In connection 
                    with other activities, such as requesting information, downloading 
                    games, or participating in the forum discussions, BlitWise 
                    may ask you to provide certain information about yourself 
                    by filling out and submitting an online form. It is completely 
                    optional for you to engage in these activities. If you elect 
                    to engage in these activities, however, BlitWise may ask that 
                    you provide us personal information, such as your first and 
                    last name, company name, mailing address (including ZIP code), 
                    email address, telephone and facsimile numbers, and other 
                    personal information. Depending upon the activity, some of 
                    the information that we ask you to provide is identified as 
                    mandatory and some as voluntary. If you do not provide the 
                    mandatory data with respect to a particular activity, you 
                    will not be able to engage in that activity.<br>
                    When you use the Site, BlitWise or third parties authorized 
                    by BlitWise may also collect certain technical and routing 
                    information about your computer to facilitate your use of 
                    the Site and its services. For example, we may log environmental 
                    variables, such as browser type, operating system, CPU speed, 
                    and the Internet Protocol ("IP") address of your 
                    computer. We use these environmental variables to facilitate 
                    and track your use of the Site and its services. BlitWise 
                    also uses such environmental variables to measure traffic 
                    patterns on the Site. Without expressly informing you, we 
                    do not match such information with any of your personal information.<br><br>
                    When you play a game under BlitWise's network, your BlitWise 
                    identification or avatar may be visible to the public depending 
                    upon the nature of the game you play. You may play games under 
                    a variety of identities without revealing your primary identification 
                    by creating an avatar or alias. An avatar consists of a name 
                    and some information that you show in a profile to other players 
                    on BlitWise. When creating such profile please be mindful 
                    that such information is available to all online. <br><br>
                    When you submit personal information to BlitWise through this 
                    Site, you understand and agree that this information may be 
                    transferred across national boundaries and may be stored and 
                    processed in any of the countries in which BlitWise and its 
                    affiliates and subsidiaries maintain offices, including, without 
                    limitation, the United States of America. You also acknowledge 
                    that in certain countries or with respect to certain activities, 
                    authorized vendors of BlitWise may undertake the collection, 
                    transferring, storage, and processing of your information. 
                    Such vendors are bound by contract not to use your personal 
                    information for their own purposes or provide it to any third 
                    parties. One instance where this could occur is in conjunction 
                    with framed pages in which the URL for the pages is not visible 
                    and the pages are being hosted by a vendor of BlitWise.<br><br>
                    <b>Policies For Children</b><br><br>
                    BlitWise does not knowingly collect or use any personal information 
                    from users under 13 years of age without express parental 
                    consent pursuant to the Children's On-line Privacy Protection 
                    Act of 1998 (hereinafter COPPA). Once verifiable parental 
                    consent is obtained by BlitWise, the personal information 
                    is treated no differently than adult users, in that in no 
                    event will BlitWise sell customer lists or profiles. <br><br>
                    Pursuant to COPPA, prior to submitting verifiable parental 
                    consent the parents of children under 13 years of age have 
                    the right to receive information describing the specific types 
                    of personal information to be collected by the site. Additionally 
                    a parent has the right to request at any time (1) to refuse 
                    to permit the operator's further use or maintenance in retrievable 
                    form, and/or (2) further online collection of personal information 
                    from that child.<br><br>
                    BlitWise has the ability to terminate service, pursuant to 
                    COPPA to a child whose parent has refused to permit the operator's 
                    further use or maintenance in retrievable form, or future 
                    online collection of personal information from such child. 
                    <br><br>
                    Finally, BlitWise will not condition a child's participation 
                    in a game, offering of a prize, or any other activity upon 
                    the child disclosing more personal information than is reasonably 
                    necessary to participate in such activity. <br><br>
                    <b>Use of Personal Information</b><br><br>
                    BlitWise collects your information in order to record and 
                    support your participation in the activities you select. If 
                    you subscribe to a forum or download a game, for example, 
                    the information is used to register your rights, if any, to 
                    technical support or other benefits that may be made available

                    As a family friendly Site, BlitWise takes its users' privacy 
                    concerns seriously. If you believe that BlitWise has not complied 
                    with this Online Privacy Policy with respect to your personal 
                    information or you have other related inquiries or concerns, 
                    you may write to the BlitWise technical support employee at 
                    the address indicated above.<br>
                    In your letter, please describe in as much detail as possible 
                    the nature of your inquiry or the ways in which you believe 
                    that the BlitWise Online Privacy Policy has not been complied 
                    with. We will investigate your inquiry or complaint promptly. 
                    Please note that if you provide BlitWise with inconsistent 
                    privacy preferences (for example, by indicating on one occasion 
                    that third parties may contact you with marketing offers and 
                    indicating on another occasion that they may not), BlitWise 
                    cannot guarantee that your most recent privacy preference 
                    will be honored. Also, please note that BlitWise is not responsible 
                    for the content or privacy practices of non-BlitWise websites
