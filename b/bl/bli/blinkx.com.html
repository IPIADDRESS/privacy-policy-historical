                <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
                <h3>Our Commitment</h3>
                <p>RhythmOne, LLC
                    (“<strong>RhythmOne</strong>”, “<strong>we</strong>”, “<strong>us</strong>”,
                    or “<strong>our</strong>”) recognizes that our customers, users, visitors and others who
                    use www.blinkx.com, applications, or other websites owned or operated by RhythmOne
                    (the “<strong>RhythmOne Sites</strong>”) (collectively or individually “<strong>User</strong>”, “<strong>you</strong>”,
                    or “<strong>your</strong>”) value their privacy. This privacy policy
                    (this “<strong>Privacy Policy</strong>”) details important information regarding the use
                    and disclosure of User information collected on the RhythmOne Sites.</p>
                <p>The Privacy Policy only addresses our activities from our servers. Other websites, including those
                    that we link to and third-party websites or services that we co-brand, may have their own policies,
                    which we do not control, and thus are not addressed by this policy.</p>
                <h3>Information We Collect And How It's Used</h3>
                <h4>IP Address</h4>
                <p>An Internet Protocol address (“<strong>IP address</strong>”) is automatically assigned to
                    your computer every time you establish a connection to the Internet. The RhythmOne Sites recognize
                    your IP address. Also, we track the Internet address of the domains from which you arrive to the
                    RhythmOne Sites, and we use this data for statistical analysis.</p>
                <h4>Cookies</h4>
                <p>A cookie is a small text file containing a string of alphanumeric characters that stores data on a
                    User’s hard drive. A cookie cannot access a User’s hard drive, and only contains as much
                    information as the User has disclosed to a particular website. We use both “session cookies”
                    and “persistent cookies”. A “session cookie” is temporary and disappears
                    after you close your browser. A “persistent cookie” remains after you close your browser
                    and may be used by your browser on subsequent visits to a site. When you visit the RhythmOne Sites
                    we may set one or more cookies on your computer that associate a unique identifier with your browser
                    and collect non-personally identifiable information (“<strong>non-PII</strong>”)
                    (including, without limitation, the server you are logged into, the geographic location of the ISP
                    you use, the type of browser you use, the sites you have visited, the products you have researched
                    and your IP address) and in some cases personally identifiable information
                    (“<strong>PII</strong>”) about your activity on the RhythmOne Sites. We may track
                    general information about each User’s activity on the RhythmOne Sites such as how many
                    searches you perform and what types of videos you prefer to watch on the RhythmOne Sites. We do not
                    link the information we store in cookies to any personally identifiable information we collect or
                    you submit on the RhythmOne Sites.</p>
                <p>We may store this information after the date of collection for various purposes, including, but not
                    limited to: improving and iterating our technologies; understanding how you interact with the
                    RhythmOne Sites and the services we offer; customizing and improving your experience; and monitoring
                    User activity on the RhythmOne Sites in the aggregate. Our RhythmMax for Publishers contextual and
                    behavioral advertising platform (“<strong>RMP</strong>”) analyzes your activity on the
                    RhythmOne Sites to show you ads which are tailored to your interests. We may set a cookie or other
                    telecommunications technologies to collect data about your video consumption patterns on the
                    RhythmOne Sites. Based on this information, RhythmOne associates your browser with relevant interest
                    categories. We use these categories to show you interest-based ads on the videos you watch on the
                    RhythmOne Sites.</p>
                <h4>Opting Out</h4>
                <p>If you prefer not to receive this type of interest-based advertising, you can opt out of RMP. After
                    you opt out, you will not receive interest-based ads. You will see the same quantity of ads as
                    before, but they will likely not be as relevant to you. To opt out, click the link in the “RMP
                    Opt-Out” box on this page. When you get a new computer, install a new browser or upgrade
                    certain browsers, erase or otherwise alter your browser’s cookie file, you might end up
                    deleting the cookies in your browser, including the opt-out cookie. If you wish to opt out again,
                    you will need to return to this page and disable the tracking.</p>
                <h4>Third-Party Cookies/Opting Out/Do Not Track</h4>
                <p>We partner with third-party ad networks and allow such networks to set cookies to collect non-PII for
                    the purpose of serving targeted ads. Such ad networks may use information about your activity on the
                    RhythmOne Sites to show advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. RhythmOne has no
                    control over these ad networks or their use of the information they collect. To opt out of
                    third-party behavioral targeting, visit the Network Advertising Initiative’s consumer page
                    at<a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp" target="_blank">www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp</a>.
                    After opting out of a network, you will still receive online advertising, but the ads will no longer
                    be tailored to your usage patterns.</p>
                <p>Although certain RhythmOne technology may honor “do not track” (DNT) signals and similar
                    mechanisms transmitted by web browsers or mobile device operating systems, RhythmOne is not
                    responsible, and shall not be liable, for the acts of third parties, such as ad networks, with
                    respect to such third parties’ tracking policies.</p>
                <p>RhythmOne is a member of the Internet Advertising Bureau (“IAB”) and supports the
                    Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising (the “OBA Principles”). For

                <p>To remove persistent cookies, follow the directions in your web browser’s “Help”
                    section. You can configure your browser preferences to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a
                    cookie is being sent, which will give you the choice whether to accept it or not. Please be advised
                    that some features of the RhythmOne Sites may not function properly if you disable your browser’s
                    ability to accept cookies.</p>
                <p>Information about our use of cookies is contained in our "<a href="/cookies">Cookie Information</a>".
                </p>
                <p>Your browser’s cookie settings may be sufficient indication of your consent to placement of and
                    access to cookies on your computer by RhythmOne, and RhythmOne’s collection, use, and
                    disclosure of non-PII and in some cases, PII about your activity on the RhythmOne Sites.</p>
                <h4>Policies of Other Sites and Services</h4>
                <p>The RhythmOne Sites contain links to third-party websites and online services. If you choose to visit
                    another website or online service by clicking on a link, you will be directed to such third party’s
                    website or online service. The fact that we may link to a website or online service is not an
                    endorsement, authorization, or representation of our affiliation with that third party, nor is it an
                    endorsement of their privacy policies. In addition, RhythmOne may also synchronize the unique
                    identifiers collected and described above with those of third parties (including cross-device
                    identifiers as described in the RhythmOne’s Use of Cross-Application and Cross-Device
                    Technology section below). RhythmOne has no control over, nor does it bear any responsibility for
                    the privacy policies and/or content of these third-parties, their sites and/or their services. Such
                    third-parties, their sites and/or their services may follow different rules regarding the
                    collection, use, and disclosure of personally and non-personally identifiable information about you,
                    and may place cookies or other files on your computer to collect data from you. RhythmOne also takes
                    no responsibility for the cookies these third-parties, their sites and/or services might place on
                    your hard drive. We encourage you to read the privacy policies of other websites and online services
                    before using or providing any information to such website or services.</p>
                <h4>RhythmOne’s Use of Cross-Application and Cross-Device Technology</h4>
                <p>We and/or our customers may collect information about your activity across multiple unaffiliated
                    third-party mobile applications. We may share this information with our customers in order to help
                    them predict the types of ads that may be relevant to you and to display advertising to you
                    accordingly. This information may also be combined with a mobile advertising identifier. To opt out
                    of such practices, please see the Third Party Cookies/Opting Out/Do Not Track section above.</p>
                <p>We and/or our customers may use technology that establishes connections among related devices (such
                    as mobile devices and desktop computers) both in order to deliver advertising that may be more
                    relevant to you, as well as for analytics and reporting purposes. This means that information about
                    your use of websites or applications on one of your devices may be combined with information from
                    your other devices.</p>
                <p>We may also partner with third parties to provide such cross-device technology to our customers, and
                    in doing so we may share anonymous identifiers with those third parties in order to make connections
                    among related devices. We may also use your device’s IP address to infer connections among
                    related devices within the same household. To opt out of RhythmOne’s use of such technologies
                    for each web browser and on each of your devices, please follow the instructions for opting out in
                    both web browsers and mobile applications, as described in the Opting Out and Third Party
                    Cookies/Opting Out/Do Not Track sections above.</p>
                <h4>Sponsored Results</h4>
                <p>RhythmOne shows sponsored results where relevant to your query. Sponsored results may contain
                    affiliate marketing links. When you click on a sponsored result, RhythmOne may be compensated by a
                    third party. By clicking on a sponsored link, you will be directed to a third-party website or
                    service.</p>
                <h4>Disclosure of Your Information</h4>
                <p>The name and contact information of persons who request information about RhythmOne, our
                    subsidiaries, our products and/or services are added to our database so that we may contact them
                    about RhythmOne’s products, services, or future opportunities.</p>
                <p>We use industry-standard efforts, such as firewalls and secure socket layers where appropriate, to
                    safeguard the confidentiality of your information.</p>
                <p>Because no method of transmitting or storing electronic data is completely secure, we cannot
                    guarantee that information, including without limitation User data or PII, will never be accessed,
                    used, or released in a manner inconsistent with this policy.</p>
