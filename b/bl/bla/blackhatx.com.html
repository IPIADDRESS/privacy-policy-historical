			<h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
			<p>We have created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate our  firm and continuing commitment to the privacy of personal information  provided by those visiting and interacting with this web site. We hold  the privacy of your personal information in the highest regard. The  following discloses our information gathering and dissemination  practices for this website.</p>
<p><span id="more-106"></span></p>
<p>We recognize the importance of protecting your privacy and our policy  is designed to assist you in understanding how we collect, use and  safeguard the personal information you provide to us and to assist you  in making informed decisions when using our site. This policy will be  continuously assessed against new technologies, business practices and  our customers’ needs.</p>
<p><strong>What Information Do We Collect?</strong></p>
<p>When you visit this web site you may provide us with two types of  information: personal information you knowingly choose to disclose that  is collected on an individual basis and Web site use information  collected on an aggregate basis as you and others browse our Web site.</p>
<p><strong>1. Personal Information You Choose to Provide:</strong></p>
<p>Registration Information<br>
When you register for any of our products, services or newsletters you  will provide us information about yourself.</p>
<p>Credit Card Information<br>
We do not collect your credit card information, any products or services  recommended on this website will be responsible by the party to collect  your credit card information when you purchase.</p>
<p>Email Information<br>
If you choose to correspond with us through email, we may retain the  content of your email messages together with your email address and our  responses. We provide the same protections for these electronic  communications that we employ in the maintenance of information received  by mail and telephone.</p>
<p><strong>2. Web Site Use Information</strong></p>
<p>Similar to other commercial Web sites, our Web site utilizes a  standard technology called “cookies” (see explanation below, “What Are  Cookies?”) and web server log files to collect information about how our  Web site is used. Information gathered through cookies and Web server  logs may include the date and time of visits, the pages viewed, time  spent at our Web site, and the Web sites visited just before and just  after our Web site.</p>
<p><strong>How Do We Use the Information That You Provide to Us?</strong></p>
<p>Broadly speaking, we use personal information for purposes of  administering our business activities, providing the products and  services you requested, to process your payment, , to monitor the use of  the service, our marketing and promotional efforts and improve our  content and service offerings, and customize our site’s content, layout,  services and for other lawful purposes. These uses improve our site and  better tailor it to meet your needs.</p>
<p>Furthermore, such information may be shared with others on an  aggregate basis. Personally identifiable information or business  information will not be shared with parties except as required by law.</p>
<p>Occasionally, we may also use the information we collect to notify  you about important changes to our Website, new services, and special  offers we think you will find valuable. You may notify us at any time if  you do not wish to receive these offers by emailing us at the link  provided on the newsletter.</p>
<p><strong>What Are Cookies?</strong></p>
<p>A cookie is a very small text document, which often includes an  anonymous unique identifier. When you visit a Web site, that site’s  computer asks your computer for permission to store this file in a part  of your hard drive specifically designated for cookies. Each Web site  can send its own cookie to your browser if your browser’s preferences  allow it, but (to protect your privacy) your browser only permits a Web  site to access the cookies it has already sent to you, not the cookies  sent to you by other sites. Browsers are usually set to accept cookies.  However, if you would prefer not to receive cookies, you may alter the  configuration of your browser to refuse cookies. If you choose to have  your browser refuse cookies, it is possible that some areas of our site  will not function as effectively when viewed by the users. A cookie  cannot retrieve any other data from your hard drive or pass on computer  viruses.</p>
<p><strong>How Do We Use Information We Collect from Cookies?</strong></p>
<p>As you visit and browse our Web site, the site uses cookies to  differentiate you from other users. In some cases, we also use cookies  to prevent you from having to log in more than is necessary for  security. Cookies, in conjunction with our Web server’s log files, allow  us to calculate the aggregate number of people visiting our Web site  and which parts of the site are most popular. This helps us gather  feedback to constantly improve our Web site and better serve our  clients. Cookies do not allow us to gather any personal information  about you and we do not intentionally store any personal information  that your browser provided to us in your cookies.</p>
<p><strong>IP Addresses</strong></p>
<p>IP addresses are used by your computer every time you are connected  to the Internet. Your IP address is a number that is used by computers  on the network to identify your computer. IP addresses are automatically  collected by our web server as part of demographic and profile data  known as traffic data so that data (such as the Web pages you request)  can be sent to you.</p>
<p><strong>Sharing and Selling Information</strong></p>
<p>We do not share, sell, lend or lease any of the information that  uniquely identify a subscriber (such as email addresses or personal  details) with anyone except to the extent it is necessary to process  transactions or provide services that you have requested.</p>
<p><strong>How Can You Access and Correct Your Information?</strong></p>
<p>You may request access to all your personally identifiable  information that we collect online and maintain in our database by  emailing us at the usual address.</p>
<p><strong>What About Legally Compelled Disclosure of Information?</strong></p>
<p>We may disclose information when legally compelled to do so, in other  words, when we, in good faith, believe that the law requires it or for  the protection of our legal rights. We may also disclose account  information when we have reason to believe that disclosing this  information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action  against someone who may be violating our Terms of Service or to protect  the safety of our users and the Public.</p>
<p><strong>What About Other Web Sites Linked to Our Web Site?</strong></p>
<p>We are not responsible for the practices employed by Web sites linked  to or from our Web site or the information or content contained  therein. Often links to other Web sites are provided solely as pointers  to information on topics that may be useful to the users of our Web  site.</p>
<p>Please remember that when you use a link to go from our Website to  another web site, our Privacy Policy is no longer in effect. Your  browsing and interaction on any other web site, including web sites,  which have a link on our Website, is subject to that Web site’s own  rules and policies. Please read over those rules and policies before  proceeding.</p>
<p><strong>Your Consent</strong></p>
<p>By using our Web site you consent to our collection and use of your  personal information as described in this Privacy Policy. We reserve the  right to amend this privacy policy at any time with or without notice.</p>
<p><strong>Our Commitment To Data Security:</strong></p>
<p>Please note that your information will be stored and processed on our  computers in the United States. The laws on holding personal data in  the United States may be less stringent than the laws of your Country of  residence or citizenship. To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data  accuracy, and ensure the correct use of information, we have put in  place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to  safeguard and secure the information we collect online.</p>
<p><strong>Choice/Opt-In/Opt-Out</strong></p>
<p>This site allows visitors to unsubscribe so that they will not  receive future messages. After unsubscribing we will discontinue sending  the particular messages as soon as technically feasible.</p>
<p><strong>Surveys &amp; Contests</strong></p>
<p>From time-to-time our site requests information from users via  surveys or contests. Participation in these surveys or contests is  completely voluntary and the user therefore has a choice whether or not  to disclose this information. Information requested may include contact  information (such as name and shipping address), and demographic  information (such as zip code, age level). Contact information will be  used to notify the winners and award prizes. Survey information will be  used for purposes of monitoring or improving the use and satisfaction of  this site.</p>
<p><strong>A Special Note About Children</strong></p>
<p>Children are not eligible to use our services unsupervised and we ask  that children (under the age of 14) do not submit any personal  information to us. If you are a minor, you can use this service only in  conjunction with permission and guidance from your parents or guardians.</p>
<p><strong>Acquisition or Changes in Ownership</strong></p>
<p>In the event that the web site (or a substantial portion of its  assets) is acquired, your information would be considered part of those  assets, and may be part of those assets that are transferred.</p>
<p><strong>Policy Modifications</strong></p>
<p>We may change this Privacy Policy from time to time. If/when changes  are made to this privacy policy, we will email users who have given us  permission to do so. We will post any changes here, so be sure to check  back periodically. However, please be assured that if the Privacy Policy  changes in the future, we will not use the personal information you  have submitted to us under this Privacy Policy in a manner that is  materially inconsistent with this Privacy Policy, without your prior  consent.</p>
