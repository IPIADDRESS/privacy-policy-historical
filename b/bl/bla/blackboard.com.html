the use of the information we collect.  The following discloses our information gathering

<font face="Arial" size="2" color="000000">
</font></p><p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="000000">
    You are free to visit Blackboard.com without identifying yourself; however, if you would 
like to utilize or customize some features of the Services, you must first register with 
Blackboard.  When you register, we will request certain personal information, including 
your name, city and state, e-mail address, and age range.   This information better enables 
us to provide you with content relevant to your interests and provides us with aggregate 
demographic data that Blackboard uses to improve the services offered to users.   You may 
update or review this information at any time by selecting the "edit account," "edit 
personal information," or "My Info" option throughout the Service.  Please see below, 
"Access to Your Information."
</font></p><p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="000000">
In addition to registration, Blackboard may, from time to time, request personal 
information for purposes such as the provision of customer service, billing, synchronization 
of information available in the Resources Service with individual CourseSites, network 
management, customer surveys, newsletter subscriptions, offers of related services, and 
other exchanges of information.  Users may opt-out of receiving future promotional mailings 
at any time.  Please see below, "User Options - Opt Out." 
</font></p><p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="000000">
Blackboard gathers information about all users collectively, such as what areas users 
visit most frequently and what services users access most often.  Blackboard automatically 
logs IP addresses, session sources, and other data which tracks users" access to 
Blackboard.com.  We analyze these logs in order to understand aggregate user behavior as 
well as for system performance monitoring.  These logs are analyzed for the overall, 
aggregate trends they reveal about our customers, not for the behaviors of individual users.

</b></font>
<font face="Arial" size="2" color="000000">
</font></p><p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="000000">
The UserID you select during registration must be used to log in and participate in a 
CourseSite.  Once you log in to a CourseSite, you will be identified to the instructor 
and other students in that course by your full name in areas such as discussion forums, 
email lists, and other places where names appear. Please remember that any information 
that is disclosed in these areas becomes available to the instructor and other students 
in that course, and you should exercise caution when deciding to disclose your personal 
information.
</font></p><p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="000000">
Blackboard makes chat rooms, forums, message boards, and/or news groups available in the 
Communities Service and other Services.  When participating in these areas, you will be 
identified by a portion of your email address and a nickname that you choose during the 
registration process.  Please remember that any information that is disclosed in these 
areas becomes public information, and you should exercise caution when deciding to disclose 
your personal information.
</font></p><p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="000000">
The personal information you supply to Blackboard will not be given, sold, rented, loaned, 
or otherwise disclosed to any third parties outside of Blackboard, except when we have your 
permission or under special circumstances, such as when we believe in good faith that 
disclosure is reasonably necessary to (i) comply with legal process, (ii) enforce the 
Terms of Use, (iii) respond to claims that any content on Blackboard.com violates the 
rights of third parties, or (iv) protect the rights, property, or personal safety of 
Blackboard, its users, or the public.  
</font></p><p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="000000">
Blackboard may use aggregated personal information to determine the demographics of our 
users and to distribute statistics and general marketplace information about Blackboard.  
These demographics will always represent aggregate information and will never identify a 
specific user.

Certain non-personal information regarding users is recorded by the standard operation of 
the Internet servers hosting the Blackboard.com site.  This information is primarily used 
to provide visitors to Blackboard.com with an enhanced online experience.  Blackboard may 
disclose aggregated user statistics in order to describe the service to prospective partners, 
advertisers, and other third parties, and for other lawful purposes.

may be offered in conjunction with a partner company.  In order to provide these features, 
it may be necessary for either you or us to share your personal information with this 
company.  If you do not want your information to be shared, you can choose not to allow 
the transfer by not using that particular feature.   Also, please be aware that advertisers 
or Web sites that are linked to Blackboard.com may collect personally identifiable

A <i>cookie</i> is a small data file that certain Web sites write to your hard drive when you 
visit them.  A cookie file can contain information such as a user ID that the site uses 
to track the pages you"ve visited. But the only personal information a cookie can contain 
is information you supply yourself.  A cookie can"t read data off your hard disk or read 
cookie files created by other sites. Blackboard uses cookies to tell when a user is a 
repeat visitor and to let us know how the user found the site.  They also allow us to 
automatically link users to their personalized accounts. When you create an account, 
Blackboard uses a cookie to store a unique, random user ID.  Blackboard uses this ID to 
identify you anonymously in our database and to track the pages you visit on our site.  
This helps us better understand and improve areas of the site that our users find valuable. 
Blackboard also uses this ID to enable you to enter various Services as a member and to 
visit member-restricted areas of the site without having to log in each time.  Blackboard 
encrypts the user ID for added security.

visitors to Blackboard.com always have the option of disabling cookies via their browser 
preferences. You can refuse cookies by turning them off in your browser.  However, some of 
the Services will not work if you have cookies disabled.
