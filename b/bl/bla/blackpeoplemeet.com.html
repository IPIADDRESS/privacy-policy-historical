Aggregate information is information that cannot be traced back to any specific individual and as such is completely general in nature. This is information that does not by itself Identify a specific individual. We gather certain information about you. This information is compiled and analyzed on both a personal and an aggregated basis. This information may include the Web Site's uniform Resource Locator ("URL") that you just came from, which URL you next go to, what browser you are using and your Internet Protocal ("IP") address. A URL is the global address of documents and other resources on the World Wide Web. An IP address is an identifier for a computer or device on a Transmission Control Protocal/Internet Protocol ("TCP/IP") network, such as the World Wide Web.

Those third parties include authorized contractors, temporary employees and consultants and other companies working with us (collectively agents). Where we believe it to be appropriate (in our sole discretion) we will ask our agents not to disclose or use your personal information for purposes other than to provide services to you or BlackPeopleMeet.com.<br><br>We collect IP addresses for the purposes of system administration, to gather broad demographic information to enable ads to be served on our site, to report Aggregate information to our advertisers, and to monitor the level of activity on our site. We collect information from visitors to our site regarding the URL they came from, their IP addresses, domain types (e.g. .com or.org), the browser type used to come to the site, the country, state and telephone area code where their servers are located, the pages of our site that visitors viewed during their visit and any search terms entered on our site.<br><br><b>Release to Other Parties</b><br><br> We do not sell, trade or rent your personal information to others. We may provide Aggregate information about our customer sales, traffic patterns, and related site information to third party advertisers or vendors, but these statistics do not include any Personally Identifiable Information.

That analysis is to help us to improve our site and product selection and to notify you of special offers that may be of interest to you.
