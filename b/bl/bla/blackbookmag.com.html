BlackBook creates internal reports on user demographics and traffic patterns for our advertisers and partners. BlackBook may include your personal information in our reports. This information allows our third-party advertisers to deliver, and our users to receive, more relevant advertisements. <br>
<br>
BlackBook reserves the right to transfer and/or sell aggregate or group data about BlackBook users for lawful purposes. Aggregate or group data is data that describes the demographics, usage or other characteristics of BlackBook users as a group without disclosing personally identifiable information. By submitting your personal information to, and/or using, the Website, you agree to allow BlackBook to transfer and/or sell such aggregate data to third parties. <br>
<br>
Credit Card Information <br>
BlackBook collects credit card information for purchases of products or services authorized by you. Although BlackBook does not retain identifiable credit card information at this time, BlackBook reserves the right to retain such information in the future. <br>
<br>
IP Addresses <br>
We use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server, and to administer our Website. Your IP address is used to gather broad and specific demographic information as well as for validation purposes. <br>
<br>
Cookies <br>
We use cookies to deliver content specific to your interests, to save your password so that you do not have to re-enter it each time that you visit our Website (if you choose), and for other purposes. <br>
<br>
Sharing of Information: <br>
We use the registration data that you supply to personalize your experience with the BlackBook service and for verification purposes. The personally identifiable information that you submit to BlackBook remains your property, but by submitting that information to BlackBook you grant BlackBook the right to use that information for marketing purposes. We do not currently do so, but we reserve the right to sell our user information and/or join together with other businesses to bring selected opportunities to our members. BlackBook is able to offer its services to you, in part, based on your willingness to be reached by our third-party advertisers. This information will not be sold or leased to advertisers on an aggregate basis, but BlackBook may contact you with specific offerings from our third-party advertisers. By allowing BlackBook to contact you for these third parties, you will receive free information on products and services that may be of interest to you. We also use contact information from your registration data to send you information about BlackBook and to keep you informed of our other products and services that may be of interest to you. Please keep in mind, though, that BlackBook does not control, and is not responsible for, the practices of our third-party advertisers. Your contact information is also used to reach you, when necessary, regarding issues concerning the use of our service. If you wish to stop receiving future communications from us, please see the Opt-Out/Unsubscribe section below. <br>
<br>
By submitting your e-mail address at the Website and/or obtaining services from us, you agree to receive e-mail marketing from BlackBook and our third-party advertisers. In addition, you agree that such act constitutes a purchase, an inquiry and/or an application for purposes of the Amended Telemarketing Sales Rule, 16 CFR §310 et seq. (the "ATSR"). Notwithstanding that your telephone number may be listed on the Federal Trade Commission's Do-Not-Call List, BlackBook retains the right to contact you via telemarketing in accordance with the ATSR. Moreover, by registering with, or requesting information from, a third-party advertiser at or through the Website, such action shall constitute a purchase, an inquiry and/or an application with the respective third-party advertiser for purposes of the ATSR and you may be contacted via e-mail, direct mail and/or telemarketing by such third-party advertiser in accordance with the ATSR. <br>
<br>
BlackBook reserves the right to release current or past user information: a) in the event we believe that the Website and/or the BlackBook service is being or has been used in violation of the Terms of Service or to commit unlawful acts; b) if the information is subpoenaed; or c) if BlackBook is sold or acquired. Moreover, you hereby consent to disclosure of any record or communication to any third party when BlackBook, in its sole discretion, determines the disclosure to be appropriate including, without limitation, sharing your e-mail address with other third parties for suppression purposes in compliance with the CAN-SPAM Act of 2003, as amended from time to time. <br>
<br>
If BlackBook collects your credit card-specific information, we will use the information to process and complete any transaction that you request. Your credit card information will be encrypted and protected with SSL encryption software. In addition, by submitting your credit card information to us, you authorize BlackBook to periodically verify that your credit card account continues to be a valid and active one by charging, and thereafter immediately crediting, a small sum to the card. Such verification may be conducted through a third party and, in that case, BlackBook would share your specific credit card information with this third party for verification purposes. Apart from said uses, we will not share your credit card information with any third parties (other than consumer credit agencies) without your prior informed consent. Notwithstanding the foregoing, BlackBook reserves the right to share with third parties the fact that we have credit card information on file for specific users, but we will not share your specific credit card information with third parties without the your prior informed consent. <br>

When necessary, BlackBook provides this information to our marketing partners. In some cases, you may be able to make a purchase through one of their third-party websites. In these instances, you may be required to provide certain information, such as a credit card number, to register or complete a transaction at such website. These third-party websites have separate privacy and data collection practices and BlackBook has no responsibility or liability relating to them. <br>
