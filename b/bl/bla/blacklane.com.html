<h2 id="9dataprocessingduringregistereduseofblacklaneservicesandbookingrides">9. Data Processing During Registered Use of Blacklane Services and Booking Rides</h2>
<p>Blacklane processes the following personal data provided by you when you register and use Blacklane Services or when you book rides (hereinafter “customer data”).</p>
<ul>
<li>Personal master data (form of address, title, first name, last name, company,
address, zip code, place, country, password);</li>
<li>Contact data (e.g. telephone number, cellphone number, e-mail address);</li>
<li>Contract data (e.g. time and manner of registration, status)</li>
<li>Ride-related data (e.g. pickup location, destination, times, flight number,
special requests).</li>
<li>Status (e.g. bonus program), customer history (e.g. previous rides);</li>
<li>Contract invoicing (e.g. invoices, status, invoicing address) and payment data
(e.g. last 4 digits of the credit card number).</li>
</ul>
<p>The customer data will be used for Blacklane services, i.e. for the personalized fulfillment of the framework agreement after registration (creation, storage, administration and support of your Blacklane account), for the procurement of booked rides and for the fulfillment of the contract of carriage for the benefit of the customer with the limousine service provider. Blacklane provides customer data to third parties, if necessary, in particular to the limousine service providers so that the customer can be transported in accordance with their booking and the transport can be processed. If the customer has indicated a bonus program supported by Blacklane, the data required in this regard is transmitted to the bonus program provider. The payment data collected is stored via a payment service provider and transferred to the intermediary financial service provider or bank (see Point 10.).</p>
<p>Personal data can be transmitted to limousine service providers in a third party country outside of the European Union or the European Economic Area in which the transport is intended to take place. Blacklane cannot generally provide further information on the data protection level in the third party country. An adequacy decision (see Art. 45 Paragraph 3 GDPR) or suitable guarantees (see Art. 46 GDPR) are not required for the transmission since the transmission is required for the performance of a contract between the data subject and the controller or to carry out pre-contractual measures upon request from the data subject (Art. 49 Paragraph 1 lit b GDPR) or because the transmission is required to enter into or to perform a contract concluded in the interest of the data subject by the controller with another natural or legal person (Art. 49 Paragraph 1 lit c GDPR).</p>
<p>The legal basis for the processing of personal data during registered use of Blacklane services and booking rides is Art. 6 Paragraph 1 lit b GDPR (contract performance). If the data subject provides additional, voluntary information (e.g. flight number, frequent flyer program, special requests), the legal basis is their consent according to Art. 6 Paragraph 1 lit a GDPR and our legitimate interest according to Art. 6 Paragraph 1 lif f GDPR.</p>
<p>In addition, Blacklane processes customer data in order to analyze, personalize and improve the use of Blacklane services according to the demand, to advertise Blacklane services, to detect, limit and eliminate technical or process-related disruptions and problems, and to prevent illegal use of Blacklane services (e.g. fraudulent booking, cyberattacks). The legal basis for the processing of personal data is, in this respect, Art. 6 Paragraph 1 lit f GDPR (Blacklane’s legitimate interest). Data is not forwarded to recipients in this respect, unless it is a Blacklane contractor (see Art. 28 GDPR) or otherwise legally permitted.</p>
<h2 id="10creditcarddata">10. Credit Card Data</h2>
<p>All bookings with Blacklane may be paid by credit card. The credit card information only has to be stored once upon the first booking and is protected against unauthorized access. For this purpose, a certified payment provider is used whose systems meet the applicable security standards, such as for example PCI-DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard). The credit card data is stored by the contracted PCI DSS-certified payment provider for recurring transactions. The legal basis for the processing is, in this respect, Art. 6 Paragraph 1 lit b GDPR (contract performance).</p>
<p>Blacklane itself does not store credit card data or only in abbreviated form for analysis purposes or to prevent fraud. The legal basis for this is Art. 6 Paragraph 1 lit f GDPR (Blacklane’s legitimate interest).</p>
<p>In order to ensure that the credit card is used by the legitimate owner and to prevent cases of fraud, payment data and credit card information is transferred to one or more external payment security services. This transfer may also include additional personal data. The external payment security services are processing personal data on behalf of Blacklane. The legal basis for this processing is Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR (legitimate interest of Blacklane).</p>
<h2 id="11communicationwithblacklane">11. Communication with Blacklane</h2>
<p>If you contact Blacklane (e.g. by calling, contact form, Facebook Messenger or e-mail), the data provided by you will be processed to handle your matter and to answer your question. The legal bases are Art. 6 Paragraph 1 lit a GDPR (consent) and Art. 6 Paragraph 1 lit b GDPR (contract performance and contract initiation).</p>
<p>Blacklane will also use data from the communication, as far as possible in a pseudonymized or anonymized form, in order to design Blacklane services to be needs-based and to improve them, to detect and remedy interruptions and technical or process-related problems and to prevent illegal usage of Blacklane services (e.g. fraudulent booking, cyberattacks). The legal basis for the processing of personal data is Art. 6 Paragraph 1 lit f GDPR (Blacklane’s legitimate interest).</p>
<h2 id="12emailadvertisingnewsletter">12. E-mail Advertising, Newsletter</h2>
<p>If you have agreed to receiving advertising or if Blacklane otherwise has the right, we will use your customer data to send you personalized advertising or general newsletters. The following data is mainly affected: Form of address, name, e-mail address. The purpose of the data processing is for Blacklane to inform you regarding current offers and to draw attention to features of Blacklane services.</p>
<p>E-mail advertising and newsletters may contain pixels. In this case, a graphic file is inserted into the e-mail sent in HTML format, based on which a statistical evaluation may be carried out. By using pixels, Blacklane can detect whether and when e-mails have been opened and links contained therein clicked.</p>
<p>The legal base for the data processing is, insofar as you have separately and expressly consented, Art. 6 Paragraph 1 lit a GDPR (consent) and otherwise Art. 6 Paragraph 1 lit f GDPR (Blacklane’s legitimate interest) in conjunction with Section 7 Paragraph 3 of the German Act Against Unfair Competition (UWG). Blacklane has the right, in context of legal permission according to Section 7 Paragraph 3 UWG, to use the e-mail address, which you have provided regarding a chargeable booking, to directly advertise its own, similar products or services. If you do not wish to receive advertising from Blacklane for similar products or services, you may at any time revoke the corresponding use of your e-mail address without incurring any costs other than the transmission costs in accordance with the base tariffs. To this end, you can use the unsubscribe link contained in any mail or you can write an e-mail to us using the above-mentioned e-mail addresses (see section 2.).</p>
<h2 id="13rightsofstakeholders">13. Rights of stakeholders</h2>
<p>If your personal data is processed by Blacklane, you are the data subject (Art. 4 No. 1 GDPR). As the data subject, you have the following rights in relation to the personal data affecting you:</p>

<p>The data subject has the right to obtain from the controller without undue delay the rectification or completion of inaccurate personal data.</p>

<h3 id="134righttotherestrictionofdataprocessingart18gdpr">13.4 Right to the restriction of data processing (Art. 18 GDPR)</h3>
<p>The data subject has the right to demand from the controller the restriction of processing when one of the conditions mentioned in Art. 18 GDPR applies, namely the accuracy of the personal data is contested by the data subject or the processing is unlawful and the data subject opposes the erasure of the personal data.</p>
<h3 id="135righttoobjectionart21gdpr">13.5 Right to objection (Art. 21 GDPR)</h3>
<p>Insofar as the data processing is based on a legitimate interest from our side (Art. 6 Paragraph 1 lif f GDPR) or is direct advertising, the data subject has at any time the right to lodge an objection to the processing of personal data affecting them for the reasons mentioned in Art. 21 GDPR. The controller will then no longer process the personal data, unless they can demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for the processing which override the interests, rights and freedoms of the data subject or the processing serves for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims.</p>
<h3 id="136righttodataportabilityart20gdpr">13.6 Right to data portability (Art. 20 GDPR)</h3>
<p>The data subject has the right within the meaning of Art. 20 GDPR to receive the personal data, which they have provided to a controller, in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format and have the right to transmit this data to another controller without hindrance from the controller to which the personal data has been provided.</p>
<h3 id="137righttolodgeacomplaintart77gdpr">13.7 Right to lodge a complaint (Art. 77 GDPR)</h3>
<p>Without prejudice to any other administrative or judicial remedy, every data subject has the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority according to Art. 77 GDPR.</p>
<h2 id="14automateddecisions">14. Automated decisions</h2>
<p>In the case of Blacklane, you are only subject to an automated decision process (see Art. 22 GDPR) in exceptional cases if you re-enter a payment method via which a payment has already previously failed or when current indications justify the suspicion that it is a fraudulent booking. In these cases, your request to book a ride with Blacklane will be refused. Such an automatic decision is required to conclude the contract (Art. 22 Paragraph 2 lit a GDPR). The data subject has the option of contacting us using the mentioned contact data (see section 2) in order to have an explanation or an intervention by a person or to express their point of view.</p>
<h2 id="15dataerasureandstorageduration">15. Data Erasure and Storage Duration</h2>
<p>We will erase your personal data as soon as the legal basis for its processing lapses. However, legal bases may also exist in parallel or a new one may intervene with the lapsing of a legal basis, such as for example the duty to store determined data to fulfill a legal retention obligation (e.g. according to commercial or tax law).</p>
<h2 id="16amendmentorupdateofthisprivacypolicy">16. Amendment or Update of this Privacy Policy</h2>
<p>Blacklane may update and amend this Privacy Policy at any time. Users of Blacklane services will be informed and may be requested to provide consent again.</p>

Blacklane provides customer data to third parties, if necessary, in particular to the limousine service providers so that the customer can be transported in accordance with their booking and the transport can be processed. If the customer has indicated a bonus program supported by Blacklane, the data required in this regard is transmitted to the bonus program provider. The payment data collected is stored via a payment service provider and transferred to the intermediary financial service provider or bank (see Point 10.).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePersonal data can be transmitted to limousine service providers in a third party country outside of the European Union or the European Economic Area in which the transport is intended to take place. Blacklane cannot generally provide further information on the data protection level in the third party country. An adequacy decision (see Art. 45 Paragraph 3 GDPR) or suitable guarantees (see Art. 46 GDPR) are not required for the transmission since the transmission is required for the performance of a contract between the data subject and the controller or to carry out pre-contractual measures upon request from the data subject (Art. 49 Paragraph 1 lit b GDPR) or because the transmission is required to enter into or to perform a contract concluded in the interest of the data subject by the controller with another natural or legal person (Art. 49 Paragraph 1 lit c GDPR).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe legal basis for the processing of personal data during registered use of Blacklane services and booking rides is Art. 6 Paragraph 1 lit b GDPR (contract performance).

The legal basis for the processing of personal data is, in this respect, Art. 6 Paragraph 1 lit f GDPR (Blacklane’s legitimate interest).

If you do not wish to receive advertising from Blacklane for similar products or services, you may at any time revoke the corresponding use of your e-mail address without incurring any costs other than the transmission costs in accordance with the base tariffs.

Blacklane provides customer data to third parties, if necessary, in particular to the limousine service providers so that the customer can be transported in accordance with their booking and the transport can be processed.
