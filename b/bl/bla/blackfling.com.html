          <p>THIS POLICY WAS LAST UPDATED ON May 9, 2009</p>

          <p><b><span class="title3">Blackfling Privacy Policy</span></b></p>

                  <p>BlackFling Incorporated ("we" or " BlackFling ")
                  have adopted this privacy policy to protect your personal information and to
                  let you know how we might use it. This privacy policy only applies to activities you perform on the
                  Blackfling website, transactions for purchasing BlackFling subscription
                  services, and activities or communications that occur using the BlackFling
                  service (collectively known as the "Service") and does not apply to any other
                  Website or offline point of contact between Blackfling, BlackFling, or any
                  other company, and consumers. This policy was implemented on January 1, 2003
                  this policy may change from time-to-time, please periodically review this
                  page. Each time you use the Service
                  or provide us with information, by doing so you are accepting the practices
                  described in this privacy policy at that time.                  </p>


                    <p><b>Your IP Address</b></p>
                    <p>Like most e-commerce Websites, each time you
                      use the Service, we automatically collect your IP address and the web page
                      from which you came. In order to administer and optimize the Service for you
                      and to diagnose problems, we use your IP address to help identify you and to
                      gather broad demographic information about you.                      </p>
 
                   <p><b>Cookies</b></p>
                    <p>Like most Websites, the Service uses
                      cookies to keep track of your purchases and other activity on the website to
                      enhance your experience. We also use cookies to deliver content specific to
                      your interests, to save your password, and if you choose, to save other
                      personal and financial information so you do not have to reenter it each time
                      you use the Service. Third party advertisers on the Site may also place or
                      read cookies on your browser. If you wish to disable these cookies, the
                      "help" portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how.
                      However, if you set your browser to disable cookies, you may not be able to
                      access certain aspects of the Service.                   </p><p><b>Information We Collect From You</b></p>
                    <p>In order to operate the Service and to
                      provide you with information about products or services that may be of
                      interest to you, we may collect "personal information" (i.e.
                      information that could be used to contact you directly without using the
                      service" demographic information" (i.e. information that you
                      submit, or that we collect, that is neither personal information nor
                      financial information; this may include, but is not limited to, zip code,
                      postal code, hometown, gender, username, age/birth date, purchase history
                      information, browsing history information, searching history information,
                      registration history information, and the content of communications between
                      you and other members over the Service), subject to the rest of this
                      paragraph. Demographic information is divided into two categories: 1)
                      "non-public information", which consists of purchase history
                      information and one-on-one communications between you and other users of the
                      Service; and 2) "public information", which consists of all other
                      demographic information. We ask that you do not enter personal information or
                      financial information into your "Profile" (for example, don't use your address
                      or passcode as your username, or include your name or address in your written
                      responses), because if you do then it may be posted publicly on the Service,
                      and the information will then be treated as "demographic
                      information" that is "public information." Please note that
                      nowhere on the Service do we knowingly collect personal information from
                      children under the age of 18, as we require that all users represent to us
                      that they are at least 18 years old.                      </p>

                    <p><b>Information Other Websites Collect From You</b></p>
                    <p>On the Service websites, we may place
                      links to other Websites operated by other parties. Some of these other
                      Websites contain our brand names and trademarks and other intellectual
                      property that we own; others do not. When you click on these links and visit
                      these other Websites, regardless of whether or not they contain our brand
                      names, trademarks and other intellectual property, you need to be aware that
                      we do not control these other Websites or these other Websites' business
                      practices, and that this privacy policy does not apply to these other
                      Websites. Consequently, the operators of these other Websites may collect
                      different kinds of information about you, and may use and disclose that
                      information in different ways than we would if it were collected on the Service.
                      We encourage you to review their privacy policies and remind you that we will
                      not be responsible for their actions.                      </p>
                   <p><b>How We Use Personal Information</b></p>
                    <p>BlackFling is committed to treating your
                      personal information with the highest degree of care. Your email address
                      and personal information is not shared with any third parties and is solely used

                      resold to any third party. We use your email address and your other
                      personal information to help us efficiently operate the Service, to contact
                      you in connection with your transactions and other activities on the Service
                      (including, but not limited to, confirmation emails or important news that
                      could affect your relationship with Blackfling), and to forward messages to
                      you from other Blackfling users. These types of communications are known as
                      "Operational Communications." In some cases, Operational
                      Communications may also contain commercial messages, such as banner ads and
                      special offers.</p>
                    <p>We also use personal information to send
                    you newsletters, information, offers and other promotional materials for
                    Blackfling's or third parties' goods or services. We attempt to send you
                    offers that are of value to you, such as discounts, exclusive offers or
                    special event information. The Service provides you with options to decline
                    to receive communications from Blackfling (other than those contained in
                    Operational Communications). Some of these options may only be for a certain
                    category of communications; others may be more general. By posting a profile
                    on the Service, you are opting in to receive messages from other Blackfling
                    members by email or text message. To stop receiving messages from other
                    Blackfling members, change your account settings on Blackfling.</p>
                  <p>To operate the Service, including
                    processing your transactions and supporting your activities on the Service,
                    we may share your personal information with our agents, representatives,
                    contractors and service providers so they can provide us with support
                    services such as authorization of credit card transactions, email
                    origination, receipt or support services, customer relationship management
                    services, order fulfillment and sweepstakes and promotional fulfillment. We
                    require these entities not to use your information for any other purpose.</p>
                  <p>By purchasing, or registering or making
                    reservations for, products or services offered or sponsored by third parties
                    on the Service, or electing to receive communications (such as emails or
                    magazine subscriptions) or electing to participate in contests, sweepstakes
                    or other programs (such as discount or rewards programs), offered or
                    sponsored by third parties on the Service, you consent to our providing your
                    personal information to those third parties. Those third parties may use your
                    personal information in accordance with their own privacy policies. You will
                    need to contact those third parties to instruct them directly regarding your
                    preferences for the use of your personal information by them. Additionally,
                    you agree that we may use and disclose all such information so submitted to
                    such third parties in the same manner in which we are entitled to use and
                    disclose any other information you submit to us.</p>
                  <p>In some cases, we may enter into a
                    promotional relationship with another company in which we prominently display
                    their brand name or trademarks on pages of the Service. These pages are known
                    as "Co-Branded Pages" and these companies are known as "Co-Branded
                    Companies." If the page on which you submit information is a Co-Branded Page,
                    or was accessed by clicking on a link on a Co-Branded Page, then we may share
                    your personal information with the associated Co-Branded Company. Co-Branded
                    Companies may use your personal information in accordance with their own
                    privacy policies. You will need to contact Co-Branded Companies to instruct
                    them directly regarding your preferences for the use of your personal
                    information by them. Additionally, you agree that we may use and disclose all
                    such information so submitted to such Co-Branded Companies in the same manner
                    in which we are entitled to use and disclose any other information you submit
                    to us. Some Co-Branded Pages may contain an action tag (also known as a Web
                    Beacon or a 1 pixel .gif file) that a third party, may use to read cookies
                    that it, or its clients, may have placed on your browser at other
                    (non-Blackfling) web sites before your visit to Blackfling. This technology
                    is used to measure the effectiveness of advertisements on such other Websites
                    that promote Co-Branded Pages. Further, such other third parties may use the
                    information collected through this technology to learn more about your visits
                    to this Service and other Websites in order to provide advertisements about
                    goods and services of interest to you.</p>
                  <p>Any third party with whom we are allowed
                    to share your personal information is authorized to use your personal
                    information in accordance with our contractual arrangements with such third
                    parties and in accordance with their own privacy policies, over which we have
                    no control, and you agree that we are not responsible or liable for any of
                    their actions or omissions. Those who contact you will need to be instructed
                    directly by you regarding your preferences for the use of your personal
                    information by them.</p>
                  <p>Please read the information below under
                    the heading "Special Cases in which we Share Personal and Financial
                    Information" to learn more ways in which we may share your personal
                    information.</p>
	
                     <p><b>How We Use Public Information and Other Demographic Information</b></p>
                    <p>We may review all demographic information.
                      We may use public information to enable other users to find your profile, to
                      determine whether they are a match for you and to communicate with you. We
                      may use demographic information to tailor the Service and communications to
                      your interests. We may also share demographic information with advertisers on
                      an anonymous and aggregated basis (i.e., without telling the advertisers your
                      identity). One of the reasons we may do this is to increase the likelihood
                      that our advertisers' goods and services will appeal to Blackfling's users,
                      so that we may target specific ads at specific demographic groups. Our
                      sharing of demographic information with advertisers is anonymous (i.e., we do
                      not tell advertisers which particular Blackfling users are members of which
                      demographic groups), subject to the rest of this privacy policy. When you
                      respond to an advertisement, however, we ask you to remember that if that ad
                      that is targeted to a demographic group and you decide to give the advertiser
                      your personal information, then the advertiser may be able to identify you as
                      being a member of that demographic group. Please also be aware that when we
                      disclose your financial information or personal information to a Co-Branded
                      Company, as described above, we may also disclose to that Co-Branded Company
                      your demographic information, other than the content of one-on-one
                      communications between you and other members. Please also be aware that we
                      may disclose your demographic information on a non-anonymous basis as
                      described above in the paragraph titled "Special Cases in which we Share
                      Personal and Financial Information." Also, to read further details about
                      how we may use your public information, see our Terms
                        of Use.</p>
                    <p><b>Changing our Privacy Policy for Previously Gathered Information</b></p>
                    <p>If at any point we decide to use
                      particular personally identifiable information in a manner different from
                      that stated at the time it was collected, we will notify users by way of an
                      email or by providing 30 days notice on the Service. Please note that we will
                      continue to have the right to change our privacy policy and practices, and
                      how we use your personally identifiable information, without notice, as
                      described in the first paragraph of this Privacy Policy, provided that such
                      changes shall only apply to information gathered on or after the date of the
                      change.</p>
                    <p><b>How You Can Access and Update Your Email Preferences, Personal Information and Public Information</b></p>
                    <p>We give you the opportunity to opt-out of
                      certain communications and modify personal information or demographic
                      information you have provided to us, and to hide demographic information
                      from, or make demographic information visible to, the public users of the
                      Service, at anytime by going to the "Account Settings" in your Blackfling
                      profile of the Service. Please be aware that it may take several hours for
                      the changes you make to take effect on the public areas of the Service. We
                      thank you for your patience. Please note that changing or deleting your
                      information in the "Account Settings" section of the Service, or otherwise
                      opting-out of receipt of email communications from Blackfling, will only
                      change or delete the data in our database for purposes of future activities
                      on the Service and for managing future communications from Blackfling. These
                      changes and deletions will not change or delete emails or information that we
                      may have already forwarded to other users or credit card companies or any
                      other third parties, all as provided above in this privacy policy.</p>
                  <p>If you have any questions or concerns

                    with the Service, you can contact us at <a href="mailto:support@blackfling.com">support@blackfling.com</a> or by calling +1-305-712-6694.
