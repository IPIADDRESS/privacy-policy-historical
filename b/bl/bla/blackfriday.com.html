            <h2>Last updated October 29, 2010</h2>

<p>This Privacy Policy discloses the privacy practices of BlackFriday.com and its subsidiaries and affiliated companies ("BlackFriday.com"). BlackFriday.com, a Canadian corporation, is the provider of the BlackFriday.com websites, including www.blackfriday.com  (This Website and other websites where this privacy policy is displayed, collectively, the "Website"). Please read the following to learn what information we collect from customers and consumer visitors to our Website (the “User”) and how we use and share that information. In this Privacy Policy, personal information means information that is  about an identifiable person.  If you have any questions about our Privacy Policy, please email us at contact@goodnews.com.</p>

<h3>1. Changes to Privacy Policy</h3>

<p>We may change this Privacy Policy at any time.  If we make changes to this Privacy Policy, we will change the "Last Updated" date above. The revised Privacy Policy is effective immediately when posted on the Website. It is the responsibility of each User to review the Website and the Privacy Policy periodically to learn of any revisions to this Privacy Policy.</p>

<h3>2. Types of Information Collected and Uses of Collected Information</h3>

<p>We collect information about you in various ways when you use our Website.  We collect personal information you provide to us, such as when you create an account, order a product or service from us or from our partners through us, submit content and/or post content in discussion forums, enter a contest or sweepstakes sponsored by us or by our partners through us, fill out a survey, post a review, send us or our partners' feedback through us, request information about our services, post a video or sign up for special offers through us  from third parties through the Website . If you decide to engage in these activities with us, we may ask you to provide us with certain personal information about yourself, such as your first and last name, mailing address (including zip code), email address, telephone number and date of birth. When you order products or services, we may also ask you to provide us with your credit card number, expiration date and authentication codes or related information. We may also obtain information from other sources and combine that with information we collect on our Website. Please understand that if you publicly post personal information about yourself (e.g., by communicating with others, reviewing products or restaurants, or submitting media content), this information may be accessible by other consumers and companies and may appear on other websites or web searches, and, therefore, this information could be read, collected, and used by others. For example, if you post your email address along with a public restaurant review, you may receive unsolicited messages. We have no control over who reads your postings or what other Users may do with the information you voluntarily post, so please use caution when posting any personal information.</p>

<p>When you visit our Website, some information is also automatically collected, including the Uniform Resource Locator (“URL”) of the website you visited before coming to our Website, the URL of the website you visit after leaving our Website, the type of browser you are using and your Internet Protocol (“IP”) address. We, and/or our authorized Third Party Service Providers and advertisers, may automatically collect this information when you visit our Website through the use of electronic tools like Cookies and Web beacons or Pixel tags.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Cookies.</strong> To facilitate and customize your experience with the Website, we store cookies on your computer. A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a User’s computer for record-keeping purposes which contains information about that User. We use cookies to save you time while using the Website, remind us who you are, and track and target User interests in order to provide a customized experience. Cookies also allow us to collect non-personal information from you, like which pages you visited and what links you clicked on. Use of this information helps us to create a more user-friendly experience for all visitors. In addition, we may use Third Party Advertising Companies to display advertisements on our Website. As part of their service, they may place separate cookies on your computer. We have no access to or control over these cookies. This Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies by our Website only and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertiser. Most browsers automatically accept cookies, but you may be able to modify your browser settings to decline cookies. Please note that if you decline or delete these cookies, some parts of the Website may not work properly.</li>
<li><strong>Other Tracking Devices.</strong> We may use other industry standard technologies like pixel tags and Web beacons to track your use of our Website pages and promotions, or we may allow our Third Party Service Providers to use these devices on our behalf. Pixel tags and Web beacons are tiny graphic images placed on certain pages on our Website, or in our emails that allow us to determine whether you have performed a specific action. When you access these pages or open or click an email, pixel tags and web beacons generate a non-personally identifiable notice of that action. Pixel tags allow us to measure and improve our understanding of visitor traffic and behavior on our Website, as well as give us a way to measure our promotions and performance. We may also utilize pixel tags and web beacons provided by our affiliates and/or marketing partners for the same purposes.</li>
</ul>
