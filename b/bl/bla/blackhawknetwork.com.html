	<p>Please share this information with all individuals who provide personal information in connection with requests for information or services. This disclosure applies to individual owners, partners, shareholders and officers (collectively referred to as “principals”) of businesses.</p>
	<p>Blackhawk Network, Inc. (“Blackhawk”) knows that privacy is extremely important to our customers. Accordingly, we want you to understand what information we collect and how we use it.

		<li>Information about your transactions or experiences with companies affiliated with us or others.</li>
		<li>Information we receive from third parties.</li>
		<li>Your “personally identifiable information” includes information gathered in the context of providing the service. We receive this information from you when you request information or services, from any transactions, and that we otherwise obtain about you in connection with providing the service. “Personally identifiable information” does not include any publicly available information or any information that does not identify you.</li>
	</ul>
	<h3>What Information We Disclose</h3>

We may also share information about our experiences or transactions with you or your account with companies related to us by common control or ownership (“affiliates”). We may disclose all of the information we collect, as described above, to companies that perform marketing services on our behalf or to financial institutions with whom we have joint marketing agreements. We do not disclose any personally identifiable information about you to any other third parties, except as permitted by law.</p>
	<p>If you decide to close your account or become an inactive customer, we will continue to adhere to the privacy policies and practices described in this notice.</p>
	<h3>Important Notice About Credit Reporting</h3>
	<p>We may report information about the services you have with us, or, if applicable, account(s) you have with us to credit bureaus and/or consumer reporting agencies. Dishonored payments or other defaults on your account(s) may be reflected in your credit report and/or consumer report.</p>
	<h3>Our Security Procedures</h3>
	<p>We are committed to providing protection against unauthorized disclosure of the information you share with us.
