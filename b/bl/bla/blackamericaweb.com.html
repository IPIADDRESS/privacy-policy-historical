          Privacy Policy</font></b></font></p>
        <p><font face="Geneva,Arial,Sans-serif" size="2">BlackAmericaWeb.com is 
          dedicated to protecting users' privacy and protecting your personal 
          information from misuse. We strongly support a policy of openness about 
          personal data collection and use. We have created and implemented a 
          policy that protects the use of any personally identifiable information 
          (your name, e-mail address, snail mail address, telephone number). Like 
          many websites, we collect information from users to constantly improve 
          the site and provide more individualized content and advertising to 
          them, but we only do so based on the guidelines stated in this policy. 
          To make this privacy policy easy to find, we make it available on our 
          homepage and at every point where personally identifiable information 
          may be requested. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Geneva,Arial,Sans-serif" size="2">Please take note that 
          other web sites that may be accessed through our site may collect personally 
          identifiable information about you. This privacy statement does not 
          cover the information practices of those web sites linked to BlackAmericaWeb.com. 
          We encourage you to review the statements of those sites. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Geneva,Arial,Sans-serif" size="2"><b>What information does 
          BlackAmericaWeb.com collect?</b></font></p>
        <p><font face="Geneva,Arial,Sans-serif" size="2">BlackAmericaWeb.com's 
          registration, online surveys, and contest entry forms may call for users 
          to provide their contact information (like their name and e-mail address), 
          financial information (like their bank account or credit card numbers), 
          and demographic information (like their zip code, age, or income level). 
          </font></p>
        <p><font face="Geneva,Arial,Sans-serif" size="2">BlackAmericaWeb.com uses 
          the standard "cookie" feature of major browser applications that allows 
          us to store data about your visit. Cookies help us learn which areas 
          of our site are useful and which areas need improvement. We also may 
          use cookies to track visits on BlackAmericaWeb.com and the number of 
          entries in some of our promotions, sweepstakes, and contests. Advertising 
          networks that serve ads onto BlackAmericaWeb.com may also use their 
          own cookies. The cookie stores your user name and password, sparing 
          you from having to re-enter that information each time you visit and 
          granting you certain access privileges. You can set your browser to 
          accept cookies, but if you do you may be unable to access certain portions 
          of the site or may be asked to re-enter your user name and password. 
          We will not be able to customize the site's features. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Geneva,Arial,Sans-serif" size="2">BlackAmericaWeb.com may 
          also gather anonymous information, which may be used by us or shared 
          with third parties. This is information that does not personally identify 
          you, but which may be helpful. For example, we might tell our advertisers 
          how many users visited a particular advertisement, and for how long, 
          so they can measure whether the ad worked. This information is also 
          used to generate advertising rates. Generally, this information is collected 
          through "traffic data" and may entail the use of numeric codes used 
          to identify a computer.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Geneva,Arial,Sans-serif" size="2"><b>What does BlackAmericaWeb.com 
          do with collected information?</b> </font></p>
        <p><font face="Geneva,Arial,Sans-serif" size="2">BlackAmericaWeb.com's 
          primary goal in collecting personal information is to provide you, the 
          user, with a customized experience on our site. This includes personalization 
          services, interactive communications, online shopping, and many other 
          types of services, most of which are completely free to you. In order 
          to provide services free of charge, we display advertisements. By knowing 
          a little about you, BlackAmericaWeb.com is able to deliver more relevant 
          advertisements and content to you. This, in turn, helps us create a 
          better website. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Geneva,Arial,Sans-serif" size="2">By delivering targeted 
          advertisements, BlackAmericaWeb.com allows advertisers to reach a targeted 
          audience. From time to time, advertisers on BlackAmericaWeb.com will 
          seek to reach specific segments of our audience (e.g. females 35 and 
          older). We will take the advertisement and display it to users meeting 
          those criteria. This kind of advertisement targeting is done with banner 
          ads as well as promotional email. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Geneva,Arial,Sans-serif" size="2">We use customer contact 
          information from our online registration, survey, and contest and order 
          forms for our own internal evaluation and tracking purposes, and to 
          send you information from our company. From time to time, our business 
          partners or other companies may send you promotional material. If you 
          supply contact information, it may also be used to contact you about 
          products and services in which you have indicated an interest, and may 
          be shared with our advertisers, business partners, or other companies 
          who may want to contact you. (Users may opt out of receiving future 
          mailings -- see the choice/opt-out section below.) </font></p>
        <p><font face="Geneva,Arial,Sans-serif" size="2">We may use cookies to 
          deliver to you content specific to your interests, to save your password 
          so you don't have to re-enter it each time you visit our site, and for 
          other purposes. Advertisements displayed on our site may contain cookies. 
          We do not have access to or control over information collected by advertisers 
          on our site. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Geneva,Arial,Sans-serif" size="2">BlackAmericaWeb.com may 
          use your IP address (the number assigned to your computer while it is 
          on the Internet) to help diagnose problems with our server, and to administer 
          our site. At a point in time, when BlackAmericaWeb.com offers shopping, 
          your IP address may be used to help identify your computer and your 
          online "shopping cart" (if any) and to gather broad demographic information. 
          In addition, your IP address is transmitted with each message sent from 
          your account. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Geneva,Arial,Sans-serif" size="2">Demographic and profile 
          data from online forms or cookies may be used to tailor your experience 
          at our site, showing you content that we think you might be interested 
          in, and displaying the content preferences you have previously shared 
          with us. This information may be shared with our advertisers, business 
          partners, or other companies only on an aggregate basis, unless you 
          specifically agree that personally identifiable information about you 
          may be disclosed. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Geneva,Arial,Sans-serif" size="2">If you submit financial 
          information it may be used to verify the accuracy of your contact information 
          and to authorize BlackAmericaWeb.com to bill you for products and services 
          you have agreed to purchase. You may choose to submit unique identifiers 
          (such as social security numbers) in order to allow us to verify your 
          identity and for use as account numbers in our record system. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Geneva,Arial,Sans-serif" size="2">BlackAmericaWeb.com may 
          disclose personal information if required to do so by law or in the 
          good-faith belief that such action is necessary to (a) conform to the 
          edicts of the law or comply with legal process served on BlackAmericaWeb.com 
          or its parent company, subsidiaries or affiliates; (b) protect and defend 
          the rights or property of BlackAmericaWeb.com or the users of BlackAmericaWeb.com, 
          and (c) act under exigent circumstances to protect the personal safety 
          of users of BlackAmericaWeb.com or the public. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Geneva,Arial,Sans-serif" size="2"><b>Security</b></font></p>
        <p><font face="Geneva,Arial,Sans-serif" size="2">BlackAmericaWeb.com has 
          security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse and alteration 
          of any information we have collected from you. Any time we ask for a 
          credit card number we transmit that credit card number in an encrypted 
          format. We use industry-standard, SSL (secure socket layer) encryption. 
          As you may realize, unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet 
          can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to 
          protect your personal information, BlackAmericaWeb.com cannot ensure 
          or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us or from 
          our online products or services, and you do so at your own risk. Once 
          we receive your transmission, we make our best effort to ensure its 
          security on our systems. To further protect your privacy and security, 
          we will also take reasonable steps to verify your identity before granting 
          access or making corrections. <br>
