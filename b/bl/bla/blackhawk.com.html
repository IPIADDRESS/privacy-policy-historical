        <p><strong><u>Our Commitment To Privacy</u></strong> <br>
          BLACKHAWK! respects your privacy and has created this policy to let you know we take your privacy seriously. &nbsp;We are particularly sensitive to privacy issues on the Internet.&nbsp; To better protect your privacy we provide this notice explaining our online information practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used. To make this notice easy to find, we make it available on our homepage and at every point where personally identifiable information may be requested. </p>
        <p><br>
              <a name="2" id="2"></a><strong><u>The Information We Collect: </u></strong><br>
          In general, you can browse BLACKHAWK!â€™s website without revealing who you are or any personal information.&nbsp; We are, however, able to determine your IP address.&nbsp; We use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server, to administer our Web site, to measure the use of our Web site and to improve the content of our Web site. In short we use your IP to gather aggregate demographic information. There are a few places where we give you an opportunity to provide us your personal information.&nbsp; On those pages, you can order BLACKHAWK! products, make requests, and register to receive materials. The types of personal information collected at these pages are: Name, Address, Email address, Phone number, and Credit/Debit Card Information (etc.).&nbsp; <br>
          On some pages, you can submit information about other people. For example, if you order a BLACKHAWK! gift online and want it sent directly to the recipient, you will need to submit the recipient's address. In this circumstance, the types of personal information collected are: Name, Address, and Phone Number (etc.) <br>
          Depending upon the activity, some of the information we ask you to provide is identified as mandatory and some as voluntary. If you do not provide the mandatory data with respect to a particular activity, you will not be able to engage in that activity.</p>
        <p><br>
              <a name="3" id="3"></a><strong><u>The Way We Use Information: </u></strong><br>
              We may use your personal information for particular purposes such as processing your order or for marketing research and other marketing purposes and for providing you with the latest BLACKHAWK! product and promotional information and other information that might be useful to you.&nbsp; We may share this information with BLACKHAWK! dealers or other business partners to support your customer relationship with the BLACKHAWK! 
              We use the information you provide about yourself when placing an order to complete that order. We use the information you provide about someone else when placing an order to ship the product and to confirm delivery. We do not share this information with outside parties except to the extent necessary to complete that order. 
          We offer BLACKHAWK! gift-cards by which you can personalize a product you order for another person. Information you provide to us to create a BLACKHAWK! gift-card is only used for that purpose, and it is only disclosed to the person receiving the gift. 
          We use return email addresses to answer the email we receive. Such addresses are not used for any other purpose and are not shared with outside parties. 
          You can register with our website if you would like to receive our catalog as well as updates on our new products and services. Information you submit on our website will not be used for this purpose unless you fill out the registration form. 
          We may use the information to monitor guest traffic patterns and site usages to help us develop and design the layouts of our websites.&nbsp; <br>
          We disclose personal information we believe release is necessary to comply with the law, enforce or apply our Terms and Conditions or protect the rights, property, or safety of BLACKHAWK!, our users, or others. 
          BLACKHAWK! website contains links to other non-BLACKHAWK! websites.&nbsp; BLACKHAWK! is not responsible for the privacy practices of the consent of such websites and you should exercise your best judgment when sharing personal information on these websites.&nbsp; 
          Finally, we never use or share the personally identifiable information provided to us online in ways unrelated to the ones described above without also providing you an opportunity to opt-out or otherwise prohibit such unrelated uses. </p>

They receive the information needed to verify and authorize your credit card or other payment information and to process and ship your order.
          Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet or any wireless network can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your personal information, you acknowledge that: (a) there are security and privacy limitations of the Internet which are beyond our control; (b) the security, integrity and privacy of any and all information and data exchanged between you and us through our web site cannot be guaranteed; and (c) any such information and data may be viewed or tampered with in transit by a third party.</p>
