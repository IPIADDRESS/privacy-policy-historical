      for users between the ages of 7 and 12. Sites listed on Blackworld Kids 
      have all been prudently selected . This selection process ensures that these 
      sites are fun and age-appropriate for our younger audience. Blackworld™ 
      does not collect personally identifiable information from children. Blackworld™ 
      is a general audience web site. Should any child under age 13 attempt to 
      register with Blackworld™, we shall at this present time decline such an 
      application until Blackworld™ fully establishes appropriate account facillities 
      under strict parental support, guidance and approval. Children should always 
      ask a parent for permission before sending personal information to anyone 
      online. Blackworld™ does not share personal information about users under 
      the age of 13 with third parties and we do not sell or rent personal information 
      about any of our users, regardless of age. In addition, Blackworld™ will
