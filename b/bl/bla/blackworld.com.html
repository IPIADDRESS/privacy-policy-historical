    <h4> Special Relationships </h4>
    <h4>As a general rule, Blackworld™ will not disclose any of your personally 
      identifiable information except when we have your permission or under special 
      circumstances, such as when we believe in good faith that the law requires 
      it or under the circumstances described below. Please refer to the Terms 
      of Service or Use Agreements for each of our products and services for more 
      detailed information about how your personal information may be shared. 
      The following describes some of the ways that your information may be disclosed. 
      <br>
      <br>
      <u>Business Partners &amp; Sponsors: </u><br>
      Blackworld™ may disclose your personal information to business partners 
      or sponsors, but this is specifically described to you prior to data collection 
      or prior to transferring the data. Details of shared use can be found in 
      specific Terms of Service or Use Agreements, and sweepstakes and promotions 
      rules. Some or all data collected during a Blackworld™ promotion may be 
      shared with a sponsor. If personally identifying data about you will be 
      shared, we will tell you before we collect or transfer the data. Many promotions 
      offer opportunities to request additional information from sponsors. By 
      requesting more information, you give Blackworld™ permission to transfer 
      your personal information to the sponsor so they can fulfill your request. 
      In many instances, only your email address will be shared. If more information 
      will be shared with the sponsor, you will be notified prior to the transfer.

    <p><b>Children's Guidelines </b></p>
    <p>Naturally, the safety of children is very important to us. Blackworld™ 
      recommends that parents and kids try our Kids Section, designed especially 
      for users between the ages of 7 and 12. Sites listed on Blackworld Kids 
      have all been prudently selected . This selection process ensures that these 
      sites are fun and age-appropriate for our younger audience. Blackworld™ 
      does not collect personally identifiable information from children. Blackworld™ 
      is a general audience web site. Should any child under age 13 attempt to 
      register with Blackworld™, we shall at this present time decline such an 
      application until Blackworld™ fully establishes appropriate account facillities 
      under strict parental support, guidance and approval. Children should always 
      ask a parent for permission before sending personal information to anyone 
      online. Blackworld™ does not share personal information about users under 
      the age of 13 with third parties and we do not sell or rent personal information 
      about any of our users, regardless of age. In addition, Blackworld™ will 
      not send any direct email offers to users who indicate they are under the 
      age of 13. </p>
