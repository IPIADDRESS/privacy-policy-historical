Introduction
    </h2>
    <p><strong>We care about privacy.</strong> We believe that privacy is a fundamental right for all individuals. Our clients entrust us with the personal information of their employees and their users, who are often students. We take the obligations that are attached to this information very seriously. We therefore have a dedicated data privacy program with privacy by design at heart. You can learn more about our data privacy program by visiting our <a title="Click to reach our Privacy Center." target="_self" href="/legal/privacy-center.html"><strong>Privacy Center</strong></a>.</p><p>Our business model is different from that of companies that collect your personal information to monetize such data. We collect and use personal information to allow us to provide our products and services to our clients and end users. In most cases, we do this at the direction of our clients. We do not and will not sell or rent your data to third parties unless this is required in the context of changes to our business structure such as a merger or acquisition. See <a href="#section-12" title="Click to Section 4 to read more about personal information disclosure." target="_self"><strong>Vendors, Partners &amp; Other Types of Disclosures</strong></a> for more details on how we may disclose personal information in the context of changes to our business structure.</p><p>We are EU-U.S. Privacy Shield certified, a proud signatory of the Privacy Pledge, and a member of the Future of Privacy Forum.</p>

You generally can visit our websites without having to log in or otherwise identify yourself. On some of our websites, you may need to log in to benefit from the service or to make use of all the functionalities and be able to communicate with us or other Blackboard users, such as with Blackboard Community and Behind the Blackboard.</p><br><p><strong>Information We Collect</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Directly from you.</strong> Some of our websites require you to sign up for an account. When you do, we ask you for information, such as your name and email address, that we need to set up your account. Often you can also voluntarily provide additional information, such as a photo or biographical information, to make better use of our websites. We also collect information you provide by completing forms or surveys on our websites. If you provide additional content through user forums, for example, when you communicate with others on Blackboard Community, we may link this information with your personal information if you are logged in.</li><li><strong>Indirectly from you.</strong> We collect information about the pages you visit and how you access and use our websites using cookies and third-party analytics tools. This information includes information about the device(s) you use to access the websites including unique device identifiers, IP address, operating system, browser, and cookies. Depending on your device settings, we may also collect information about your geographical location. Learn more about our use of cookies in our <a href="/legal/cookie-statement.html" title="Blackboard Cookie Statement" target="_self"><strong>Cookie Statement</strong></a>.</li><li><strong>Information from third parties.</strong> We receive information from affiliates in our Blackboard group of companies, our partners, and other third parties that we use to enhance the website experience and promote our products and services.

This analysis is necessary to further our legitimate interest in understanding our users and how they interact with us and our websites, improving our websites and communication with you (including for marketing purposes).</p><p><strong>Personalization.</strong> For some of our websites we also use your information to personalize the pages, which is necessary to provide more contextually relevant information as you browse our websites. For example, if you have indicated your primary industry or your job title, we may present content related to your role or industry as your browse our websites and return to them.</p><p><strong>Communication.</strong> If you use Behind the Blackboard, Blackboard Community, or other websites with logins, we use the contact details you provided to communicate with you and to let you communicate with us and other Blackboard users. Typically, we use information in this way because it is required to provide this service to you and because it is in our legitimate interests to ensure our services are being offered in a manner that meets our high standards.</p><p>We keep website usage information for as long as it is necessary for the purposes described above. This period of time will vary depending on the services and websites you use and how you interact with us. Account information is kept until you delete the account and for a limited period afterwards. Where you provide information in forms, the information is kept only as long as required. For example, we may need to keep a record of the correspondence with you if you have made a complaint for as long as it is necessary to protect us from any legal claim. Similarly, if you unsubscribe from receiving marketing communications from us, will keep a record of this to ensure you do not receive such communications in the future.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Who We Share This Information With</strong></p><p><strong>Third-party tools.</strong> Where we use third-party tools (for example to understand how our websites are used and make sure you see relevant ads and campaigns on other websites), these third parties will have access to some of your personal information.

                        <p><strong>Your institution decides how your personal information is used.</strong> We provide most of our products and services to end-users of an institution as a so-called ‘data processor’ on behalf of our clients (for example, school, districts, universities, and corporations). This means that the main responsibility for data privacy compliance lies with your institution as the ‘data controller.’ It also means that <em><strong>your institution’s privacy statement governs</strong></em> the use of your personal information (instead of ours). Your institution determines what information we collect through our products and services and how it is used, and we process your information according to your institution’s instructions and the terms of our contracts with your institution.</p><p><strong>Read your institution’s privacy statement.</strong> The following section is mainly for informational purposes and describes how your information is generally used when we provide products and services to you on behalf of a client. How your information is used depends on your institution, so you should read your institution’s privacy statement.</p><p>For our Web Community Manager product, please read the separate <a href="/legal/web-community-manager-privacy-policy.html" title="Web Community Manager Privacy Policy" target="_self"><strong>Web Community Manager Privacy Policy</strong></a>.</p><br><p><strong>Information We Collect</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Information your institution provides to us.</strong> Typically, our products and services integrate with your institution’s systems.

We generally don’t store this information but may have access to your institution’s systems that store such data.</li></ul></li><li style="list-style: none"><br></li><li><strong>Directly from you.</strong> Depending on the products and services you use, we will collect the following data categories directly from you:

    <p></p><p>This section provides more information on how we protect your information when we engage vendors, how we share information with our partners, and in which other scenarios we may share your information with third parties.</p><p><strong>Vendors</strong><br>
We use vendors to help us provide our products and services to our clients and you or to perform work on our behalf. Where this requires access to personal information, we are responsible for the data privacy practices of the vendors. Our vendors must abide by our strict data privacy and security requirements and instructions. They are not allowed to use personal information they access or receive from us for any other purposes than as needed to carry out their work for us.</p><p><strong>Partners</strong><br>
In some countries and regions, our products and services are offered through channel (or reselling) partners (<a title="Review our list of Channel Partners." target="_self" href="/about-us/locations/find-a-channel-partner.html"><strong>see the list of our channel partners</strong></a>).We will share information with them that is necessary for them to offer and provide our products and services to our current and prospective clients.</p><p>Some of our products allow you to access functionalities or content provided by our content and technology partners. For example, Blackboard Learn’s integration with Dropbox Education allows institutions and users to store and share content using Dropbox functionalities. With your or your institution’s permission, we will share information about you, such as your name, email, or student ID, that is required for you to access these partner functionalities or content from our products and services.</p><p><strong>Other types of disclosures</strong><br>
We will also share your information where required in the following circumstances.</p><ul><li><strong>Payments.</strong> Where you use our products and services to make a purchase or transaction, we will share your payment and transaction data with banks and other organizations to process the transactions and for fraud detection and prevention or anti-money laundering purposes.</li><li><strong>Changes to our business structure.</strong> Where permitted by applicable law and by the contracts with our clients, we may disclose your information in the following cases:&nbsp;
<br><ul><li>Corporate transactions such as a merger, acquisition, sale of assets, and financing&nbsp;</li><li>Bankruptcy, dissolution or reorganization, or in similar transactions or proceedings&nbsp;</li><li>Steps related to the previous bullet points (for example, due diligence)</li></ul></li><li><strong>Comply with law.</strong> We may need to disclose your information to comply with legal or regulatory requirements and to respond to lawful requests, court orders, and legal processes. We will always aim to limit the information we provide as much as possible.
