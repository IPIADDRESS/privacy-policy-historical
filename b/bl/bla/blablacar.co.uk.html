<h2>7. Is your Information being transferred? how and where?</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We store the Personal Data that we hold about you in the European Union (“<strong>EU</strong>“). Given the fact that we are an international company, we also transfer your Personal Data to non-European countries where data protection laws may be less protective than the legislation where you live.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This happens when one of our data processors is located in a country not providing an ‘adequate’ level of data protection, such as the United States. Such a data processor may be engaged in, among other things, the fulfillment of your service request, the moderation of your user account pictures, the processing of your payment details, the provision of advertising and marketing services on our behalf and the provision of support services through electronic communications.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This also covers transfers to BlaBlaCar’s affiliated companies located outside the EU to whom we may transfer some of your information for the provision of our services in these countries.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When such a transfer happens, we ensure that it takes place in accordance with this Privacy Notice and is regulated by standard contractual clauses approved by the European Commission as ensuring an adequate protection for data subjects.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Should you want to obtain further details about the safeguards put in place, you can contact us via the contact section available at the end of the Privacy Notice.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"></p><h2>8. What are your rights in respect of your personal data?</h2><p></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>8.1.</strong> Where permitted by law, you may have the right to obtain a copy of Personal Data that we hold about you. Before responding to your request, we may ask you to (i) verify your identity and (ii) provide further details so we can better respond to your request. We will endeavour to respond within an appropriate timeframe and, in any event, within any timeframe required by law. If you want to exercise this right, please contact us using the contact details provided below (see section 13).</p>
<p><strong>8.2.</strong> As a member of our Platforms, you can access the Personal Data we hold about you via your account to correct, amend, or delete information that is inaccurate. You may also update or delete your Personal Data by contacting us, using the contact details provided below (see section 13). You can also close your account online at any time and have the right to object to the processing of your Personal Data.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Please note that in some cases we may retain certain information about you as required by law, or for legitimate purposes. For instance, if we believe you have committed fraud or violated our Terms and Conditions, we may want to keep some of your information to avoid that you circumvent the rules applicable to our Platforms.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>&nbsp;</em>You also have the right to make a complaint to the relevant data protection supervisory authority or to seek a remedy through the courts if you believe that your rights have been breached.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"></p><h2>9. Cookies &amp; similar technologies</h2><p></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Our Platforms may, from time to time, contain links to and from the websites of our partner networks, advertisers and affiliates. If you follow a link to any of these websites, please note that these websites have their own privacy practices and that we do not accept any responsibility or liability for these policies. Please check these policies before you submit any Personal Data to these websites.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"></p><h2>12. Changes to our Privacy Notice</h2><p></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Any changes we may make to our Privacy Notice in the future will be posted on this page. Where appropriate, we will notify you or seek your consent. Please check back frequently to see any updates or changes to our Privacy Notice.</p>
