<p><strong>1.3</strong>&nbsp;– Comuto SA is registered under the Data Protection Act 1998 (the “Act”). The Act sets out a number of important principles that organisations must apply when processing personal data. For more information see&nbsp;<a href="http://ico.org.uk/">http://ico.org.uk/</a>.</p>
<p><strong>2. Ways that we collect information</strong></p>
<p><strong>2.1</strong>&nbsp;– We may collect and process the following personal information or data (information that can be uniquely identified with you) about you:</p>

<p><strong>2.4</strong>&nbsp;– An IP address is a number assigned to your computer by your Internet Service Provider (ISP), so you can access the Internet.
