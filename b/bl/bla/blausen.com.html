<li>“Cookies” are small data files that a website places on your browser when you visit the website. Cookies allow a website or third party to recognize your browser. There are three primary types of cookies:</li>
<li><em>Session cookies</em> are specific to a particular visit and carry information as you view different pages within a website. Session cookies expire and delete themselves automatically in a short period of time, e.g., when you leave the website or when you close your browser.</li>
<li><em>Persistent cookies</em> enable us to recognize you when you visit our website and remember your preferences. Persistent cookies are stored on your browser or mobile device until you choose to delete them, and otherwise typically delete themselves at expiration.</li>
<li><em>Third-party cookies</em> are placed by someone other than us, and may gather browsing activity across multiple websites and sessions. They are usually persistent cookies and are stored until you delete them or they expire based on the time period set in each third-party cookie.</li>
<li>“Web beacons” are small graphic files (sometimes called “clear GIFs” or “web pixels”) that are embedded in images on pages of a website or in an email and are typically used to track a user’s activity on the page or whether an email was opened. The beacon sends back to the home server (which can belong to the host site, a network advertiser or some other third party) information from your browser, such as the IP address, the URL of the page on which the beacon is located and the content viewed, the type of browser that is accessing the site and the ID number of any cookies on your computer previously placed by that server.</li>
