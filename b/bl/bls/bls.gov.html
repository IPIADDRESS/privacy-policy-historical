    <hr>
    <p>Thank you for visiting the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) Website and reviewing our privacy
    and security statement. The Bureau is strongly committed to maintaining the privacy of your
    personal information and the security of our computer systems. With respect to the
    collection, use and disclosure of personal information, BLS makes every effort to ensure
    compliance with applicable Federal law, including, but not limited to, the Privacy Act of
    1974, the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, and the Freedom of Information Act.</p>
    <p>As a general rule, the Bureau of Labor Statistics does not collect personally-identifying
    information about you when you visit our site, unless you choose to provide such
    information to us. The information we receive depends upon what you do when visiting our
    site.</p>
    <i></i><p><i>If you visit our site to read or download information, we collect and store the
    following information:</i></p><ul>
      <li>The name of the domain from which you access the Internet (for example, bls.gov, if you
        are connecting from the Bureau of Labor Statistics computer account).</li>
      <li>The date and time you access our site.</li>
      <li>The Internet address of the website from which you linked directly to our site.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The above information is used by software programs on our website to create summary
    statistics which allow us to assess the number of visitors to the different sections of
    our site, identify what information is of most and least interest, determine technical
    design specifications, monitor system performance, and help us make our site more useful
    to visitors.</p>
    <i></i><p><i>If you identify yourself by sending an E-mail containing personal information:</i></p>
    <p>You also may decide to send us personally-identifying information, for example your
    mailing address, in an electronic mail message requesting that information be mailed to
    you. Information collected in this manner is used solely for responding to requests for
    information or records. We may forward your E-mail to other Government employees who are
    better able to respond to you. Should you wish to file a request under FOIA, instructions
    are provided at: <a href="http://www.bls.gov/blsfoia.htm#request">http://www.bls.gov/blsfoia.htm#request</a></p>
    <i></i><p><i>If you link to other sites outside BLS:</i></p>
    <p>Our Website has many links to other sites. When you link to any of these sites, you are
    no longer on our site and are subject to the privacy policy of the new site.</p>
    <i></i><p><i>Cookie Use Notice</i></p>
    <p>On a limited number of its web pages, the Bureau of Labor Statistics employs
    "cookies" to provide better service to its customers. We do not use cookies to
    collect any personally identifying information from users or to track user activities
    beyond our web site. We do not maintain copies of cookies on our web site after you leave
    our web site.</p>
    <p>Cookies are small pieces of temporary data that are exchanged between a web site and a
    user's computer which enable a "session", or "dialog", to be
    established between the two machines. With the session established, BLS is able to tailor
    its responses (i.e., identify and provide you with the information you want) and help you
    traverse our web pages in the most efficient and effective manner possible.</p>
    <p>The Bureau of Labor Statistics limits its use of cookies to "session
    cookies"...types of cookies that are temporarily stored in your computer's memory.
    Session cookies are normally deleted from a user's computer when the user logs off the
    computer or the user exits the browser. As of October 2000, the Bureau of Labor Statistics
    does not issue "persistent cookies"...types of cookies that could be stored
    permanently on your workstation and reused each time you visit the Department's web site.
    Before October 2000 however, BLS had a small number of web sites that automatically
    created persistent cookies. Those cookies may still be stored on some user's computers
    and, in some cases, may be updated by the user's browser when revisiting the BLS web site.
    In the event a cookie is found on your workstation which was issued from a BLS web site,
    you may remove it without adversely affecting your future visits to our web site. At no
    time did BLS track users or store any personal information.</p>
    <hr>
    <p>For security purposes and to ensure that this service remains available to all users,
    our website also employs software programs to monitor network traffic to identify
    unauthorized attempts to upload or change information, or otherwise cause damage.</p>
    <p>Unauthorized attempts to upload information or change information on this service are
    strictly prohibited and my be punishable under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1986
    and the National Information Infrastructure Protection Act of 1996.</p>
